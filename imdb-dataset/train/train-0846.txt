<START> i can't believe how awful this movie turned out to be i feel magnanimous even referring to it as a movie the acting was flat the editing was terrible and the plot leaves many major questions unanswered the premise was ok if unoriginal a small group of aliens is living in the us and trying to slowly take over humanity but it goes rapidly downhill from there how could they convince a human to accept an alien as his wife in order to make they alien human hybrid they require they show a larval alien but never show what it does they have a plastic surgeon that can produce perfect looking skin on an industrial scale they throw in the obligatory huge alien monster with teeth the ending was almost too painful to watch i suppose that i'm mostly disappointed that bruce boxlietner would have anything to do with this how could he say to the huge alien monster with teeth get away from him you son of a b tch with a straight face it's a long fall from his babylon 5 days avoid this at all costs
<START> lol not a bad way to start it i thought this was original but then i discovered it was a clone of the 1976 remake of king kong i never saw king kong until i was 15 i saw this film when i was 9 the film's funky disco music will get stuck in your head not to mention the film's theme song by the yetians this is the worst creature effects i've ever seen at the same time this film remains a holy grail of b movies memorable quotes take a tranquilizer and go to bed put the yeti in your tank and you have yeti power i remember seeing this film on movie macrabe hosted by elvira there is one scene where it was like king kong in reverse in king kong he grabs the girl and climbs up the building but in this film he climbs down the building and grabs the girl who was falling also around that year was another kong clone mighty peking man 1977 which came from hong kong there is a lot of traveling matte scenes and motorized body parts this film will leave you laughing it is like i said just another king kong clone rated pg for violence language thematic elements and some scary scenes
<START> this movie is one of the most wildly distorted portrayals of history horribly inaccurate this movie does nothing to honor the hundreds of thousands of dutch british chinese american and indigenous enslaved laborers that the sadistic japanese killed and tortured to death the bridge was to be built over the bodies of the white man as stated by the head japanese engineer it is disgusting that such unspeakable horrors committed by the japanese captors is the source of a movie where the bridge itself isn't even close to accurate to the actual bridge the actual bridge was built of steel and concrete not wood what of the survivors who are still alive today they hate the movie and all that it is supposed to represent their friends were starved tortured and murdered by cruel sadists those that didn't die of dysantry starvation or disease are deeply hurt by the movie that makes such light of their dark times
<START> you know this movie isn't that great but i mean c'mon it's about angels helping a baseball team i find the plot line to be hilarious anyways this kid's dad says he'll take him back if the angels win the pennant because he knows they won't kid prays to his fake god to help the angels win god helps the whole time via the angel christopher lloyd rip and in the end his dad doesn't take him back and rides off on his motorcycle right in that kids face it's hilarious until danny glover adopts it and it's friend br br i guess the upside is that the old lady is left alone to die with her stitchin' projects and her stories the real winner here though is god because later he got a job as a writer for numerous prank shows br br as a kids movie it gets a 7 as a movie about the mysteries of blind stupid faith and the nature of god it gets a 10
<START> what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe during the first season dark angel was on my weekly must see list and not just because of jessica alba br br unfortunately the powers that be over at fox decided that they needed to fine tune the plotline within 3 episodes of the season opener they had totally lost me as a viewer not even to see jessica alba i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin on one of the second season episodes they even had max sleeping and dreaming where the first season stated she biologically couldn't sleep br br the moral of the story the one that hollywood never gets if it works don't screw with it br br azjazz
<START> 13 days to glory tells the traditional tale with sympathy toward the mexican viewpoint the major problem in this movie was that while cowboy actor james arness played the part of jim bowie persuasively the rest of the name actors in the cast brian keith davy crocket and lorne greene sam houston were too old br br raul julia played general antonio lopez de santa anna with grace and dignity owed to the professional soldier who after all won the battle the scene where he upbraids his officers for failing to mount a guard and prevent a sortee is one the scriptwriters did not understand failing to keep watch is a major remiss in the military santa anna was within his prerogatives to be angry raul julia magnificently carried poor writing through the scene br br kathleen york was an impressive susannah dickinson a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage however kathleen york might have been reminded that as dickinsons hailed from pennsylvania they probable dis not sound very southron
<START> a toothsome little potboiler whose 65 minute length doesn't seem a second too short my name is julia ross harks back to an english tradition of things not being what they seem hitchcock's the lady vanishes is one example out of work julia ross nina foch finds a dream job at a new employment agency in london whose sinister representative seems very anxious to ascertain if she has living relatives or a boyfriend after reporting to duty she wakes up having been drugged in a vast manderley like pile on the cornish coast supposedly as the barmy in the crumpet wife of george macready who displays an alarming interest in knives and ice picks his doting enabling mum is the irresistible dame may whitty this time a model of bustling efficiency on the other side of good vs evil than she occupied in the lady vanishes the nightmare vision of this tale unfolds claustrophobically we know what's going on but are powerless to tell poor julia this movie curiously is regularly accorded a place of honor as one of the earliest and very few british films noirs i think it's closer to the gothic old dark house tradition than the american one of wet cobblestones and urban corruption it does however evince a more modern psychoanalytic cast of mind whatever you call it it remains a sharply satisfying thriller
<START> the problem with this movie is that it is shot on the worst possible camera and the film is blurry and grainy maybe it's just the fact that whoever was holding the camera couldn't hold still because they were having a seizure or something there is also way too much poop and vomit in this movie there is someone vomiting every twenty minutes and it makes me think that this was made by some bulimic or something it was disgusting then there is the annoying high pitched screaming that goes on and on and on and doesn't stop until the credits roll i also didn't like when all her friends were being shot or not i don't know and she goes in the van and puts band aids on that was just really really stupid to even have that in a movie how much gas can a person siphon to get a van going it must be a whole lot because they don't run out of gas for the rest of the movie it was a terrible movie and i would highly suggest not ever seeing it in your whole entire life
<START> this is one of the funniest and most excellent movies ever made although i've only seen forty minuets of it and i must say this is a good movie the plot if funny and because there's sex around pretty much every corner of this movie it's really funny and i don't see how anyone could not like this film i really really really want to watch the rest of the movie it has one slightly sick scene in it trust me it's not very pleasant but apart from that this is a great movie i rate this movie an 7 8 for comedy 10 10 for sexual content and 10 10 for the plot please if your a fan of american pie and you want to watch a movie where there's pretty much all sex in it the buy this movie it will please you br br 10 10
<START> would that more romantic comedies were as deftly executed as this one i never thought anything as mundane as the simple sale of a music box could leave me catching my breath with excitement margaret sullavan makes a marvellous saleswoman and she and james stewart always brought out the best in each other this movie sports what i think is frank morgan's most winning performance and with the wizard of oz and tortilla flat under his belt that is saying a lot the way he finds a christmas dinner partner left me giddy with joy director ernst lubitsch might have thought trouble in paradise his favorite but this one he must surely consider a triumph with some of the wittiest dialogue american movies of the 30's has to offer
<START> to me there is something so appealing and nostalgic about low budget sci fi as a kid in the 50s thats all there was in 1957 i saw the first man into space in a movie theater with my dad it had marshall thompson starring and some other poor slob who got the title role it is also about a space mission gone bad where the astronaut turns into a grizzly killer scared the good plenty right out of me the memory of those heebie jeebies still lives within me the incredible melting man is almost a re make only in full glorious color that is wherever the scenes were well lit just gotta love it for what it is a little over an hour of darkly lit scenes disgusting noises and that eerie music bravo
<START> but just as entertaining and random love it or hate it but don't expect a sophisticated plot or nail biting cliffhanger think of it like seinfeld but without the follow through and repeat performances of wacky characters well so far i have a feeling i will develop favourites as the season continues br br creature comforts is not for the faint of humour it's meant to be enjoyed with the least amount of effort on your brain's part which is why this show embodies everything i need in a program when i get home from work in the evening superficial conversation in the background with just the right amount of cute to the characters for me to enjoy when i eventually look up from the computer to see what i'm missing br br funnier than most of today's sitcoms calmer than an evening at nascar just the right mix of dead air and comebacks can't wait for the next one
<START> a give this movie a 10 10 because it deserves a 10 10 two of the best actors of their time walter matthau george burns collaborate with neil simon and all of the other actors that are in this film director herbert ross and all of that makes this stage adaption come true the sunshine boys is one of the best films of the 70's i love the type of humor in this film it just makes me laugh so hard br br i got this movie on vhs 3 days ago yes vhs because it was cheaper only 3 i watched it as soon as i got home but i had to watch it again because i kept missing a few parts the first time the second time i watched it it felt a lot better and i laughed a lot harder i'm definitely going to re get this on dvd because i have to see the special features br br it's very funny how that happens two people work together as entertainers actors performers they get along well on stage but really argue off stage they can't survive another minute with each other then some 15 years later you want to reunite them for a tv special you can find that in this film matthau burns were terrific in this film it's a damn shame they died george burns deserved that oscar he gave a strong comic performance he was also 78 when this movie was filmed so far he's the oldest actor to receive an academy award at an old age jessica tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress richard benjamin was also fantastic in this he won a golden globe for best supporting actor he deserved that golden globe although many people might disagree with what i am about to say everybody in this film gave a strong performance this comedy is an instant classic i highly recommend it one more thing whoever hates this film is a putz
<START> i generally like watching burt lancaster's films especially when he is needed to go nuts with his imposing screen presence like in elmer gantry however his greatest strength his magnetism was occasionally also his greatest weakness as he rarely if ever underplayed anything and it is this lack of subtlety that really hinders the rainmaker now i understand that his character was meant to be a sort of showman but how katherine hepburn could fall under his spell is completely inexplicable she is supposed to be smart but doesn't seem so when lancaster's blarney is being thrown about the screen in addition to this the story is perhaps one of the most stagy looking films i have ever seen and it is way too obvious that this is a movie based on a play it just looks like it was mostly filmed in a sound stage instead of in the great wide open west like it was supposed to be br br overall a very overrated film
<START> a story of obsessive love pushed to its limits and of a lovely swan whose beauty is the very ticket to her own premature demise placed at the beginning of talkies prix de beaute walks a thin line in being a full on silent film which is still is at heart and flirting with sound and sound effects the effect is a little irritating for anyone coming into this film because the recorded audio is extremely tinny and just doesn't help it at all hearing sound stage conversation edited over the beginning sequence which takes place in a beach for example is as part of the movie as the actress who dubs louise brooks' dialog and in doing so robs the audience of a fine performance other than that the movie rolls along more or less well with little jumps in continuity here and there something quite common in films from this era and has that vague sped up feel typical of silents in a way this is an experiment of a movie and closer to the style of sergei eisenstein in visual presentation and near intimate closeups that elevate it from what would be a more pedestrian level louise brooks here plays a character less flapper than what she was known for she's a stenographer who on a lark decides to enter a beauty contest despite the furious opposition of her extremely smothering boyfriend her role is quite thirties and contemporary for its time the last of the flapper jazz baby roles were being shown on screen and now with the onset of female independence women as professionals were being represented in film that brooks's character decides to leave her boyfriend even if she does reconcile with him later is also a little ahead of her time however her character's fatal flaw is its willing to believe what isn't there that her boyfriend wants her to succeed and this is what leads to her end at the movie theatre this final sequence looks like something straight out of hitchcock in its heightened suspense seen in the man who knew too much and cuts from brooks her image on screen and the murderous boyfriend even more dramatic is the placement of the still singing live brooks with the now dead one a chilling effect to a chilling powerful movie
<START> the garden of allah was one of the first feature length 3 strip technicolor films to correct a previous poster the first technicolor feature after disney's 5 year exclusivity deal was 1935's becky sharp which was a costume drama that used the color for it's garish color costumes br br the garden of allah looks as if it could have been shot years later as the cinematography uses not only the color but also the use of shadows it must have been amazing for an audiences at the time to see a color feature after seeing basically only black and white films for their whole life unfortunately the film does not stand up to the cinematography that being said the film is worth seeing just as a visual treat
<START> since i first saw anchors aweigh in 1945 viewing it on videotape holds a lot of nostalgia for me at age 15 it was easy for me to be drawn into the first of the great mgm technicolor musicals now i am perhaps most interested in thinking about the future careers of the leading players though sinatra had done a couple of negligible films soon after his emergence after his dorsey days as a solo singer this was his first major film appearance as another viewer noted this seems almost to be a warm up for on the town sinatra may have had to work hard at it but his dance with kelly is credible and he would do better in their next pairings however observing his physique it's easy to see why he was caricatured as a string bean who would have imagined that within a decade he would win an academy award for acting and go on to play many roles as a tough detective or leader in combat though gene kelly's personality and dancing dominated this film his winsome performance did not suggest that he would become a major creative force almost the iconic figure for mgm musicals where he developed a style of dance complementary to that of fred astaire finally it was strange to see the fresh faced dean stockwell and remember that he would later play a thrill killer in compulsion based on the leopold loeb murder from the 1920s an additional note one reviewer praised the performance of betty garrett as sinatra's love interest she later played opposite him in on the town but pamela britton was featured in this film
<START> after having red the overwhelming reviews this film got in my country i but wanted to see it but what a disappointment to see a bunch of one dimensional characters in a plot that lacks of originality is not worth the money and the time to spend i sometimes wonder about the filmcritics in switzerland
<START> i saw this feature as part of the asian american film festival in new york and was horrified by the graphic sado masochistic child pornography that i witnessed the story line is hidden beneath way too many graphic sex scenes and not one is in the least bit erotic sick is the more the feeling the director seemed to be going for shock value rather the exploring the various levels of why these characters are like this see it if you can stomach it i still have flashbacks
<START> i wonder who was responsible for this mess the jokes wouldn't have worked for gilligan's island if this had gone to series would there have been jokes about auschwitz or would eva have to replace her oven only to have adolf suggest the kind that seats 50 another post compared this show to i love lucy the problem with this is that lucille ball was a genius at physical comedy and bizarre situations and this mess was just plain badly done and an insult to my intelligence br br after the damage the nazi's did to england and the number of people they killed i would think the very concept of a comedy about hitler would seem repugnant and most normal people would have killed this concept before any episodes were produced
