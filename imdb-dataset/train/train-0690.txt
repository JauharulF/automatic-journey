<START> i can't believe that none of the official reviews for this movie warn people that it contains two quite upsetting sexual assault scenes it's as though our culture accepts this kind of behavior as simply sexual but not violent my biggest problem with the movie is that it doesn't seem to condemn these assaults as in the woman who is repeatedly assaulted and pressured never holds the men accountable for their actions and neither does anyone else one man is stopped from completing the assault when someone throws a dagger at him but he is reprimanded only with you cannot force a woman to love you rather than you should never force a woman sexually you jerk from a woman's point of view the movie is a let down it sort of throws a bone to women in letting them be both skilled fighters and leaders but the movie is much more defined by the romance which is characterized by the notion that human sexuality must involve an imbalance of power with men dominating the woman they love this amazing martial arts fighter doesn't use any of her fighting skills to try to fend off her attackers she never even makes them apologize rather she seems apologetic overall a depressing and upsetting movie with some great cinematography and some cool fight scenes but not as good as hero by a long shot
<START> my very favorite character in films but in nearly all of them the character of zorro has a small bit of cloth as a mask and if the villain s can t tell who is under that cloth then they are daft br br but in reed hadley s zorro s fighting legion serial 1939 the mask fills his whole face making it a real mystery as to who zorro really is br br but anyway zorro is one of the best character s in films and to bring it up to date l think anthony hopkins in the mask of zorro 1998 is a delight br br my interest in films is vast but l have a real liking for the serial s of the 30s 40s br br bond2a
<START> anne brontes epic novel the tenant of wildfell hall should be studied and read throughout schools and libraries and peoples living rooms its a fantastic story and tells the real truth on alcoholism and ruined marriages and a mothers fight to keep her son away from her brutal husband its so alike todays stories that we see and hear and i believe people can learn a lot from reading this book based on possible true experiences that the author had back in the 1840s br br do watch this film its a great version of the book and very moving indeed i'm sure anne herself would have been happy with the way it was produced br br excellent acting and great locations
<START> exceptionally horrible tale that i can barely put into words the best part of the movie was when one of the murder victims turns up at the end alive and well only to be massacred again there is the chance that i missed some crucial plot elements since i may have been in a slight coma during the time this baby was on the box that the movie comes in shows scenes that are never even in the film i was lured in by the crude images of bondage torture and promises of a 'euro trash sexy horror flick ' i get the feeling this was the budget version and about one quarter of the film was left out all the good stuff more than likely i got the pg 13 addition that made about as much sense as the end to the new 'planet of the apes' movie watch this one with a friend and a bottle of the hard stuff you'll need it
<START> the late 30s and early 40s were a golden age for adventure movies what with the rise in budgets during the economic recovery the changes to screen entertainment since the production code became enforced and the general carefree optimism of the times while most of these were rip roaring swashbucklers about the wild superhuman and often frankly misogynistic exploits of heartthrobs like errol flynn and tyrone power gunga din is very different in its focus scope and tone br br part of gunga din's secret is the division of labour in its writing team the original story is by ben hecht and charles macarthur two of the most skilled and celebrated writers of hollywood's golden age however the actual screenplay was the work of joel sayre and fred guiol both of whom guiol especially had a background in comedy what we get from these four is a plot that is well balanced and engaging yet also cleverly spiced up with comical touches most of the adventure flicks of this time were at least partly comedies usually featuring one or two comic relief supporting players but they didn't use laughs in the way gunga din does here all the main characters are capable of being objects or originators of jokes we see the sinister menace of the bad guys suddenly diffused as the scene dissolves into a light hearted brawl the first main battle scene is an even handed blend of action and gags in the style of the silent swashbucklers of douglas fairbanks sr something which the flynn and power vehicles largely failed to replicate towards the middle of gunga din the action must necessarily take a break and there are lots of talky scenes for the sake of the plot however the continual forays into comedy Â such as the spiked punch routine Â make this slow portion bearable br br producer director george stevens was a natural when it came to this sort of thing himself having cut his teeth at the hal roach studios and almost exclusively having directed comedy up to this point this was his first full on action feature and he does a startlingly good job in particular his use of moving point of view shots make the battle scenes extra exhilarating he also brings something you seldom see in action pictures of this era Â a sense of real dread and fear he sets this up with those stark and foreboding mountains dominating many of the shots and dwarfing the characters the portrayal of the abandoned village and the thuggee cultists cry of kali is genuinely haunting this dimension of fear plays into all the other emotions that are at work here causing us to worry for these likable characters and making the comedy a greater relief of tension br br a real touch of genius is in the way the eponymous hero is introduced to the audience we are made aware of din visually as he is prominent in a number of scenes before any of the characters actually address him or verbally refer to him because of this we are given the impression that din is not an important figure within the regiment but he quickly becomes a notable character to us and crucially a sympathetic one as we see him risking his life and giving water to dying men br br but the best efforts of writers and directors are all for nought without a capable cast fear not for gunga din has a top notch one victor mclaglan and cary grant were ideally suited to the material since their best roles were generally found somewhere on the spectrum between drama and comedy grant in particular is at his best largely believable but just occasionally breaking into that over the top whooping and capering that was his trademark douglas fairbanks jr is not quite up to the standard of his heavyweight companions but he is by no means bad and of course there is sam jaffe cursed by his looks to forever play these wizened little oddballs but who else could play them with such dignity and humanity i have not set out to bash the swashbuckling adventures of errol flynn and tyrone power and indeed many of their pictures are absolute classics that i love absolutely but gunga din does things that even the best of those swashbucklers could never achieve not only does it dispense with the dashing male lead or the clichÃ©d defiant damsel it successfully merges the action genre with comedy and poignancy in a way that few pictures have done before or since and that's fabulous
<START> as a fan of looking further into the phenomenon that is school shootings this film took an interesting and different approach to the idea presented as a series of video recordings made by the two troubled men i cannot refer to persons who kill as boys or teens the months of preparation leading to zero day the codename for the day on which they will attack the film tries to present the situation from the opposite end of the gun it seems intent on portraying the pain they suffer yet focuses on the literal preparation the problem is that little in terms of emotion is directly delivered the only point at which emotion became overwhelming was the ending as expected but leading up to this point it's never really clear as to why they are planning this out we are told the obligatory story that they were mocked but the film also seems to contradict this without ruining the film it's easy to say it was a great attempt and had equally great intentions but falls short because of sloppy film making all directing is amateur to further the homemade video concept but the story and continuity is weak the film seems to want the audience to decide a lot but also fails to provide the information for such an event the ending is abrupt and doesn't feel like it finishes everything that the film began
<START> this true story of carlson's raiders is more of a army training film than anything else obviously thrown together quickly on a miniscule budget about the only thing it has to recommend it is an early performance by robert mitchum who's the only decent actor in the cast and actual footage of the wreckage at pearl harbor which gets your blood boiling as it was obviously intended to do
<START> the costumes the dialog historical accuracy are terrible for instance stacey dash and the hanging scene the noose was accurate as for as i could tell but that type of noose broke the person's neck ms dash is left hanging at the end of the rope with no ill effects until the rope was shot this type of not did not strangle the person it killed them at the end of the drop br br and right before they go in to rob a bank in a flashback they pause on the street for a group hug with their bandannas hiding their faces that would have been obvious to people on the street br br the poor editing that is a battery pack under that shirt and it is obvious the clip of the long ride shows them riding along then reverses the film br br i did like the fact that they kept the scene with the horse taking a crap it seemed symbolic the entire movie was crap
<START> so there's this bride you see and she gets crushed to death by this statue that falls on her on the day of her wedding then get this a year later her former fiancÃ© falls in love with a beautiful psychicÂ and then that beautiful psychic gets haunted by the ghost of the disgruntled dead bride who wants to keep her from stealing her boyfriendÂhe heÂit'll be hilarious polite chuckling br br this i like to envision is how jeff lowell the man who dreamed up over her dead body presented his concept to the studio execs over there at new line cinema the big mystery is how those very same corporate bigwigs could then turn right around and green light the project allowing lowell to direct the film as well as write the screenplay br br for if you think that no movie could ever possibly be as bad as this original premise sounds then clearly you have another think coming the only way in which it might have worked is if the writer had simply gone crazy with it and turned it into a no holds barred satirical farce instead wanting to ensure that he delivered a fuzzy inoffensive and warmhearted romantic comedy lowell engages in boring half measures every step of the way tamping down the absurdity in favor of drab conventionality indeed over her dead body is so thoroughly inept and unfunny that it's hard to know where exactly lowell thought he was going with it virtually every set up joke and sight gag in the film is flat footed and poorly executed with even the actors themselves seemingly aware of their predicament how else to explain the halfhearted lifeless performances of paul rudd eva langoria parker lake bell and jason biggs in their various roles br br i choose not to blame the actors some of whom have proved their talents in better vehicles in the past that is particularly the case with rudd but lowell and those studio execs sure have some 'splainin' to do
<START> i run a group to stop comedian exploitation and i just spent the past 2 months hearing horror stories from comedians who attempted to audition for last comic standing if they don't have a good agent then they don't even get a chance to audition so more than 80 of the comedians who turn up are rejected before they can show anyone that they have talent if they do make it to an audition i was told that it's pre determined if they get a second chance so what the tv audience sees is not the best comics in the us br br if the comics do make it to the show then most of them don't get imdb credits i know this because i did the credits for all 6 seasons of last comic standing and i don't get paid for doing the producers' job it's really a disgrace a month ago i asked last comic standing 7 on facebook why the producers aren't giving imdb credits and i was banned from their facebook page i am not a comedian so i do not have a personal stake in this i just want people to know the truth i don't like seeing anyone getting exploited and that's why i've been helping the comedians comedians get exploited on hbo bet tvone and other cable networks but nbc is a big three network so those in charge should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this exploitation to happen br br please watch this video of a comedian who was victimized http www youtube com watch v rmb4 hyet y
<START> this has to be the worst piece of garbage i've seen in a while br br heath ledger is a heartthrob he looked deformed i wish i'd known that he and naomi watts are an item in real life because i spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him br br orlando bloom is a heartthrob with the scraggly beard and deer in the headlights look about him i can't say i agree br br rachel griffiths was her usual fabulous self but geoffrey rush looked as if he couldn't wait to get off the set br br i'm supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers this is a far cry from butch cassidy which actually was an entertaining film this was trite cliche ridden and boring we only stayed because we were convinced it would get better it didn't br br the last 10 15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel and women and children are dying because of their presence that's not funny but it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on because all we could think of was the black knight from monty python and the holy grail i kept waiting for them to say i'll bite yer leg off we were howling with laughter as were several other warped members of the audience when we left pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was br br i may not have paid cash to see this disaster sneak preview but it certainly wasn't free it cost me 2 hours of my life that i will never get back
<START> this is surely one of the worst films ever made each scene is painful you will groan at the flimsy attempts at humor the awkward camera work the sexism and racism the ridiculous story line the wooden acting poor joan bennett she is the only one in the movie who is not an embarrassment in all dreadful
<START> want a great recipe for failure take a s y plot add in some weak completely undeveloped characters and than throw in the worst special effects a horror movie has known let stew for a week the amount of time probably spent making this trash the result is corpse grinders a movie that takes bad movies to dangerous and exotically low places br br the movie utterly blew my words cannot convey how painful it was to watch this is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit around and make fun of this is not plan 9 from outer space this is a long boring sad waste of time corpse grinders ii is the biggest waste of energy and talent i have ever seen i depresses me when i realize that people actually took time out of their lives to act in this shit if you can call it acting but than again when you have poor direction poor storywriting poor everything acting is the last thing to criticize br br this movie is like a huge disgusting turd that you yearn to quickly flush out of existence fearful that a friend or loved one might somehow see it i really with i could somehow destroy every copy of this film so it will not pollute the minds of aspiring filmmakers thank you ted v mikels for giving me new found respect for every movie i have ever seen you have shown me what is truly awful and why i should appreciate all those movies that are merely crappy or boring
<START> arguebly al pacino's best role he plays tony montana a small time hood from cuba turned into a rich and powerful crime lord in miami and he does it with the only two things he's got in this world his balls and his word and he doesn't break'em for nobody starts as doing jobs for a big time cuban dealer frank lopez robert loggia and quickly goes up the ladder of the organization along with his long time friend manny steven bauer soon he has an eye for the boss's sexy wife elvira michelle pfeiffer after frank sees a threat from tony to his position he attempts to assassin tony but with no luck tony is upset and nothing can stop him now the film has a great supporting cast among them is f murray abraham as a jumpy gangster another familiar face is harris yulin as a crooked cop trying to shake down tony marry elizabeth mastrantonio as tony's young sister credits to the ecxellent screenplay by oliver stone this film is one of brian depalma's brightest points in his long ups and downs career you can see this guy is very talented the movie has a magnificent look to it also pay attention for two memorable scenes the one at the fancy restaurant say goodnight to the bad guy the other is the final shootout where tony shows that he still knows how to kick ass and kills about 20 assassins that invaded to his house this is certainly one of the most impressive endings to a movie i have ever seen for fans of al pacino and crime movies it's a must see for the rest of you it's highly recommended 10 10
<START> this tender beautifully crafted production delved deep down bitter sweet into my being the irreverent pupils the life embittered bus driver and the teachers personalities present a subliminal debate as the story unveils the adult characters all seem familiar my teachers my bus driver each one of their opinions so plausible and well known when a key incident happens on the bus we are sent on a circuit of viewpoints all the time the babble of teenage energy is only just kept under control by the organisers of the trip mr harvey is experiencing much pain throughout he reminds me of war damaged teachers i did not understand when i was an irreverent pupil br br rhidian brook and the producers deserve much acclaim for this well shaped british film the acting unblemished the scenes appropriate it should be widely available yet does not seem to have been given the right opportunity
<START> this show was great it wasn't just for kids which i thought at first it is for the whole family br br the first season was mostly about the father looking after is two daughters and son he sadly passed away in season 2 i could believe it when i heard it br br i am clad they carried on with the show as that what would really happen in really life and i need to mention the goodbye episode it was so well made it must of be so hard for them to film this you could tell they were real tears in theirs eyes i am 24 year old male and this episode did make me cry me as i know how they felt as my father died when i was 13 years too just like roy br br season 2 and season 3 had great comedy in there also season 3 had some of my favorites such freaky friday secrets br br i still think the show was strong enough to go on i was disappointed that it ended it was one the best no it was the best family comedy show ever since home improvement and it could have been the next friends br br it should never have ended but still love watching the repeats everyday
<START> when i first saw the trailer for prom night i have to admit the trailer looked good and like this would be a fun horror movie so my friend and i saw prom night last night and i have to say i must be growing up because this was such a ridicules film not to mention i am so sick and tired of the typical horror slasher movies with the loud noises as an excuse to scare people there was no tension the characters how was i supposed to care about them they had no development what so ever the killer oh my god this was very possibly the most stupid serial killer that has ever existed i know it's a film but why would a man who never or at least we know of killed any one before kill a girl's family and friends that he's just obsessed over i mean was he going to kidnap her or was he going to kill her i have no idea because this film made no sense and is too predictable and insulting to true fans of horror br br donna's family was just brutally murdered by her teacher who has become very obsessed over her he was captured and put in jail it's been 3 years and she's just now getting some peace in her life she's even going to her senior prom but the killer has escaped and still has donna on his mind he follows her to her prom which means bad news for her friends and the hotel maid and the bell boy because it is such a good idea to kill the maid and bell boy so no one become suspicious enough to check to see where these employee's are donna is in big trouble because also this killer who is clearly human can apparently get into houses un noticed and can kill people so silently just wow br br i'm sorry i really did want to love this movie we haven't had a good slasher flick in a long time but this was just a stupid movie that i was not impressed with just the situations were unbelievable and the actors were obnoxious i know that this was a pg 13 movie but i just love how someone was brutally stabbed to death and they only have just a little blood on their clothes not to mention no stab holes i wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone unless you're a teen this movie was made for the teenagers not adults and not for those who know a real horror movie no offense to those who did enjoy this film but i don't understand how anyone could br br 2 10
<START> i thought it was a pretty good movie and should have been released in theaters first it wouldn't have been a big blockbuster but it would have made some pretty good money the movie has suspense and makes you wonder just how much of this is going on in the real world justin timberlake did a good job i wasn't expecting justin timberlake to do that good a job considering it is his first movie he did a good job this is a movie that is good to pick up and watch when you just don't know what you want to rent that night it should go pretty well the cast was great so i highly recommend that everyone checks this movie out
<START> pickup on south street 1953 directed by movie maverick samuel fuller contains a stunning opening that establishes a double complication subway rider candy susan peters collides with pickpocket skip mccoy richard widmark dipped in shades of sinatra cool she's unaware that she carries valuable microfilm mccoy is unaware of grifting it both are unaware of being observed by two federal agents thus the grift sets in motion a degree of knowledges candy is doubly watched skip and the police and therefore doubly naive skip the overconfident petty thief is singularly unaware trailed by federal agents the feds all knowing are ultimately helpless they can't stop the passing of government secrets or the spread of communism
<START> this was a wonderful film how these women tried to save their husbands i thought that the performances of the actors were great i had to think about the film for a very long time i think that every student should see this film so that they can think about war relationships friendship and love i liked the film because it told and showed me how strong love can be i wish i could be so strong as a woman i really liked it because it told me something about relationships and that is what i like to see in a movie i think you can compare the film with der untergang the pianist if you put these three films together you have a great sight of what happened during the war we should remember something like the war forever
