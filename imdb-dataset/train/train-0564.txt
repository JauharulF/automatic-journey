<START> i was fully amped up to see this film i had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in new zealand i shouldn't have built myself up so much because it was so disappointing and is without a doubt clark's worst film there is so much wrong with this film first off some of the acting is great in particular nick stahl as 'the bully' and the girl with the curly brown hair i can't recall her name but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly unbelievable especially leo fitzpatrick he's a veteran of clark's films now and he was so brilliant in 'kids' but in 'bully' he invests his lines with such solemnity as to turn his scenes into a parody virtually the screenplay felt like it had been written by a first year film student no sorry a high school student one who has never seen a movie before and i couldn't fathom clark's intentions was he trying to point out the meaningless of these kids' existence it sure as hell didn't stop him getting in a damn good perv i'm no prude but i didn't need to see teenage breasts and buttocks every 5 minutes i still maintain that clark's best film is 'another day in paradise' it's fantastic and i don't think he'll ever top it
<START> class of '61 br br aspect ratio 1 33 1 br br sound format stereo br br in 1861 class members from the west point academy are torn apart by the outbreak of the civil war br br gregory hoblit's ok historical drama makes an obvious point virtuous men are rendered blind by conflict though the production seems a little stilted despite authentic period detail and a cast of talented newcomers clive owen christien anholt josh lucas andre braugher laura linney etc toplined by dan futterman as a conscientious southerner who takes up arms in defence of slavery pitting him in direct conflict with his former northern friends the movie's emphasis on such a misguided though sympathetic character is particularly brave but the drama is otherwise flat and superficial and hoblit's direction is efficient rather than inspired
<START> like most people i've seen jason priestley on tv and i think he's great but i didn't know he had a sister justine priestley is simply mah velous as the scorned other woman good music intrigue and a death scene involving amanda's revenge on an abusive dr that will stay with you for weeks i'll leave it at that kudos
<START> if you are a traveller if there is a fire burning into your heart if you'd call home every place on earth but none of them can give you enough if you are always looking for the next thing and if you believe the other part of your soul is somewhere out there see this movie and you'll find out a little but wonderful piece of life sitting next to you
<START> some films are so bad that they're good this is clearly not one of them based on a true story this film was about as true to the story as pinocchio's chances of becoming a real boy the acting was terrible the direction was poor and it travelled way too fast it was as if the director just wanted to get it over and done with and go home br br nor did melissa joan hart ever strike me as a talented actress but then every film she made was pretty low budget anyway like most of her other films she lets down her characters by hamming them up too much talking too quickly as if speeding up her words is going to make her more dramatic she really brings out the sense that there is a crew in front of her and she's talking to a camera when she should be engaging the viewer in her character it pretty much lets down the whole film and any leg that it may have had left to stand on is ruined br br probably the only good thing about the film is when she got nailed in the end but even that wasn't satisfying enough to subdue my loathing for such a bad film br br watch it if your taste in film is blander than a piece of dry toast
<START> even if you subscribe to the knee jerk anti free trade politics of this movie it is still just the same tired note played again and again and again clink clink clink even if you can accept a preacher with peroxide hair who advocates a return to first principles the reverend billy is pretty hard to look at as a serious figure the clownish reverend is the sort who wakes every morning with no aspiration more ethereal than to see his own face on tv before he climbs back into bed that night he has a pretty wife i have to admit but it would take tons more than that to save this dreary mess of a movie the interminable bus rides are the worst part with progress shown can you guess by a colored line moving across a map aww you guessed oh well it has the virtue of being short is that the only favorable thing i can say hmmmm yep afraid so
<START> had this been the original 1914 version of tess of the storm country also starring mary pickford i probably would have rated it a lot higher as this sort of extreme melodrama and sentimentality was pretty typical of the teens however by 1922 this film was already starting to show its age and compared to many of ms pickford's other films such as daddy longlegs sparrows my best girl and suds tess comes up a tad short and not every pickford film merits a 10 even if she was america's sweetheart now this isn't to say that it's a bad film it certainly isn't but i just can't see how so many have given this film a 10 br br the film has a very long and complicated plot especially because most films of the era were shorter a rich old crank builds a mansion at the top of a hill next to the river at the bottom of the hill are some dirty squatters who he hates but who he cannot evict so he tries to come up with a variety of ways to get them off the land one ends up in tragedy when his daughter's fiancÃ© is killed in a scuffle with the po' folks the man accused of the murder is dear old mary's father though he is innocent to make things a lot worse the only witness to the real murder won't talk and the dead man had gotten his fiancÃ©e pregnant so at this point we have an innocent man in prison waiting to be executed and a pregnant lady afraid to tell her sanctimonious father she is in the family way there's a ton more to the film such as the crank's son falling in love with mary but it's best you just see the film for yourself br br the film excels in some ways the plot while very complicated is also rather interesting and the cinematography is top notch the very final scene is also pretty cute however there is so much overt sentimentality you can practically cut it with a knife mary is so good and so sweet and so plucky at times the viewer might find it all a bit hard to take while it worked great in 1922 making her the biggest star in the world today it's very dated this is not true of all her films but this one certainly is br br by the way the image entertainment dvd is of decent quality though a few scenes are badly degraded something that isn't very surprising considering the age of the film also the only extras included are a brief filmography
<START> steven spielberg wanted to win an oscar so bad that he figured that he wouldn't win by directing special effects epics he was nominated for three of them close encounters of the third kind raiders of the lost ark and e t the extra terrestrial so he decided to get very serious by directing the color purple a period film with no special effects spielberg's first serious drama is a remarkable movie but the academy voters who voted back in 1985 still didn't give spielberg any respect the color purple received 11 oscar nominations including best picture but spielberg was unfairly snubbed when he wasn't nominated for best director it got worse on oscar night when this film didn't win a single oscar it got completely shut out that wasn't right the color purple should have won a couple of oscars including one for whoopi goldberg's spectacular film debut as celie a woman who suffers at the hands of an abusive husband frightfully placed by danny glover then gets stronger throughout the film thanks to some special friends oprah winfrey also made her film debut here and gives a great performance as sofia one of those friends' of celie since i'm from chicago i had already known winfrey from her talk show which at the time of this films' release hadn't gone nationwide like goldberg what a film debut margaret avery is terrific as shug avery another friend who also happens to be the mistress of celie's rotten husband all three actresses received well deserved oscar nominations for their work here goldberg for best actress winfrey and avery for best supporting actress set in the south during the first half of the 20th century the color purple is a film so strong that it made me cry at the end it also made me laugh at times too why academy voters were so hard on not nominating spielberg for best director is a mystery that still puzzles me today but spielberg would eventully go on to win two oscars years later for schindler's list and saving private ryan making him one of the best movie directors of all time but he should have gotten nominated for this movie the job that he did going from special effects blockbusters like e t to a serious drama like the color purple was remarkable br br out of four
<START> the number of goofs in this episode was higher than the first 9 they don't follow their own rules about spirits where destruction of the body makes the spirit dissolve this one dropped a second body that body and dean drop about 20 feet from sam but then they are right with sam flashlights go out in an unlighted asylum at night and we can still see everything it's night but light is streaming through the windows a ghost that died in 1960's is making cell phones calls come on there is no way sam could get a psychiatrist to see him in the same day he makes an appointment and the doctor talks to sam like it wasn't his first visit sam and dean knew there were other bodies in the asylum and innocent spirits still lurking and didn't do anything to help them that doesn't seem like a thing the winchester boys would do oh and after crawling around on a dirt filled mattress and all around a nasty asylum the girls' makeup and hair is perfect and not a smudge on her white shirt br br while the implementation of this episode had problems the premise was good and a few times i was not creeped out but nervous as dean sat reading elicots' journal i just knew that an object so intensely personal to the ghost would draw it to the person violating it's sanctity elicot didn't appear maybe that is a fault for such an important object or place like elicot's office should draw the spirit when a living being touches or enters when they separate i want to scream 'that's how you die always stay together and watch each others backs ' but they don't listen to me o the elicot spirit and his special ability was a very nice touch it's prime time show but i do wish the horror of elicot strapping one of his victims down and using anticipation of torture to creep us out further br br especially because of the lighting goofs i gave this a 4 sudden darkness or the flickering of the whole scene's lighting as the flashlight flickers is all that more terrifying the lighter coming or the flashlight reviving and instantly a spirit is in their face is shocking i understand the directors wants us to see his scene but then make a mention or obvious connection by elicot touching an electric socket and the lights coming on have the characters respond to the fact an asylum with no power suddenly has lights in the one room blue white lights flickering as electric arcs just like elicot's finger power br br seriously mcg could have done better
<START> i saw this movie today and i have to say it was much much better than i expected it to be about couple of hours before going to see it personally i had some prejudice due to the language of it but it did totally change my idea the movie was in most cases surprisingly good with the great actor and actress performances it was a story about a boy who had a dream and who did everything to reach it this really touched me and as a film which is based on a true story it convinced me a new school psycho headmaster and a young boy who get known with a new teacher a bit different one than the others and about fighting for the things even if they doesn't seem to work out it showed how little things can make huge changes in many things and how difference can sometimes cause difficult situations also i think the actor selections has succeeded perfectly it really felt like you had been some person watching the episodes as an outsider when they happened before i spoil this movie with praises i have to admit that there were some things and situations that didn't look and feel realistic like the one where the headmaster of the school beat frits aka martin in front of the class at the end of the movie he really got beaten badly but the only thing that it caused to him was some blood coming from the nose when comparing that to the first beating in the beginning when frits got some stitches well i guess every movie has it own faults have to say that if i someday somewhere find this dvd from the store it's sure thing that i take it with me
<START> this is another fantasy favorite from ralph bakshi after watching it on youtube that is set in the distant past after the ice age it is a prehistoric sword and sorcery quest between good and evil nekron lord of the realm of ice and his mother queen juliana has set their sights on conquest of the known world when their glaciers destroy's the village of a man named larn he larn vows to avenge his people and kill the ice lord meanwhile the sub human minions of nekron and juliana capture firekeep's king jarol's sultry daughter princess teegra but she manages to escape and eventually meets with larn who promises to escort her back to firekeep if the sub humans don't find them first br br this movie did very little box office as did most of ralph bakshi's films but has become a cult classic partly for the quality of the art a collaboration between ralph bakshi and the famed fantasy artist frank frazetta also i have heard that the screenplay was written by gerry conway and roy thomas the two men who had done conan comic book stories and the background painters included james gurney the illustrator of the dinotopia novels though admittedly i had never read conan or dinotopia and also the painter thomas kinkade noted for his artwork for figurines music boxes for the bradford exchange company besides paintings and like bakshi's films the lord of the rings and american pop this movie was rotoscoped but the process works better in this film than in the former br br so overall i think it's one of the best animated fantasy movies ever made and an awesome collaboration between two great minds ralph bakshi and frank frazetta with plenty of fantasy sexual innuendo and thrilling adventure
<START> i remember watching this movie when i was young but could not recall the title to it then going through horror movies i find it and think to myself that is the title this movie is a kind of combination disaster film insect attack film with fewer notable stars in it it is also somewhat boring too as it has that television vibe to it where you can see the movie fade out for commercials and such the plot has this sort of resort being invaded by ants i think they were a bit disturbed by construction or something going on nearby but do not quote me on that the most memorable ant attack for me in the whole flick was the first one involving the kid who falls into the swimming pool after being swarmed and of course summers attack scene too what else stands out in this one is the very goofy ending where the survivors use cardboard tubes to breath through in the end though like most television movies this movie is very tame and not very scary in the least unless you panic at the sight of ants
<START> well this movie actually made me feel so strongly that i signed up for an imdb account just to warn people it is patently awful nothing makes sense in this movie there is way too many subplots for a start josh hartnett's character is an aspiring actor and yoga instructor as well as a cop who seems to be living way beyond his means and only teaches yoga to hot girls some of whom wait naked in his jacuzzi for when he comes back from work add to that the fact that his dad was killed by a crooked cop who just so happens to be in on the current crime being investigated by the hapless duo harrison ford's character is trying to sell real estate on the side and is sleeping with the internal affairs investigator's ex wife who happens to run a psychic radio show which ford's character calls from time to time nonsense br br i can't remember the characters names that's how forgettable this is so i'll refer to them as ford and hartnett br br then there's the dialogue which is brutal i mean cringe inducing stuff here throw in every clichÃ© in the book having a heart to heart in a dark bar during the day over a drink where the bartender knows his name the duo being investigated by internal affairs why hartnett confronting his dad's killer and you've got one hell of a mess br br as i mentioned the plot is preposterous and continuity is non existent 1 when ford's car is being repossessed how the hell did the repo guys know where it would be parked were they following him 2 when hartnett goes to the morgue and it just so happens that the only clue from the crime scene an earring is replicated on of the charred bodies there that was lucky 3 when the two are arrested and taken in for questioning ford keeps answering his phone and hartnett centers himself with a yoga pose on the table instead of taking the phone from ford the ia guy waits for it to ring each time and then tries to grab it off the table before ford does meanwhile the female ia officer in with hartnett is rubbing herself all over him then inexplicably the two are released without answering any questions 4 during the car chase hartnett's car is crashing and smashing its way around hollywood but then suddenly the car is perfect again not a scratch 5 when ford chases the bad guy into the building and he gets in the elevator how the hell does he know which floor the bad guy got off at 6 when the two are chasing the bad guy around in hartnett's car ford is trying to close a real estate deal come on 7 the bad guy is the most unconvincing record exec ever his motivation for killing an aspiring group of rappers on his label they might leave his label and it's a warning to keep his other groups loyal but hang on how is he ever going to sign anyone new with that business plan 8 why is the ia guy who is investigating ford arrested in the end there is no explication 9 and hartnett gets to use his acting to capture the bad guy in the end br br i could go on i really could anyone who is looking deeper into this movie than a straight up action comedy needs their head examined because that's all it is there's nothing else to it it's not supposed to be satirical or ironic it's just crap
<START> identical twin sisters mary kate and ashley olsen climbed to fame in sitcoms like two of a kind i had never seen them in anything before but i had an idea of what to expect but it was much worse basically the hunter sisters charli mary kate and leila ashley are in rome for a summer intern program but not long after starting their jobs they are immediately fired for a series of mishaps but the man who owns the company they are working in derek hammond julian stone gives them their jobs back and they they do slowly prove themselves useful assets and talented fashion artists and help stop a mean man taking over the company also starring leslie danon as jami derek lee nixon as ryan ilenia lazzarin as dari archie kao as nobu valentina mattolini as heidi michelangelo tommaso as paolo and matt patresi as enrico tortoni you can tell that this film was made to go straight to video the camera work is completely mismatched and it doesn't help when you want to admire the sights of rome in fact the background is the only good thing to watch the twin sisters are two of the most annoying celebrities around i knew before watching that they weren't going to interest me in any way their not even that pretty this is awful gush of rubbish film pretty poor
<START> the original animated dark knight returns in this ace adventure movie that rivals mask of phantasm in its coolness there's a lot of style and intelligence in mystery of the batwoman so much more than batman forever or batman and robin br br there's a new crime fighter on the streets of gotham she dresses like a bat but she's not a grown up batgirl and batman is denying any affiliation with her meanwhile bruce wayne has to deal with the usual romances and detective work but the penguin bain and the local mob makes things little more complicated br br i didn't have high hopes for this 'un since being strongly let down but the weak batman sub zero robin isn't featured so much here but i was delighted with the imaginative and exciting set pieces the clever plot and a cheeky sense of humor this is definitely a movie no fan of batman should be without keep your ears open for a really catchy song called 'betcha neva' which is featured prominently through out br br it's a shame the dvd isn't so great don't get me wrong there are some great features the short 'chase me' is awesome and a very cool dolby 5 1 soundtrack but the movie is presented in pan and scan batman mystery of the batwoman was drawn and shot in 1 85 1 but this dvd is presented in 1 33 1 an in comparison to the widescreen clips shown on the features there is picture cut off on both sides i find this extremely annoying considering mask of phantasm was presented in anamorphic widescreen warner have had to re release literally dozens of movies on dvd because people have complained about the lack of original aspect ratio available on some titles why they chose to make that same mistake here again is beyond me br br i would give this dvd 5 5 but the lack of oar brings the overall score down to 4 5 it's a shame because widescreen would have completed a great dvd package
<START> wealthy psychiatrist lindsay crouse has just published her first novel and is feeling down about her profession feeling that it's hopeless to help her patients a young gambling junkie client asks her to help him pay off his debts if he truly wants to help him get better here she gets involved with joe mantegna to reveal any more of the plot would spoil one hell of a fun movie and 'house of games' may very well be the best con movie i've seen david mamet wrote and directed this gem that's full of snappy dialogue great one liners and enough twists to keep you guessing til the end crouse is perfect as the uptight psychiatrist needing a change and mantegna tops her as the devilishly sly con man and with the exception of a coincidence in the last quarter of the movie the film is in utter control of it's audience and we are loving the con br br out of
<START> paul reiser is one of my favorite people in show business i have read both of his books and think that he is great peter faulk can deliver a punch line with the best of them the combination of the two is magic br br this is a story about a family really getting to know each other through a road trip a father and son connect for the first time in their lives in the midts of a family crisis they do all the things that fathers and sons are suppose to do in life they are just doing them much later in life the situations are very funny but have the feeling that they could actually happen to people in real life not obsurdly over the top or cartoonish this is the first time that i watch paul reiser and fully believed every emotion that was portrayed at times his eyes look so sad br br gret movie and great story and plot it has comedy and emotion but an uplifting message olympia dukakas does a great job also
<START> first lesson that some film makers particularly those inspired by hollywood need to know just 'style' does not sell i guess tashan when translated will mean style second if you are hell bent on selling style that does not spare you from having a decent story br br tashan has some story which could have sufficed with some better director but it is not slick for example all three saif kareena and akshay are narrators at different points in the story but this setup is not utilized to properly there could have been a better mix and match of their narrations actions sequences are from the seventies br br cheoreography of the film is awful i think vaibhavi merchant just sleep walked through this film vishal shekhar have put up a good score but it does not belong to this film why is there a sufi song dil haara in tashan why is the cool hinglish song dil dance maare not on anil kapoor when he is the one who is english crazy br br akshay kumar is the saving grace of the film but he is in his stereotyped self you won't mind missing this film
<START> throw this lame dog a bone sooo bad you may watch anyway kol ross hagen is an intergalactic bad guy that escapes being vaporised by an over zealous spaceship commander jan michael vincent kol manages to steal a shuttle that crash lands on earth an unstoppable android killer is sent to bring back the villain dead or alive john phillip law plays a forest park ranger that urges caution in dealing with these two visitors from far far away costumes are outrageous and the script is lacking intelligence vincent surely took the money and ran law shows the only sign of effort so bad it is almost comical also in the cast dyana ortelli p j soles and dawn wildsmith
<START> this is a generally nice film with good story great actors and great songs the cinematography was unfortunately bad one of the film's weakest points is the annoying chain of sequences copied from pretty woman why does it hurt to attempt some originality abbas mustan anyone br br the film is about a newly married couple raj and priya salman rani priya cannot conceive after an accident she had during the previous pregnancy and they finally decide to use a surrogate mother who will carry their child they pick madhubala a vulgar prostitute played by preity zinta the film is not really realistic i mean isn't it easier to adopt and even if they pick a girl does it mean the man has to sleep with her have you heard of insemination anyway i guess if the writers had heard of all this the film wouldn't have been made so the concept is apparently intentional br br salman acts very well it's nice to see him playing a serious character but his character suffers from unnecessary and cheap dialogues about his great love to his wife and how hard he finds it to sleep with another woman come on it's cheesy and unrealistic rani is just about ok she is generally effective and does try to do something with the role but gets completely overshadowed by preity zinta br br the film belongs to preity who steals the show in a big way with her flawless performance she makes the transformation from a loud prostitute to a sensitive woman easily and naturally she lives the film emotes and makes you love her and admire her at the same time partly because of her role partly because of her magnetic and positive personality this is one of her career best performances there is no doubt she is more talented than her industry contemporaries she just should do more such roles br br the film's ending only highlights what i said above it is tear jerking exciting and very well acted watch it for preity br br 7 10 for the film 10 10 for preity
