<START> my 7 year old daughter loved it as disney execs crassly calculated that she would that's the problem with air buddies it's a strictly by the numbers children's film filled with carefully calculated cuteness a couple politically correct morals and enough potty humor to avoid the dreaded g rating as a parent or even as a 10 year old you've seen it all before and done better before think 101 dalmatians meets home alone and you get the general idea i'm of the opinion that a good children's story is a good story period air buddies which is about as original as recycled paper fails to meet that standard it isn't the worst video your child could watch but there are megatons of better ones
<START> saturday night live national lampoon and sctv alumnus are all together in a sometimes funny sketch film br br however it is very interesting to watch now at the start of 2005 twenty years after this movie is supposed to take place look at how many of their gags have become absolutely true there is a mock movie trailer that probably wasn't even clever at the time for something called the pregnant man which came true with arnold schwarzenegger's dumb movie junior there is a commercial spoof that probably wasn't even clever at the time for something featuring sammy davis jr and jackie onasis called celebrity wrestling which has now come true with a popular show called celebrity boxing there is a mock movie trailer that probably wasn't even clever at the time that features john candy in a movie about a severed head watch this trailer and look how similar it's shots and plot are to frank hellenlotter's basket case and finally there is an ad for a late late show documentary about a dead dream the only two left the name of the documentary is the last hippies lol br br four prophecies come true
<START> one of the most definitive gangster films of the 80's scarface is very much a film of its time the first thing you notice when you watch this film is that it is screaming at you 'made in 1983' the costumes the music score and soundtrack the hairstyles make no mistake about it this is a film all about crime in the 80's and while it should have dated horribly it hasn't this is still a superb film while georgio moroder's music has dated a fair bit it still compliments the story of tony montana well thanks to the superb screenplay by oliver stone and the first class direction of brian de palma one of two films that he has made with pacino the other being the fantastic carlito's way all of de palma's trademarks are here the strong language the graphic violence more on that later the stylish excesses such as grandiose set pieces and of course the stylish camera work br br pacino dominates the film and i mean that literally he is the dominant star of this film his performance over the top this is one of those films were pacino doesn't so much say his lines as he does shouts them this time with a superb cuban accent however this is pacino and he does it fantastically only he could go this far over the top and still come away from the film with his acting integrity in tact while some may complain about his shouting of his lines and the sheer excess of it all this is an excessive film take a look at the production design of tony's house take a look at the violence in this film the chainsaw incident is downright brutal and their is blood everywhere the shoot out at the end has bodies going down at a rate that is more akin to schwarzenegger and stallone in the rambo films take a look at the amount of coke that is displayed in the film so pacino's performance i suppose is perfect for the film he is supported by actors who are more akin to saying their lines in a more controlled way steven bauer in particularly as manny tony's best friend is the stand out of the supporting cast his performance is so controlled and quiet in a de niro sort of way it is a wonder how he ended up doing straight to video soft porn michelle pfeiffer of course adds the glamor robert loggia adds gravitas as usual and mary elizabeth mastrantonio makes a great debut as tony's sister br br of course this is more than just a film about excess there is more to it than drugs violence chainsaw assaults and a big great shoot out this is a film about the darker side of the american dream in many ways it puts it on a thematic par with the godfather films tony finds himself coming to america getting it all living the american dream and then losing it all in violent fashion and by saying he loses it all i mean he loses it all he kills his best friend his sister is killed his empire crumbles literally around him and to top it of he is killed in his own mansion bullets ripping through him br br without doubt scarface is one of the key films of the early 80's sure it doesn't have the subtleties of the godfather films but this is still a fine film and one that is worth going to again and again
<START> this movie is not as good as all the movies of christ i've ever seen and i'm quite amazed that in this story pilate wants to finish jesus when the scriptures as well the other movies state differently it lacks also a very important issue the resurrection none of the other movies skip this very important part the faith of all of us christians lies in this very event as paul says in one of his letters if christ did not rise from the dead our faith is vain a very impressive scene for me in this movie was seeing on the streets the remains of the palms that were used when jesus entered jerusalem br br finally and in opposition to my jewish co commentator jesus was not a myth and as a matter of fact he was also a jew there are plenty of documents relgious and secular that prove the existence of this extraordinary man or should i said god become a man that indeed changed mankind i strongly advise him given he is a historian to read about flavius josephus the most brilliant jewish commentator of the 1st century
<START> ok basically this is a popcorn sci fi movie but from the outset its obvious that it has been directed with a great deal of intelligence you can count about 10 clichÃ©s that the film is building up to but it only delivers on about three of them and a couple of them have a twist to them that lets you know once again that the director hasn't assumed that you are an idiot kurt russell's acting is truely superb and brings a depth from the character that is suprising and rewarding recommended if you've just seen something really stupid and want to rebuild your faith
<START> dreck about three beautiful women in california who go to cover some festival or something all the hotels are booked so they have to spend the night in a creepy old house what they don't know is that there is a creepy inhabitant there who likes to kill br br yawn boring pointless utterly stupid horror film bach and her two buddies are certainly beautiful but the movie itself is dull dull dull bach and her friends are no actresses their faces are blank all the way through the final revelation is laughably predictable and there's no blood or gore to keep you interested along the way there is some expected gratuitous female nudity but that's not enough to save this boring pointless and unknown for good reason a 1 all the way
<START> anyone who loves the rheostatics' music is going to enjoy this film i have some minor complaints mainly about pacing and the casting of certain actors not maury who aren't really convincing in their roles but i don't have time write a detailed review i just want to warn anyone who has seen this film or plans to watch this film as presented cbc television in canada the version that airs are the cbc is like the reader's digest version of whale music don't watch it it cuts out entire scenes and subplots if you can them that from the film the cbc which presents most of films untouched took half the guts out of whale music i don't know why it's horrible what they did to the film rent the video or watch it in a theatre but don't watch it on cbc television
<START> time spent watching this film was time wasted i do not dislike science fiction i do not reject any genre per se since good work can be done in any genre this film however is not good work i cannot fault the visuals when not involving alien makeups and the special effects are impressive the story was not out and out bad for a trekkish comic book but the fx visuals were obviously where all the makers' interest attention money went the direction alternated between sluggish and confusing one was not at all sure exactly who was doing what and with what and to whom at at least one crucial juncture the acting was mostly very bad indeed there was no basis to most of the line readings besides a hint of it was that way on the page and the director told me i was supposed to be mad sad scared whatever okay so it was a sf series pilot since when is that an excuse for correctable shoddiness in areas when should be regarded as essential to a dramatic medium i'm astonished the pilot sold the series or is the money also in the hands of technerds
<START> michael callan plays a smarmy photographer who seems nonetheless to be regarded as a perfect catch by any woman that runs across him could this have anything to do with the fact that he also co produced the film he's a hero whom it's very difficult to empathize with so the movie is in trouble right from the start however it's troubles don't end there it has the production values of a tv movie check out that head made of clay or something near the end and the ending cheats in a way that i can't reveal in case anyone wants to see the movie highly unlikely let's just say that the killer knows more than we were let to know he knows 1 2
<START> the first mystery is to guess what welles' original film was like that makes this a real adventure to see an incomplete skeleton and using cinematic forensics imagine the beautiful woman it once supported br br if you do you will both see and experience perhaps one of the best film mysteries ever as mysteries go the narrative is rather ordinary a simple diversion one jealous husband as red herring br br what's rather miraculous is welles' placement of the story in an artificial eye seeing a dark dark multifaceted world the first real noir but even darker it's not an obviously twisted world unless you think about the camera what we can see firsthand is someone creating a vocabulary that would later become common br br for all the celebration kane was a success because of the great drama and story the camera's eye was shocking but experimental welles would go from there to explore the mystery narrative and the self reference of shakespeare with this eye othello and macbeth are both begun in this period and i consider them part of a single vision with this br br the noir feel here hinges on the notion that people are not in charge of their lives even a little they are manipulated by random factors in the environment so in telling this story welles has to make the environment into a character several characters as suspects in the mystery br br thus we have the famous lighting blocking and angles we know and have since seen countless times and we have the deliberately closed sets the park yacht picnic area aquarium dock courtroom chinese theater and funhouse i am certain that what was cut by the barbarians was lots and lots of 'external' narrative dealing not with character but with these strange environments br br my own solution to the mystery is that the funhouse did it among the other character environments introduced as suspects in other words the manipulation of black irish who we know from notes and one scene typing at the union hall was an aspiring novelist was neither a force of human conspiracy the park or the civilized version the courtroom nor of nature the picnic or the civilized version the aquarium br br instead it was a matter of deliberate caprice by the gods for amusement this is of course a self reference to what welles is doing putting these people including himself through hell for our own caprice a matter underscored by the peking opera set with welles doped up and of course leading to the funhouse where the environment directly tinkers with perception br br more about the self reference surely there is conscious comment on his relationship with his soon to be exwife but i believe there is strong subconscious comment on his own taunting the environment in which he worked the studio environment surely welles was as much screwed with and in much the same way as his character and that screwing took the form of the murder of this film leaving the rotting corpse mentioned at the beginning of this comment br br that poor rita comes from china ties up the whole thing the chinese theater the expected rape from above the loss of the woman the investment in environment beyond all
<START> this was an absolutely spellbinding series and was sorry that i was only able to catch a few shows way back when it aired late night in the uk the style of it was so different from others of its kind and the whole thing had an unnerving air of stylish dread to it all you have to do is read all the positive comments not a single negative that i can see to realise what a really innovative series this was and how it caught at the imagination i now understand from reading the comments it got cancelled that's just so unbelievable what a bunch of 'headless overpaid suited turkeys' there must have been or just maybe still are running around to do that
<START> the nutcracker has always been a somewhat problematic ballet it bears little resemblance to eta hoffman's original story on which it is based br br in the ballet the story is essentially over by the second half when clara or marie in this version travels to the kingdom of sweets to watch a series of character dances br br there's an infinite variety of stage productions that re interpret the story in myriad ways not always successfully to compensate for the ballet's weak libretto br br balanchine's version doesn't really have any sense of drama or story at all despite the fact that there is plenty of drama and mystery in tchaikovsky's wonderful first act music the result is a completely forgettable first half christmas party where hardly anything happens and where even the dancing the little that there is of it isn't particularly memorable br br the pantomime over acting particularly of drosselmeier which might look passable on the stage just looks silly filmed for the big screen br br unfortunately things aren't much better when we get to the kingdom of sweets act ii in the stage version although there are a few choreographic highlights most of the choreography is bland and uninspiring this certainly isn't vintage balanchine br br balanchine is widely regarded as a master of abstract dance but i have always felt he was less successful as a creator of narrative ballets watching this film version of his stage production of the nutcracker has only re affirmed this view
<START> this film was abysmal and not in the good way as some have claimed first off the main character is a very unattractive gingerman second wtf is going on with this van love the plot basically is boy wants sex so buys a van which in fairness is quite cool unbelievably given that he looks like a newt he scores with lots of chicks and he fails with some then he scores with a really hot chick and realises he loves this dowdy bird who played hard to get then he drag races with the hot chicks boyfriend and he tips his van at which point danny devito saves the day although he didn't need to because in tipping the van the ginger kid crossed the line first i gave this 2 's as i'm willing to assume that there's some sort of 70's vanning subculture i'm not getting and also because there's some 70's boobage too
<START> i have seen it i like it melissa plays her part well it was actually believable my brother in law saw it with my sister i and when i mentioned to my sister that i forgot it was based on a true story i had seen it a few years ago he said just because its on lifetime you think its true both my sister i were like it was so anyway i was wondering if anyone knew what murder it was or like who was really involved was because i want to prove it to him i love lifetime movies especially the ones that are true or just the ones that teach a good lesson i thought i saw something about it a week ago but i cant remember where any help would be appreciated
<START> the forest isn't just your everyday standard slasher backwoods cannibal fare it also has an interesting mix of supernatural elements as well the story is about two couples that hike into the forest on a camping trip a cave dwelling cannibalistic woodsmen and the ghosts of his dead wife and two children soon terrorize them there is something you don't see every slasher director don jones gets an a for effort although the film itself falls flat on just about every level the acting is just simply average except for jeanette kelly who plays the dead wife of the woodsman michael brody aka gary kent br br the film opens with some beautiful shots of a couple hiking through a valley and into a forest they realize too late that someone is stalking them they are both dispatched in typical slasher fare our killer uses a trusty hunting knife throughout the entire film except during a flashback when he implements a handsaw pitchfork and rusty saw blade to dispatch his cheating wife's lover br br the forest has a good story line but the movie just doesn't work along with it i found it pretty boring with simply crappy acting 4 10
<START> the characters were alive and interesting the plot was excellently paced the pyro effects were masterfully accomplished and it takes a basic love triangle story and tosses in a science fiction element into it i could identify with many of the characters and their motivations made logical rational sense in the framework of the story br br the camera work was great the audio clear and accurate the background music perfectly chosen for effect the singing firemen a nice talented memorable oddity the sets brilliantly crafted and the special effects performed with a skilled talent br br i am a tad puzzled how an entire mini carnival in a chain store's parking lot could be powered by one single lamppost outlet that seems impossible to say the least the fight between the brothers near the end of the movie was brilliant though having jim varney in a non clown role was a wonderful touch too as played the semi serious role of a carny very well
<START> a laurel hardy comedy short the boys arrive to sweep the chimneys at the home of professor noodle a mad scientist who's just perfected his rejuvenation serum stan ollie proceed with their dirty work spreading destruction inside the house and on the roof then the professor wants to try out his new potion br br a very funny little film the ending is a bit abrupt but much of the slapstick leading up to it is terrific especially good is stan ollie's contest of wills at opposite ends of the chimney that's lucien littlefield as the professor
<START> i can sit through this movie once but i doubt i could make it through a second time mildly entertaining mainly for the physical presence of lindsay lohan the fun of matt dillon think something about mary and the re emergence of a more serious acting micheal keaton this is not the fun romp the love bug was but it is watchable one of my main detractions from the movie was the fact that herbie had evolved into r2d2 antics for the most part i was bored with the headlight eyes effects about the second time of the 30 or so times they were used and the bending front fender caused the same reaction from me go see this with your little ones i e the single digit bracket kids and don't expect a lot from this film br br x
<START> there's some very clever humour in this film which is both a parody of and a tribute to actors however after a while it just seems an exercise in style notwithstanding great gags such as balasko continuing the part of dussolier and very good acting by all involved and i was wondering why blier made this film all is revealed in the ending when blier directing claude brasseur gets a phone call from his dad bernard blier from heaven and gets the chance to say how much he misses him an effective emotional capper and obviously heartfelt but there isn't really sufficient dramatic tension or emotional involvement to keep the rest of the film interesting throughout it's entire running time some really nice scenes and sequences however and anyone who likes these 'mosntres sacrÃ©s' of the french cinema should get a fair amount of enjoyment out of this film
<START> daphne zuniga is the only light that shines in this sleepy slasher and the light fades quickly if not her than what other reason to watch this five college kids are signed up to prepare an old dorm for its due date of demolition problems are automatically occurring when a weird homeless man is soliciting and the group are short a few people then a killer is on the loose i honestly wanted to say i was going to enjoy this one it had a fair set up or maybe that was just daphne zuniga in it the film is too slow and almost as silent as a library most of the acting is below average and the point of view moments are so old news acclaimed composer christopher young of such films as hellraiser and entrapment scored this in a repetitive cue line that was better made for a tv movie still it seems higher than the movie deserves so other than young and zuniga this one scrapes the bottom of the barrel
