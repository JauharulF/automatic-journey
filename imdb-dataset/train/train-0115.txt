<START> the exclamation point in the title is appropriate albeit an understatement this movie doesn't just cry it shrieks loud enough to shatter glass br br filmmakers andrew and virginia stone made shrill humorless suspense thrillers that strove for a semi documentary feel here they shot on actual new york locations with tinny real life acoustics to jack up the verisimilitude but the naturalism of the sound recording only serves to amplify the stones' maladroit dialog and the mouth frothing histrionics of tortured butterfly inger stevens br br in a performance completely devoid of modulation stevens plays the wife of electronics whiz james mason looking haggard and bored both are held captive by extortionist rod steiger looking bloated and bored and his slimy cohorts in a scheme to blackmail an airline with a deadly bomb that mason has unwittingly helped construct br br here is another credibility straining instance of a criminal mastermind so brilliantly attentive to every detail yet knuckleheaded enough to hire a drug addicted degenerate as an underling the stones' idea of nail biting tension is to trap the hysterical stevens alone with benzedrine popping rapist neville brand filling the frame with his sweaty drooling kisser but the camera work is so leaden and brand so uncharacteristically demure that the effect is hardly lurid much less suspenseful the stones a square pair at heart don't even have the courage of their own lack of convictions br br the film which ends with the portly steiger chasing the fleet footed stevens on a subway train track is as clumsy as its ungainly heavy with angie dickinson as steiger's amoral girlfriend jack klugman kenneth tobey and barney philips
<START> the minute i started watching this i realised that i was watching a quality production so i was not surprised to find that the screenplay was written by andrew davis and was produced by sue birtwhistle both of these brought us the excellent 1995 production of pride and prejudice so my only gripe here is that emma did not run to 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes like pride and prejudice the acting was superb with i think prunella scales excellent as miss bates but i loved kate beckinsale and mark strong just as much the language is a delight to listen to can you imagine in this day and age having a right go at someone without actually uttering a swear word samantha morton was excellent as miss smith in fact the casting was spot on much as it was with pride and prejudice i liked it so much that i watched it twice in two days so once again thank you bbc for another quality piece of television i have seen the paltrow version and it is okay but i do think the bbc version is far superior an excellent production that i am very happy to own on dvd
<START> br br i am a big time horror sci fi fan regardless of budget but after watching countless horror movies late night on cable and video this has to be the worst of all movies with bloody special effects what looked like a roast covered in fake blood or ketchup that kept being shown over and over again and people running around screaming from left then to right then back again it should have stayed with the beginning convenience store scene and stopped there and been 15 minutes instead it is dragged out very long it is very very x5 low budget many scenes were way way too long narrator sounded very amateurish like a random person out of junior high was talking this is the only movie to rate lower in my opinion than manos red zone cuba benji and godzilla vs megalon despite their higher budgets 10 snoozes try to stay awake through whole movie in one setting or better yet avoid it like you would an undead brain eating mob the why did i ever see this piece of zombie dung blues epitome of nauseatingly bad made movies etc ad infinitum infinity 10
<START> i hadn't laughed this hard for a movie in a really long time the garbage that hollywood has been putting out lately drives me up a wall this one was definetely fresh and witty if you look at the demographic figures for the ratings only a few women have voted i don't want to ruin the movie for you but i'm sure that every guy who saw this ran to their computers to rate it and gave it a poor score why because the movie puts men in their place that's why if more women vote for this movie because of its actual humor value and not because it is damaging to men it could easily be a 7 rated movie
<START> can i please say first of all that i felt so strongly about this movie that i signed up to imdb specifically to review it and my review this is easily the worst movie i have ever seen br br the synopsis of the movie sounded interesting nazis occult time travel etc but the movies plot failed to properly bring all these elements together remember the episode of south park that featured manatees writing family guy using 'idea balls' did these manatees also write unholy its like the writer wanted to include all these different ideas but had no idea how to link them all together and then to make things make even less sense included a donnie darko esquire time travel theme to the ending messing up the chronology br br i could tell from early on that this was a bad movie special effects were too low budget for anything better than straight to dvd the acting wasn't great but in fairness i've seen worse i will praise the nazi paintings they were creepy but the evil nazi butcher guy was just comic br br i don't have a vendetta against this movie or anything but to be honest i'm not even into the horror genre but this movie cannot be described as a thriller or a drama if this story had been well told this would have been a good movie but it has been over hyped waaaaay over hyped
<START> extremely dull drama starring a very young roddy mcdowall who trains a wild horse the flicka of the title and is the only reason for watching the movie in the first place coated in blaring overbearing music and weighed down by schmaltzy dialogue this is one of those interminable films that bores you to the point of a gnawing headache the naffly titled sequel 'thunderhead son of flicka' in which mcdowall trains the next generation of nag is marginally better than the original but the pace remains slow and the score continues to pummel you into submission although there are at least one or two scenes that don't induce a coma
<START> it seems that the people behind envy realised that recent comedies especially ones involving ben stiller and to a lesser degree jack black have been situation spoofs which have steadily declined in originality and generally laughs i found the sheer absurdity of zoolander utterly hilarious when it was released starsky and hutch was also enjoyable and then dodgeball kept the laughs going for a lot of people although personally i was a bit tired of the over the top characters especially when the scenario wasn't quite so funny perhaps the comedy of a dodgeball tournament doesn't quite translate to australia where it's rarely played so in an attempt to do something a little more original envy moves away from an absurd scenario and instead revolves around the absurd creation of jack black's character i won't spoil what it is for those who intend to see the movie the problem is that the movie seems to drag i'm not a big enough movie buff to be able to think of examples but it seems like this set up has been done a thousand times before and very rarely successfully so instead of a nice crisp enjoyable and fresh comedy you get a film that seems to just go through the motions sure the motions can be quite amusing and they're centred on an idea that is quirky enough to provide a few laughs especially with jack black playing the excited and amusing though a bit 2d creator ben stiller on the other hand seems a bit lost he's asked to play a fuller role than the ridiculous characters of his zoolander breed of movies but he struggles as a family man whether his fault or the scripts there isn't enough depth to the character and the result is a movie of ben stiller doing those typical mannerisms and generally becoming tedious the performance doesn't leave an imprint on the viewer he's just ben stiller jack black manages to actually portray a character though not a challenging one the last annoying element of the movie is christopher walken's role as 'the j man' which is about as typical and two dimensional as characters come and naturally he becomes monotonous and frustrating very quickly br br it's really not as unbearable as some people would have you think it's watchable especially if you're in the right mood feeling silly would be a good prerequisite for seeing this film hire it on a movie night with friends and watch it after you've watched a scary film and feel like something light hopefully you'll also be somewhat tipsy by then too in that scenario i can imagine it would be quite enjoyable but generally it provides too few laughs to carry itself and most of the time just drags along
<START> beautifully done a lot of angst friendship may not endure all but in the end it's all that matters or so a group of friends learn i have watched it over and over again the music is also amazing when kei loses the one friend he has he gives up until he meets sho an orphan boy who is not repelled by his true nature in the lawless streets of mallepa they struggle for their own place among a melting pot of asian races and learn that sometimes being on top can cost you more than you are ever ready to pay a surprise ending that grips as much as the whole movie does i couldn't get enough of it gackt and hyde do a wonderful job of acting proving they are more than pretty boys who sing
<START> the movie held my interest mainly because dianne keaton is my favorite actress i disagree with some of the other posts on the grounds that the plot was not convoluted i had no trouble following it maybe some people had too much eggnog the night before the movie was very sad and touching as well what more do you want alexa davalos is a fine new talent beautiful too and tom everett scott does an excellent job with his part as well the relationship of the mother and daughter may have been a bit unrealistic but the behavior of the young people in the movie was not it was tragically sad but enlightening it sure beat the other shows that were on tv new years day evening
<START> after realizing what is going on around us in the news in our homes the whole new world i remembered this show and how obsessed i was watching it every week in my town br br i started looking for this series 3 days ago didn t have luck till this moment and i was shocked when i read about it and about cbs br br people i believe they stopped the show because it's talking about something way ahead of our understanding of the new world it was trying to deliver a hidden message about something terrifying br br the people who stopped it are the same who are controlling the world now i remember in one of the episodes it was talking about the one dollar and the pyramid with the one eye
<START> although lang's version is more famous borzage's work is not devoid of interest far from it its celestial sequences are even better the metaphor of the train perhaps borrowed from the ending of abel gance's la roue is eventually more convincing than the up above heavenly world br br borzage's tenderness for his characters shows in marie's character and love beyond the grave is one of his favorite subjects the ending of three comrades the amusement park seems to be everywhere we see it even when we are in marie's poor house i do not think that the sets are that much cheesy they are stylized to a fault the fair from a distance almost gives a sci fi feel to the movie br br borzage never forgets his social concerns in the heavenly train going up the rich cannot stand to be mixed up with the riffraff but as chief magistrate tells here there's no more difference br br not a major work for borzage neither is lang's version but to seek out if you are interested in the great director's career
<START> i am a back batman movie and tv fan i loved the show new and old and i loved all the movies but this movie is not as great as some people were hopeing it to be in my opinon it is a big let down i think the problem was it had no drama batman mask of the phantasm and batman beyond return of the joker had a lot of drama and batman mr freeze sub zero had some drama too also i think this movie is to light for batman the only scene that seems a little dark is the big fight with bane at the end anyways it's an ok batman movie but i would just rent it
<START> stella starring bette midler in the title role is an unabashed tearjerker set in upstate new york stella claire works nights as a bar maid pouring and dancing in a workingman's saloon one night in comes a slumming medical intern stephen dallas who woos stella and in the course of their affair impregnates her she spurns both his offers of marriage and abortion sends him packing to a lucrative medical career and raises her daughter herself in near poverty flash forward 16 years and the daughter has grown into a gorgeous loving young lady dr dallas is not out of the picture still maintaining a tenuous but caring relationship with his daughter andÂ i'm rambling and worse yet making the movie sound somewhat interesting the acting and screenwriting are so over the top you'll let out a groan in almost every scene the chief offender is bette midler but close behind is john goodman as her alcoholic buddy each scene seems more contrived than the preceding right up to the finale which is truly a hoot taken as a dramatic piece this film rates no more than grade d but as camp it scores an unintended b br br
<START> this movie is not schlock despite the lo fi production and its link to troma productions a dark fable for adults exploitation is a theme of sugar cookies and one wonders if the cast has not fallen prey to said theme a weird movie with enticing visuals shadows and contrast are prominent definitely worth a look especially from fans of warhol and stylish decadence through all the cruelty and wickedness a moral albeit twisted can be gleamed
<START> i am not a big fan of rajnikant in the first place but baba was a huge disappointment in between an awful storyline the action and songs were only mediocre the storyline becomes very preachy instead of running for office like ntr or mgr rajni almost appeared to be running as tamil nadu's next big guru my wife tells me that since this film came out rajni swore off doing any more movies br br we were lucky initially to have bought babu an oldie by sivajiganeshan online by accident when trying to buy this one that was a great film which made up for having bought this dud except it makes baba look even worse by comparison br br bryan
<START> wow i can't believe i waited so long to see this film i just never got around to watching it the plot has nothing that interests me i know nothing about soccer football i am one of those american fools that has no clue i had never even seen david beckham before this film i chose to ignore the buzz surrounding this film at the time it was released in america enough about me br br truth be told it was a mistake to ignore this little piece of movie making heaven what a fun film it's full of color and exuberance i had a goofy grin on my face through the whole movie parminder nagra is so sweet and lovable you can't help but root for her no wonder why the american television show e r has snatched her up i have a new appreciation for indian culture those people know how to have a good time the wedding scenes are dazzlingly beautiful br br the only problem i had was deciphering some of the british slang and dialogue through the accents i turned on the english subtitles to make sure i didn't miss anything this is not a criticism of the film i'm sure audiences worldwide have trouble understanding the constantly changing slang in american films as well br br this is a perfect date film it has a great sports plot like rocky and a strong sense of feminism that is empowering for women i watched it with my wife and sixteen year old niece and we all loved it i highly recommend it
<START> a 1957 yes that's the correct date j arthur rank production with james robertson justice margaret rutherford wilfred hyde white it has to be a smash comedy right oh it's just awful it's a one gag film watching people be shocked at the sight of a little alligator music is thrown in most inappropriately and forgettably jeannie carson is a lively dancer and competent singer but what was she doing in this film diana dors is here too providing oh so daring shots for use in the previews her acting level is not bad but she's in the film to provide someone to leer at well one must do something beside groan during this film the movie is being sold on vhs now by people on e bay spare yourself the expense and the waste of time a comedy without a laugh a musical without a memorable song or dance
<START> this is the ultimate one man show in which eddie murphy is at his very best just forget the nutty professor and the distinguished gentlemen this is the real eddie murphy his imitations of mr t pretending he is gay michael jackson and other artists are killers i think it's also quite daring to make fun of artists who where really popular in that time my favorite act is the one where he is at his annual bbq with the family and plays his drunken dad and aunt bunny who falls from the stairs br br this show is the best medicine when you feel down if you watch the sequel 'raw' don't be disappointed it's quite good too but doesn't match 'delirious'
<START> an insomniac's nightmare is the story of a man's plunge into insanity having chronic insomnia jack is plagued by hallucinations causing him to try and determine what is real and what isn't br br we find out interesting things about jack near the end and think that by the time the movie is over we will have a happily ever after hollywood ending wrong this is new york city the place where nobody sleeps br br tess nanavati writer and director has herself a good film in 'an insomniac's nightmare' a talented filmmaker and writer she made this film right after her high school graduation she has real potential and will be one to watch in the upcoming future br br as i watched this short film i was constantly uncomfortable between the music bleak scenery and realistic portrayal of an insomniac by dominic monaghan as jack i desperately wanted to turn this off at times just to escape from it
<START> carla works for a property developer's where she excels in being unattractive unappreciated and desperate she is also deaf br br her boss offers to hire in somebody to alleviate her heavy workload so she uses the opportunity to secure herself some male company help arrives in the form of paul a tattooed hoodlum fresh out of prison and clearly unsuited to the mannered routine of an office environment br br an implicit sexual tension develops between the two of them and carla is determined to keep him on despite his reluctance to embrace the working week when carla is edged out of an important contract she was negotiating by a slimy colleague she exploits paul's criminality by having him steal the contract back the colleague quickly realises that she's behind the robbery but when he confronts her paul's readiness to punch people in the face comes in handy too but this thuggery comes at a price br br paul is given a 'going over' by some mob acquaintances as a reminder about an unpaid debt he formulates a plan which utilises carla's unique lip reading abilities to rip off a gang of violent bank robbers it's now carla's turn to enter a frightening new world br br the fourth feature from director jacques audiard 'read my lips' begins as a thoroughly engaging romantic drama between two marginalised losers only to shift gears halfway through into an edgy thriller where their symbiotic shortcomings turn them into winners the leads are excellent effortlessly convincing us that this odd couple could really connect carla's first meeting with paul is an enjoyable farce in which she attempts to circumnavigate his surly reticence and jailbird manners only to discover that he was until very recently a jailbird emmanuelle devos who plays carla has that almost exclusive ability to go from dowdy to gorgeous and back again within a frame vincent cassel plays paul as a cornered dog who only really seems at home when he's receiving a beating or concocting the rip off that is likely to get him killed br br like many french films 'read my lips' appears at first to be about nothing in particular until you scratch beneath the surface and find that it's probably about everything the only bum note is a subplot concerning the missing wife of paul's parole officer a device that seems contrived only to help steer the main thrust of the story into a neat little feelgood cul de sac br br it was the french 'new wave' of the 60's that first introduced the concept of 'genre' to film making and i've always felt that any medium is somewhat compromised when you have to use a system of labels to help define it so it's always a pleasure to discover a film that seems to transcend genre or better still defy it
