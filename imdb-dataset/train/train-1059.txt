<START> i tried to watch this movie three separate times the night i rented it got through about 20 minutes hoping it would be better if i had a night's rest watched 15 more the next day almost vomited at how stupid it was it wasn't even funny stupid which is sometimes a fun movie to watch but this movie was just crap with a capital s if you know what i mean in the censored world we live in and finally on the third day i watched over an hour of the dumb thing and i didn't enjoy one single moment not even one how did this script get greenlighted oh boy br br g br br 1 10 the one is for cheerleaders they deserve at least something for all their hardwork
<START> this rubbish excuse for television is the single most god awful piece of trash ever to hit australian television the house mates are dull uninteresting ridiculously unintelligent and are picked on the basis that you would be likely to attempt to murder them if you had to live with them as far as i am concerned big brother is the decline of western society showing how us as a society are on a steep slope to becoming brain dead morons whatever happened to television that didn't target the lowest common denominator of society as an audience this cannot be classified as entertainment i think that it true that channel ten can remove your soul it happened to rove mcmanus who was once a respectable comedian and once moving to channel 10 become horribly unfunny with the exception of the simpsons which is highly intelligently made
<START> watched this with my girlfriend after stumbling over it while zaping channels br br i guess we both hoped for some kind of happy family cute christmas movie but were extremely disappointed br br the actor playing the soldier seems to have 0 emotion whatsoever his face looks the same whether he's chopping down christmas tree's seeing the girl he loves being kissed by her boyfriend or when he's happily surprised by the girl he loves he's an awful actor and at no pont did any of us do nothing but laugh at him br br then there's the cute blond girl blessed with the ability to count dot's and cheat on her boyfriend what a catch and her ambition in life is to live with her parents and count more dots br br so it's basically a story about a guy without any emotion or feelings who falls for a guy who count dots and cheats on her boyfriend it's as predictable as it get's and really a waste of time you gain nothing by watching this other than some weird laughs because it's all so corny br br i love it when her dad says that he only eats french fries and not french wine and they all laugh that's the hillbilly attitude this movie is about furthermore if my girlfriends dad were bossing me around like i'd tell him a thing or to but not our army veteran no sir he let's everyone boss him around br br the movie is what first blood would have been if john rambo were burn like the biggest wimp in the world
<START> i really wanted to like this movie but it never gave me a chance it's basically meant to be spinal tap with a hip hop theme but it fails miserably it consistently feels like it was written and acted by high school kids for some school project and that's also the level the humor seems to be aimed at there is no subtlety and more damningly for a mockumentary it never once feels like a documentary and while the lines aren't funny in the first place an attempt at dead pan delivery would have helped certainly anything would be better than the shrill overacting we are subjected to br br i'd recommend this to people who like comedies in the vein of big momma's house or norbit people who think that words like butt are inherently hysterically funny other people should stay away and not waste their time
<START> here's how you do it believe in god and repent for your sins then things should turn around within the next day or so br br until the last fifteen minutes this movie just plays as a bad recap of a drunk's crappy life his mom dies his stepmom's a b tch his dad dies he drinks he gets married he has kids he drinks some more his wife gets mad he disappoints his kids the wife threatens to leave he calls up a reverend late night b c he wants to kill himself then after the recap happens that's when we get the left behind like subtle message br br he needed a paycheck this is the phrase i had to repeat over and over once credits started to roll so i wouldn't lose my respect for madsen br br madsen drops to his knees and begs christ's forgiveness once he does he walks outside and actually says that he sees the world in a different way he tells his wife that he's found god and that's good enough for her flip scene four months and the wife is tired of going to church end the movie as madsen walks by the bar and gives a soliloquy about how happy he is with christ and without alcohol final moment he gives a little dismissive wave to the bar i e sin house and give a gay miami vice after school special congratulatory jump in the air as the camera freeze frames see why i had to repeat the phrase he needed a paycheck br br man this movie is bad the b grade 80's production values don't help much the script could have easily been a touched by an angel episode it could have been knocked out in 30 minutes plus commercials the acting is wooden and never believable even madsen of whom i'm a big fan and is the sole reason i sat through this makes it clear that this is his first acting job and he doesn't know his a from his elbow yet on camera 45 minutes into it i started to get discouraged this thing was like homework i just wanted to put it away and say that alright i saw half of it that's good enough but no if i sat through cheerleader ninjas i could sit throughout this br br the only reason i'm not giving this thing a 1 is for two points 1 i love madsen i know it's not fair but it's great seeing the opening title introducing michael madsen sue me 2 some of the dialogue is so bad that it's classic i'll stick some quotes at the end of this so you can enjoy them too br br that's about it to wrap it up this thing is a piece of crap that should stay flushed with the rest of the turds but hey look michael madsen see also tilt executive target my boss's daughter etc now i've gotta rewatch reservoir dogs and watch madsen torture a cop to get my respect back for him see ya kids br br this stuff's gonna make me go blind but i'm gonna drink it anyway madsen's first taste of cheap alcohol br br i don't understand everything seems so beautiful madsen walking outside after confessing to god br br i'm going downtown later and pick up a bible and i'm gonna get a haircut too madsen after converting at the dinner table because satan lives in your hair
<START> despite the high ratings given to this film by imdb users this is nothing more than your typical girl with a bad childhood obsessively stalks married man film the attractive justine priestly's brief nude scenes may attract voyeurs but the film is hackneyed tripe br br 1 2 out of
<START> although twenty minutes of love is a harmless attempt at an early comedy it was difficult to follow and the film quality was not very good it does have a couple of moments that are funny but i have seen better by charlie chaplin
<START> there are very few performers today who can keep me captivated throughout an entire film just by their presence one of those few is judy davis who has built a successful career out of creating characters that are headstrong in attitude but very vulnerable at heart she takes roles that most other performers would treat melodramatically and adds a fiery deeply emotional intensity that pulls attention away from everything else on the screen br br her skills are well displayed in high tide a film that matches her up a second time with director gillian armstrong who gave davis her first major success with my brilliant career in that film davis played a young woman who was determined to make it in the world despite the suffocation she felt from her community and upbringing in high tide however davis' character lillie is roughly the opposite she gave up on any hope for her future when she was young and after giving birth to a child runs from her responsibilities and takes up a life without direction or meaning when she finally meets up with her daughter years later the thought of taking care of her child is petrifying she knows this is her chance to atone for her failures but how can she be honest with her daughter and still gain her respect br br gillian armstrong's films usually relate stories about characters who desperately want to communicate with each other but face obstacles set up by their own personal habits and addictions oscar and lucinda for instance was about a man and a woman who desperately needed each other's love but were always blindsided by their craving for chance represented by their gambling addictions here we are immersed in the world of a family torn apart by the mother's inability to commit to a settled life and her struggles to redeem herself despite being fully convinced that it's too late to change for the better this is not simply a film with a great performance at its center but also a rare achievement a fully convincing story of redemption
<START> i saw an advanced screening for this movie tonight i absolutely loved it the movie kept me on the edge of my seat all night cillian murphy is extremely creepy as the villain for those of you who have seen batman begins his character was much scarier in this film he played his character very well the scariest bad guy i have seen in awhile rachel mcadams was great everyone in the audience laughed gasped and cheered at the same time as if we were on cue the suspense is held through out the movie the amazing part is that the end was not anti climatic i was not disappointed in the end i felt satisfied the trailer does not do the movie justice the movie is much better than the trailer indicated do not wait for this movie to come out on video go see it although i did not have to pay to see this movie i would have gladly given 10 75 to see it enjoy
<START> since i'd seen the other three i figured i might as well catch this made for tv fourth part of the omen series as a stand alone film this movie is mediocre but as a sequel to the 1976 masterpiece it's a travesty the film goes along the same route that many series' go down when they're running out of ideas that being the idea of changing the male lead to a female it's always obvious that this film was made for television as the acting is very standard the plot lacks ideas and the gruesome murder scenes seen in the previous three are kept to a bloodless minimum the film does keep a thread with the original which i won't reveal as despite being obvious that revelation is one of the most interesting aspects of the movie the basics of the plot largely copy richard donner's original and see a young couple adopt a child which they name delia not damiella or damiana fortunately there's a big dog involved and a child minder and pretty soon the wife starts to suspect that the child may not quite be normal as she's menstruating at eight years old and never suffered from any illnesses br br the first two sequels to the omen weren't bad at all and the series really should have ended at number three i guess there was money involved somewhere down the line as there really is no artistic reason why this film should have been made it brings nothing to the table in terms of originality and the only thing it's likely to succeed in doing is annoying fans of the series the film looks and feels like a tv movie all the way through and for the most part plays out like a film about the troubled upbringing of a young girl indeed asia vieira does look like a little bitch but she never convinces that she's the antichrist as her stares are redundant and most of the 'evil' she does is laughable faye grant is given the meatiest role and doesn't impress while the rest of the cast regret agreeing to star in such an awful waste of time the only good thing about this movie is the theme tune which of course has been ripped off from the original and is overused on the whole this film really isn't worth seeing as it delivers nothing that the series is famous for and doesn't even do justice to weaker second sequel
<START> i find it rather useless to comment on this movie for the simplest reason that it has nothing to comment upon it's similar to a rotten egg which has nothing good to show to the world excerpt for the fact that it is rotten as other endless number of eggs have been before it but since a comment is mandatory for such a grandiose insignificance br br filth is definitely the proper word to describe this movie created in the same manner as any other romanian movie directed by lucian pintilie who insists to depict the so called romanian reality following the communist era 1990 to present days br br under no circumstances recommended for people outside romania as for the others who lately find amateurish camera lack of plot lack of directorial actors's quality etc noise etc as being trendy and even art like watch enjoy this movie as i know you will but do the other well intentioned imdb members a favor don't write an online review for it will misguide irritate and in the end waste their time br br on the other hand this movie among others has some value whatsoever an educational one for it sets the example for how not to make a movie
<START> a real disappointment from the great visual master ridley scott g i jane tells the story of a first female ever to go through the hellish training at the navy seals the training is the most difficult and hard in existence as the instructor says in the film to the lead character o'neil played by demi moore there is no particular message or point in this film or then i couldn't reach it properly it may be a some kind of a statement of female rights and abilities but it all sinks under the tired scenes and stupid gun fight at the end of the film br br i really can't understand why ridley uses so much zooms in that mentioned last gun battle at the desert it looks sooooo stupid and irritating and almost amateurish so i would really like to know what the director saw in that technique when i look at his latest film black hawk dawn there is absolutely nothing wrong in the battle scenes which are plenty and they are very intense and directed with skill the whole finale in g i jane looks ugly and is nothing more but stupid and brainless shooting and killing br br this is ridley scott's worst movie in my opinion and there are no significant touches from which this great director is known still i'm glad i saw this in widescreen format because there are still couple of great scenes and samples of scott's abilities but they are very few in this film br br a disappointment and nothing compared to the classics blade runner thelma louise alien and so on of this talented director so i'm forced to give g i jane 4 10
<START> i cried my heart out watching this movie i have never suffered from any eating disorder but i think this must be a very true picture br br alison lohman is excellent she expresses these feelings amazingly well my teenage years came back to me so vividly anyone who has gone through difficult times as a child or teenager will be able to relate to this movie i recommend you all to see it br br the music is great too i've now discovered diana lorden br br i'm also looking forward to seeing alison lohman in white olÃ©ander because i am positive she is perfectly suited for the role as agnes
<START> look although we don't like to admit it we've all have to suppress our fears concerning the extreme likelihood of experiencing the events that take place in this movie you know you get into your car and you immediately start thinking gosh i hope today isn't the day that my accelerator sticks at a comfortable cruising speed of 55 mph all four door latches break in the locked position both my main and emergency brake fail my ignition switch can't be turned off and i've got a full tank of gas all simultaneously fortunately for most of us our thorazine kicks in before we actually decide that it's a bad idea to be driving a car not so for the makers of the harrowing white knuckle edge of your seat if only in preparation to leave the room action juggernaut runaway car but they go ahead and drive anyway br br i am endlessly pleased to have found thanks to the imdb that this movie is real and that i didn't merely dream it br br this movie is at the very least one of the fantastic sights you will see on your journey to find the el dorado of very bad cinema br br i highly recommend it
<START> this was a very enjoyable film a humorous but poignant look at family and the obligations that come with it the story of a man who comes home from his life in the city to his fathers bath house in a small chinese village there he learns to appreciate even cherish the very things he left home to get away from the film is as visually beautiful as it is emotionally beautiful
<START> i first saw this back in the early 90s on uk tv i did like it then but i missed the chance to tape it many years passed but the film always stuck with me and i lost hope of seeing it tv again the main thing that stuck with me was the end the hole castle part really touched me its easy to watch has a great story great music the list goes on and on its ok me saying how good it is but everyone will take there own best bits away with them once they have seen it yes the animation is top notch and beautiful to watch it does show its age in a very few parts but that has now become part of it beauty i am so glad it has came out on dvd as it is one of my top 10 films of all time buy it or rent it just see it best viewing is at night alone with drink and food in reach so you don't have to stop the film br br enjoy
<START> although this was not without its faults this drama was a fitting one to be shown around easter time it reminded us of our spiritual selves and showed that behind our facades we often hide our deepest sufferings and experiences there was so much to enjoy in the drama not least the rapping teenagers who provided a better musical accompaniment to the drama than the rather poor sound score in the background the acting was excellent and timothy spall was once again superb the climax was very satisfying if rather simplistic timothy spall's letting go of his long dead wife's suicide was credible and mirrored well the feelings of despair that were present in the teenage girl who self harmed the resolution between the graffiti boy and the muslim was gratifying but less believable a wonderful drama which left myself and my husband felling that the evening had been well spent congratulations
<START> also known as stairway to heaven in the us during wwii british peter carter's david niven plane is shot down in combat but he survives he meets and falls in love with lovely june kim hunter but it seems a mistake was made in heaven he should have died a french spirit comes to get him but he refuses he is soon to plead his case in front of a heavenly tribunal that he should be allowed to live br br sounds ridiculous but this is actually an incredible film the script is good with the actors playing the roles completely straight faced and it's beautifully directed the scenes on earth are in breath taking technicolor i've never seen such beautiful blue skies and the scenes in heaven are in black and white niven is a little stiff at times but hunter is just great and very beautiful and roger livesey is superb as a doctor trying to help niven the imagery throughout is amazing especially the staircase and during the final trial sequence and the special effects are truly great considering the age of the film there's also a very strange sequence when niven runs into a totally nude young boy herding sheep this is an absolutely beautiful thought provoking film highly recommended this remains unknown in the us which is a shame
<START> gena rowlands plays an actress who loses her grip on reality when she witnesses the death of a fan of hers she becomes increasingly deluded from reality and as a result her emotional turmoil intrudes with her work as an actress in the sense that she breaks all the rules of acting and improvises everything yet still manages to engage her audience makes the film interesting if a bit self important as a parallel of cassavettes' own struggles as a filmmaker there's so many ideas thrown around and as result it becomes a bit muddled i'm still pondering the relation between the dead fan and rowlands among many other things but the way they're presented in their rawest form makes it a consistently interesting and thought provoking film would be great on a double bill with mulholland drive br br
<START> i liked this movie because it basically did more with less it could have been made more interesting if they had kept it confined to the studio even more though some of the plot elements would have been harder to develop br br the guy playing the dj did a good job of showing someone spooked out and haunted by his memories i also found his dialog with the callers pretty funny br br while parts of the movie you can see coming a mile away other parts you do not expect to turn out the way they did br br i thought it was a pretty minimal ghost story for the most part concentrating more on the living side of the equation the last 5 10 minutes were pretty well done as everything is being revealed br br while it was a shorter movie it felt to be just about the right amount of time to tell the story any more and it would have started to drag
