<START> when i saw previews of this movie i thought that it may be dumb but it will at least be funny well i was wrong even though somewhere deep down the producers had an interesting message to convey about parents being left alone and re evaluating their life the way they tried to deliver that message was horrible the first fifty times something silly happened to the couple was relatively funny but by the end i could almost predict what stupid mishap is going to happen next br br throughout the movie i like a total of maybe five lines of dialogue and everything else was at best mediocre which is still more than i can say for the movie itself
<START> after seeing a heavily censored version of this movie on television years ago i was curious to see the unedited version i was surprised that it was more believable and well acted than i remembered but one thing really stood out i think other reviewers have mentioned this also namely what exactly is the nature and motivation of the chris sarandon character has he raped other victims before is he completely psychotic or an average sociopath how did he expect to get away with his attack on the younger sister is this character at all credible or is it just a matter of more background being necessary he seems almost simultaneously to be an uncomfortably believable character and too crazy to actually be able to hold on to a teaching job that puts him in contact with young vulnerable girls this seems to to be the biggest complaint of viewers in general it has nothing to do with his performance which is terrifyingly convincing the movie occupies an uneasy position between sheer exploitation and a half way serious treatment of the subject without quite settling into either mode not the worst movie ever made but not all that good either
<START> this movie made me very angry i wanted desperately to throttle the scientists and unseen film makers during the course of it very very painful to sit through sophomoric and pretentious in the worst way the little good information on brain function chemistry and quantum theory is lost in a sea of new agey horse sh t the worst offenders were the crack pot charlatans ramtha and joseph dispenza mr dispenza informs us that most people lead lives of mediocrity and clearly implies that he on the other hand is living on a higher plane even the ideas and attitudes that i basically agree with are presented in such a heavy handed clumsy superior pretentious preachy manner that i felt the desire to disavow them i think that's what made me so angry the fact that they've taken what are indeed profound aspects of established scientific thought and marred them with their new age hokum much of it is based around the fallacy of applying concepts of quantum theory to the macro world fittingly the dramatized portions with marlee matlin are amateurish and clichÃ© ridden br br i would refer people instead to bill bryson's excellent survey of science a brief history of nearly everything there's plenty of profound wonder about life and the universe in the actual established science
<START> monstrous mother son duo alice krige and brian krause sucks life force of virgins and their newest target is pretty but lonely tanya madchen amick however these monsters are allergic to cat's scratches i have never been fan of sleazy overrated bestsellerists like king koontz or barker but this b movie written by mr dung himself is actually not near as bad than it could be yes it is sometimes jaw droppingly atrocious but there is actually some surprisingly impressive touches good old fashioned graveyard eerie soundtrack and candlelit gothic house scene mirror showing the monstrous form of the villains etc of course the film is polluted by mr dung's potty mouthed dialogue and all tactics of toilet seat obsession to vilify fat people leading to totally pointless subplot of rapist teacher but there is roses among manure
<START> this film may have been the biggest let down i've experienced in renting movies based on imdb reviews overall i simply found this to be a second rate movie br br leslie cheung is certainly passable as the antihero and ma wu handles his character with cheerful competence on the other hand ma wu's makeup facial hair is so obviously phony that i simply could not take him seriously he looked like an overweight teenager dressed up for halloween complete with the 4 95 stick on beard br br the special effects were so so though the undead in the cellar were pretty good the tree tongue looked like something from a bad 1950s monster flick though the pov shots from the tongue's view more closely resembled sam raimi's trademark shots in the more recent evil dead trilogy the pyrotechnics were ho hum and the final battle is about as dull as you can get in fact it most closely reminded me of the lost in space episode where the robinsons are caught in a sandstorm and br br the plot was not particularly original and has been told countless times in the form of european fairy tales there was no suspense and no plot twists in fact you know right away as you are introduced to the characters who is good who is bad and who is going to survive br br i just returned this film to netflix and then i sat down to write this review the very first thing i did was check the production date yep it says 1987 not the 1967 that i thought it might be and that pretty much sums it up the production values and fx are typical of the 1960s the plot and action seem much older as hollywood was actually producing some interesting and challenging films in the 60s br br out of
<START> cinderella is a film about a young girl whose mother passed away and her father remarried once her father died cinderella's stepmother became very mean to her and made her do all of the chores around the house like cleaning up after her two evil stepsisters one day the king sent out a message to all of the single women to attend the royal ball in honor of his son to find a wife of course cinderella didn't get to go but her stepsisters did cinderella was very upset and thought that there was no way she could attend the royal ball until her fairy godmother appeared so she did some magic and made cinderella into a beautiful woman but she had to be back by midnight because that is when the magic changes back while at the royal ball cinderella loses track of time and the clock strikes midnight so she runs out of the palace and loses her glass slipper then the king orders the duke to find the women who wore that slipper the duke searched every house but finally found the women who it belonged to cinderella br br clyde geronimi wilfred jackson and hamilton luske directed one of the best animated disney films in 1950 this film is about a magical fairytale in the beginning of the film cinderella was a servant to her own family and had nobody to love her but with a little bit of magic her whole life changed around and finally found love br br my favorite thing about cinderella is the music when cinderella's fairy godmother appeared doing her magic she sang the song bibbidi bobbidi boo when i was a child it was one of my favorite songs to sing around my house so i will never forget it i also loved the part when cinderella and the prince were singing the song so this is love while they were dancing because they realized that they are in love overall this film was my favorite film when i was a little child because every little girl wants to live a fairy tale life
<START> thelma ritter did steal the picture i just finished watching it again i couldn't help becoming emotional in her final scene she didn't get the oscar that's why you shouldn't put too much faith in oscars richard widmark never had a better part and was perfect casting as a 3 d flawed human being jean peters was great as the streetwise tough girl in her best role ever and richard kiley must have been very good why else would i have hated him so yes it was heavy handed on the patriotism but without it you don't have much of a film watch their faces the top three stars didn't really need much script i would like to have seen them do this film without dialogue if you've ever seen ray milland and rita gam in the thief maybe you know what i mean when i was a kid in 1956 on my first trip to nyc i made my bronx uncle drive us to the foot of south street looking for no 66 that's when i knew that hollywood couldn't be trusted but i did find the river br br i'm not giving away much of the story because i hate it when i know what happens before i see it for myself if you have seen it no elucidation is necessary just maybe someone who is reading these comments hasn't seen pickup on south street you will like it just don't go looking for 66 south street in new york city
<START> i read the running man from kings books as bachman and i felt for the main character john and his family this movie could have been so much more the trouble it was set during the big action movie craze i watched the movie and was in pain during the whole thing i felt nothing for the character and less for his cause yes it had funny scenes or laughable though i think that it did not save the movie in my eyes if you read the book you can feel the climax and the fire in the heart of john as he gets his final revenge br br i give this movie a low number it may not have been this low if i had not read the book
<START> this is a truly terrible film br br i'm only writing this so that some people somewhere are put off watching it if i have stopped one person from wasting some of their precious life watching this film i shall die happy br br unutterably dull although since it stars al pacino i was fooled into thinking that at any moment something interesting was going to happen then the credits rolled and i realised i had been completely fooled into watching this unbelievable drivel br br i cannot believe that this film has achieved as high a score as it has at imdb over 5 stars when i last saw the voting are you people voting ironically br br please please please do not watch this film
<START> this is about a mad scientist who creates a half shark half man type critter on an uncharted island then calls up all his old business and academic buddies to come and see his creation evil laugh but actually he wants his sharkman to kill them lots of bad gci goofy plot elements and babes sweating in tight t shirts follow br br these monster movies all follow a similar formula but this one spices things up with a bit of humor i guarantee the folks who made this had tongues firmly planted in cheek not to mention the sexy babes but let's mention those sexy babes several hot babes in tight t shirts sweating profusely one's in her undies at the beginning another at the end thank you thank you makers of bad movies the plot is full of goofy stuff a guy drives up in a jeep slams it right into a tree then offers to fly everyone off the island in a helicopter yeah um well how 'bout we think about that for a while we'll get back to you the sharkman is hilarious either awful cgi or an equally comedic guy in a rubber suit the mad scientist gives a pretty good performance he's evil that's his motivation he makes no apologies br br overall if you want a stupid fun b movie this one should do the job
<START> i have seen this movie when i was about 7 years old which was 33 years ago and i never forgot this movie i was deeply touched and moved by the brave little boy and the beautiful eagle and i just couldn't believe it when he turned into an eagle just when everyone in the theater thought he was going to die br br my sister was in the movie with me and i asked her recently if she remembered the movie we saw with the boy and the eagle and she said she remembered it like we saw it only yesterday so it isn't just me br br this movie is a must see br br you will never forget it just like my sister and me
<START> visconti's first film has all his trademark visual flair and immaculate technique accompanied by compelling performances from massimo girotti as the handsome drifter and best of all clara calamai as the fabulous frantic giovanna remade several times as 'the postman rings twice' but never bettered can't believe this was the man's first film it shows the confidence of someone at the zenith of their career
<START> over several years of looking for half decent films to rent for my kids i've developed a sixth sense for spotting the really cheesy direct to video efforts that are really painful to sit through for anyone over the age of eight i dropped the ball on this one and the kids spent half the movie asking me what did she say that for and why did he do that and my eyes got sore from rolling them every minute or so as characters did a really bad job of introducing seemingly random plot changes and the next time someone decides that having absolutely no skill with a sword is simply bringing realism to a film please run them through with a dull butter knife prehysteria was head and shoulders above this arrgh
<START> the father of the who's alcoholic drummer keith moon was named arthur i found so many similarities between dudley moore and keith moon in this movie liza minelli who usually overacts did quite a good job in this one and was able to turn cheek on dudley moore in every turn yes i agree sir john stole absolutely every scene it was a very different movie enabling the viewer to have a glimpse into another life we often try to catch a rerun of this movie on satellite god rest dudley moore this was such an enjoyable movie much satire and thumbs down to the rich and snobby affluent the close friendship between moore and sir john is rather endearing
<START> some guy gets whacked right out in plain sight this other guy shoots him he's got some bodyguards and they whack the killer but a reporter gets interested she goes to the hospital where they took the guy who got whacked she walks in and corners one bodyguard but he doesn't feel like talking i can't figure out why it's not like anyone else is interested she's the only reporter there anyway her editor discourages her from working on this lame story but hey she does anyway she goes to see the killer's sister mom a few minutes after she leaves they get whacked big time somebody blows up their trailer huge ball of fire then she searches out the bodyguard from the hospital she finds him hungover on his boat but a minute later they're both underwater sucking on a scuba tank 'cause three guys are trying to whack them and have blown up the boat big time huge ball of fire the reporter and the bodyguard whack two of the guys who are trying to whack them br br in the course of the next hour another guy gets whacked crossing the street there's a shootout with several stiffs in a warehouse some car chases with wreckage death a fake suicide etc etc lotsa stiffs all kindsa carnage br br great stuff but what the reporter and the bodyguard can't figure is why in hell the original guy got whacked what's the motivation of course it might help us to figure out why the reporter's even interested through almost all of this she's the only reporter on the story nobody else in the media cares not even with all the big fireballs and dead bodies true the original guy who got whacked wasn't exactly a celebrity his job was a little bit dull he was just the president yeah the one who lives in the white house oh and the bodyguard is a secret service agent br br is that the spoiler br br it should be after all there are no tv cameras no other print reporters no bloggers just another one of those police blotter crimes br br so what's the spoiler br br lemme think br br no wait the spoiler is that his wife did it yeah the first lady she was p ed because the president was fooling around and she gets away with it she's really sharp huh but how the hell could anybody ever figure that out why would anyone bother after all only one reporter is even interested br br i give this move a 1 it was so dumb i just had to keep watching and it only got dumber that's the real spoiler but even though i've told you you've got to see it to believe it
<START> despite what a lot of other people thought about the first movie i really liked it this one however how to sum it up in one word this movie is and here comes the word crap br br but let's look at it part by part here is the plot finally the old queen has been removed from her castle but her successor snow white has problems of another sort the court jester father of her son has gone astray as the super spliss goes to the extreme to battle his gray hair and sells the royal offspring for some blond and full hair in her desperation snow white seeks the help of bubi otto walkees who must first find his other six dwarf companions and then try to find the royal offspring or at least try to find the name of rumpelstiltskin br br the whole plot seems to have been written on a weekend where the writers were very drunk but were just under pressure from the studio to write the screenplay br br yes there are some good jokes even for fans of the first part or for fans of any of the other actors it's really not worth buying the the dvd believe me br br the only thing that at least kind of saves the movie from complete oblivion are the performances of some of the actors that's why i gave the move 3 10 sadly the script is so bad that none of the actors or all of them combined can make up for the bad story br br for example at one point they even cross over in our reality and sadly they don't do anything funny while being here br br still a lot of great actors in this movie otto waalkes ralf schmitz martin schneider nina hagen cosma shiva hagen especially funny rÃ¼diger hoffmann as the mirror helge schneider and many more but sadly all these comedians aren't able to bring this really bad script to life br br maybe it is a treat for some hardcore fans but for regular movie goers or by now dvd renters or buyers it's not worth the money br br i even regret renting the movie
<START> for fans of 1970s hammer type horror films this movie should be a treat the only thing i didn't like about the film was the fact that peter cushing was wasted on the worst episode in general however this is a solid spooky little movie if this is not amicus' best film it's certainly one of them the best episode rightfully saved for last is the one featuring jon pertwee as a horror film actor it is really excellent as good as pertwee was in this role it's hard to believe he didn't do more of these types of movies all in all this is an entertaining movie which scared the heck out of me as a child and which still gives me the creeps to this day
<START> terrible movie if there is one turkish film you should avoid seeing in 2006 that should be banyo what a waste of time other than couple of cheap laughs this movie achieves nothing nada zilch nil the dialog is cheap and sexual clichÃ©s are all over it the director needs to watch more films before attempting to direct his own the red headed women displays examples of what an actress should not do if you are interested in learning how not to act this is a perfect example of bad acting the only good thing i can say about the movie is wait wait there is nothing good i can say about it i must have really disliked it to write about it this much jeez
<START> one of my all time favourite films ever just beautiful full of human emotion wit humour intelligence the story grows as does the lesson of life just a wonderful film in so many ways br br the cast are also fantasic a great selection of the finest british talent around i loved them all for every diverse element brought into the film br br italy has to be one of the most romantic places to form a story such as this everything about this film works br br i love it
<START> a truly adorable heroine who at turns is surprised and terrified by giblets wrestles with mattresses runs full on into closed doors just a few of the moments that sparkle in my memory of 'the naked truth' i loved what i caught of this show enjoyably daft plots and some good supporting characters provided the setting for the diamond of the show tea leoni as 'nora wilde' cute clownish and wonderfully accident prone how refreshing to see an actress who can clown it's no wonder hollyood doesn't seem to know how to cast her but where oh where are the dvd releases the amount of bleep they release it's incredible me that this little gem continues to remain buried someone please correct me if i'm wrong
