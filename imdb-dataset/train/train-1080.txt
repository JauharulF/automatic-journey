<START> during a sleepless night i was switching through the channels found this embarrassment of a movie what were they thinking br br if this is life after remote control for kari wuhrer salin no wonder she's gone nowhere br br and why did david keith take this role it's pathetic br br anyway i turned on the movie near the end so i didn't get much of the plot but this must've been the best part this nerdy college kid brings home this dominatrix ish girl this scene is straight out of the comic books or the cheap porn movies she calls the mother anal retentive and kisses the father oh i didn't expect tongue great lines br br after this i had to see how it ended br br well of course this bitch from hell has a helluva past so the swat team is upstairs and yes they surround her and yes yes the kid blows her brains out ahahhahahaha br br this is must see tv br br
<START> this movie is just not worth your time its reliance upon new age mysticism serves as its only semi interesting distraction the plot is one that has been re cycled countless times br br i was only prompted to even spend the time to put in a comment when i noted that some have tried to prop up the reputation of this drivel their motivation objectivity is dubious since they encourage you not to look at the movies faults but at its well intentioned message of new age consciousness br br so would it be alright for some twenty to thirty evangelical christians or islamic fundamentalists to pour in positive ratings about movies television that support their views in spite of the poor qualities of production or the lack of truth in any of its supposed historic basis i hope not br br i am sure the followers will come right behind me to say flowery things about this movie in spite of the truth
<START> this is not a horror film but a boring sex movie a very bad movie to be avoided by any serious horror fan no plot awful acting and annoying music if you only watch the trailer you will know enough it's a shame that such thing is available on vhs or video while there are so many good movies unavailable if you like vampires try the hammer productions or the italian gothic from mario bava and antonio margheriti instead those are masterpieces if you compare this with this trash rating even 1 is too much and believe me i am not the only one with this opinion
<START> most people when they think of expressionist cinema look to the b w german films of the silent and early sound eras films that emphasized canted angles extreme contrasts of light and dark exaggerated performance and occasional uses of surrealism to create a dreamlike atmosphere in order to diverge from traditional naturalistic modes of cinematic representation if we're willing to accept that the germans were not the only filmmakers to create expressionist cinema and that those above mentioned characteristics are not prerequisites for expressionist film then i would argue that dodes'ka den dkd is a prime example of this type of film br br like dreams dkd is a little unhinged for a kurosawa film dabbling as it does in the unreal however dkd is also unlike dreams a great film and probably my favorite kurosawa picture why mostly i think it's the colors this was i believe kurosawa's first color film and the man saturates the movie with vibrant primary colors creating a completely unreal contemporary japan we are used to the neon lights and gleaming tokyo skyscrapers we are not used to a city that appears to have been colored with crayons br br dkd is as i said a peculiar film inasmuch as many of its characters live in a junkyard appearing to live in an alternate universe that is i think the point these are the tokyo outsiders the people left behind during the great move forward following world war ii the film also represents one of kurosawa's more heartfelt movies there is genuine sentiment here and genuine pathos such as when the boy's father describes their dream home it's an amazingly moving film from a man better known for stunning john ford like vistas and samurais everyone should have known kurosawa had in him a movie as touching and thought provoking as this ikiru foreshadows the emotional resonance of this film in many ways br br i will also argue to the last that this is kurosawa's greatest achievement his samurai films though capable pictures pale in comparison to works by kobayashi hara kiri is the greatest most intelligent samurai film committed to celluloid rashomon hidden fortress seven samurai yojimbo sanjuro kagemusha and ran are all fine films but they're merely good and frankly i think that word is too generous for hidden fortress and kagemusha dkd is a great movie as is ikiru they are the crown jewels that show akira was not a one trick samurai pony they reveal his artistry and mastery of cinema
<START> a young american woman visits her irish roots and fends off a druid witch who is out to possess her sounds intriguing but after an interesting start i got lost and spent most of the time wondering where it was going the movie seems to be dithering in two directions are we watching the travails of the irish american woman battling her alcohol problem or are we watching a straight off horror flick about an evil witch that returns from the past the director can't seem to decide the two doesn't seem to gel and in the end you get nowhere this could be so much better done and the story seemed to drag towards the end this was most boring and disappointing
<START> probably my all time favorite movie a story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause but it's not preachy or boring it just never gets old despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years paul lukas' performance brings tears to my eyes and bette davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles is a delight the kids are as grandma says more like dressed up midgets than children but that only makes them more fun to watch and the mother's slow awakening to what's happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling if i had a dozen thumbs they'd all be up for this movie
<START> 25 000 pyramid clues deep blue sea tremors slither eight legged freaks br br pyramid category movies that were funnier and more thrilling than snakes on a plane br br hell with that definition i'd have to include the relatively harrowing journey of ted and elaine in airplane as superior to snakes in both laughs and thrills br br the sad truth is that this isn't even close to the mother of all unintentionally intentional funny snake movies anaconda besides the never to be seen again casting of jlo cube o wilson stoltz wuhrer in the same flick you had jon voight pulling off the all time cinematic heist his final scene alone represents everything soap tried and failed to do as a so ludicrous it's fun movie br br in the end snakes on a plane is definitive proof that studio execs and fanboys make the worst collaborators possible every big scene had been discussed and dissected so much the last year all that was left to amuse by opening night was the amount of fanboy flop sweat that had to be mopped up at my theater i heard more forced laughs here than at a studio taping for according to jim
<START> kim basinger stars as della a housewife who has twin children terri and tammi played by luke gair and erika shaye gair and an abusive jerk for a husband kenneth played by craig sheffer br br the movie opens on christmas eve kenneth is on his way home from work driving a nice car too i might add he is on his cellphone arguing with a business partner i would assume when he gets home he sees that the floor is a mess with shoes and toys spread all about this angers him even more and he takes up with his wife della asking her why the house is always a mess he pins her up against the wall the twin's watch from the stairs he punches the wall leaving a hole in it and walks away she tends to the children trying to comfort them after that is all said in done she needs to go to the mall to do some last minute shopping and because she is out of wrapping paper she gets there and the parking lot is full because there is a lot of last minute shoppers there while she is looking for a parking space she notices a car taking up two spaces and this irks her she finally finds a spot to park makes her way over to the hoggish car and leaves a note under the wiper calling the owner a selfish jerk then she goes in the mall to do her last minute shopping br br when she finally does leave the mall it is closing and many people have left already not the owner of the car she left the note on however and she notices this on the way to her vehicle she also notices that the note she left under the wiper is no longer there odd when she gets to her vehicle she gets in to start it up she notices a car coming up behind her and it blocks her from backing up she gets out of the car only to be confronted by the owner of the car chuckie played by lukas haas she left the note on and a posse of his thug friends yelling ensues and a mall cop no not paul blart makes his way over to them to see what the problem is only to have his brains blown out of his head by chuckie while this happens della jumps in her vehicle starts it and drives over the median in front of her chuckie and his posse hop in his car and give chase della ends up crashing her vehicle into a log pile at a housing development but she is unharmed she manages to make it to the back of her vehicle open up the hatchback and grab a toolbox before the thugs get there br br with that della spends the rest of the night trying to outrun and out wit the thugs armed with only the tools that she has in her toolbox as weapons the first kill in my opinion is the best the first kill that della performs anyway the last one was probably the weakest and it should of been the best considering that this was the main bad guy she was offing br br i will admit that there will be some that are put off buy the ending and i was let down a bit myself as a whole though it was a fun flick and moves along nicely at it's 1 hour and 20 minute run time
<START> after watching this film last night on sundance i realized that much of nakata's style was first done in this film here we have many of the same elements of the ringu series especially the idea of the media being the source of the supernatural instead of the cursed videotape we instead having a haunted studio and strange images appearing on film in fact the strange images appearing on film brings immediately the cursed videotape in ringu to mind the only thing missing was the obsession to water that runs through nakata's later films the final scenes are quite chilling with a bit of a nod to murnau what with the door opening by itself ands the ghost entering the room reminds me immediatly of br br nosferatu a chilling movie that will make think twice about going up to a catwalk
<START> screwball comedy about romantic mismatches in new york city peter bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the women in his picture he reveres them yet audrey hepburn is naturally put a notch above the others because after all she's the princess bogdanovich probably fell in love with at the movies 30 years prior he shoots her in loving close ups gets right in the sheets between her and a wonderfully hard boiled soft boiled ben gazzara and allows her room to sparkle throughout the love connections made in the course of the film are fast and amusing though i did tire of john ritter's tv styled klutziness colleen camp dorothy stratten and the grounded earthy sensual patti hansen are all exciting to watch but it's really hepburn's valentine and she absolutely glows from
<START> the plot of this enjoyable mgm musical is contrived and only occasionally amusing dealing with espionage and romance but the focus of the film is properly pointed upon the tuneful interludes showcasing the enormously talented and athletic tap dancing eleanor powell abetted by tommy dorsey and his orchestra featuring ziggy elman buddy rich and frank sinatra red skelton shares top billing with powell and he and sidekick bert lahr are given most of the comedic minutes although skelton is more effective when he if it can be believed performs as powell's love interest with virginia o'brien actually providing most of the film's humor as the dancer's companion the technical brilliance of powell is evidenced during one incredible scene within which buddy rich contributes his drumming skills and which must be viewed several times in order to permit one's breathing to catch up with her precision director edward buzzell utilizes his large cast well to move the action nicely along despite the rather disjointed script with which he must deal and permits powell's cotangent impossibilities to rule the affair as is appropriate
<START> hatred of a minute is arguably one of the better films to come out of michigan in recent years not to say that it's a brilliant film by any means but it's definitely worth a watch br br hatred chronicles the sordid adventures of eric seaver played by director kallio a formerly abused child now grown up and starting to listen to his evil side br br hatred is very nice visually the shots are creative and the lighting is approporiately moody and interesting to look at this film actually has an element of production value to it unlike other recent michigan releases like dark tomorrow and biker zombies subtle dolly shots and stylized shot composition show good use of this film's 350 000 budget br br however hatred stumbles in the same places that so many other local films do and that's in the story and character department essentially things just kind of happen eric seaver doesn't evolve at all basically he's always been crazy it's just that people are starting to notice the film just wanders along its merry way with very little development also the ending is very abrupt br br however since this is a horror film since when do we care about plot we just want to see people die and hatred certainly delivers as the body count mounted people in the theater started cheering kill her kill em' all when people scream back at the screen it's always fun br br that's the place where hatred succeeds it's fun and in the end that's all that really matters
<START> delightful disney film with angela lansbury in fine form as a middle age spinster whose interest turns to witchcraft in world war 11 england br br lansbury was about age 51 at the time of the film and she is just ideal for the part she is jessica fletcher again but this time it's for the benefit or children and for mother england during a time of great peril br br the film follows the adventures of miss price lansbury and david tomlinson as the professor of witchcraft in trying to obtain certain information on sorcery those 3 little darlings sent to live with price to escape the london bombings are just wonderful in this enchanting film for all of us regardless of age br br too bad that tessie o'shea roddy mcdowall and sam jaffe are given so little to do in this endearing film br br i really thought of the ben stiller film night at the museum at the end of the film when the relics come to life to do battle with the nazi invasion in the small british coastal town
<START> i saw this film in its entirety in the 1960s 70s yes it is gruesome and could be the progenitor of the faces of death series popular in the 80s 90s considering the state of so called driver education these days this one should be required viewing for everyone preparing to learn to drive when you see violent death in all its gore horror you certainly if you have any sensibility at all get a truer perspective on the responsibilities required to drive safely what one instant of thoughtlessness or inattentiveness at the wheel can do i worked for bell telephone in the 70s 80s and at one point was assigned to conduct a safety class i found this film in the company library showed it at the session a number of people got physically sick and had to leave the room incredibly most of them later said i never knew a car accident could be so terrible this film and another red asphalt is certainly reality in its most graphic form i'll never forget it i only wish i could have found a copy when my children were attending driver's ed in high school
<START> i have watched this movie well over 100 200 times and i love it each and every time i watched it yes it can be very corny but it is also very funny and enjoyable the camp shown in the movie is a real camp that i actually attended for 7 years and is portrayed as camp really is a great place to spend the summer everyone who has ever gone to camp wanted to go to camp or has sent a child to camp should see this movie because it'll bring back wonderful memories for you and for your kids
<START> i was watching this when my wife called to inquire from the other room as to my choice of fare my comment i am watching my life br br though younger but only by 5 years or so than the rocket boys i remember the absolute urgency with which sputnick was greeted by our administrators of education and how the whole science fair thing gained momentum and took me and others into the competitive whirlwind my own tornado landed me in my own state's science fair in physics by '62 though our group was less successful in gaining the support of for example firefighters we approached for guidance and counsel until after a tragic event our city went so far as to allow us to tour the nike missile site on chicago's lakeshore br br this movie brought it all back for me and i will bet that it brought it all back for a bunch of us ubernerds of the late '50s and early 60's br br we are in a similar science brain drainage period now and really need this movie as a country see it
<START> the government that he fought to establish to recognize his loyalty with a promised and much needed pension ripstein's lyrical work is a sweet ode to all those who like the colonel suffer under the abuses of a cynical and hardened society that strengthens itself by denying its citizens the means to live with dignity and purpose unlike the absurdity of waiting for godot the colonel's wait for the arrival of his pension gives hope and significance to his otherwise miserable life two things in the film drive the colonel who is masterfully played by fernando lujan the hope that his military pension will one day arrive and the knowledge that his son agustin died for a noble cause a reason other than a drunken fracas at a rigged cockfight unable to realize the former and forced to prove to the world the latter the colonel does the only thing he can do set about training his son's fighting cock the cock is now the warrior who can bring fortune and justice to the colonel and his asthmatic wife but his fighting ring is that of the killer of his former owner agustin in a tense scene of confrontation between the colonel and nogales his son's killer the colonel is offered by nogales a paid government agent money enough to equal the colonel's full pension but this is blood money hush money designed to hide the fact that those in power have turned their backs on one who fought for their political ideals and to conceal to the world that the warrior colonel's son was assassinated because he wrote for an underground paper that favored the rights of labor unions and the common man with maximum dignity the colonel rejects nogales' offer picks up his fighting rooster and walks away as nobly as his old legs can carry him once he is at home dona lola his scolding wife wants to know why the colonel refused the money when both of them are starving in response to her continued question what are we going to eat until november when the cockfighting season begins the colonel responds shit excrement is what the poor and disenfranchised have been eating all of their lives and excrement is a meal that the colonel willingly chooses to eat with dignity knowing that he could never sell his soul to those who oppress him the colonel waits as the only man of honor and valor in a world without principles
<START> rachel mcadams cillian murphy wes craven the dream team this is one of the best thrillers of 2005 a great plot a great twist a great eye candy this is one of wes craven's greatest movies apart from scream and a nightmare on elm street this could be the best the plot is one of the best things about the movie and it is very simple lisa reisert mcadams a struggling hotel manager boards a late red eye back to la little does she know that she has been followed by jackson ripner aka jack the ripper murphy they have a couple of drinks and end up sitting together on the plane later he reveals to her that he is an assassin who was sent to kill the secreteary of homeland security who is staying in lisa's hotel and what does this have to with lisa well she would have to move his room to the top suite so they can bomb him if she doesn't ripner will murder her father brian cox the twist and bringing of the story really gives it the extra zing and the side characters and the side jokes really add to it overall definitely one of the best thrillers of 2005 definitely worth the see br br 3 1 2 out of 4 stars
<START> this was surely the stupidest crudest most repulsive film i have seen in quite some time i was tempted to turn off the vcr but as in the fascination watching a horrible car accident i literally found it compulsively hateable in every conceivable way and slugged it out through to the end i am by no means a prude who objects to the comedic portrayal of sexual antics on the screen animal house porky's there's something about mary both american pie movies and even the notorious freddy got fingered i have found highly enjoyable on their own crude terms mamie van doren's breast baring sponge bath is the most horrifying appearance by a naked geriatric since the shining ineptly edited and shot with incredibly annoying performances from devon sawa and jason schwartzman the film ended without the benefit of having made me giggle once the only useful purpose for the film is as a textbook example of how not to make a gross out picture oh and it would also serve nicely as a lawn fertilizer
