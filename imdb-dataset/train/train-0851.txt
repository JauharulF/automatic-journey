<START> halfway through lajos koltai's evening a woman on her deathbed asks a figure appearing in her hallucination can you tell me where my life went the line could be embarrassingly theatrical but the woman speaking it is vanessa redgrave delivering it with utter simplicity and the question tears your heart out br br time and again the film based on susan minot's novel skirts sentimentality and ordinariness it holds attention offers admirable performances and engenders emotional involvement as few recent movies have with only six months of the year gone there are now two memorable meaningful worthwhile films in theaters the other of course being sara polley's away from her hollywood might have turned evening into a slick celebrity vehicle with its two pairs of real life mothers and daughters vanessa redgrave and natasha richardson and meryl streep and mamie gummer richardson is redgrave's daughter in the film with a sister played by tony collette and gummer plays streep's younger self while redgrave's youthful incarnation is claire danes br br add glenn close eileen atkins hugh dancy patrick wilson and a large cast yes it could have turned into a multiple star platform instead koltai the brilliant hungarian cinematographer of mephisto and director of fateless created a subtle ensemble work with a continental feel the story taking place in a high society newport environment in the days leading up to a wedding that is fraught with trouble br br missed connections wrong choices and dutiful compliance with social and family pressures present quite a soap opera but the quality of the writing koltai's direction and selfless acting raise evening way above that level into the the rarified air of english french and a few american family sagas from a century before its contemporary setting br br complex relationships between mothers and daughters between friends and lovers with the addition of a difficult triangle all come across clearly understandably captivatingly individual tunes are woven into a symphony br br and yet with the all the foregoing emphasis on ensemble and selfless performances the stars of evening still shine through redgrave richardson gummer an exciting new discovery looking vaguely like her mother but a very different actress danes carrying most of the load until streep shows up in the final moments and of course steals the show dancy and wilson are well worth the price of admission too br br as with away from her evening stays with you at length inviting a re thinking its story and characters and re experiencing the emotions it raises at two hours the film runs a bit long but the way it stays with you thereafter is welcome among the many movies that go cold long before your popcorn
<START> i have only recently been able to catch up with the films of marilyn miller since they are not shown on tcm in the uk i have been much intrigued over the years because this was one of the superstars of the 20s what was she really like to some stars of this era like jolson some of the magic still shines through but alas not for miller her dancing seems awkward and poorly choreographed her singing somewhat limited and as an actress she makes ruby keeler seem like hepburn even worse in this film as the public had grown tired of musicals virtually all of the musical numbers have been deleted so we are left with a comedy of that period with little real appeal she was being paid 500000 for this so i have only two conclusion either she was poorly served by the cinema or she had no talent at all i think that the truth is nearer the later than the former
<START> story about four teenage girls growing up in california jeanie jodie foster is the most level headed of the bunch but wants to move out of her house where she lives with her divorced mother sally kellerman annie cherie currie is addicted to drugs alcohol and bad boys and is beaten up by her father madge marilyn kagan has overprotective parents deirde kandice stroh thinks she's more mature than the rest of them br br this is nothing new from what we've seen plenty of times before but this one has one big difference it's accurate i graduated from high school in 1980 when i first saw the film and i was surprised at how realistic it was they got the dialogue clothes and attitudes down completely right even the main song of the movie on the radio by donna summer was a big hit before this came out this film hit me harder than any other teen film of the time because i could understand and relate to the characters i knew girls in high school who were just like this the film is of course dated but it captures a time we will never see again br br the acting is good on all counts with foster giving the best performance the relationship between her and kellerman who was excellent was realistic and well done even scott baio who has a small role as a friend of the girls more or less realistically played a teen boy br br a very good movie essential viewing if you came of age in 1980 the film has a deserved r rating plenty of drug use and swearing but should be seen by all teens i give it a 8
<START> i just watched antwone fisher on bravo what an awesome movie and incredible young man this movie is a must see for anyone who is dealing with how to overcome childhood abuse and abandonment as an adult denzel washington puts in an outstanding performance as well as the young man who plays antwone fisher kleenex alert feel good and tearful the most heartrending moment is when he finally meets his mother who he was taken away from at 2 months of age and one of the most courageous was when he stood up to his abusive foster mother and sister i saw this movie on bravo in 2008 and only wish i had known about it years ago definitely a movie to add to my dvd collection
<START> i did not think this movie was worth anything bad script bad acting except for janine turner no fantasy stupid plot dumb ass husband and unfair divorce settings if you have never seen this movie before don't even bother it's not worth it at all the only thing that was good about it was that janine turner did a good job acting terry's husband is a stuck up smart ass defense attorney who has won a lot of cases and even gotten guility murderers off he think he is so smart but he is really just a nut her best friend has an affair with her husband and betrays her nice girl huh yeah she's a real peach not she's no day at the beach either
<START> with all due disrespect for this george stevens sr epic of miscastings and misreadings i can only wonder that the james dean legend could survive this outing i submit that then studio obeisances to bankable box office giants came a cropper of its own 'gigantismoses' nor were rock and liz that much better off let us just say that the televised dallas was the authentic heir even if contemp tuous latterday texans like lay and delay not to mention our putative president of these here yewbenighted states of amurrika perform a one upsmanship of dastardly global dimensions i never read edna ferber's original but will lay odds it is head and shoulders superior to what got on screen herein and all those well paid i would imagine supporting actors of note and celebrity notwithstanding giant is to me at least a midget of scant merit never mind the promo campaigns
<START> crush examines female friendship for the most part avoiding the saccharine quality which spoils so many films with the same theme e g steel magnolias at the same time it reveals the power of a sudden passion to overwhelm and surprise the events depicted were highly improbable but the underlying emotional truth seemed very genuine to me not a film for the speeding vehicle and explosion crowd but grown up women are certain to respond with both laughter and tears
<START> i never attended the midnight showing of a movie before dick tracy came out br br i still have the t shirt ticket i had to wear to get admitted to the showing around here somewhere and like that shirt dick tracy has stuck with me ever since br br if you've seen the movie the sharp visuals bright primary colors and strong characters have no doubt been etched into your brain it's a wonder to behold br br as director star co writer producer beatty knows what works in a film and shows it here taking a familiar american icon and re creating him for a whole new era still set in the '30s tracy has a kind of timeless quality like all good films do i've lost track of how many times i've watched tracy and i still catch something new every time i do br br the others are all top notch starting with pacino's big boy caprice a reminder that he can do comedy with the best of them even madonna's breathless mahoney is a relevation in that under the right environment she can act gasp br br but there's still such themes touched on as the necessity of family keeping true to one's self good versus evil even machiavellian themes are explored odd for a comic strip film but hey it works br br all in all dick tracy is a classic unto itself compared with other films of this decade it makes a strong statement it's a good strong film that doesn't depend on blood violence profanity or nudity to make its point br br there's a lesson to be learned here br br ten stars great scott
<START> east palace west palace reminded me somewhat of the detective with frank sinatra in the role of the cop and william windom is the boy it's a progressive film for china i guess but it also perpetuates myths about the femininity of gay men much is made of chinese myths in which men take on female roles the movie focuses on an effeminate man who wants desperately to be dominated and hurt by a macho guy he cruises the park without fear he hopes to be taken into the stationhouse by the officer and that in fact happens then he tells the officer his entire life story while being subjected to mild torture made to squat for a period of time handcuffed slapped this is what the gay man wants and implicitly the gay man is challenging the cop's self image as a manly man the story's about the gay man's life which include flashbacks are tolerable but when he starts describing old chinese myths and dramatic works the movie becomes unbearable it becomes a cry of pity for china's gays who only want to fulfill a traditional role in chinese society sorry i can't relate
<START> this movie is not as good as all think the actors are lowlevel and the story is very comic like i respect fantasy but lord of the rings is fantasy conan is fantasy this is just normal hk lowprice entertainment why did they include this splatter tongue it makes everything worse the only good thing is the cinematography and the cutter's job
<START> nick nolte gives an excellent performance in kurt vonnegut's dark tale notle plays howard w campbell who was a double agent working in propaganda during world war ii after the war he lives anonymously until competing factions wish to dig up his past as with much of vonnegut's work this is a meditation on the absurdity of war and those who use propaganda for their own aims nolte is fantastic self assured and confident as the younger campbell and then broken and haunted as the older man who is forced to atone for the sins of his past 7 out of 10
<START> this isn't a movie it is a collection of unrelated ill conceived and poorly assembled scenes that look like the unedited results of a dim 10 year old with a mini dv camera in fact i have a theory that the extremely abrasive girl in the train corridor the one with the greasy hair dead pan stare ipod and nervous tic probably shot it herself in a creative phase br br if you made it further than the ten minutes i did don't bother trying to fit what you saw into the context of the european artiste mentality praised above this is a true and complete waste of time money and film that would have made william one shot beaudine cringe br br the unfortunate part is that the endless series of vacuum packed characters is representative of what now passes for much of humanity br br what's next six directors shooting social intercourse at the wal mart snack counter
<START> i saw this film when it was first released the memory of how bad it was has stayed with me almost forty years i didn't want to trust my own sentiments about the movie when i saw it so i consulted a movie review published in a major metropolitan newspaper the next day sentiment confirmed the reviewer wrote that the movie was incoherent indecipherable and uninspiring a little research reveals that the producer was star leslie caron's husband thus the whiff of nepotism suggests the beginning for this awful film the film's roster of many capable actors caron warren oates scatman crothers gloria grahame and james sikking among others suggests that it holds some promise but the death of this film is attributable to its terrible screenplay the mystery implicated is so obscure and so little revealed throughout the film that the viewer is left perplexed from scene to scene the movie seems torn between being a detective mystery and an espionage thriller but never settles upon one or the other the sense of suspense is entirely absent the main characters settle on playing dry emotionless types in a fashion that inspires no empathy whatsoever the cinematography is pedestrian the result is that the hapless viewer loses interest in the characters the plot and in the end the film itself i am little surprised that there is no version of this pathetic film available to purchase i hope that if tcm finds a print of this film and feels compelled to air it that it is safely relegated to the 4 00 am slot
<START> this three stooges flick is at a tie with my other favorite flick disorder in the court this is an uproar of laughter for any three stooges fan to enjoy br br the boys are janitors at a recording studio when they hear the lovely christine mcintyre sings a great version of voices of spring she is going to be offered a record deal but she is scarred to be honest with her father about her choice of a career and prove herself as a real singer when she and the others leave the studio the stooges decide to have a little fun and play her record and dress curly up as christine the contract lady who can make christine's career sees curly and mistakes him for christine and invites curly to sing for her party of course there is a man that they have upset that is at the party and they destroy his solo in front of the crowd so he'll find a way to get back at them br br what a great stooge flick this should not be missed br br 10 10
<START> an acted manipulated documentary about one of the most darkest places of guatemala portrayed as a fun secure but sad place were a bunch of sex workers get to play in a soccer team assembled in what seems like no more than a week the documentary's main focus is to prove that society repels this kind of workers even though no solution to these poor women is ever achieved except that the people who documented this made them some sort of stars just like the title says so in exchange of being exploited for making this realityshowlike documentary it does have however its own documented reality but that sadly has nothing to do with the main storyline i would not accept to see it again but i would recommend it for general cultural purposes only
<START> i have seen this movie a whole dozen times and it's awesome but the only thing with it was that in the beginning there was too much talk of who's going out with who i think that it would be interesting to do a remake of it but on the official site they said that they will not be making a remake of it because so many people have gotten saved when viewing it what's even happened to patty dunning now she is a pretty good actress she has done several other movies in the 70s and 80s but we haven't heard from her since i know for sure about thom rachford who plays jerry works for accounting at rd films but overall i have to say that the series itself is like left behind gone old school
<START> not for people without swift mind or without a drop of balkan blood in their veins if you don't have any of these you can not understand it and if you don't understand you can't enjoy it for example if you think picasso is a name of a car produced by citroen probably if you see a picasso's painting you just will walk by it deciding that it's a trash work of some street painter so do not judge before trying to understand it in the end i think it's a must for every one with open minds still my n1 remains the shawshank redemption and remember that not all things can be put in frames because there are things in this world that any frame just won't fit
<START> as you all may know jigsaw did not make its way to blackbuster because of a member of full moon's own staff devin hamilton devin is the one who sells to all of the video chains he recently released a movie bleed which he was selling to blackbuster at the same time as jigsaw he convinced the blackbuster buyer not to take any jigsaw and double the number of bleed the result is that jigsaw looks like a flop and bleed looks like a hit the major problem with that is that bleed is one of the worst movies ever and as we all know jigsaw is well gold i urge all of you to go on to the bleed page on the internet and vote for the movie that wronged jigsaw and all of your talents likewise you should go to the jigsaw page and cast high votes for it if you already haven't we need to get jigsaw up to at least an 8 or 8 5 and bleed down to around a 2 thus putting it on the internet's 100 worst movie listing also try to convince friends and family to do the same br br hope you all are doing well matt
<START> xiao chen zhi chun is a great movie not only in the year it was shot but also now it's an art movie which is not outdated even in 21st century the director maintained a good narrative skill and thus made the story so smooth br br the movie reminds me of the later french new wave movie francois truffaut's femme d'a cote which is of the similar topic
<START> the first part of grease with john travolta and olivia newton john is one of the best movie for teens this one is a very bad copy the change is only in the sex in the first one the good one was sandy here it's michael i prefer to watch the first grease
