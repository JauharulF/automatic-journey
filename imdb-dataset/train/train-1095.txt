<START> have you ever wondered what would happen if a couple of characters from beverly hills 90210 were thrown into a thai jail if so this is your movie this is midnight express for the mtv crowd that would be ok but the story was poorly executed contrived plot twists poor dialogue and unresolved issues abound this slight film did not earn the right to be as cryptic as it ends up being potential spoiler and impossibly preposterous plot line the faux tension filled moment when the hotel employee discovers the girls do not have a room there and is about to kick them out this moment is innappropriately played with the same solemnity and gravity as the moment when they are arrested at gunpoint later the same hotel employee is somehow found and bangkok is a big city mind you ive been there and testifies against the girls as if a couple of free mai tais warrant 40 years in prison c'mon rent another day in paradise instead
<START> yeah i get pasolini and his milieu but at the same time i feel his decameron is largely overrated and more than a little disturbing overrated because the supposed realism he introduces milling crowds crumbling architecture etc are mooted by the absurd and downright goofy way that the characters behave in the pursuit of realism pasolini utilized many non actors but their deer in the headlights stares and painfully awkward line delivery gives the whole a terribly off kilter and inconsistent feel and frankly many of the toothless misshapenly featured people are painful to look at br br and pasolini's decameron is disturbing to me at least because of the casual and prevalent homosexual content not because i'm prudish or homophobic i'm neither but because the emphasis that pasolini places upon homoerotic images and situations is contrary to the neo realism he otherwise espouses so it comes off as gratuitous and forced one can almost hear him say ooh i've got to stick a cute naked boy in this scene at times it seems that pasolini is trying to play up the homosexual angle to thumb his nose at critics and at other times because he enjoys that aspect himself regardless of what his audience might prefer br br the disjointedness of the 9 or 10 different stories in pasolini's decameron struck me as being a failing of pasolini as a storyteller rather than being an aspect of neo realism he seems to get bored with each story and so he wraps them up rather unconvincingly and with little conviction even the pasolini's final line of dialog in the film which some people seem to find pithy why create a work of art when dreaming about it is so much sweeter to me it just makes me wonder why pasolini would bother making a film if he felt this way in my opinion a far better crafted film and with more homosexual content is fellini's satyricon it is also full of bizarre looking people and absurd situations but it succeeds because of its pacing direction and strong storytelling whereas decameron fails by those same elements
<START> the groove tube was one of only two ken shapiro movies the other one being the equally zany modern problems this one is just a full scale parody of tv aside from shapiro who apparently didn't do anything after modern problems the movie also stars chevy chase and henry winkler's cousin richard belzer the three cast members plus some other people in smaller roles appear in various skits one of the funniest ones features chase in a geritol spoofing commercial in which he's describing the medicine as his wife strips and it ends with her humping him there's also a pornographic news program an irritating cooking show and the epic tale of some drug dealers br br anyway the whole thing's just a real hoot in my opinion the three best tv spoofing movies are this one plus tunnelvision and kentucky fried movie although i might also include the truman show really funny br br i wonder what ever did become of ken shapiro
<START> i watched like 8 or 9 herzog movies and none of them had any impact on me br br i watched several documentaries about him he is obviously an intelligent man with great knowledge about films and passion for making them but does this makes him a good director definitely no a complete anti talent he can make a good documentary because of previously mentioned traits but a film with actors Â never br br he can't direct nor write his screenplays are full of badly thought out situations and many situations dialogues in his movies are so childishly and badly done that they cannot be hidden behind the word art in any sense no way not to mention the unskillful direction so amateurish like to say that he wants to direct like that and write crap like that is a lie br br like the scene when scheitz gets arrested and storszek hides in the back of the store who is he kidding br br he is a cheater he knows what fake intellectuals and critics want he knows what elements he needs to put in the script to get your their attention and empty praising never mind the rest of the script and sloppy direction br br just look at julio medem if herzog can make a movie like medem can then i might re check his old movies and try to find talent in them
<START> the original was a good movie i bought it on tape and have watched it several times and though i know that sequels are not usually as good as the original i certainly wasn't expecting such a bomb the romance was flat the sight gags old the spoken humor just wasn't this may not have been the worst movie i've ever seen but it comes close
<START> tarzan and his mate the second of mgm's tarzan pictures picks up a year after the events of tarzan the ape man tarzan and jane have been living happily in the jungle and harry holt one of the expeditioners in the first film returns this time accompanied by the less than honorable martin arlington in quest of the ivory from the elephants' graveyard naturally a variety of perilous and exciting adventures take place along the way br br the first film romanticized everything the jungle adventure romance itself wild animals and even death the second film still has a great deal of romanticism and a lot of wonderful action sequences but a more serious tone underlies the action the characters dare to ask questions like what if something happened to tarzan what would jane do if she was stranded by herself in the middle of the jungle and she had to fend for herself while these are probably the questions real people would be asking in this situation it creates a certain amount of somberness that isn't always as much fun as the throw caution to the wind attitude of the original br br one of the most enjoyable aspects of this film is the growth we see in tarzan and jane's relationship tarzan still speaks very broken english but he has clearly learned a few new words from his mate additionally their love for each other has really blossomed and we feel like they really have spent a year together in the jungle br br most people consider tarzan and his mate superior to the original tarzan the ape man personally i liked the first film just a little bit better the main reason is that the relationship between the harry holt martin arlington team isn't nearly as likable as holt's relationship with james parker jane's father from the original the mr arlington character could have worked as a great movie villain but he plays the hero for far too much of the movie the movie can never decide whether we should like him or hate him also i don't want to give anything away but in one of the scenes where we should clearly hate him jane never finds out about those events so the ending isn't quite as satisfying as it could have been all of these detractors are relatively minor however and it's still a great movie br br like the first film tarzan and his mate has amazing action scenes wonderful wildlife footage and one of the screen's all time greatest romances if you liked the first film in the series this is definitely a sequel to see
<START> brilliant movie the drawings were just amazing too bad it ended before it begun iÂ´ve waited 21 years for a sequel but nooooo
<START> the ghost of the vietnam war has haunted the american psyche for thirty years now if not because of the fact that tens of thousands of american soldiers went mia in vietnam or the manner in which those who returned were treated then because it was the first war that america could be said to have lost many men came home from the war a shadow of their former selves and the original first blood managed to provide a small insight into their problems as they attempted to rotate back into the world as the saying goes first blood part ii on the other hand is little more than a fist pumping mess that goes to illustrate how sore america can be both in victory and defeat stallone puts in another sluggish performance as the titular special forces commando while richard crenna attempts to hold up the serious actor quotient where it all comes undone is in the script which didn't do any better when it was called missing in action and starred chuck norris what little semblance of logic there was in the original is now gone as the filmmakers decide to paint a big s on rambo's massive chest br br the film picks up a little while after the end of first blood the film that is the novel didn't allow for the possibility of sequels in this mediocre follow up rambo has been put to work at what appears to be some sort of open air mine as he is breaking rocks and working up a sweat a prison guard pulls him away to go and have a chat with colonel trautman who advises him that his government is willing to offer him an early release if he goes on a covert mission rambo never one to back down from a hard day's violent work accepts and is promptly shipped off to a covert base in what appears to be cambodia or thailand i forget which from there he is commissioned to seek out a camp where american mias are supposedly being held and photograph them his mission quite clearly specifies that he is not to make any attempt to secure their release rambo being rambo however has other ideas in spite of their possible political implications br br of course things go somewhat awry when it turns out that the people commissioning rambo's work have more interest in making sure no american mias are found it is the age old conspiracy theory and makes no apologies for exploiting the plight of many an american family that was left without a son during the ten years that the official vietnam war had been raging for of course with the jingoism that was inherent in american society during the 1980s they could not help but work in a plot tangent about the vietnamese army being in bed with what appears to be a single battalion of russians together the two antagonists attempt to extract what information they can from rambo but it backfires upon them in an orgy of bullets arrows rockets and destruction about the only thing missing is the moment when rambo drinks from a grail like chalice and declares himself invincible br br to be honest first blood part ii is a well photographed and well choreographed action spectacle the hand to hand combat with the larger russian commander is one of the few battles in the film that has any dramatic tension whatsoever the rest is simply a case of the lead actor and the director building a fantasy for americans to pump their fist to fortunately this fad of america Ã¼ber alles action films soon died down when more introspective and intelligent war films such as platoon began doing the rounds some of the kills shown here are quite creative despite all the problems the vietnamese commander meets an end that many an action film villain would envy the russian commander bites it in a manner that is as spectacular as it is ridiculous only in a 1980s action film would one see a law being used from inside a helicopter sure there have been action film clichÃ©s rooted in contradictions of fact but never this ridiculous before br br i gave rambo first blood part ii a one out of ten it is so bad it is ridiculous and so ridiculous that it is often funny one doesn't even need to have served in the military to know how stupid some of the action sequences are the only risk it takes is in trying to make a stupid political statement with what is a heartbreaking subject for those directly involved keep the tongue firmly in the cheek and it might be watchable
<START> although there were some amusing moments i thought the movie was pretty lame the longer it ran the worse it got once the action entered monument valley i found myself watching the magnificent outcroppings more than the increasingly silly and unconvincing interaction of the characters br br the character of the daughter was particularly incoherent first she's in on the deal then discovers the truth and she bails then she's back again then deserts them again then she's back again there's no apparent motivation for any of her decisions there were interesting characters some interesting scenes and many missed possibilities i would have to say the pictures was much less than the sum of its parts apparently the people who liked repo man were inclined to like this one searchers 2 0 is no match for the searchers
<START> i love it when they actually do a sports story well so many in the past have been so hokey it was embarrassing to watch not this one it's just a genuinely nice movie an old fashioned type of story and based on a real life guy to did exactly what dennis quaid did in this film he plays a high school coach who is talked into trying out late in life athletically speaking to become a pitcher in professional baseball eventually he reaches his goal of making it to the major leagues even if it was a very brief stint br br all the characters in here are nice people the kind you root for from quaid to the players on his high school team to his little boy angus t jones now somewhat of a star on television br br quaid is believable in playing jim morris because unlike actors in the past in sports films he knows how to throw a baseball he looks like a pitcher a guy who could fire it 90 plus miles per hour and most of this film is true as testified by the real life pitcher in one the documentaries on the dvd br br so if you're looking for a nice inspirational true life sports film you can't wrong with this one
<START> i went to school with jeremy earl that is how i heard of this movie i don't really know if it was in the theater's at all i don't recall the name i have seen it it is like one of those after school specials the acting is ok not great the plot was kind of weak and the lines were pretty corny so the only comment i can give this movie is eh i borrowed the movie from jeremy if i was in a movie rental place this is one that i would walk past and after watching it i wouldn't recommend it to anyone past middle school age i've also noticed that many times when urban kids are portrayed the slang is overused or just outdated many times i think thats what makes their characters unbelievable
<START> this movie took me by complete surprise i watched it 2 or 3 times i really liked this film there were many truths this movie brought up i love all the characters in this film as well this movie makes a lot of sense because as society becomes more advance what does the culture loose not to sound preachy i can really relate to this movie from my child hood and loosing apart of my life that will never come back or ever been the same this film is on my top 5 movies i have ever watched there is just such a raw truth that i feel when i watch the movie and its not the kind of truth that you have to dig for its right in front of your face the creators of this film did a great job and i enjoyed this movie very much this movie may not be for every one but if you have an open mind i think you will love it
<START> sometimes you need to see a bad movie just to appreciate the good ones well that's my opinion anyway this one will always be in the bad movie category simply because all but shu qi's performance was terrible br br martial angel tells of cat shu qi a professional thief turned straight after leaving her lover chi lam julian cheung two years before but her past returns to haunt her as chi lam is kidnapped for the ransom of security software belonging to the company cat works for in order to rescue him she calls on her old friends from her orphanage days six other feisty women to save the day br br i may have told the synopsis cheesily but this is a cheesy story in fact the whole script and direction lacked any quality at all much of the dialogue was meaningless and coupled with a plot that was as thin as rice paper in water if i could sum it up take a bad jackie chan movie remove the comedy remove the choreography throw away the budget and you have martial angels a formulaic piece of work with no imagination at all br br mind you i do have to give credit where credit's due and shu qi was probably the only person to emerge unscathed from the terrible action as it was her performance that shone through okay you can't say she was excellent after all she had absolutely nothing to work with but she did manage to dig some character out from her role other than that only sandra ng and kelly lin made any other impression although these were mostly glimmers and very brief br br elsewhere the film just fell to pieces scenes and dialogue were completely unnatural and unbelievable special effects were obviously done on the cheap with no attempt to clean up edges between persons and the mask of the blue screen poor editing involving numerous discontinuities in fight scenes camera angles that were elementary and unflattering and direction i've seen better from a lost dog br br i guess this film was a too many cooks affair most probably the budget was blown away on the over enthusiasm to have seven babes on the same silver screen that didn't leave much else br br frankly the way this film was made was like a cheap porn movie without the porn charlie's angels it ain't in fact while sisters can do it for themselves none of that was really that apparent here br br definitely one to forget
<START> this is my first review on imdb i didn't really want to write one but since there are only 2 for this great movie right now i feel compelled to add my perspective and no i'm not associated to the movie makers in any way yeah yeah how often did you here that before fyi i'm in my late 20s br br 1st of all i have to admit i really like animated movies because what you see is only limited by the imagination of the creators and they were pretty imaginative on this one not so much in terms of story but in achieving a very unique and imo fresh visual style the characters look good but far from real and it works well for the movie after all it's a fairytale like world but the backgrounds and the world in general is filled with awesome visuals that my jaw dropped several times while watching this the blue bunny like mini dragon steels the show and has easily some of the funniest moments of the movie he is already an instant classic much as scrat from ice age the story is not too surprising a bunch of anti heroes have to go out and slay the biggest dragon you can imagine but who cares if the movie looks and sounds that good 1 thing i have to point out imo the movie is not suited for very young children because it has some darker scenes in it and maybe frightening for kids under 6 8 i would say these are only very few scenes but worth mentioning imo anyway i had a great time watching this and can't wait for it to hit the stores in high def to watch it over and over again just for the sheer beauty of it br br 8 5 for me
<START> across the great divide which we call understanding there is still much we do not know about that which was explained by the early tribal elders in every instance there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much conversely there are those who warn us of not preparing for what they warn is the 'end time ' in this movie called the last wave an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason when those responsible are arrested they remain silent less they disturb the order of things david burton richard chamberlain plays the defense attorney assigned to defend the accused although haunted by prophetic images from his own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by an sympathetic aboriginal named chris lee david gulpilil burton proceeds to defend the infraction as tribal law and therefore not subject to standard justice the movie is fraught with puzzling dark foreboding images of apocalyptic end world disasters and warns of a future island tsunami and doom black drama and deep rituals are what gives this film it's frightening allure and therefore is not for the faint hearted in fact the simplest haunting apparitions can last for years in the nightmares of innocent movie goers good silent drama
<START> i must say i thought i had seen it all i am an extremely jaded movie buff this movie didn't shock me by any means i'm way past that point but it did take me to certain emotional places i didn't know i could go to i had no idea i could ever find ick the idea of beastiality erotic never never never ever ever but there you go he did it i have to give the director credit he pulled it off br br for the first 40 minutes this movie is a total bore we start off with some very explicit footage of two horses having sex after five minutes of this i started wondering if buying this movie wasn't a mistake then an old guy in a wheelchair talks to some other old guy about two people getting married then some nervous guy shaves then we see briefly a hot chick getting it on with a butler but this is very brief at this point i was cursing the movie out loud while trying to stay awake in fact i fell asleep at about the 40 minute mark and forced myself to finish it the next night br br we finally get the good stuff when a girl who knows who she is or who anyone is in this movie has a dream about a victorian era gal being ravaged by a beast thing in the forest the scene goes on for quite some time and is really the meat heh heh of the whole deal it's beautifully shot superbly edited and does deliver the goods they do try to wrap up the plot at the end and it sort of makes sense but sort of doesn't either oh well i would definitely recommend this film the first 40 minutes made me want to shoot myself and my tv but the last 50 minutes totally redeems it
<START> the comment by eliz7212 1 hits the proverbial nail on the head for this turkey of a program but it is a hoot to watch william shatner cavort and dance yes the marks on the word dance are necessary for what bill does this show would be a great skit on snl or mad tv and it does rate a few stars for one viewing or so to see shatner who seems to have taken camp to new heights whether in a role or as himself but the guy is funny br br the girls who are in the cubicle areas with the game data scrolls will be pretty much out of luck when this turkey is canceled unless there is a revival of the whiskey a go go genre with a resurrected demand for shapely young women to dance in elevated cages once more br br i watched the first contestant who was annoying and literally dumber than a post yet through sheer luck walked away with a quarter mil or so the second contestant somewhat more intelligent but who'd be lucky to gain 1 000 on jeopardy got zonked by the card which requires answering a special question which he didn't know and thereby left with zilch br br this plethora of game shows which dangle and sometimes award large sums to everyday individuals are admittedly a cheap effort overall to attempt to woo viewers even if the host is well compensated and they give away six figures in an average episode i suppose that the revenue versus costs can be favorable since you don't have a sitcom cast where several stars are getting six or seven figures per episode with some big residual deals as well br br but i suspect even the better ones will wear thin before long this one has already pretty much reached this point i think his offerings especially with james spader and the others on boston legal should give us a satisfying quantity of bill shatner's offerings br br again the above rating is simply appropriate to view bill hoot and prance perhaps one time that should be sufficient
<START> what a master piece to take the cold war conflict and transport it to the future this film is satire of the highest order in my humble opinion it outranks dr strangelove br br the clever naming of the two superpowers as the confederation and the market cons being commies and market the west outstanding the clever use of gen joxs was ahead of its time only are we really seeing the dangers of genetic engineering robot joxs tackled the issue head on in 1989 br br the message of this film is about the comradeship of the humble man and how it can overcome the wishes of government this movies screams don't do it you fools you'll kill us all br br excellent 10 10
<START> many mystery stories follow the standard whodunit path murder most foul gathering of clues gaggle of possible perps sprinkling of red herrings and inevitable showdown between clever evildoer and even more clever crime solver br br forgotten abandons the well trod and gives us complex characters who may or may not have committed terrible acts the fact that at the end of three episodes we have no easy answers and no neatly tied package might frustrate some but for me it was the indication of an intelligently crafted tale which probes disturbs and haunts with the question what does an evil person look like br br excellent acting and production combine to make a mystery not easily forgotten
<START> the movie has a good start portraying an interesting and strong shannon lee and introduces two very simpathetic side characters through the first half but later something happens and all the sudden shannon turns into this straight faced second hand bad girl and the movie gets lost in it's own context the second half lacks any kind of charisma and is full of clichÃ©s bad acting a horrible plot and even worse stunt coordination not to mention the horrible actors they chose for the chechen mafia gang br br game of death 2 was bad and clownified bruce but his daughter tops it making an even bigger embarrassment of herself than the double who played bruce lee back then i truly believe that she can do much better than this and i hope she participates in a better production next time br br if you are a real hard core action fan and don't care about quality go ahead and see this movie i was personally looking forward to it but just got terribly disappointed
