<START> panic delivers the goods ten fold with oscar caliber performances from william h macy neve campbell and donald sutherland in a movie about the choices we make and the consequences we live with chillingly honest and thought provoking panic is easily one of the best film to come out of hollywood in years the impact stays with you right after you leave the theater
<START> a friend gave it to me saying it was another classic like debbie does dallas nowhere close i think my main complaint is about the most unattractive lead actress in porn industry ever even more terrible is that she is on screen virtually all the time but i read somewhere that back in those days porn had to have some artistic value i was unable to find it though see it only if you are interested in history of development of porn into mainstream or can appreciate art in porn movies i know i am not but the director of the movie appears to be a talented person he even tried to get simon garfunkel to give him permissions to use his songs of course they rejected
<START> claire denis's chocolat is a beautiful but frustrating film the film presents a very interesting look at the household of a european colonial family living in cameroon giving the viewer an informative perspective on the lives of many characters and their interaction however the development of these characters is often maddeningly insufficient for example a central theme in the story is young france's inability to form strong relationships with others although this portrayal is executed flawlessly notably in the way that denis frames the story with scenes from france's return to her childhood home the girl's lack of intimacy with the film's other characters makes it difficult for a viewer to invest much interest in her development or lack thereof as a protagonist the general stagnation of the film's character development makes it difficult to become engaged in the loosely organized plot the film raises a great deal of tension between characters particularly between aimee and the men in her life but never fully addresses this social friction leaving the viewer unsatisfied the final few scenes are powerful but depressing denis's work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical standpoint but if you are looking for a film with adventure or drama chocolat is definitely not the best choice
<START> i saw this important intense film tonight its richard gere and claire's dane's most important and best work gere deserves an oscar for his fine portrayal of a man being forced into early retirement as a sex offender registrar administrator claire danes is riveting as the woman gere handpicks to replace him a woman he tries to teach all he can while investigating one final case in which gere's character is convinced one of those he is charged to monitor may be holding a young girl hostage the subject matter is shocking sex offenders and those who monitor them but this film will not soon be forgotten i know i will be haunted by gere's portrayal for a very long time not since anthony hopkins portrayal of a serial killer has a screen portrayal terrified and so engaged me the film opens with a shocking statistic so don't miss the opening credits intense and memorable richard gere's finest role proving the man can act danes can as well and both do extraordinarily well in this often challenging film br br this is a gutsy film and gere gives a multi layered deeply felt performance just give him the oscar now he deserves it
<START> smallville episode justice is the best episode of smallville it's my favorite episode of smallville
<START> i have seen this film several times and watched it today on tcm solely because of geraldine fitzgerald she is a much underrated actress and i have to admit i have had a crush on her since i first saw her probably in wuthering heights 40 or more years ago the real star in this movie however is paul lukas and he deserved all the accolades he got he makes it clear whether we like it or not that the end justifies the means naziism had to be stopped and anything that helped do it was good he gave his children a line about being bad and that they should not be bad but as he said earlier when conversing with adults he would do this sort of thing again without hesitation lukas did give an excellent portrayal of a man caught in this situation and made it clear that what he did was a very hard thing to do br br some people think his victim was a nazi but i don't think so i think he was only after the money his nazi associates knew this and that is why they did not have much use for him br br one interesting point in the film and presumably also in the play is the fact that muller lucas is a german while the anti german hysteria of wwi was not repeated in wwii there was considerable anti german sentiment and some germans were interred similar to what happened in california with people of japanese ancestry it was something of an act of bravery for hellman to write a play about good germans at this time maybe she thought they were the ones who signed the nazi soviet pact after all the us and british air forces were bombing german cities and having no qualms about killing innocent civilians i think however that the dresden bombing and firestorm happened later after watch on the rhine was released br br the title is something of a play on words as the watch is looking west from germany in fact watch am rhein was a german army marching song used in wwii but the nazis had their own marching song that was used as well but muller is a german and he is engaged in his own wach am rhein br br all the other actors did an excellent job here although bodo was too much there are children like him i am surprised he did not give his father's secret away in real life he may very well have done so
<START> this is the first must see film i've seen in the last year it's wickedly funny incredibly original unbelievably great looking they went for this super cool wide screen technicolor look that's awesome to behold and it actually has depth in character and in what it says about society it's really smart satire that nails everything from homeland security to race issues while at the same time leaving you laughing and realizing how much are world lives in fear carrie anne moss turns in a comedic performance i never imagined would come from her she's sweet funny and sexy billy connolly is great as fido who can only grunt and moan and dylan baker as the dad is priceless in fact the whole cast is perfect henry czerny as the bad guy tim blake nelson as the neighbor with the hot sexy zombie girlfriend getting the idea now funny though provoking and just all round amazing go and see this movie it's like nothing you've ever seen before
<START> flame in flame out that seems to be gammera in a nutshell a prehistoric creature who can take it and dish it out with equal abandon i'm not a fan of japanese monster films but wound up committed to viewing all the flicks on the fifty film dvd sci fi collection put out by mill creek treeline films it's a great value at about twenty five bucks so at fifty cents per movie it really boils down to an investment in time to watch some of the goofy offerings br br gammera is riled from a centuries long slumber by a nuclear blast and he's not happy like godzilla he takes it out on tokyo setting the united nations into motion to try and come up with a plan to save the planet they arrive at 'plan z' the hope of the world and wouldn't you know it there's a scene where a huge shed is shown that's called the 'z plan' building that was a nice touch br br by the mid 1960's this country still wasn't quite politically correct one of the american military scenes at the alaskan air defense sector has general arnold asking a female sergeant to make coffee i guess there weren't any privates around br br good old gammera was quite the sight though walking around on two legs and going for the flame throwing routine when challenged that's why it surprised me how plan z managed to capture turtle man in the nose cone of a hidden space ship whisking him off to mars to save the world high fives all around for the american and russian team that made the save now let's get back to the cold war br br like godzilla gammera spawned at least a good dozen films but having seen this one pretty much satisfies my interest in flying flaming turtles especially since that dvd pack i mentioned earlier has attack of the monsters with a featured guest appearance by the big g it took all i had to make it through to the end of both films it was such a relief to get to the final frame in this one that said 'gammera sayonara
<START> considering the potential this move had the reality was disappointing while it's always nice to see jennifer aniston in a movie even that couldn't turn this around most of the action was predictable the jokes were flat to mildly amusing and the characters were not very interesting i wanted to like this film but it just never happened ben stiller was hilarious in there's something about mary here it looks like he's just going thru the motions if they have to lift plot points from friends they should have known something was wrong the toilet humor should have stayed in the closet br br watch 50 first dates instead
<START> entertaining jim belushi vehicle a modern cockeyed version of it's a wonderful life michael caine plays a sort of angel who lets belush see what life would have been like if he had made it big jim is at his best with a good story and supporting cast seems like real chemistry between him and hamilton not an oscar contender but good warm hearted fun
<START> the only good thing about people i know is that it serves as a perfect example of movies that al pacino should avoid performing in the first big turn off i had was the way in which pacino tried to portray a georgia accent at times it was weak and unattractive while in other segments it seemed too overdone dialogue and character interaction was terrible along with a weak plot the supporting cast did an extremely perfunctory job in keeping the movie interesting and within an hour i still saw no signs of a sturdy plot the story overall is a real bore and i had to slap myself in the face a few times to keep myself awake br br this movie will surely bore you as well avoid at all costs
<START> probably bigas luna's finest achievement for it achieves a delicate balance between sleaze eroticism and surrealism the delicious mathilda may who spent most of tobe hooper's lifeforce in the buff is the object of young biel duran's pre teen lust he can't get may's breasts out of his mind and wants so badly to suckle them and suckle the breasts of his own mother too his pursuit of may is the film as in luna works such as lulu and jamon jamon the director brings a slightly warped sexual sensibility to his strange but beautiful tale the usual suspects will be offended but those with open minds will enjoy this frothy erotic poem to the female breast josÃ© luis alcaine's images are gorgeous and nicola piovani's score is sweet and rich a gorgeous cinematic confection with a delightfully anarchic sensibility that the spanish do so naturally
<START> this film is terrible the story concerns a woman trying to find out what has happened to her sister the film struggles with its identity lurching from noir thriller to erotic with elements of horror thrown in for good measure the film has a very confused structure for example with frequent use of flashbacks without tying these into the story the plot is poorly developed and the characterisation made it difficult to distinguish between who was who and the part they were playing some implausibilities exist in many films but the scene where the main protagonist willingly accompanies a virtual stranger to his home then agrees to go upstairs alone to where he says she will find a phone minus the gun she had brought with her to call the police was too hard to believe some of the cinematography is very poor we were watching on a 42 tv so how anyone with a smaller set could work out what was happening in the scenes taken in almost complete darkness is beyond me overall a chaotic mess
<START> well this is a typical straight to the toilet slasher film br br long story short a bunch of teenagers young adults becoming stranded in the middle of creepy woods and get hacked down by naked nymphomaniac demons br br this movie has all the basics for this slasher fromage br br naked women teens or young adults being marooned in someplace spooky gory death scenes the last survivor being a well built young woman who will always show off her midriff but never bra less a creepy crazy man who knows about the evil lesbian kiss scene sex being a killer no plot br br even then for a cheesy slasher film it was really terrible the atmosphere is totally dead nothing not even the sexually explicit scenes and nudity was enough to keep the male and lesbian female audience interested watching it felt like it was being watched with a nasty head congestion or a nasty head cold br br give the demonic 0 10
<START> this early version of the tale 'the student of prague' was made in germany in 1913 starring paul wegener who was also in 'the golem' a few years later in this film he plays a dual role technically impressive for a 95 year old film to see them in the same shot after meeting a mysterious old man who makes a pact with him for gold the gold he needs to woo a countess he's previously saved from drowning br br moving at a fast pace the film runs just over an hour and fairly well written and characterised 'the student of prague' has echoes of the faust legend as well as dr jekyll and mr hyde starting as it does with a pact with a mysterious figure of potential evil and developing into good and evil sides of the same person
<START> the movie starts little cute there are a number of revolting scenes people in toilets good actors wasted and the original television series has all but ruined here this did not need to be crude br br forget it find the tv show disney at new low
<START> louise brooks gives a wonderful performance in this well made french melodrama she plays a typist named lucienne who despite being in love with a man named andre dreams of rising above her position in life she sees opportunity in a beauty contest for miss europe but andre is furious when he discovers that she's entered then demands that she withdraw she tries to take back her entry only to discover that she's already been chosen as miss france and will now go on to the main pageant br br this is a story of love loss and decision played out to its passionate end the movie is very energetically filmed by director augusto genina and cinema tographers rudolf mate and louis nee the filming style is more like modern movies than the hollywood flicks of the '30s and shows the different style employed by europeans there are many fast cuts and traveling shots mostly done with great skill and verve the high energy of the movie's first third dwindles a bit in the middle but picks up again in the last 15 minutes br br the performances were very good by all the principals but that of louise brooks is especially memorable louise leans heavily on her silent screen skills even though this is a talkie but because her silent style had a surprisingly contemporary understated feel she makes the transition to talkies very well the long early scene at the fair was especially poignant as louise used her remarkably expressive eyes to convey her growing sense of misery and alienation of being trapped in a life she no longer wants i doubt it's ever been done better br br the film builds to a superb finale artfully shot powerful and stylish this is really some of the best stuff of the early days of film and the tragic storyline only underscores the greater tragedy that this is the final starring role for louise brooks she wasn't just a great beauty who looked fantastic in a swimsuit she really was a major acting talent who basically threw it all away we are all the poorer for that br br this movie is less well known than her german films with g w pabst but i think it's a better one i think this crew is just better at storytelling than pabst and while prix de beaute may lack the deep moral complexity of the pabst films it's much easier to follow and is overall a more streamlined focused piece of work and it doesn't hurt that louise's singing parts are done by edith piaf either br br bottom line this is a classic louise brooks film well worth looking for
<START> first saw this movie in about 1990 and absolutely died laughing through it it became a cult favorite with my circle of friends and we'd quote from it at the drop of a hat i'm going home in a bag needless to say the humor is still there 15 years later it's become a tradition at halloween time to expose many of my new friends to this film good thing you can still buy it off ebay i've found that halloween candy tastes much better with your tongue planted firmly in your cheek and this movie provides it all pathos suspense unrequited love nobility and the list goes on royal dano provides an amazing heartfelt performance as old man wrenchmuller i remember seeing him in the 7 faces of dr lao as a bad guy who met a bad end here you really feel for the old guy right from the beginning br br if you aren't careful you'll miss some of the levels of humor in this movie the creators got real subtle in many ways with offhand comments little subtle costume digs at other sci fi movies and even a scene ripped from the pages of wile e coyote br br don't spend too much thought processes trying to analyze a movie people this is fun fare without the need for nitpicking and shouldn't be offensive to anyone well maybe stupid people but they won't know they're being mocked br br now if you'll excuse me i'm gonna go get a 'zag nut' bar br br ramsay rc cowlishaw karaoke dj entertainer
<START> what an empty and lack lustre rendition of the classic novel i do wish people would stop messing about with classics when they clearly have no idea of the real intention or point of the original this version is no different i felt that the ralph fiennes version is much worse though as the casting of juliette brioche as kathy has got to be the worst casting decision ever anyway back to this version it aims to make the story relevant to a contemporary setting and in a musical style it succeeds in both but high art it is nit throwaway viewing for a rainy day maybe the direction was average and the editing abysmal worse than the old quincy deepak verma does a great turn as hindley and is in fact one of britains wasted talents the part of heath was played with great charm and belief and i think that the casting is the strongest point of this project although a more talented director would have made better use of the facilities he had its clear that he was a director for hire and didn't instill the project with the passion that it deserved
<START> this is another gem of a stand up show from eddie izzard you cannot fail to laugh at the wide range of topics he talks about he even takes the piss out of his american audiance at times and most of them didnt even realise it a must see for anybody who likes comedians 9 out of 10
