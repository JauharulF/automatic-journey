<START> i have just finished watching this film in my gcse history class it was thrilling and was a brilliant insight to what actually happened to steve biko during the time of the apartheid law how anybody can say that this film was the most boring or dull 2 and a half hours of their lives i don't know because it had me hooked from start to finish it was great how denzel washington portrayed him and showed how he was fighting against the apartheid law and to get equal rights for black people in one part steve biko says to a policeman we are just as weak and human as you are this is to show them that he and all of the other black people in south africa were no different to the whites donald woods inspired me because he fort for what he believed in and did not believe totally in apartheid he and steve biko formed a very strong friendship that shook south africa and went on to awaken the world i very much enjoyed this film and strongly recommend this to people it helped me see that racism is not right and that everybody is equal their fate should not be determined by the colour of somebody's skin n
<START> this film really got off to a great start it had the potential to turn into a really heartrending romantic love story with cinematography that recorded the love between harlan and tobe in long poetic and idyllic scenes it really didn't need to be anything more than that and for a moment there i became excited that someone was finally making a beautiful film for its own sake another timeless classic a modern myth perhaps why oh why then mess it up halfway through by making the lead character norton another psycho maybe i'm missing the point but do we really need another film about psychos or is this need in hollywood to portray the sick side of human nature indicative of a more general malaise in the movie industry for a moment there i was going to make a mental note of the director's name now i'm left feeling indifferent at least it should be added in the film's defense that all the actors seemed to invest in their roles also evan rachel wood is really lovely to look at and a good actress with lots of potential
<START> slash flicks come few and far between now a days so when i heard about cut i had high hopes and heard good things about it those good things i heard were all wrong very wrong this flick is bad and i mean bad it's just plain stupid everything about it especially the killer's origin and how he stays alive and how he is taken care of in the end there is nothing original or outstanding about this flick just another slasher wannabe with those hip self aware movie savvy characters i'm so sick of that crap someone do something different cause the slash genre needs new blood literally
<START> in le million rene clair one of the cinema's great directors and great pioneers created a gem of light comedy which for all its lightness is a groundbreaking and technically brilliant film which clearly influenced subsequent film makers such as the marx brothers lubitsch and mamoulian the plot a witty story of a poor artist who wins a huge lottery jackpot but has to search frantically all over town for the missing ticket is basically just a device to support a series of wonderfully witty comic scenes enacted in a dream world of the director's imagination br br one of the most impressive things about this film is that though it is set in the middle of paris and includes nothing actually impossible it achieves a sustained and involving fairy tale fantasy atmosphere in which it seems quite natural that people sing as much as they talk or that a tussle over a stolen jacket should take on the form of a football game another memorable element is that le million includes what may be the funniest opera ever put on film o that blonde braided soprano i laugh ha ha also a delight is the casting clair has assembled a group of amazing sharply different character actors each of them illustrating with deadly satiric accuracy a bourgeois french type so that the film seems like a set of daumier prints come to life br br the hilarity takes a little while to get rolling and i found the characters not as emotionally engaging as they can be even in a light comedy as they are for instance in many lubitsch films for these reasons i refrained from giving it the highest rating but these minor cavils shouldn't distract from an enthusiastic recommendation br br should you see it by all means highly recommended whether you want a classic and influential work of cinema or just a fun comedy
<START> this is a family film which to some people is an automatic turn off it seems that too many people do not want to see films that are not loaded down with failing arms and legs gratuitous violence and enough expletives to fill the new york phone book this film is none of those it is clichÃ© it is formula but it is also fun it doesn't ask you to think it doesn't demand that you accept the film as reality it simply does what a good film ought to do which is to willingly suspend disbelief for two hours and enjoy the adventure the cast is good while not excellent as another commenter pointed out the john williams sound score was as usual excellent and the fact that a lot of the film was shot in huntsville at the real space camp made it even more believable br br it was ironic that the original release of the film was delayed for some months due to the challenger shuttle disaster which may have played a large part in it's original theatrical opening but the film eventually has helped to focus the dreams of many young people back towards space and the possibilities that lie therein so sit back with your kids and prepare to enjoy
<START> i gave it a 2 just because natassia malthe as the vampiress quintana looks sooooo sexy in this movie br br certainly there is very little logic to this movie but so are most of the sci fi vampire flicks the movie probably tried too much to break away from the traditional vampire stories unfortunately it went too far and made the whole story not just unreasonable but ridiculous br br there is too much gore and too many rip off the body scenes that made me feel sick a good vampire movie should be more sensible that you don't need to see a lot of blood we all know when a vampire jumps on a human he she is going to do what a vampire will do a few moans or screams are all it needs to describe the scene like the one at end when quintana tries to sexually arouse rosa all it needs is a few moans the rest is your imagination anyway it's just my personal taste
<START> 'presque rien' 'come undone' is an earlier work by the inordinately gifted writer director sÃ©bastien lifshitz with the collaboration of writer stÃ©phane bouquet the team that gave us the later 'wild side' as we come to understand lifshitz's manner of storytelling each of his works becomes more treasureable by allowing his tender and sensitive love stories to unfold in the same random fashion found in the minds of confused and insecure youths time now time passed time reflective time imagined time alone lifshitz makes his tales more personal involving the viewer with every aspect of the characters' responses it takes a bit of work to key into his method but going with his technique draws us deeply into the film br br mathieu handsome and gifted jÃ©rÃ©mie elkaÃ¯m is visiting the seaside for a holiday a time to allow his mother dominique reymond to struggle with her undefined illness cared for by the worldly and wise annick marie matheron and accompanied by his sister sarah laetitia legrix their distant father has remained at home for business reasons weaving in and out of the first moments of the film are images of mathieu alone looking depressed riding trains speaking to someone in a little recorder we are left to wonder whether the unfolding action is all memory or contemporary action br br while sunning at the beach mathieu notices a handsome youth his age starring at him and we can feel mathieu's emotions quivering with confusion the youth cÃ©dric stÃ©phane rideau follows mathieu and his sister home continuing the mystery of attraction soon cÃ©dric approaches mathieu and a gentle introduction leads to a kiss that begins a passionate love obsession mathieu is terrified of the direction he is taking rebuffs cÃ©dric's public approaches but continues to seek him out for consignations the two young men are fully in the throes of being in love and the enactment of the physical aspect of this relationship so very necessary to understanding this story is shared with the audience in some very erotic and sensual scenes yet as the summer wears on mathieu a committed student realizes that cÃ©dric is a drifter working in a condiment stand at a carnival it becomes apparent that cÃ©dric is the dionysian partner while mathieu is the apollonian one in a telling time in architectural ruin mathieu is excited by the beauty of the history and space while cÃ©dric is only interested in the place as a new hideaway for lovemaking br br mathieu is a complex person coping with his familial ties strained by critical illness and a non present father a fear of his burgeoning sexuality and his nascent passion for cÃ©dric their moments of joy are disrupted by cÃ©dric's admission of infidelity and mathieu's inability to cope with that issue and eventually they part ways time passes family changes are made and mathieu drifts into depression including a suicide attempt the manner in which mathieu copes with all of these challenges and finds solace strangely enough in one of cÃ©dric's past lovers pierre nils ohlund brings the film to an ambiguous yet wholly successful climax br br after viewing the film the feeling of identification with these characters is so strong that the desire to start the film from the beginning now with the knowledge of the complete story is powerful lifshitz has given us a film of meditation with passion conflicts with passion's powers found in love and a quiet film of silences and reveries that are incomparably beautiful the entire cast is superb and the direction is gentle and provocative lifshitz is most assuredly one of the bright lights of film making in french with english subtitles highly recommended grady harp
<START> the movie is bad nothing special just a kid movie with no serious thing in it there is though one reason to watch this for the animal talk some of them are so funny in what they say you just can't stop laughing so if you want to hear a dog in the dog pound saying i'm keyser soze or another animal saying you're a dead cat walking or many other funny one liners see it cause there's no other good movie to watch it vote 4 out of 10
<START> assassin hauser's john cusak mission is to whack a mid eastern oil minister whose name happens to be omar sharif neikov in the country of turaqistan which is run by american interests hauser poses as trade show producer to allow him to get to omar br br sometimes a satire can be so overdone it becomes most annoying here it does too much the government politics music war people not generally accepted by society and did i mention war and that is what we have here a most annoying movie that borders on a very bad nightmare brought to life i am still asking myself why i continued with the dvd also there are so many cusak family members in this that john cusak appears embarrassed by the family just being there or is that just me br br it used to be that a john cusak movie while a little offbeat was in the end rather good not here believe that john cusak had a hand in the writing and producing of this mess make of that what you will br br there is too much going on in the movie accompanied by constant gun fire bombings and shouting that you really cannot focus or was that the point probably it just takes too long to set up the hit which is largely forgotten until the last 15 minutes in the meantime we have meaningless banter among all in the cast and chemistry between john cusak and marisa tormei i don't think so but you know the boy Â girl thing ÂÂand they needed something to take up more time br br yes for what they were supposed to be offbeat and annoying the performances of duff and kingsley were good but when i saw dan aykroyd's character in the beginning of the show sitting on a toilet taking a dump i knew the rest of the show would go to the tank as well i was not wrong i am sure some will sing praises of this effort but if a rose is still a rose by any other name so too is a messÂÂÂÂÂ br br i now remember why i continued with the dvd i was hoping that the story would somehow level out and save itself never did br br violence yes sex no nudity no language yes
<START> this film is lame lame lame it takes a lot to bring me to over exaggeration about a movie but this movie stunk up my house i haven't even finished the movie yet and i had to stop to comment on how bad this movie is i've never done that as a consumer do not spend your money on this film wait until it comes out on a cable channel or something it's barely tv worthy i really hate trashing a movie but this movie is trash barely above porn should have and x rating good plot some frontal nudity if that floats your boat but horrible high school level acting don't know how this movie received distribution must have been a contractual thing really if you really like watching good movies don't waste you time with this one from one movie lover to another you will be mad at yourself let me say this as well if you've been through something like this perhaps you can relate and it will have some value for you in that case i say watch it you may take something away from it if not just seeing something that's happened to you being acted out by someone else has therapeutic value
<START> i'm not a writer or an critic i'm just a student that has seen this movie few minutes ago and i want to thank people that worked on creating this movie it is not the best or the most but it touched my heart why i would like to understand it myself it is easy and accessible it is a movie that makes you feel good after a bad day without any regret about the time wasted on watching it it is about love and caring about the life that we have but we miss it sometimes because of material stuff look at all the time that we have but we miss it why a fu k do we do that we need to live like were dying care about every second and remember if we do good things good things come back to us happiness is real and it has a special taste in new york i love this town and the world the we live in thank you very much for the movie and sorry for my mistakes english is my second language
<START> there's an inexhaustible hunger for basic training movies so it's surprising that this one got so little notice when first released looks likely to have a well deserved second life on dvd vhs br br tigerland isn't uniformly great by any means there are some terribly cliched characters especially the portrayal of the nco's makes you long for the return of lee 'full metal jacket' ermey but the lead performance of colin farrell is the stuff of instant stardom charisma to burn and a role any actor would kill to get
<START> quick and simple i love this movie br br as some others have mentioned i also am not from the south don't really care for country music and have never worn a cowboy hat i've never drove around in a car with a dead body in my trunk either but i love goodfellas this is just great film making shot in a 2 35 aspect ratio and beautifully transfered to dvd the vhs was 1 33 full screen and yes a solid 5 1 mix for your viewing pleasure what can you say about this movie br br it's just a great love hate story set in texas with great performances travolta is fantastic next to pulp fiction it's the best thing he's done it's been in my top 5 for 25 years br br check this one out it's a 10
<START> franco rossi's 1985 six hour italian mini series of quo vadis is a very curious beast creating an absolutely convincing ancient roman world shot in matter of fact fashion very few long shots no big cityscapes but playing the drama down so much in favour of allusions to classical literature and history that the story constantly gets lost in the background br br the shifting structure much of episode one is played out via voice over letters and lack of narrative urgency makes the full six hour version simultaneously demanding and undemanding and certainly far too often uninvolving but it has something going for it the two main strengths are the characterisation of petronius a thankfully dubbed frederic forrest whose own voice would almost certainly flatten his dialogue as a man whose spent so long looking for an astute angle to survive court life that he's become incapable of experiencing emotion and klaus maria brandauer's unique take on nero as a wannabe actor whose every move and action is calculated on how his 'audience' will receive it elsewhere max von sydow briefly appears in a few episodes being rewarded with the show's most impressive and genuinely moving scene here he encounters a child as he attempts to leave rome it's the kind of thing the show could do with more of but it seems all too often to flatten every potentially emotional inspiring or exciting moment under it's relentlessly low key direction br br unfortunately francesco quinn makes a staggeringly anonymous hero blending in with the walls and coming over less as a roman officer than that quiet slightly gormless but inoffensive guy who works in the same office as you who never says much at office parties you know the one who you think is called dave or something like that the budgetary limitations are very visible once its meet the lions time for the christians and ursus battle with the bull is so determinedly low key that it just passes over you before the show just abruptly loses interest and suddenly ends br br not a trip i can particularly recommend i'm afraid but if you do embark on it it's one not entirely without its small rewards
<START> this is by far one of my favorite of the american pie spin offs mainly because in most of the others the main character one of the young stiflers always seems unrealistic in nature br br for example ap the naked mile you have a teenage guy surrounded by naked college chicks and has one in particular hot on his trail to rid him of his virginity problem and he ends up stopping mid deed and rides a horse back to sleep with his girlfriend who keep in mind gave him a guilt free pass for the weekend i can appreciate the romantic aspect of the whole thing but let's be realistic most people who are watching these movies aren't particularly searching for a romantic story br br whereas the most recent installment finally seems to realize who the audience is and good old erik stifler seems to wake up and smell the roses and as always mr levenstein lends his perfectly natural eyebrow humor to the equation and scored a touchdown with this new movie
<START> if you want to see a movie that terribly mixes up one latin country with any other latin country the celestine prophecy is a good example 1 perÃº not even in its most violent times has not shown polices or soldiers as much as in this film this showed a country like el salvador when civil war since i'm a peruvian who lives in lima the capital of perÃº it was too funny to me seeing the police guards here there and everywhere 2 if you have a car in perÃº and you want or need to be a taxi driver just post a sticker with the word taxi on the front glass of your car and you can drive freely in peruvian streets there are taxi companies but their rates are quite expensive no need of yellow or a black white squared band on the doors of your car well taxis in this film have that band somethin that you will never see in perÃº 3 peruvian people are not caribbean styled clothing for example when a taxi driver comes out he was wearing a guayabera cuban shirt a white hat and 40's mustaches like clark gable not one peruvian man looks like that please perÃº is not the caribbeans 4 a scene shows a woman on a street with a quite long skirt like the typical folklore dresses in latin america take a walk anywhere in perÃº and you'll never find a woman wearing like that unless you are watching a typical dance 5 cast could've been better i can not deny hÃ©ctor elizondo is a great actor but he's not a latin actor his father was basque and his mother from puerto rico but he was born in new york and his spanish is not fluent it's notorious spanish is not his first language there are dozens of very good latin actors who could've performed as cardinal sebastiÃ¡n petrus antonius general rodrÃ­guez was also a bad choice for a latin police officer it was so funny seeing elizondo and petronius in general rodrÃ­guez's office they looked like two english or american students in a spanish class making their best effort in order to pronounce spanish unsuccessfully of course castulo guerra was better in his spanish a peruvian officer who announced cardinal sebastiÃ¡n spoke a quite funny spanish too there are very good peruvian actors like augusto alvarez calderÃ³n and christian meier just to mention two out of many peruvian actors who could've performed with excellence 6 i admit that a fictional movie can let itself a license inventing cities or even countries but please when creating a name be careful when using a foreign language the town portrayed in this movie should've been called vicente and not viciente vicente is a male name and viciente has never been used 7 i disagree one user who says that this movie was filmed on locations in perÃº not one location is peruvian although the production has used in excess posters showing inca kola the peruvian soda as not few american films this one must have used any latin country after all for american producers or directors a latin place is identical to any other latin place 8 in the first scenes when john matthew settle flies to perÃº he's supposed to arrive to the only one international airport in perÃº jorge chÃ¡vez airport in lima the capital actually believe me it must be any airport in the world but peruvian airport and of course in peruvian airports there are no military or police guards 9 when this john takes a room in a peruvian hotel this one has a fan and obviously has no air conditioner please this doesn't happen in no hotel in perÃº and other latin countries unless you get a 1 star hotel 10 the rebels who fight against the government are Â¡colombians their accent was with no doubt from colombia for casting them the producers should've hired peruvian actors in few words it would've been cheaper filming in perÃº br br i could go on with more examples out of this film that led me to give it a 1 awful vote but i fell asleep after about 20 minutes from its beginning but dear producers it's not a tragedy there are many worse movies with not few mistakes just let's remember indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull and indescribable disney's the emperor's new groove the list of bad films could be endless
<START> the main reason to see this film is warren william who is in top form as the shyster campaign manager he is electric constantly finding ways to fool the public and defeat the opposing party in the midst of the biggest disasters william is a great actor i feel he never got his due bette davis as his girlfriend also shines in an under written role personally i found guy kibbee not quite right as the lame brained candidate that william and the others are trying to foist on the public he seemed more like an empty canvas than a person i would have preferred to see a real character emerge rather than a non character the story itself is implausible silly and clichÃ©d but warren william and bette davis are well worth watching
<START> i saw this movie way back when it premiered br br it was based on the notion that autistic children could communicate with typed out messages with someone else merely aiding them and guiding their hands br br then suddenly these children many of whom weren't even observing the keyboard or the screen when the messages were being typed out they could be looking up at the ceiling in some instances but their moderators were eyes glued on the keyboard began typing messages of abuse from their parents and other persons sending parents and child welfare agencies in a proberbial tizzy left and right br br this whole thing was proved a fallacy when a third person presented a folder opened it to the child and said 'type the picture you see' then as the presenter turned the folder to the moderator a fold would fall down revealing another different picture br br so while the child may have seen a dog the moderator saw something like a boat br br every time every bloomin' time the name of the picture typed was what the moderator had observed never what the child was shown br br so who was doing the typing never the child br br this movie further took a disastrous turn with as the australia poster stated the person who molested the child in the movie was in the situation trying to help the child br br had melissa gilbert never put her son in that place he wouldn't have been molested is what the movie says he was better off under her supervision br br if i turn my kid over to your organization for aid and he gets molested instead do you think i'm going to be keen to listen to anything you have to say after that not likely i think it is a safe bet that all of these accusatory messages that these kids were typing out that this movie was based on they never accused someone within their operation as took place here br br unfortunately i do recall that the movie gave a very good performance from gilbert as the mother of an autistic but other than that the movie really didn't do much br br the worst by far was the child typing at the end to patty duke and we hear the mechanical voice read back what he typed we won this child was molested if you cut my leg off and i take you to court and you are found guilty of damaging me assault whatever then that is legal justice but it doesn't bring my leg back br br at best in my condition i will view it as a hollow victory br br whatever chance this child had at what is perceived as normalcy with the autism alone is further damaged by the molestation br br a 'normal' child has enough to contend with from such an experience br br it's utterly superficial to think that you must look upon any situation and go 'we won' if that person is found guilty in court br br just a bad handling of a situation and circumstances all the way around here
<START> when this initially aired in 1984 my wife and i taped it on our very first vhs recorder i still have that aging tape which i try to watch annually it was the year my first child was born and seeing a christmas carol in this incarnation brings back fond memories of happy times many hours of which were spent with this film playing in the background i finally broke down this year and ordered a dvd which prompted me to take a moment to write this brief reaction to the movie charles dickens' story is captured in outstanding fashion here george c scott is absolutely amazing and totally believable as scrooge the supporting cast is equally spectacular this is to my mind a flawless production little details add much to the enjoyment the game similes scrooge's nephew and wife play with their party guests is a neat item i've since re created it with my high school english students as a brief respite from class work honestly i can think of few ways to entertain myself over the holidays i enjoy more than indulging in this cbs production which was originally sponsored by ibm incidentally it's fun to watch the old tape with the original ibm commercials which show just how much computers have evolved in 21 years amazing how things have changed bottom line a christmas carol is a timeless story and this rendition is a timeless classic enjoy and god bless us every one
<START> this movie is completely ridiculous not only is the plot atrocious but the acting is horrendous the special effects are asinine and the entire movie is set in a post apocalyptic desert yet it is by far the most amusing movie ever given permission to be produced it is 101 minutes of laughs due to the fact that we all know there will be no fuel in the year 3000 or any el camino's there are also other aspects which i will not spoil just because they are what makes the movies so wonderfully moronic i highly recommend this movie just because of its utter idiocy i have no idea who would watch this expecting it to be a high quality feature but if a good laugh is what you need watch exterminators of the year 3000
