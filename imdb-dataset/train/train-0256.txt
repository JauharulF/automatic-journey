<START> it was the sixties and anyone with long hair and a hip distant attitude could get money to make a movie that's how michael sarne director of this colossal flop was able to get the job sarne is one of the most supremely untalented people ever given a dollar to make a movie in fact the whole studio must have been tricked into agreeing to hire a guy who had made exactly one previous film a terribly precious 60's hip black and white featurette called joanna that film starred the similarly talentless actress waif genevieve waite who could barely speak an entire line without breaking into some inappropriate facial expression or bat like twitter sarne who was probably incapable of directing a cartoon never mind a big budget hollywood film was in way over his head david giler's book is the best place to go to find out how the faux infant terrible sarne was able to pull the wool over everyone's eyes if there is ever an historical marker which indicates the superficiality and shallowness of an era myra breckinridge provides that marker it embodies the emptiness and mindless excess of a decade which is more often remembered for a great sea change in the body politic breckinridge is a touchstone of another equally important vein watch this movie and you'll get a different perspective on the less often mentioned vacuity of spirit which so often passed for talent during those years br br many reviewers have spoken about the inter cutting of footage from other films especially older ones some actually liked these clunky comments on what was taking place in the movie others found them senseless annoying and obtrusive though since the film is so bad itself any intrusion would have to be an improvement br br in my opinion the real reason michael sarne put so many film clips into myra brekinridge was to paper over the bottomless insufficiency of wit and imagination that he possessed that is to say sarne was so imagination challenged that he just threw these clips in to fill space and take up time they weren't inspiration they were desperation his writing skills were nonexistent and david giler had wisely stepped away from the project as one might from a ticking bomb so sarne was left to actually try and make a movie and he couldn't it was beyond his slim capabilities hence the introduction of what seems like one half of an entire film's worth of clips the ghosts of writers and directors many long since passed on were called upon to fix this calamitous flopperoo because sarne sure as heck wasn't able to this was what he came up with on those days he sat on the set and thought for eight hours while the entire cast and crew not to mention the producers and the accountants cooled their heels and waited for something some great spark of imagination a hint of originality a soupcon of wit to crackle forth from the brow of zeus um oops no zeus no imagination no sparks millions of little dollar bills with tiny wings each made from the hundreds of licensing agreements required to use the clips flying out the window bye bye br br as for myself i hated the film clips they denigrated sarne's many betters poked fun at people whose talents even those whose skills were not great far outstripped the abilities of the director and so ultimately served to show how lacking he was in inspiration originality and even of plain competency compared to even the cheesiest of them
<START> that movie was awesome i can't get over it's songs i think i'm a little too old for musicals but that movie deserves some credit here guys my especial favorite was jack wild me being a british actor lover you can't restrain me from all those nice looking fresh faced young men i never knew that when jack was doing that movie he was sixteen he looks like an eleven year old he's short that's what helps try posting up your replies fellow posters so i can relate to your experiences oh and about oliver reed that guy bill sikes i think that drone look is really familiar any idea where he's starred in before if so post it up i'd really like to know
<START> way back when the x files was an intelligent thought provoking show a big part of its appeal was that the writers looked to folklore and science for their ideas tying the plot to the spooky side of real life br br i was incredibly wary of the 8th season when it aired the show had already provided two perfectly good episodes to bow out on one son and requiem and the 7th season had seen a sharp rise in episodes that scraped the barrel for ideas that were far fetched implausible or downright silly but i figured hey give it the benefit of a doubt maybe they're bringing it back because they've got some great ideas lined up br br roadrunners really was upsetting following patience which at least offered an interesting angle on the vampire folklore that the show had done well to avoid the episode sees a strange alien parasitic slug with the power of mind control worshipped by a cult of backwoods christians oh and they think it's the second coming of christ but you only find that out in the last couple of minutes seriously there's never any attempt to make sense of this to explain what the slug is why anything that's happening is happening or anything even in the show's early years in fact especially then you could expect a little bit more depth a bit of background or if not that then the opposite a bit of mystery some uncertainty about what this was all about br br it's scully that really kills it though you could put up with the silliness of the premise but to have a character who has been developed over a good 7 years as a rational skeptic transformed into a gullible maverick purely for the sake of advancing the plot is bizarre to watch you feel like you're watching some godawful teen horror except that it's a woman well into her thirties throwing herself into the kind of creepy isolated community that she's spent the best part of a decade uncovering the sinister underbelly of being either outwitted by very stereotypical hicks or utterly indifferent to her own safety oh and by the way doggett the new mudler isn't around scully just wandered off into the desert to look into a brutal murder on her own without him he shows up at the end to save the day i can't even remember why but apart from that he's not really in it again seriously br br in short it feels like either a generic script written for another show or someone's pet movie project which they've been allowed to shove like a mutant leech into the spine of an existing long running show at a time when it was at its most vulnerable it might've worked on a lesser show where the characters are more archetypal and the audience expects less but the x files had a good thing going and scully was one of the strongest and most idiosyncratic tv characters of the 90s deciding that you're going to change her personality for the sake of a story that they must've done on star trek a good fifty or so times is pointless
<START> of the ten actors who portrayed philo vance in the series edmund lowe seemed the most personable but in this script the audience is way ahead of the famed detective after all when the jockey douglas walton stares blankly in space obviously hypnotized and says something like i must ride and be killed i felt it was dumb that no one picked up on it after he does get killed the police thought it was a suicide because he said he would do it after hated horse owner gene lockhart gets shot and killed frieda inescort does the same thing saying she's going out to be killed and then fatally jumps off a bus i laughed when lowe finally yells i got it as though it were a revelation the guilty party however was cleverly concealed and there was considerable suspense generated when that party starts to hypnotize lowe to get him to jump off a roof
<START> my first exposure to whale music was the rheostatics album of the same name that i bought around 1993 i was reading the liner notes and the band said the album which remains in a prominent place in my collection was inspired by canadian author paul quarrington's book br br i picked up the book a few months later and devoured it an amazing read i have since re read the book numerous times each time finding some new element to desmond and his desire to complete the whale music br br i found the film in 1996 on video i haven't had a lot of good experiences with canadian film but this one worked for me the role of claire could have been cast differently but overall i think that paul quarrington's vision was transfered nicely from the book to the screen br br maury chaykin gives a moving performance as the isolated genius the movie deals with family relationships love and finding someone who understands i would strongly recommend whale music to not only music fans but anyone who has ever lost something or someone and tried to find their way back to the world
<START> this is one irresistible great cheerful and technically greatly made movie br br the movie features some of the greatest looking sets you'll ever see in a '30's movie even though it's all too obvious that they are sets rather than real place locations often if a character would fall or shake a doorpost too aggressive the entire set would obviously move br br the best moments of the movie were the silent more old fashioned slapstick kind of moments it shows that renÃ© clair's true heart was at silent movie making the overall humor is really great in this movie also of course the musical moments were more than great this is a really enjoyable light and simple pleasant early french musical though the best moments are the silent moments that does not mean that the movie is not filled with some great humorous dialog that gets very well delivered by the main actors who all seemed like stage actors to me which in this case worked extremely well for the movie its overall style and pleasant no worries atmosphere no wonder this worked out so well since this movie is actually based on stage play by georges berr br br it's a technical really great movie with also some great innovation camera work in it and some really great editing that create some fast going and pleasant to watch enjoyable sequences there is never a dull moment in this movie br br renÃ© clair was such a clever director who knew how to build up and plan comical moments within in movies it's a very creative made movie that despite its simplicity still at all times feel as a totally original and cleverly constructed movie that never seizes to entertain br br the last half hour is especially unforgettably fun without spoiling too much and is really among the greatest as well as most creative moments in early comedy film making br br the movie is filled with some really enjoyable characters who are of course all very stereotypical and silly and were obviously cast because of their looks it all adds to the pleasant light comical atmosphere and cuteness of the movie br br one of the most pleasant movies you'll ever see br br 8 10
<START> i'm being generous giving this movie 2 stars the line about have you even seen the wizard of oz was the best part for me with terrible writing and acting like displayed in this movie it's no wonder so many are taken in by worthless tv reality shows do yourself a favor and get out of the house and hit a royals baseball game your gonna be glad ya did
<START> this is just plain bad sometimes remakes even if they stray from the original are good on their own they can bring another viewpoint and achieve a certain interpretation that makes them unique and enjoyable this was as poorly thought out and carried out as can be this wasn't any good even standing on it's own viggo mortenson is a top notch actor but some of his selections of roles and projects leaves something to be desired the original vanishing point was such a thrilling psychological adventure this is not an adventure at all and is not enjoyable or entertaining whatsoever this was made from a by the numbers approach to film making stuffing in plot points that someone in hollywood believes will please what they see as today's film going audience basically they see us as a bunch of idiots it's insulting that someone will put this out as a feature film and even attempt to remake a cult classic this sloppily the manipulative plot devices the make it obvious so they don't miss the point aspects ridiculous dialogue stereotyped characters amateurish direction br br this is plain bad
<START> wow this was probably the worst dcom ever i watched the first half hour and i laughed brenda song plays wendy the popular girl with the hot jock boyfriend and stuck up friends who is determined to be homecoming queen she is supposed to save the world as a warrior and shin comes to her aid to help her with her martial arts shin teaches her the skills of a snake tiger etc and she has to learn certain techniques to save the world br br this movie is great for kids who want to learn about martial arts and the chinese culture but the acting and casting was horrible br br brenda song is a comedic actress and i can't see her playing a serious role it was laugh out loud funny watching her cry over shin shin couldn't act at all and everything was totally unbelievable br br i watched this movie and tried to think of something similar and the thing i came up with was the power rangers this movie is so fake and the stunts were so power ranger esquire that it was just corny and stupid the characters weren't likable and i just couldn't stand to watch it disney really needs to take time to make some decent movies high school musical is the only movie that deserves to be on disney channel along with other movies like jumping ship color of friendship go figure read it and weep stuck in the suburbs br br if you like action adventure and corny jokes you'll like this movie
<START> it is cheese if all you want is a video game complete with what look like straight from the computer cutaway sequences for action the film was too cheap to actually make special effects for this is it my friend and i actually had a great time seeing it since the theatre was mostly empty and we could heckle a bit this movie really requires heckling br br plot there was a plot ok some stupid college or later types get invited to the rave of the year and go to one of the san juan islands if they'd only stayed back in seattle they would have survived direct quote or nearly to attend they get there and everyone is gone and the site is somewhat wrecked but hey the keg is still full with the help of a crusty old captain and a coast guard woman who acted only slightly less tough and slightly less well than cynthia rothrock they fight lots of zombies some which spit acid get an earful of freaky legends and mostly get killed that's about it br br it's not quite as bad as demonicus but not by much and still better than severed they are sort of my own personal alpha and omega for bad movies the former is bad but fun to heckle and the latter is just too freaking bad to watch more than once on the other hand if you're expecting a video game movie as excellent as resident evil run away run away now br br ok some real big questions without too many spoilers since when did spanish ships of the 18th century venture into the pacific northwest why is anyone in the pacific northwest smuggling guns and to whom canada for crying out loud why is a rave on an unnamed oh excuse me it's called isla del muerto shya right san juan island and outdoors still keeping in mind this is the pacific northwet and the rave has about 30 people in attendance the rave of the year my patoot br br lucky thing there's lots of hatchets around lots of them everyone has them must be a hatchet sales outlet nearby br br finally while the movie started out playing with a little parody with nudges at i know what you did and jaws it didn't carry it through near enough br br ok really finally when the introductory comments in a voice over no less casually mention that one of the characters gave up her boyfriend to focus on her fencing you can be darn sure there'll be some fencing by the end of the movie not good fencing but a couple of people hacking at each other with swords anyway
<START> i thought it was a very funny movie i love dog movies and comedy movies so combined they were twice as good k 9 k 911 and k 9 pi are my favorite movies jim belushi is hysterical and jerry lee is hilarious and adorable they make a great team the only downside is that i really didn't understand how dooley's wife died she died before this movie but how if they said it i must have missed it other than that i give it two thumbs tails up those dogs jerry lee and zeus must have had a lot of training they were so funny and all the noises jerry lee would make when dooley was talking to him was so funny my favorite was when jerry lee sang and when he would bite peoples privates to get information very very funny lol
<START> this is a very engrossing bbc tv mini series which is loosely based upon a mysterious disappearance of a young mother but the series is really more of a study of the assorted characters in the story which lasts for five hours it is thus very much an ensemble piece where the wide variety of brilliant british actors and actresses can show off their talents the actual characters portrayed are really 'the kind of people one does not normally meet' people so boring and nondescript that it is difficult to admire them for instance the lead character is a young husband the one whose wife disappears who has no job and no apparent interest in finding any he lives off handouts from his parents in law he was once in the army but does not appear to have the slightest flicker of any ambition or any interests in life apart from doting on his small family he is played by david oyelowo who is brilliant at the part coming across as a totally sympathetic person although his only activities for five hours are loving and grieving which he does superbly so that one wants to comfort him as he is so obviously a nice guy the standout performance of the whole series is unquestionably penelope wilton who acts circles round everyone else in the story she is simply incredible she portrays a very unsympathetic woman indeed the only character in the story who is all too familiar to everyone namely an irrational hysterical self centred dense querulous blindly loving and blindly hating elderly idiot woman alas alas we know them too well wilton is one of britain's finest actresses see my review of her in 'half broken things' she takes a character who could have been two dimensional and makes her four dimensional she is wonderfully supported by old pro patrick malahide who plays her exasperated husband and the pair of them set a high standard indeed for all the younger players janet mcteer a spectacular actress when younger has become a much less sympathetic type of person now that she is older has coarsened in some way and puts one off but she redeems herself in the latter stages of the story by showing how brilliant an actress she can be when she has a chance by pulling off one of the most convincing and original drunk scenes i have ever seen on film the big surprise is the enigmatic character sarah played with great depth and originality by actress sarah smart she takes a character who could have been insufferably tedious and by sheer acting magic turns her into a deeply mysterious and intriguing person about whom we wonder tirelessly for the entire five hours she is so good at it that we end up wondering about sarah smart frankly i guess that's what happens when you really do your job properly that people wonder where the character ends and the actress begins if she knows herself that is and many do not she has some deeply unnerving tricks with her eyes which wobble and let us know she is unhinged but we are not sure how or why though we eventually learn that she had an extremely violent and traumatic childhood her mastery of ambiguous facial expressions is extraordinary rory kinnear is amazingly convincing as an apparently hopeless fellow who lives with his mum and isn't up to much but who turns out to have hidden depths i suppose most people have hidden depths but do we want to plumb them that is the question his mum is played very well indeed by margot leicester a superb performance is given by lucinda dryzek who plays a snotty revolting teenage girl of the sort we all dread to meet but who at crucial moments collapses in helpless tears and turns out to be pathetic with all her arrogance just a pose three other children are also very good lucinda's friend and her younger half brother and half sister the younger siblings may be very dim indeed as characters in the story they seem unable to say anything particularly articulate being hopeless witnesses to the disappearance with little to recommend them but their sweet natures but that is conveyed to wonderful effect by lee massey as the boy and tyler anthony as the girl harriet walter has a small role but we do not get to see much of her which is a shame as she is such a fine actress that she was wasted here one could go on but one must draw a line somewhere the series manages to be strangely fascinating because of the depth of portrayal of all these essentially uninteresting people caught up in a web of intense anxiety and suspense
<START> ok i am not japanese i do know a little about japanese culture and a little less about japanese pop culture other than that i am spanish i eat paella and i like black humor br br good with that point set i can comment on the movie i have no idea on how it is enjoyable to the japanese audiences mamoru oshii is quite a good director despite the overly pedantic postmodern stuff in the style of talking head and even that was curious and somehow interesting and i am surprised he came up with this it may just be one of those lost in translation cases i am afraid it is but as a european viewer watching the film with subtext overloaded english subtitles i just thought it was horrible the jokes seemed bad the script was overcooked i mean give the audience a break and shut up a little you damn narrator to the point of almost making my head explode over an overkill of fast paced speaking and absurd action br br however i thought the animation was really cool the idea is great and it is well exploited in those animated scenes however the eye candy finishes as soon as the characters are left aside to start with an endless not funny at all mumbo jumbo speech over still pictures it just makes you want to fast forward to the next cut out hysterical characters scene br br i read mamoru oshii is actually planning on a sequel for this the idea was good but horribly exploited maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie or maybe it will be more and more over narrated scenes but hell if you thought talking head was dense amazing lifes of fast food gifters will give cause you a stroke br br of course all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is european probably this is totally useless to japanese people maybe it was a really funny film lost in cultural frontiers and translation maybe
<START> this film was terrible i have given it the high score of 2 as i have seen worse but very few br br from the clichÃ©d start of having the end of the film at the start and going back to the start at the end this film used everything in the box of tricks used in film making just for the sake of it like a kid with too many toys there was the endless boring repetitive narration slow motion freeze frame flashbacks and merged images etc none of which made a dull film any better br br it is called 16 years of alcohol but there was little drinking or drunkeness and no depiction of withdrawal with the film jumping about all over the place with no coherent sense the story was badly written and extremely pretentious and the direction was equally poor and it is a shame that people have put up further money for more films by mr jobson previously know for being in a rubbish group and on tv making as much sense as this film does br br i found it a major struggle to see this to the end but in the hope of it getting better i carried on to the bitter but it really was a waste of time and i would have been better off not bothering
<START> i want so badly to give this piece of garbage a zero unfortunately there isn't so i had to give it a 1 just to warn you about how stupidly terrible this imposter of a familiar cartoon really is the characters look like they were drawn by pre schoolers no wait i've seen pre schoolers do better i prefer misadventures of flapjack to this terrible excuse for a cartoon i'm probably saying what others have said two words rip off remember that episode of dexter's lab when they raced go karts down that volcano yeah mister fellows even cashed in on that idea and failed they even ripped off shadow lugia in that one episode that parodied pokemon he even cashed in on that franchise that one character is a cheap rip off of mandark from dexter's lab mister fellows needs to be sued for statutory infringement for this piece of crap everyone has their own opinion but those of you who like johnny rip off test your'e just lying to yourselves do yourself a favor change the channel when this rip off tries to disgrace your screen
<START> a so common horror story about a luxury building at brooklyn which hides the gates to hell it is reminiscent of polanski's the tenant released a year before the sentinel but is too far from the movie of the polish filmmaker in any aspect possible the tenant was so disturbing whereas the sentinel is not at all br br what it's more surprising from this film is the cast it is full of great names of american cinema burguess gardner wallach veteran actors acting for food i guess br br verdict barely entertaining br br my rate 4 10
<START> i saw the trailer to this film and it looked great so i went out and bought it what a mistake the acting is a shambles the special effects if you could call them that look like something that wouldn't be out of place at a school play some of the characters are so stupid in this film you will cringe the minute they are on the screen which unfortunately is all to often as for a story forget it this is a warning don't waste any money at all on this film it has to be one of the worst things i have ever seen if for some reason you like this film watch troll 2 you will probably enjoy that as well
<START> the only film i've ever walked out on amazing since i paid for myself and my date and i'm really cheap but my brain couldn't stand any more of the dreck being piled on particularly since i could have written funnier material while tie up and gagged br br from the beginning to the end this film offends worse it ain't funny it wasn't funny then and it sure ain't funny now but even worse is that this film represents the beginning of the end of really smart sophisticated comedy it's juvenile really sophomoric script and ideas began an era which continues to this day where cheap laughs and sexual innuendo dominate the culture of comedy in film br br sexual olympics what high school kid hasn't thought of that the beginning of the end
<START> i remember hitch hiking to spain at 25 getting a lift from what turned out to be two fleeing italian small crooks they were doing a lot outside the law but from the other side carrying a little portrait of jesus in the pocket for their protection just and unjust good and bad criminal and correct where here in a new combination outside of the categories i used to know 'les valseuses' gives me although a film and not real life a picture close to my own experiences the intenseness of each moment as soon as you leave 'all behind' and go for the momentous whatever comes your way it's another state of mind and also 'dangerous' form of life because as we all know there are people who are not ready for this and willing to persecute you for 'stealing' and so on this film touches 'values' it's a story about 'what's right and wrong' morals it's resurrection of the individual fighting him herself free against the 'false morals' and conformism there's danger all the way because how far can you go with your own 'freedom' and crossing your own moral borders and that of other people what to do with people who are willing to hurt you put you in jail or even shoot at you for the things that you do like stealing some petrol from a multinational oil company for you fifth hand car les valseuses re awakens these questions in me because morality in contradiction to the usual 'media message' is quite complex
<START> ostensibly this is a z grade dtv horror film br br but with lines like br br it's easy to die i have many times br br and br br why are you reading that book because it makes the plot more interesting br br and br br you made your way in here now you can make your way out again after he leads a man into the basement br br and take a listen to what they chant br br it's not that clear what this film made in the era known for post structuralism is actually about or whether its just bad film making the acting is atrocious but some actors i know so are they hamming it up br br an old house cut obviously with a contemporary dwelling is the site of murders a bad film is made in the grounds and the story replays again
