<START> this is a beautiful rich and very well executed film with a rich and meaningful story basically it tells how an old master story teller needs to find a male heir to carry on his craft but ends up not getting what he expected in his very male dominated world the characters must then deal with their situation and the old master must grapple with the conflict between his desire for a companion and heir and his and society's traditional notions br br the story is fun emotional and complex the exploration of the characters their lives and emotions is rich and compelling the character development is strong while the characters are complex and not one dimensional at all the film expertly conveys the old man's emotions and his desire to find an heir and compellingly shows how he and the kid handle the situation there is also humour sometimes quite subtle at appropriate points the film also examines the good and bad of traditional chinese culture creating further interest and depth to the film br br the directing acting and scenery are all outstanding added to the other strengths this creates rich and convincing visual images and compelling real characters as a result the film evokes strong empathy for and feelings about the characters br br some have claimed that the ending weakens the film but i do not necessarily agree perhaps it could have been stronger with a different ending but any improvement in the overall film would have been rather small
<START> just as its a mad mad mad mad world is at the top of my list for all time greatest comedies ever made this one is at the very bottom of course i could be wrong not having seen saving silverman in other words it's a lame lame lame lame comedy br br rating 1 2 out of
<START> i see quite a few positive reviews on this board trying to revive this film from its lackluster status and starting a cult following i see the usual ranting i guess this movie is just not for the easily offended this movie is not shakespeare etc guess what neither was road trip and i laughed my a off during that movie there's a way to make a crude tasteless comedy and deliver laughs and there's a way to just make it crude and tasteless whipped tries to be swingers without the wit or intelligence it seems to have been written through the puerile eyes of a 14 year old boy for god's sake the characters in this movie are supposed to be white collar upright citizens and they talk like some of the idiots i knew in freshman year of high school the dialogue is laced more like drowned with four letter words you would think that people of their status would have some degree of intelligence and a more extensive vocabulary just watch a whit stillman film and you'll see the difference not to mention the fact that the dialogue sounds totally unrealistic and downright cartoonish if you know any successful white collar businessmen who speak like the characters in this movie please let me know and introduce me to them their annoying sexual banter is equivalent to that of standard locker room chat among teens just arriving at puberty there is absolutely no insight into relationships sex or anything it's just a poor excuse to showcase an array of extremely and don't take the word extremely for granted because i mean it with all my heart crude gags these are gags with no substance gags that are meant more for groans than laughs the scene at the end between amanda peet and her girlfriends was totally un called for and totally unconvincing there are some movies that involve interaction among females that were written by straight men and play out wonderfully this scene involves a barrage of sexual metaphors and gestures it involves the kind of dialogue you can never imagine leaving a woman's mouth it was one of those noticeably written by a guy scenes i wasn't believing it for a second br br whipped is purely a sick male fantasy that's as flat as it is annoying i got very few laughs out of this utterly forgettable comedy and those were probably a result of desperation when you're not laughing for a long period of time you desperately look for humor in the most trivial things so i wouldn't mark that down as a positive
<START> here is one the entire family will enjoy even those who consider themselves too old for fairy tales shelley duvall outdid herself with this unique imaginative take on nearly all of the popular fairy tales of childhood the scripts offer new twists on the age old fables we grew up on and they feature a handful of stars in each episode cinderella is no exception to duvall's standard and in my opinion it's one of the top five of the series highlighted by jennifer beals remember her from flashdance and she's still in hollywood today making a movie here and there in the title role jean stapleton as the fairy godmother with a southern accent and eve arden as the embodiment of wicked stepmotherhood edie mcclurg ferris bueller's day off and jane alden make for a hilarious duo as the stepsisters matthew broderick is an affable prince henry you'll all keep coming back for this one
<START> loyalty to peter falk is all that kept me from giving this awful picture the 1 it deserved for that matter loyalty to mr falk was what kept me watching this film all the way from heads to tails even if you forgive all the glaring errors this was just plain the poorest excuse for a made for tv columbo film ever i'm glad i watched it on tv for free would have hated to have coughed up the bucks for a print
<START> the peculiar charisma of martin kosleck brings a certain believability to his character of the frustrated artist he imbues his dialog with an odd sense of realism making the sculptor marcel a convincing individual the character manages to come across as a real person and not so much a typical b movie villain br br the story line is nothing to write home about and many scenes are dull what makes it work is the strange chemistry between kosleck and rondo hatton as the creeper kosleck's talkative philosophical character is contrasted with hatton's low key monosyllabic approach the character of the creeper isn't developed much beyond a basic monster level but hatton suggests undeveloped possibilities and makes you wonder about his back story br br this movie was on shock theater a lot when i was a kid so i have a certain nostalgic fondness for it it's worth seeing once anyway for those who enjoy forties horror movies
<START> full house in my opinion is an absolute abc classic i'm not sure if i've never seen every episode but i still enjoyed it one of my favorite episodes is where jesse john stamos and rebecca lori loughlin get married if you want to know how what made it so funny you'd have to have seen it for yourself it was a two parter so you'd have to have seen both parts another one of my favorite episodes is where jesse stephanie jodie sweetin and michelle mary kate ashley olsen get locked in a gas station on michelle's birthday you'd also have to have seen it for yourself if you want to know how and why that happened i have many other ones that i like too everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong in conclusion even though it can be seen in syndication now i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
<START> cutting to the chase this is one of the most amazing most intense film i've seen in a long time the first movie in years that left me absolutely staggered i could barely feel my way out of the theatre i was so overwhelmed br br i've been staring at the screen for about fifteen minutes trying to find some way to describe the power of this film and just failing highlighting any one aspect of it the documentary style video diary format the unflinching portrayal of the events the force of the characters just seems to trivialise it all some may find it laughable that any killer could be characterised as normal but then not all killers are raving lunatics foaming at the mouth many are quite regular unassuming people they're just wired differently br br and that's perhaps the most chilling thought of all
<START> of course by any normal standard of film criticism soldier is a very poor film indeed kurt russell is a futuristic super soldier raised since birth to kill but then made obsolete after being bettered by a bunch of really super soldiers at a dangly hoop ruck that looks a bit like a gladiators contest without the crash mats br br abandoned on a junk planet he's befriended by a community of naff space hippies that teach him about gardening family life and um breasts kurt doesn't talk much finally the really super soldiers turn up and kill the hippies by shooting them in the back while they're running away kurt gets angry and kills everyone a planet gets totalled the end br br unless the academy start a new category for best explosion soldier is not going to win any awards however as ludicrous as it is it remains an enjoyable experience the military hardware is the coolest since aliens the apc's especially and at 90 minutes long it doesn't outstay its welcome please note that the below mark is only a guide knock five points off if you intend to take it seriously and discount one more if you don't like miniguns br br 7 out of 10
<START> i'm a fan of the series and have read all 7 books i wanted to see this just to see how it was done all i can say is that the only people who should watch this are ones who have already read the series and are curious about it its pretty bad and will turn you off reading them not to be mean but lucy is so ugly it detracts from the movie was she the directors daughter seriously i'm sure the beavers in the movie were jealous of her teeth she had an overbite that would put any beaver to shame the movie just loses so much in translation cs books don't translate as easily as the tolkein lotr books or even harry potter br br one thing they did right aslan very well done although the other human actors with painted faces beavers wolf look silly aslan was really well done since it was not just a human actor walking around i guess its like that old horse custume 2 people inside also i would be curious what kids think of this movie maybe they would enjoy it but as for adults safe bet they wont even if a cs fan
<START> i found the dvd version of this movie at a rummage sale the basic premise is an affair between a teacher coach a student the acting is weak and the plot razor thin br br this movie had all the depth and plot development of an adult film
<START> a bloody maniac with cannibalistic tendencies rapes a woman he's been shot by two policemen and then he is risen from the grave because of some sort of satanic ceremonial rite preformed by an evil heresy the hunting of women continues by this zombie demon the sacrificed baby returns from the grave and wants the maniac dead again but only with the help of the police this will come true br br a bloody 65 minute mess horny zombies doll babies s m corrupted and twisted policemen repented heretics who seek refuge in front of jesus christ and three text screens at the end of the film explaining us what finally happened to the policeman who survived yes we ought to know two decent disemboweling shots can't save the situation i've seen worst horror flicks but this one was pretty bad too recommended only for the die very hard fans of the genre
<START> ko to tamo peva is one of the best films i ever saw a tragicomedy with very deep implications on the fate of humankind shown through the eyes of seemingly very plain and common people from a god forsaken serbian province just before the start of the world war ii i saw it in a small movie theater in russia where the film had had a very limited distribution and i had no chance to come across it ever since it is such a pity that this excellent film is almost forgotten now i searched for a vhs or dvd copy of it many times and alas could find none i would be most grateful to other fans of this little gem of movie making for a suggestion of the ways to purchase a copy
<START> when this play was first shown by the bbc over 30 years ago it would have been something quite different for the time so therefor some people would have found it quite scary and may well have been impressed with the special effects br br looking at the play in this day and age it doesn't seem to be all that scary anymore even the special effects can leave a lot to be desired br br would a train really be allowed to pass a red light into a dark tunnel i don't think so but if you watch this play again you will observe that the first train that enters the tunnel rushes straight through the red light maybe that's how it was in dickens time br br you will also notice that the footpath that leads down to the signal box is very steep and in a poor state surely there would have been a series of proper steps with handrails for the signalman to climb up or down into the cutting i can't help but notice things like that br br i will not take anything away from the acting both denholm elliott signalman and bernard lloyd the traveller gave wonderful performances br br i am not at all sure what is going on i mean was the ghost the traveller or what does anyone really fully understand this rather confusing story well maybe i am the only one that don't br br to sum up br br the play has a wonderful atmosphere throughout with great character it suffers from not being that scary these days and a little if not very confusing in places and has some rather unusual signalling practises br br thanks for reading my review
<START> errol flynn is gentleman jim in this 1942 film about boxer jim corbett known as the man who beat john l sullivan directed with a light hand by flynn's good friend raoul walsh the film also stars alexis smith jack carson alan hale sr william frawley and ward bond flynn plays an ambitious egotistical young man who has a natural talent for boxing and is sponsored by the exclusive olympic club in san francisco in the late 1800s though good natured the fact that he is a shanty irishman and a social climber builds resentment in olympic club members most of them can't wait to see him lose a fight and they bet against him despite this he rises to fame even working as an actor finally he gets the chance he's been waiting for a match with the world champion john l sullivan ward bond sullivan demands a 10 000 deposit to insure that corbett will appear to fight for the 25 000 purse corbett and his manager frawley despair of getting the money however help comes in the form of a very unlikely individual br br this is a very entertaining film and jim corbett is an excellent role for flynn who himself was a professional fighter at one time he has the requisite charm good looks and athleticism for the role alexis smith plays victoria ware his romantic interest who insists that she hates him in real life she doesn't seem to have existed corbett was married to olive lake morris from 1886 to 1895 br br the focus of the film is on corbett and his career rather than the history of boxing corbett used scientific techniques and innovation and is thought of as the man who made prizefighting an art form in the film corbett is fleet of foot and avoids being hit by his opponents it is believed that he wore down john l sullivan this way br br good film to catch flynn at the height of his too short time as a superstar
<START> this movie was absolutely pathetic a pitiful screenplay and lack of any story just left me watching three losers drool over bikini babes at times i felt like i was watching an episode of beavis and butthead i couldn't even sit through the whole movie emran hashmi disappoints and hrshitta bhatt is not impressive at all celina jaitley was not bad the only worthwhile part of the film is the spoof on anu malik and his obsession of shayaris it was pretty hilarious the songs sini ne and its remix version were really good you can always count on emran lip locking and lip synching a chartbuster all in all it seems emran doesn't have a good script from the bhatts to back him up this time
<START> the real irony is this joe besser was a top notch comedian in other situations away from the stooges he had a definite track record for being very funny and clever moe and larry and shemp had actually known him or at least of him for many years and liked his work so what on earth was going on when he joined the troop as the third stooge obviously nothing in most of these late stooge era shorts more often than not the boys are pitted against each other or joe against the other two and this is not accurate stooge etiquette one for all all for one every man for himself to quote curly from restless knights one thing about a good comedy team laurel hardy abbott costello the marx brothers no matter how much they all try to take advantage of each other or slap each other around when the chips are actually down they stick together and come to each other's aid in this particular one none of that happens it's almost like watching a dog fight as one tries to cheat the others or be mean and nasty and not for comedic effect either one might assume that there was something behind the scenes going on here art imitates life maybe there really was hence why besser did not stay very long with moe and larry just look at the history of the other teams and tell me i'm wrong
<START> doctor mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely under the radar but is totally worthwhile it really reminds me of the old serials from the 30s and 40s which is why i'd have loved to see follow up movies but judging by the rest of full moon's output there simply weren't enough tits to satisfy the typical audience unfortunately thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene there two too many for a family audience which is unfortunate because without em' this could have been a harry potter style magicfest that kids would have eaten up both jeffrey combs and yvette nipar are great i wasn't sure if ms nipar hadn't wandered off an a list picture onto this film she was very believable no seriously anyway it's a shame they didn't have the bucks to license dr strange because i think this could have been a total kiddie phenom
<START> this movie was so ridiculous i never even finished watching it i actually thought someone had made their own version and dubbed it onto the dvd from the movie store this movie made me sick not because it was gory but because i wasted 2 50 on it it looks like my brother and i went into a house and made the movie ourselves and edited slaughterhouse footage into it i am so ticked off even the btk killer deserves more credit than that it was not even accurate i mean come on the cow head was obviously made out of play dough or bubble gum omg i cant even get all the words out to explain it do not watch this movie
<START> people don't seem to be giving lensman enough credit where its due a few issues have been overlooked which are key to understanding the lensman experience br br the year for the year it was made in 1984 lensman features some of the most stunning effects i've ever seen as a person who watches a lot of early 80's animation lensman is unique in it's use of what appears to be computer generated imagery at a time when computers were extremely primitive kim's battle against the geometric cutter pods in the laser maze can be taken as an excellent example of this every time i watch that i have to keep repeating to myself that it was 1984 when it was made br br the soundtrack lensman has one of the most insane soundtracks that i've heard and this mad hysterical beat permeates every corner of the film lensman borrowed heavily on two western mistakes and managed to somewhat deal with the first one the need to fill in every second of silence in a film with music and the need for a heroine while the music is attuned well and galvanizes scenes such as the motorcycle battle in the thionite factory on radelyx the heroine theme fails due to the sheer annoyance value of chris it's interesting to note that the constant music thwarted my attempts at noise removal when i was archiving lensman over from analog tape to digital format since there wasn't a single second of silence available to use as a reference point br br western influences helmut sounds like helmet and has roughly the same voice as darth vader clarissa fairborn has the same hairstyle as the princess of sw and her name sounds suspiciously similar to marissa fairborn of transformers takes over han solos role by flying the ship and having some technical expertise buzzkirk a definite improvement on chewbaka the lens a nice concrete copy of the force that comes across less as a chance to preach christianity at the audience than in the original sw while the force relied on belief far more than concentration the lens is a pure concentration tool theoretically anyone could wield the lens the lens is far more limited than the force being purely a defensive offensive weapon br br technology the boskone alliance have interesting meatball sponge ships they look like stormtroopers only with red uniforms instead of white the idea of a dna weapon was nice if only it had been developed the galactic alliance looked like starblazers or whatever it was called that 60's series where they were battling the xylons there weren't enough ship to ship battles for me this is much improved upon in the second lensman film br br finally a note on worzel this character is a unique and very interesting character design who fortunately continues on to the second film br br
