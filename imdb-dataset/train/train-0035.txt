<START> i would imagine that if steve mcqueen knew he would go on to become an icon and start wanted dead of alive the same year this film came out or be in the magnificent seven two years later he would not have done it but he did and we are the richer for it br br sure it's a camp classic horror the way it was meant to be for the drive in theater it's fun and nostalgic br br it is interesting that the last lines of the film were br br lieutenant dave at least we've got it stopped steve andrews yeah as long as the arctic stays cold br br they never would have imagined 52 years ago that the arctic would be thawing the blob will soon return
<START> i really wanted to like the pillow book intriguing story interesting character outlines ewan macgregor in the utterly glorious altogether unfortunately i hated every minute of it greenaway got so enamoured with presenting the movie uniquely and not to the film's benefit i won't even get into vivian wu's abysmal acting br br you get distracted from the story with 4 billion teeny windows and calligraphy that rolls on the bottom of the screen displaying the lyrics of the music that's playing it seems he lost sight of presenting the actual story and developing the plot and got entangled with foo foo embellishments that have nothing to do with anything it's a bit like presenting a john singer sargeant portrait in a chintzy hallmark frame that says grandma loves me in big sparkly letters br br this movie seems to be a casualty of the director auteur's ego instead of what it could have been disturbingly and horrifyingly beautiful in another director's hands jeunet coppola it could have been a masterpiece in greenaway's hands it's best relegated to fine arts classes that also take themselves too seriously
<START> i think that this movie is very fun and horror i love elvira and i like this movie it's very pity that second part of this wonderful movie had no success because it very funny like a first part i also regret that besides of this movie i have no seen cassandra peterson in other films i think that she is amazing actress with big potential i hope that ii'll see her in future in the third part of elvira's adventures cassandra peterson is one of my favorite comedy actresses cassandra if you read this know that you are the best and my heart will be with you you can rely on me what can i more add this is cool and classical movie
<START> this movie is a modest effort by spike lee he is capable of much more than this movie get on the bus while apparenly anti racist does nothing but berate whites and degrade the black status quo the plot of this movie is about a group of black men who travel on a bus to louis farrakhan's million man march the bus has every type of person you could imagine gay muslim gangbanger and the uncle tom he is thrown off the bus though there was one only white person on the bus he was accused of being a racist the minute he got on the bus to drive despite him being a jew and the fact that he explained is situation he ended up being a racist and leaving the bus i hate to say it but films like this need to realize their own hipocracy and rienforcation of steryotypes this should not be seen as a triumph but a sad dissapointment you may think i am a racist for writing this but i mean well better luck next time spike
<START> just cause takes some of the best parts of three films cape fear a touch of evil and silence of the lambs and mixes it together to come up with a good thriller of a film br br sean connery is a liberal law professor married to a former assistant district attorney kate capshaw and he's a crusader against capital punishment blair underwood's grandmother ruby dee buttonholes connery at a conference and persuades him to handle her grandson's appeal he's sitting on death row for the murder of a young girl br br when connery arrives in this rural florida county he's up against a tough sheriff played by laurence fishburne who's about as ruthless in his crime solving as orson welles was in touch of evil br br later on after connery gets the verdict set aside with evidence he's uncovered he's feeling pretty good about himself at that point the film takes a decided turn from touch of evil to cape fear br br to say that all is not what it seems is to put it mildly the cast uniformly turns in some good performances special mention must be made of ed harris who plays a hannibal lecter like serial killer on death row with underwood he will make your skin crawl and he starts making connery rethink some of those comfortable liberal premises he's been basing his convictions on many a confirmed liberal i've known has come out thinking quite differently once they've become a crime victim br br of course the reverse is equally true many a law and order conservative if they ever get involved on the wrong end of the criminal justice system wants to make real sure all his rights are indeed guaranteed br br criminal justice is not an end but a process and a never ending one at that for all society i guess if just cause has a moral that would probably be it
<START> a bit quirky and bordering bad taste but intelligent enough to be worthy of watching a wheelchair bound young woman jane hatchard helena bonham carter is teamed with a reluctant caregiver richard kenneth branagh richard is an artist that daydreams of human flight he builds an airplane in his garage and intends to fly it he wants to resurrect his own troubled life by taking care of the independent dying jane who suffers from an neurological disease that has all but left her speechless and very little motor skills wheelchair bound and full of spirit her last dying wish is to loose her virginity she offers herself to richard who won't help her directly but is willing to rob a bank in order to pay a gigolo to do the deed i found this flick ambitious and humorous even in this role carter has a certain charisma and likability
<START> well pop this into the dvd waste an hour and a half of your life that you will never get back and find out br br acting what acting br br production values production values br br story don't get me started br br after many years of posting on imdb i never thought i would see a film so bad that i truly wished for a lower rating than one i always have found at least a reason or two to see merit if only in the intent or the effort of the writer the director the cast or the producer br br in this case they're all the same guy who really needs to get a handle on the fact at least as demonstrated by this worthless waste of video tape that he has no talent i mean it would be a reasonable excuse if this were some junior high schooler's production for his first cinema class but the referenced artist behind this dreck was twenty six at the time of this miscarriage br br just how did this ever get made who in their right mind ever wrote a check for this moreover don't let the box cover fool you there's not even anything that remotely resembles a good sex scene or any good exposure of the hunk on that cover br br two final items there was one second when this film had redeeming value the aforementioned talent gets roundly punched out by his lover i cheered and i did learn one thing from this film there are times when something is so very bad that it is indeed truly very funny but not in any comical manner it's just sadly humorous very sadly humorous
<START> there is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not related to one of the stars or a producer actress nichole hiltz she is the show in this slow moving and wildly unlikely story of revenge directed by simon gornick the film stars joyce hyser as a betrayed wife who decides to seek revenge on her cheatin' spouse oh but not by conventional means she plans a total guerrilla war and recruits bad girl nichole hiltz as her weapon of choice she wants nichole as tuesday to get close to her ex the handsome but dull stephan jenkins who should stick to music to embarrass him and ruin his life david deluise is good in his few brief moments and former crime story star anthony dennison is given virtually nothing to do but scowl hiltz on the other hand comes off at various times as sexy and playful then evil and devious she also handles vulnerable and maybe a bit psychotic well she's also quite hot though there's no naughty bits show so you can understand how she might be able to get to any guy she is aimed at but the performance is kind of wasted in this movie which is just not edgy or interesting enough to recommend
<START> based on a true story this series is a gem within its kind the slave that becomes queen by capturing the heart of the most powerful man in the village br br in the diamond mining town of tijuco in brazil the diamond commender appointed by the king of portugal is the ultimate authority having grown up in the relative security of his house the young and beautiful xica da silva finds her world threatened when he decides to sell her to a whorehouse in town refusing to recognize that a black slave girl could be his daughter in a desperate bid to save herself xica steals the diamonds collected by the diamond commender for the king intending to use them to escape the king's army arrives to collect the diamonds the very next day however and when the loot turns up missing the diamond commender is led away in chains his family dispossessed and thrown out in the street with only the clothes on their backs martin the diamond commender's son swears vengeance xica and the other slaves however are sold at auction and xica ends up in the home of the sergeant major an old man who bought her solely to slake his lust to the town of tijuco however comes the new diamond commender the elegant and ruthless joao fernandes immediately struck by xica's beauty he manipulates the sergeant major into selling her to him and thus begins a love story filled with danger intrigue and passion between a willful nobleman and a crafty slave girl who rises to one day become queen br br the series is filled with rich details of the era's beliefs superstitions politics fashion etc etc and it really manages to captivate your attention for every minute at times funny with a sarcastic and dark humor full of suspense and unexpected twists xica da silva is definitely a must i wish i could buy the whole series on dvd
<START> this movie was very good because it remember when i was young when i maked snow castle it was so fun this movie is interessant this is a good quebeker movie with no much money and is also a magical movie because their wonderfull castle is very big and beautiful
<START> the film opens with bill coles melvyn douglas telling a story about how his best friend make that client jim blandings cary grant and his family are tightly packed into a small new york apartment with not enough closet space and way too few bathrooms when jim's wife muriel myrna loy wants to renovate the apartment advertising exec jim falls in love with or falls for an ad for a house once he's purchased the house bills and frustration pile up incessantly as everything that can go wrong with the building of jim's 'dream house' goes wrong br br one of three collaborations between grant and loy this is a charming little comedy not very taxing with no real great message but a great way to spend an hour or two the laughs are there right from the start when the alarm clock goes off and jim tries to shut it off only to be thwarted at every turn by muriel the timing and delivery of the comedic lines and situations can only be given by a couple of seasoned pros and that's just what grant and loy give us polished performances simple chemistry and a lot of fun myrna loy is in a pretty thankless role it's evident that grant's character jim gets the lion share of the lines and the acting and grant as always pulls both off with remarkable aplomb but she gives muriel a colour life and bite that only myrna loy can give a character melvyn douglas plays wry amusement to perfection as well never hitting a single wrong note br br one of my favourite scenes has definitely got to be when bill gets himself locked in the 'store room' and jim goes to 'save' him only to get everyone trapped inside every little problem that pops up for the blandings renovation project including petty jealousy and an ad campaign for 'wham' seems to bring together everything that could go wrong with building a new house but makes it believable and an enjoyable watch 8 10
<START> hawked as the most offensive movie ever guaranteed to offend everyone guess what it worked i'm offended that we shelled out money to rent this two friends and i were bored and decided to see if all that bull about the movie that we saw on tv was true curse comedy central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage on us it was by far the worst movie i've seen since hollow man i generally avoid the crappy ones but got sucked into this one we have since beaten the prick who suggest we rent it and his movie picking privileges have been revoked there is nothing remotely funny about this movie even the adventures of dickman scene was sophomoric at best color me p ed thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reason no it just sucked never watch this for any reason whatsoever not even with copious amounts of illegal substance would this movie be funny that's saying alot please for the love of all that is holy if you cherish your sanity never view this movie it's many things stupid pointless and worthless to name a few but the main thing it was aiming for offensively funny it failed miserably crash and burn
<START> okay let's start off by saying this film is not an exact rendition of the crimes and legal pursuit of andrei chikatilo while it may have been official policy in the politburo that the ussr had no serial killers in actuality the legal system had handled others and killer x as he was actually called was already being sought when fetisov brought burakov onto the case in fact as soon as it was realized they had multiple murders on their hands the authorities assigned a task force of dozens of officers to track down and end the killing spree of a man that did not fit into what is perceived as normal serial killer parameters it's good the director and writers consistently remind the viewer that the story is only based upon actual events for a docudrama this ain't br br spoilers follow br br that said this is a damn good example of a fast paced hollywood style thriller that still gets across the basics of what happened it is easy to follow and has just enough truth behind its version of events to make for compelling viewing yes chikatilo raped and murdered both children and adults both male and female yes shoddy lab work set him free to continue killing for years yes innocent men were accused of the murders and confessed to their crimes at police urging yes the gay community was harassed while the crimes were being committed albeit with burakov's committed assistance and yes chikatilo was brought to confession not by the haranguing of the special prosecutor gorbunov but by the gentle understanding of a psychiatrist named bukhanovsky though gorbunov was really nowhere near the egotistical martinet portrayed in this film quibbles about truth and veracity aside all of these events are dramatized in a manner that consistently tightens the tension and fear br br it doesn't hurt that director and co writer chris gerolmo has a pitch perfect cast stephen rea's growing emotional involvement in the killings and developing expertise in detecting clues donald sutherland's snarky manipulation of the soviet party hacks and subtle spine that becomes evident when it is needed jeffrey demunn's seething undercurrent of rage hidden by a fear filled demeanor max von sydow's boyish excitement at being part of a criminal investigation all enhance the sharp dialog and crisp editing in ways that cannot be underestimated br br taken for what it is citizen x is almost pitch perfect the almost due to one moment of self congratulation at the end that just does not fit highly recommended as fiction well told not fact being presented but considering the junky serial killer movies that hollywood usually spits out that's good enough for me
<START> valentine is a horrible movie this is what i thought of it br br acting very bad katherine heigl can not act the other's weren't much better br br story the story was okay but it could have been more developed this movie had the potential to be a great movie but it failed br br music yes some of the music was pretty cool br br originality not very original the name paige prescott' recognize prescott br br bottom line don't see valentine it's a really stupid movie br br 1 10 br br
<START> picture the scene a mountainous alien landscape twin moons illuminate the blood red sky the tardis lands and out steps the doctor a middle aged man in a victorian frock coat and rose his companion from earth a flicker of recognition crosses his face well i never its the planet saurious 7 where i fought the warlike kraggartians they tried to use giant skinkons to take over the planet the girl sniffs the air can't we go doctor i don't like the look of this place i keep thinking we're being watched the doctor wags a disapproving finger don't be silly girl i wonder if the king and queen of cordaraby city remember me from my last visit come along rose come along he strides off the girl struggles to keep up high on a hill sinister red eyes regard them with hatred br br that was not how 'rose' began back in 2005 and thank heavens for that say i unfairly derided at the time of its original u k broadcast 'rose' can now safely be regarded as a landmark episode putting 'dr who' back where it belonged as one of the b b c 's flagship programmes the mistakes made by the mcgann t v movie were well learnt instead of trying to shoehorn the new 'who' into existing chronology it represented a fresh start for the series beginning with shop girl rose tyler billie piper going about her daily routine one day she goes to the basement to find a man named wilson and then the trouble begins mannequins come to life and attack her it is only through the intervention of a mysterious stranger christopher eccleston that she is saved br br the story slight though it may be is more than adequate as a starting point for the series the autons are of course an old villain this was their first appearance since 1971 but no references are made to their past appearances another wise move the finale effectively recreated the famous scene in 'spearhead from space' when shop window dummies sprang to life as the doctor christopher eccleston lacked the eccentricity of his predecessors preferring a modern leather jacket to the doctor's traditional period clothes but this made him more accessible to the show's hoped for new audience billie piper confounded her critics by making a big impression as 'rose' also good was noel clarke as her boyfriend 'mickey' br br yes there was an added emphasis on special effects but then there needed to be the wobbly sets and unconvincing monsters of the past have no place on 21st century television what is more important is how good a script this is ten million people tuned in to see the new doctor br br 'dr who' was back and back with a bang
<START> i really cant think of anything good to say about this film not a single thing the script is a nightmare the writer blurs the line between chemical and biological traits and doesnt seem to understand the difference you'd think they would at least get a technical advisor the performances were bad by most of the cast although i dont really blame them the material really stinks the editing was equally bad i'll just stop now its all bad 2 10
<START> in all honesty if someone told me the director of lemony snicket's series of unfortunate events city of angels and caspers was going to do a neat little low budget indie film and that'd it be real good i'd say that person must be joking but that's what director brad siberling did and it was really good br br 10 items or less has a similar conceit to films like before sunrise lost in translation or more recently once it involves the chance meeting of two people who if serendipity didn't put them there they'd probably never cross paths or if they did they wouldn't say word one to each other like those films 10 items or less focuses on the relationship that builds and how the characters come to understand each other and build on each other's strengths and weaknesses br br the story involves morgan freeman playing an unnamed actor who goes to research his role as a grocery store employee for an upcoming independent movie and because of things beyond his control ends up spending the day with the lady in the 10 items or less lane played by paz vega she has a rotten marriage and is hoping to land a new job as a secretary initially freeman's character just needs a lift home after spending time with her however he wants to get to know her and maybe even offer her some advice br br brad siberling builds the characters almost entirely through the exchanges between freeman and vega the plot is merely a setup for these two characters to interact with each other for most of the film's 80 minute duration freeman has fun with his character as he appears an outsider in lower class world that vega's character scarlett inhabits vega in the meantime grows beyond the stubborn checkout clerk upset with her life's situation looking to move on br br there a couple things that really stood out in this film first of all siberling has probably taken note from independent cinema to make sure the relationship is sincere and doesn't fall into any hollywood pitfalls it's a very mutual friendship that develops convincingly throughout the film it works even though the situation itself does seem a little inconceivable br br i am also impressed with the performances while freeman's presence gives this film credibility from the get go he shows a certain amount of charm and fun not usually seen from him paz vega meanwhile is priming herself for a breakthrough in us film sometime in the future i loved her in spanglish and she's equally good here as the tough no nonsense scarlet towards the end of the film she successfully conveys the growth of her character i'm looking forward to seeing her in more films br br overall 10 items of less functions best as a character piece well scripted and directed by brad siberling he hasn't done much writing and his feature film work has consisted mostly of big hollywood films yet there's certainly an artist at work here and am anxious to see if he'll take this road again
<START> yet another british romantic comedy which audiences all over the world seem to have a ravenous appetite for this feeble effort is an unintentional parody of the genre all the classic clichÃ©d scenes are here from ridiculously elaborate misunderstandings to running after departing trains to declare one's love the characters are one dimensional caricatures save for love hewitt who manages to bring some cohesion to the film things threaten to spiral out of control in the plausibility department as the film progresses our good natured suspension of belief finally comes crashing down during the preposterous ending if you're looking for a bridget jones notting hill kind of experience you won't find it here
<START> the first scene in 'problem child' has a baby peeing into a nun's face for this movie that's witty a nasty mean spirited 'comedy' it's inept on so many levels it beggars belief john ritter is the kind father who adopts the child from hell and kudos to him for maintaining his dignity in the surrounding onslaught of one note annoying performances and puerile humour and what the hell's jack warden doing in this mess slackly directed by dennis dugan and obnoxious in its attempts to turn on the sentimentality when it's done with the crudity the movie is made so badly it's quite a bizarre experience but never mind all that the lowlight of the whole thing is michael oliver the most repulsive and unlikeable kid actor ever to hit the screen Â believe me you will want to smack him right in the mouth
<START> wow what an episode after last week seeing mellisa constantly making cameos about the friendship of annie and brandi i almost puked but that was nothing until seeing mellisa's tirade after being fired seeing her hobble around on her cast spewing out obscenities and screaming for someone to get her purse was absolutely the most hilarious thing ever on reality tv she continued to scream at people off set to get her clothes all of them like someone else would wear one of her hideous outfits mellisa you are like 40 years old and you still throw temper tantrums then joan starts calling annie and brandie every name in the book and gets up and quits the show both rivers are spoiled brats who were only left on the show this long to keep ratings up mellisa crying and refusing to do an exit interview just proves to america what everyone thought you are a spoiled baby wah wah i can't get my way i love how annie told the cameras she could manipulate mellisa to think her way and then did exactly that mellisa is by far the smartest contestant and clearly deserves to win the whole game
