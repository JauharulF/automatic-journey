<START> this film was terrible ok my favourite film is 'the wicker man' 1973 so i was always bound to be a little biased br br the plot rambles along throwing out enough of the key elements of the original to make the term 'remake' highly dubious he's not a virgin but is allergic to bees wow so many things happen that make no sense and are unexplained which i'm afraid mr labute does not a horror movie make how are two people we clearly saw blown up in a car at the start alive and well at the end of the film cage looks haggard and bewildered throughout and his character is prone to calling out rowan at the slightest noise the 'nods' to the original are irritating as they come off as tacky rather than as intelligent homage for example certain incidents mirror the original the girl falling out of a cupboard pretending to be dead when woodward cage is searching the island and several lines of dialogue are plucked straight from anthony schaffers original screenplay and shoehorned in br br i'm sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis than this i really can't be bothered to write any more about this film it lacks any kind of substance throw it on the scrap heap with all the other remakes that have sullied the good names of the films they were 'based' on in this case very loosely
<START> this is a great british film a cleverly observed script with many quotable lines which captures perfectly what magic mushrooms can do to a man over a weekend as per usual phil daniels is excellent along with that most under rated of british actors geoff bell peter bowles with a joint hanging out of his mouth is a casting masterstroke and gary stretch with his brooding looks brings something strangely atmospheric to the piece although it seems to be billed as a biker movie i think it will find an audience outside of this purely on the premise that a lot of people have been there done it and got the t shirt also a great original soundtrack with a blinding version of freebird this really could be a 21st century heir to the famous ealing comedies like the weed in the welsh fields it's a grower
<START> i came to new port south expecting a surrogate movie about the columbine school massacre similar to gus van sant's elephant and certainly the synopsis in the tv guide stating that a student sociopath rebels against the system did give me that impression but this is a very boring movie where little happens so consider yourself warned br br the story is about maddox a chicago high school student who decides to strike back at what he perceives to be an authoritarian regime the major problem is that the character is underwritten and the actor who plays him blake shields is unable to embellish any script deficiencies you have the gut feeling that maddox should have the evil charisma of hitler saddam or bin laden but he never comes across as anything more than a petulant truculent teenager and it's impossible to believe he could rally any disciples the subtext of you overthrow one manipulative authoritarian regime only to replace it with another manipulative regime is too obvious which means new port south is an entirely unconvincing drama that's not worth going out of your way to see
<START> i don't think this movie was rated correctly i took my copy and blacked out the pg rating and wrote down r i would not recommend this for anyone under 17 or 18 whatever the r limit is br br why it contains a scene in the jungle with several topless indian women i don't know about you but that's not something for little children to be watching true it might be the traditional clothing style of the african indians but i think partial nudity should give a movie an r rating br br i haven't seen the movie recently but i guess otherwise it was alright
<START> much has been made of rohmer's use of digital technology to 'fill in' the background at times it works well the scene where grace and her maid witness from afar the king's execution is particularly striking at other times it gives the film a strangely amateurish look resembling a home video however the major failing is that the sheer artificiality of the mise en scene creates an alienating effect in the viewer we know that what we are watching is not real so how can we feel for the characters to be frank i did not care at all what happened to the lady or the duke br br the other major failing i regret to say is the performance of lucy russell in the leading role she is in virtually every scene and the success or otherwise of the film rests on her performance ok she is speaking a foreign language but she is incapable of expressing real emotion her emoting in the scene where she recounts to her friend mme de meyler an excellent performance by the debutante helena dubiel seeing the head on a pole caused some embarrassed laughter in the audience also watch her hands when she is expressing emotion br br all in all a very disappointing film particularly given the positive reviews on this site
<START> wonderful cast wasted on worthless script ten or so adults reunite at the summer camp they attended as juveniles could this ever happen in a million years it's simply a fantasy and a boring one at that do they become teenagers again do they reenact their pranks games good times they may try but ultimately the answer is no is there any intrigue any suspense horror comedy none of the above how anyone can be entertained by this drivel is beyond me i wanted to like this movie i tried to like this movie but my brain refused
<START> okay i must say that before the revealing of the 'monster' saying that he really didn't fit into that category just some weird thing that had an annoying screech and personally i think a granny could have ran away from that thing but anyway i actually was getting into this film although having the main character a drunk and a heroine addict didn't come as an appeal but such scenes as when she runs away from the train and you can see the figure at the door was kind of creepy also where the guard had just been killed and the 'monster' put his hand on the screen br br but then disaster stuck form the moment the monster was revealed it just became your average horror with limited thrills or scares slowly i became more bored and wanted to shut the thing off i like most people have said was rooting for the homeless people to make it specially the guy he gave me a few cheap laughs here and there i think this film could have really been something special instead it became what every other horror nowadays are just boring and well not worth the money br br if you are looking for a cheap scare here and there or a mindless gore fest which is limited hardly any in fact by all means give it a go but for all you serious horror watchers look somewhere else much better films out there
<START> kureishi hasn't exactly been blessed with movies that justify the quality of his writing recent adapted travesty's like 'intimacy' have ruined great writing but the mother surpasses all his previous incarnations eclipsing even my beautiful laundrette a middle aged woman overcomes widow hood by having a very carnal relationship with the boyfriend of her emotionally weak daughter the fact that you believe all this is credit to the quality of the acting as it is to the finite gift of the writing and in daniel craig we have a strutting brash gruff anti hero who denies the audience to ever question why a young stud would contemplate bedding a sagging grandmother beautifully shot the film fails only in the weak depiction of the peripheral characters but as a study of inconceivable lust it's a winner
<START> this is a low budget film with a cast of unknowns and a minimum of on location shoots the philippines substitute for thailand and nobody actually goes to hong kong the stock shot of a cathay pacific jumbo jet landing at the old airport makes the transition perfectly this film proves that you need neither mega budgets nor a headliner star to produce an excellent movie it contains neither the gaffes nor the excesses that young filmakers often stumble into solid workmanship from people who know all the aspects of movie making and who understand the compromises between art and box office an excellent piece of work
<START> in this send up of horror films 50's cold war paranoia reagan era america and high school films adam arkin plays tony the star quarterback of full moon high in the 1950's he and his father ed mcmahon travel to communist romania and while he's lost in the streets one night he is bitten by a werewolf when he returns stateside he cannot control his animalistic urges and goes on a killing spree frustrated he flees town decades later the immortal tony returns to town and re enrolls in highschool he still can't control his transformations and the townspeople and his friends realize he's not quite human it all culminates during the schools big football game br br i expected this to be one of those 'so bad it's good' films from the early 80's but i was surprised that the film was actually legitimately funny the cast including kenneth mars as a pervy coach roz kelly as tony's lusty former flame demond wilson as a bus driver and alan arkin as a oddball doctor go all out with hilarious results br br while watching this film i was struck by how similar the writing and humor were to 'family guy ' 'full moon high' has that same anything goes attitude and never takes itself seriously
<START> silly simplistic and short gun crazy volume 1 a woman from nowhere goes nowhere br br this brief just over sixty minutes tale isn't so much inspired by the classic spaghetti westerns as it is a rip off of sam raimi's the quick the dead his admitted homage to the spaghetti westerns brought into a contemporary setting in quick dead sharon stone's character seeks revenge against the dastardly sheriff played by gene hackman who when she was but an urchin placed the fate of her father a brief cameo by gary sinise in her hands she accidentally shot him through the head in gun crazy saki played by the nimble ryoko yonekura seeks revenge against the dastardly mr tojo played with minimalist appeal by shingo tsurumi who when she was but an urchin placed the fate of her father in her hands she let her foot slip off the clutch and dear ole dad was drawn and quartered by a semi truck the only significant difference despite the settings is the fact that tojo sadistically cripples saki with Â well i won't spoil that for you in case you decide to watch it br br in short saki Â a pale imitation of the clint eastwood's 'man with no name' Â rides into the town Â basically there's a auto shop and a tavern alongside an american military base so i guess that suffices for a town Â corrupted by tojo the local crimelord with a ridiculously high price on his head for reasons never explained or explored confessing her true self as a bounty hunter saki takes on the local gunmen in shootouts whose choreography bares more than a passing similarity to the works of johnny to and john woo of course by the end of the film saki has endured her fair amount of torture at the hands of the bad guys but she rises to the occasion Â on her knees in a laughable attempt at a surprise ending Â and vanquishes all of her enemies with a rocket launcher br br don't ask where she gets the rocket launcher just watch it for yourself try not to laugh br br the image quality is average for the dvd release there is a grainy quality to several sequences but all in all this isn't a bad transfer the sound quality leaves a bit to the imagination at times but again it isn't a bad transfer br br rather it's a bad film
<START> yes shakespeare would indeed have been proud laurence fishburne was not at his best but certainly not bad kenneth brannagh on the other hand was brilliant his scheming was wonderful as was his toying with the audience very nice work br br there were at times too little drama where more would have been expected cassio's slaying for instance was a bit clouded by too much happening to far apart causing the spectator to twist his head to grasp it all br br did i mention michael maloney his madness striken roderigo was unusual annoying even br br if you haven't seen othello before see this if you haven't read othello see this if you haven't heard othello see this you do on the other hand do yourself a favour by reading it seeing it acted onstage and hearing it sung too
<START> please take a minute to read my entire review i am not knocking the film itself only the dvd versions currently available br br br br i really wanted to give this film even two stars i mean how could it possibly rank a mere 1 out of 10 br br here's how an epic film adaptation of tolstoy's novel war and peace with historically accurate battle scenes courtesy of the red army and an extremely faithful scene for scene adaptation of the novel would be difficult but worth sitting through for seven hours if that's what you were seeing br br the trouble is you can't see that film anywhere as far as i know br br i am attempting to watch the ruscico dvd version widely considered the best version available since it's letter boxed and restores the scenes that were cut from other dvd releases br br but it is one of the worst film prints i've ever seen transfered to dvd the picture is muddy and inconsistent often strobing it's almost tolerable if you crank your brightness color and picture levels up to maximum but the problem doesn't end there br br the sound is also way inconsistent blaringly loud in parts virtually inaudible in others br br and as for languages it's a huge problem for english speakers the dubbed option has some good actors and some really terrible ones whose performance grates and parts of the film just aren't dubbed at all slipping back into russian and even french randomly br br the subtitled option isn't much better the subtitles don't appear below the image but right over it obscuring some of the beauty or what's left of it in the scenery furthermore the subtitles are often a poor translation a shame given that the script took pains to hew so close to tolstoy's actual words and the subtitles too seem to just drop out in parts br br so even if you max out the color brightness and picture settings and turn the volume way up and choose subtitled and english dubbed you're still going to get a film that's annoying to watch and listen to br br can it's content overcome that it might have been able to but at seven hours who can stand it for that long br br maybe someday someone will come along and restore this and maybe then i will see a masterpiece but for now i just can't give more than one star to something i've only been able to stand watching about the first 12 of
<START> this has got to go down as almost one of the worst movies of all time awful acting awful script and they were the good points one to definitely miss the jokes if you could call them that were so predictable as to be pathetic pamela anderson is still relying on her body to detract from the fact that her acting is just as plastic i sat willing to give it a chance hoping that it was going to improve which alas it didn't if it was a choice between this and a book i suggest you settle down for a good read i like denise richards which is why i gave this movie a go but why she has let her self be cast in this movie is beyond me
<START> it should come as no shock to you when i say that alone in the dark is a crappy movie to put it bluntly it's as if a dung monster defecated ate the result and then vomited the final product would still outshine this movie br br seemingly based on an ancient atari video game the movie has something or other to do with a portal to the bowels of the earth the unleashing of demons and ancient civilizations something about there being two worlds that of darkness and that of light guess which one's ours oh and 10 000 years ago a really super duper advanced civilization opened the portal demons came over and had a blast then wiped out the civilization which is why we've never heard of them conveniently enough br br christian slater perhaps pining for the days of heathers and pump up the volume plays edward carnby a paranormal researcher to whom something bad happened when he was 10 years old he's hot on the trail of one of the artifacts of said advanced civilization carnby used to be part of a secret institution called 713 which has been trying to figure out what happened to that long ago civilization but carnby believed he wasn't going to be able to find the answers he sought so he left the group br br but see these beasties are out and they get their prey in varying ways such as gutting them splitting them down the middle implanting neurological control devices in them or just turning them into killing zombies yes it's another zombie movie br br that's about as distilled i can make the plot it's pretty convoluted and incomprehensible in similar movies one might see the intrepid researcher adventurer figure things out a step at a time and when we the audience are mentally with the researcher it's a lot of fun but when the scenes shift from attack to attack with no perspective or context not so much fun br br the acting is dreadful save for slater who although he almost seems embarrassed to be in the movie showed he was capable of carrying the acting load he had to get this tara reid is cast as a museum curator honest to goodness i thought i'd seen the casting of a lifetime when denise richards was cast as a nuclear physicist in tomorrow never dies but reid here matches richards crappy emoting for crappy emoting hightlights include reid pronouncing newfoundland as new fownd land reid delivering most of her lines in a dazed throaty monotone kinda like she'd been on an all night bender for the past week before filming reid a museum curator mind you spending a lot of the movie in a midriff bearing top and hip hugger jeans oh yeah she was as believable as jessica simpson giving stock quotes oh why must the pretty ones be so dumb note i don't think tara reid's all that good looking she looks like she's in perpetual need of food almost everyone else in the cast is completely forgettable except perhaps for steven dorff who played burke one of the leaders of 713 dorff's character wasn't terribly well developed but nothing in the movie was from the sets to the characters to tara reid but i digress br br anyway the perplexing and utterly preposterous storyline is tough enough to follow with the film moving at such a breakneck pace but director uwe boll tosses in a pounding mind deadening soundtrack it's so loud you can't hear what the actors are saying in some of the scenes that can't be right given the acting level however perhaps thanks are in order to mr boll br br oh and a fun note the opening moments of the movie include narration of the words that are crawling across the screen at the same time remember the first star wars you heard that now familiar star wars theme while the prologue crawled there was surely no need for narration why do i need some doofus to read what's on the screen for me were the producers simply looking out for blind people maybe that also explains why the soundtrack was so loud they were also looking out for hard of hearing people also the narrator inexplicably had a lisp for the first few lines of the crawl then lost it bizarre br br alone in the dark is a loud dopey mishmash of dreadful acting an incoherent script and ham handed directing hardly a note rings true there's so much chaos that the audience simply gives up caring about the characters and roots for their demise even in the dark the demonic creatures seem cooler and much more developed by comparison br br ironically since there were only three other people in the theater i watched this alone in the dark i wonder if uwe boll planned it that way i can't quite give this the lowest rating because i had low hopes for it to begin with and because it never grabbed me enough for me to get worked up about it it's atrocious although slater redeems himself a tiny bit
<START> why can't this type of compact entertaining mystery be filmed in the new century it keeps the viewer thinking and guessing all the way the cast is a great ensemble william powell exhibits true star quality who knows perhaps he was rehearsing for his future as nick charles he is a joy to watch one also can see why eugene pallette made more than 200 films he is a great supporting character actor and his excellent chemistry with powell is fun to watch mary astor does above average work in a not very meaty role all other hands chip in to make this a thoroughly enjoyable way to spend 73 minutes i suspect michael curtiz had a ball directing his one bravo
<START> if you didn't live in the 90's or didn't listen to rapper ever this movie might be ok for you but any for any fan or any single person who ever listened to rap this movie was boring and there was no point in the movie where i said thats interesting or i didn't know that another thing that bugged me was it made it look like anything in his life he did was very easy there was no struggle he made jail look easy selling drugs and even rapping it wasn't realistic i think if the movie where released in about 15 years from now it might have more of an impact maybe good rap movies hustle and flow get rich or die trying not notorious
<START> forget the campy 'religious' movies that have monopolized the television film market this movie has a real feel to it while it may be deemed as a movie that has cheap emotional draws it also has that message of forgiveness and overall good morals however i did not like the lighting in this movie for a movie dealing with such subject matter it was too bright i felt it took away from the overall appeal of the movie which is almost an unforgivable sin but the recognizable cast and their performances counteract this oversight br br definitely worth seeing buy the dvd
<START> meaning if this movie got pitched scripted made released promoted as something halfway respectable given the constraints yeah i know springer sex violence where is he br br reminded me of porn movies i saw in college plot and dialogue wise shoulda just done something for the scurrilous porno market showed penetration and be done with it would have made more money the ultimate point of this exercise
<START> i enjoy a good slow moving drama christmas in august chungking express virgin stripped bare by her bachelors the way home springtime in a small town hana bi eat drink man woman dolls in the mood for love and spring summer fall winter spring are all enjoyable films Â just to name a few br br unfortunately there is a subset of films within the drama genre that attempt to ride the coattails of good films while providing nothing of interest themselves these are what i call ian films Â incomprehensible artistic nonsense tsai ming liang is the king of this subgenre and vive l'amour is his masterpiece in fact this is the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of crap infested garbage under the guise of art people walk around in their apartments drink water stroll back and forth waiting for pay phones to become vacant hang posters staple papers together go to the bathroom eat do pushups have sex slap at mosquitoes etc i'm not joking when i say that is an accurate synopsis of the entire film which is the quintessential posterchild for pointless art house trash there is no plot no storyline no interesting or noteworthy events no emotion no meaningful dialogue and most importantly Â no drama br br the most eventful scene has two people banging on a bed with a person masturbating underneath the mattress Â ironic that it's also totally tasteless and gratuitous the relationship of the characters on the bed is practically non existent tsai apparently didn't feel like communicating anything to the viewer regarding these people other than the obvious fact that they like to bang the person under the bed is just as one dimensional and uninteresting he likes to drink water makeout with melons and stroke himself this is tsai's idea of character development a truly misguided entertainer indeed br br tsai's true contribution in vive l'amour is perhaps the most atrocious scene in art house film history he first shows the lead actress walk all the way from one end of a park to the other for 285 consecutive seconds only to then show her cry hysterically Â for absolutely no reason whatsoever Â for another 356 consecutive seconds the film then abruptly ends no point no entertainment just pure concentrated torture inflicted on the viewer br br in an effort to beat a dead horse the underlying theme of loneliness is mishandled so greatly that the only true feeling of this film is that of boredom in fact kiyoshi kurosawa provides a much better exposition on loneliness in his horror film kairo and guess what it's actually interesting that film moved as slow as molasses in january but there are better ways of addressing the concept of loneliness than the utter waste known as vive l'amour kairo is a perfect example of that br br fans of cinema may thank tsai ming liang for directing this film as he has provided irrefutable evidence that art house cinema can be just as poorly made as b grade made for television horror flicks art house snobs have now officially lost their pedestal of self righteousness the quality level of your precious genre now overlaps films like army of darkness and Â gasp Â showgirls how do you like them apples
