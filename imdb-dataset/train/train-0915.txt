<START> the main reason for writing this review is i found this revisioning of a great play and worthy 1972 film a horrible movie experience if i can save someone from watching it i will have done a good thing br br this new version is loaded with talent and it all goes wrong kenneth branagh oks an ugly sterile one note set he proceeds to film the movie from every arty distracting self centered angle possible we see reflections of the actors in stainless steel on security monitors shots of their heads from 200 ft above close ups of eyes chins and on and on the screenplay by a nobel laureate introduces long stretchs of unpleasant homosexual banter that is being faked by both parties i think given the character twists how would i know the characters themselves so richly drawn in the original are crass and unsympathetic the running time has been cut by an hour which is either the real problem or the kindest thing the director did for us the actors perform their lines effectively but nothing they say or do is remotely believable jude law is over the top more than caine but as the credited producer must have had branagh's blessing br br all in all i found this to be an ugly to look at unconvincing shell of a former classic why was it even made the paying public spent less that 4m worldwide to see it a vanity piece of work that fails at every turn
<START> a friend told me of john fante last summer after we got into a conversation about charles bukowski i did not know that fante was a favorite writer of bukowski's an author with similar edge and humor except from one generation earlier 'ask the dust' was the first fante book i read and it remains one of my favorite novels the novel was a brilliant piece of writing about a sad frightened young writer posing to himself and the outside world as an overconfident masterfully talented author who had no idea how to write about the real world experiences he had none of in the novel the protagonist is a virgin with no idea how to win the graces of the women he desperately wants to write about in magazines the story of his bizarre relationship with camilla how he settles for his first sexual experience with a 'wounded' admirer and how he eventually is left with nothing but the story of his failed attempts at love is biting and real with no touching hollywood ending the film adaptation stays true to the book for a while but meanders into the cinematic trap of love persevering through racism sickness and death the heart of this story lies in the fact that bandini is a jerk and camilla is f ing crazy and their love never was and never would be the real thing no matter how much either of them wanted to find it in each other this movie tore out the real meaning of the story out and replaced it with schlock i can't believe the man who wrote chinatown could read this book and make a movie about it that got it so wrong
<START> it is true that some fans of peter sellers work may be disappointed with this his last venture but surely any fan of sellers will find delight in all of his films simply because of the man's huge talent and the fiendish plot of dr fu manchu is certainly no exception unfortunately this would prove to be sellers last film it was even released after his death but it's still nice to see how the man had managed to keep his irreplaceable talent right until his untimely demise and not only do we get one sellers but we get to for sellers plays not only the title role but also his nemesis the equally bizarre nayland smith the detective on the hunt for the crazed 168 year old fu the story is equally outlandish as we follow fu's outrageous antics to make his age defying elixir and also nayland and his group of associates trying to prevent him just like any of sellers greater films the film comes with a guaranteed impeccable performance from him as well as many of his familiar faced co stars david tomlinson sid caesar john le mesurier clive dunn and helen mirren to name a few it's also nice to see pink panther stalwart burt kwouk cato enjoying a cameo with sellers albeit playing the same role but still nice the story is indeed pretty ridiculous as are many of the characters involved which classes this as a film strongly under the goon influence and although it never reaches the heights of goon comedy there are plenty of amusing jokes that seem to point in the right direction the film failed commercially on it's initial release due to the entire world mourning after sellers' death the film was released less than 3 weeks after and there is always that sorrowful thought lurking in the back of your mind when viewing it that this was sellers last film it's far from a great film it's often slow too ridiculous and sometimes the jokes simply aren't there but it is nevertheless enjoyable if only for another top rate performance from peter sellers
<START> this movie was terrible at first i just read the plot summary and it looked ok so i watched it the acting was terrible it was like the actor were almost camera shy everything seemed fake i feel bad for edward furlong terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago i've watched it at least 20 times br br the plot was also crap the writers were probably sleep deprived when they came up with the lines br br on the plus side it's the good kind of bad movie the one you keep watching just to see how much worst could it will get so that later you can tell other people how you couldn't believe how terrible the movie was br br i think everybody should watch this so that then we could appreciate better other real movies
<START> it's a while ago that i have seen sleuth 1972 with two great actors michael caine and laurence olivier michael caine is back but he is now the husband and jude law the lover of his wife the story is still the same and it's a fantastic play br br during the movie i always had the feeling to watch a play that's one of the reasons i dislike this remake of a classic when i watch a movie adapted a play i still must feel to see a movie and not just a play director kenneth brannigan did some marvelous movies in the past but this time he missed another reason was the look of the movie the design was modern stylish clean uncomfortable and cold i never got the feeling that somebody ever lived in that house the photography wasn't bad but the lightening was awful sometimes there was blue light dark green light to round it up not friendly for eyes br br the acting was really good michael caine's and jude law's perform at their best i really would like to see these 2 guys playing together on stage but i have to confess i never was a fan of jude law the weakest part was the mid part i remember that in the original that this part was still very mysterious and just marvelous directed i tried to watch it twice and always in the mid part i felt asleep the end part is better and more interesting sleuth 2007 isn't awful but it seems to be more a movie for critics than for the audience sleuth 1972 is still a masterpiece and much more entertaining than sleuth 2007
<START> only after some contemplation did i decide i liked this movie and after reading comments from all the other posters here and thinking about it some more i decided that i liked it tremendously i love american films probably because they are so narrative they usually have a well defined beginning middle and end presque rien on the other hand makes no such attempt i disagree with other posters that say it's 'too artsy ' in every way this film is meant to evoke your sense memories so often throughout the film you feel like you're there you feel the summer sun the breezes the heat the winter chill the companionship the loneliness etc etc br br in every way the director pulls you into the lives of the characters which is why so many people feel so strongly that the movie disappointed them after i finished watching it i felt the same but upon some reflection i recognized that this is how the movie had to be the 'story' isn't the narrative it's the emotions you the viewer feel br br the lighting scenery and camera angles immerse you in the scenes they're rich exquisite and alive with detail and nuance although i normally cannot countenance films without a fully developed plot after all isn't a movie 'supposed' to tell a story this film is definitely one of my new favorites
<START> some spoilers if you are a big horror movie fan then you will know that halloween paved the way for many slasher films often imitated never duplicated this movie is a true horror classic and is definitely one of the scariest movies ever made if not the scariest br br i actually saw this movie after seeing the rest of the series don't ask me why i honestly saw the other 7 movies before seeing this one that's just how it worked out but i would have to say this one blows all the others away it is genuinely frightening and seeing michael pop out from behind a bush or walk around in the dark sends a chill down your spine my favorite part of the movie was when michael stabs a guy and leans his head to one side it is one of the eeriest images in movie history br br later slashers such as the friday the 13th films were more fun and less intense than this movie i do like the f13 series better than the halloween series but this movie alone is better than all the f13 movies michael myers is such a scary villain because he is realistic you could imagine a crazed guy like him going around killing people i admit this movie gave me nightmares after watching it for a few nights br br what's great about this movie is that it doesn't rely on gore or humor to entertain the audience it is just pure terror it's too bad the later films of the series swayed from this one because this is as good of an example of a spectacular slasher movie as they come
<START> just the kind of movie i love some very good british actors as well as the one and only sharon stone catherine tramell stone masterfully manipulates a well educated group of people's lives playing on their frailties to collect experiences to write a murder mystery book she plays the female psychopath quite well while using her ample sex appeal to convincingly portray what could be considered one of the ultimate black widows tramell is use to dark places within society and freely partakes in sadomasochistic flings in the 'never visit after dark' side of town from the beginning there is nothing short of an r rating here from the dialog alone stone could also be described as a sort of female hannibal lecter an emotionless femme fatal without the meal plan
<START> i should have never watched this movie the style of filming may be considered artsy to some but it is considered migraine inducing to me i think it may have had an interesting plot but since i couldn't watch it for long stretches at a time i missed a lot the flickering pictures and stop motion filming branded my brain i stopped watching mid way through and won't be back for a second try i suppose if i were home alone in my own lighthouse some dark and stormy evening this might be just the ticket ps not sure if the lighthouse film style thing can be considered a spoiler but i don't want to be blacklisted on my first review
<START> again stacy peralta is true first to the people who lived the story by letting those involved in the genesis of big wave surfing tell us their stories how it felt and what they thought you get the feeling of having been there the film carries you from the fifties to the near present by focusing on three primary architects contributing to the evolution and development of the sport candid home movie like videos of themselves and their contemporaries take you further into their world the layers of music culture technical information a pure view of the participant's athleticism and fabulous big wave images you get a full scope perspective of this aspect of surfing br br thoroughly worth watching
<START> some of those guys that watch films and complain about them for a living are forgetting something dvd menu system i tell you the people i watched the main screen repeat in this one about 35 times it was awesome a cinematic tapestry of cascading brilliance that had me from where it was which was the very beginning many times the sum and bam i was hooked over and over and over and over br br doot de doot de doo de dodedo and that's just the soundtrack br br i is laid aside in the bed curled up with my vaio the rain is in the flat roof and tonight soft is again soft the cat is comfortable and my ankle which crosses in me is already rested i popped in the dvd i was mesmerized through the night doot de doot de doo de dodedo br br the blob see it steve queen two cops and one girl in a dress two thumbs way up
<START> well i was going to wait till this came out on video to see it and i wish i had i actually caught scary movie 2 on cable the other day and it made me yearn for more of the same what i got was airplane on crack i mean if you like airplane or any other leslie nielsen vehicles then you'll probably be in heaven but if your used to the usually wayans comedy then you will be dissapointed there was alot more eye candy in this one which will keep young hormone raged teenage boys happy which is probably why it was a box office hit the first week it came out i enjoyed scary movie 2 ten times more then this fodder and part one 5 times as much odd that the better of the 3 is part 2 but then again i always liked halloween 2 better then the original as well maybe its just me the funniest part of the movie has to be the way the aliens say goodbye but that wasnt worth the 11 dollars i spent to catch a matinee of this with my fiance save yourself cash and catch part 2 again on cable till this is released on video tape and then rent it dont buy it
<START> thanks to a dull dimensionless screenplay by neil simon and lackluster direction from robert moore chapter two becomes a shrill showcase for marsha mason who received her third of four oscar nods for chapter two giving the same performance here that she gave in cinnderella liberty 73 the goodbye girl 77 audrey rose 78 and only when i laugh 81 only this time she doesn't have a child to drag around chapter two is the third and last feature film for moore having previously directed neil simon's the cheap detective 78 and murder by death 76 caan is miscast the characters are mono dimensional the dialog is overly analytical and there's virtually no establishing detail the first half is a less than captivating meet cute coy romance between a blinkered caan and a chipper mason and the dreary second half makes you long for the first half the nyc locations as well as joe bologna and a painfully thin valerie harper are irrelevant but at least they provide some welcome distraction and last and least there's an awful song played during the credits
<START> as a fan of the sookie stackhouse books i find this series to be a totally crass representation of them vampire bill is not very good looking and looks much older than described in the book i found that they have made already wonderfully colourful characters seem very course and vulgar one of the things i loved about the books is that despite all the crap that she is going through sookie is always a lady and yet in the tv series she doesn't seem like that at all not only that but the prejudices displayed in the tv series are not nearly as wide spread in the books i didn't expect an exact replica of the books but i at least expected the feel of them to be used for the series
<START> this movie is s l o w spent most of the movie actually waiting for it to 'begin' br br the setting was bleak the script was bleak the cinematography was bleak the plot was bleak the budget was low not that all low budget movies are bad but this one had no redeeming features br br the plot was more consumed with a vengeful slightly deranged hunter than the actual wendigo which made a very brief appearance toward the end of the movie this in itself was disappointing as this 'wendigo' was just a bizarre mix of a tree and a stag everything about the movie was uninspiring br br the parents of the little boy appeared to be rather aloof and at times seemed completely detached from their son whether this was down to bad acting or a bad script i'm not sure but it only heightened my disappointment and boredom levels br br there was no food for thought nothing to pique an interest with no real intrigue or chill factor this movie creaked along so painfully you just couldn't care less what happened by the end br br wendigo's ambiance reminds me of the dull movie shown at the awards ceremony toward the end of 'mr bean's holiday' a movie which is artistic and nonsensical trying too hard to to be deep and meaningful but coming across as pretentious and boring br br i would never want to watch this again i only watched it to the end in the vain hope that something interesting might happen but it didn't
<START> i totally agree with the review by a reviewer of variety that the film is never quite as funny lively or insightful about the creative process as its premise would seem to warrant narratively it is messy and the lighting is really problematic if the film is supposed to be character driven the poor lighting doesn't enhance the acting and it is sometimes difficult to observe the facial expressions of the actors many non south africans will have difficulty in following the spoken english in the film and some of the local humor will be lost in the process i watched the film at the cape town world cinema festival last year comments and reactions to the film ranged from unwatchable and sloppy to a welcome departure from the films about our painful past unfortunately bunny chow won't be remembered as one of the bright lights of the south african new wave but some of the remarkable films about our apartheid history will indeed be rated among our best in our 110 year old film history not surprisingly the film disappeared from cinemas in cape town only two weeks after its release and from most of the cinemas in durban and gauteng it has clearly limited appeal among south african audiences
<START> purple rain has never been a critic's darling but it is a cult classic and deserves to be if you are a prince fan this is for you br br the main plot is prince seeing his abusive parents in himself and him falling in love with a girl believe it or not this movie isn't just singing and dancing there are many intense scenes and it is heartwarming sometimes it comes off has funny but when it works it really works very hit and miss br br no one can really act in the film everyone is from one of prince's side acts like the time and vanity 6 still it adds charm to the movie when ever prince is on screen he lights it up and it fun to see him at his commercial peak br br in conclusion go and see this if you love prince like me if you aren't a fan it'll make you one
<START> and maybe as fred sandford used to say one across the lips that to those who released this film on an unsuspecting public and perhaps to the person in rue morgue who called this a fender hellbender and said it was good br br five young girls apparently taking a short cut home from a high school football game become lost and stop to ask directions at some small store in the middle of nowhere while there the driver accidentally hits a parked suv knocks out a headlight but the girls all decide to just leave not go find the driver but the driver does come to find them and it's not just that the headlight on her vehicle got dinged it's for another reason that the girls do not yet understand when the driver does first catch them she yes it's a she brandishes a shot gun makes them strip down and keeps screaming at them how much did you see of course the girls are scared to death don't know what she's talking about br br as the night rolls on the girls end up in a cat and mouse game with the driver of the suv who manages to inflict all manner of injuries on the girls who are remarkably resilient to shot gun blasts and screwdrivers where they didn't want them eventually they come to find that something happened back at that store after they left that is the reason for this woman's psychotic rage and eventually they have a chance at revenge and take it about as far as they can go br br there are elements of this film that are rather disturbing and scary but unfortunately those moments are undermined by bad acting bad dialog and huge lapses of credibility one girl is hit by a shot gun blast and appears to be mortally wounded and she's feeling cold her life is passing before her eyes but she got better and how far can a mini van run on an almost empty gas tank at speeds of 80 miles per hour i need one of those things it apparently gets great mileage br br there should have been an ending when the girls got their revenge but the film goes on for a bit after that which is an anti climax but they at least learn some of what set the woman off and the driver is still worried about messing up her mom's van which is obviously the least of anyone's worries br br so this isn't the worst film i've seen but it's too amateur to be good and yet a bit too scary and gruesome at times to be completely terrible but it does take the cake for plenty of shrill hysterics and you'll want to put two across your ears if you watch this which by the way i don't necessarily recommend 4 out of 10
<START> i thought that mukhsin has been wonderfully written its not just about entertainment there's tonnes of subtle messages that i think yasmin was trying to bring across and yes it might be confusing to some of you especially if you didn't watch sepet and or gubra for 76 times br br i bet u noticed how they use characters from the two movies before right its really ironic how the characters relate like the bossy neighbour is that prostitute from gubra and the chick at the snooker pad turns out to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future br br and i absolutely love the voice overs its crude yet awakeningly fresh like when they took a shot of the rumah tumpangan gamin signboard then there was suddenly mukhsin's voice saying 'bismillahhirrahmannirrahim ' the scene when he climbed the tree br br it captured malaysian's attitude and in some mild way sniggering at how pathetic it is portrayed in the character for example even the kids can be really sharp tongued complete with the shrill annoying voice and simply bad mouth ppl all movie long and how you can be such a busybody and talk about ppl when ur own life isn't sorted out br br all i can say is this movie totally reached my expectation if not exceeded it br br it kept me glued to the screen i couldn't even take my eyes off it not even to make out in the cinema ha ha
<START> it is not the same as the other films about dancing a few normal people found themselves from dancing unlike the dancing films in hollywood the characters in this film are not handsome or hot young people they are someone that you may see everyday in your offices they are some depressed about their lives and finally find themselves and their dreams from dancing this touches me very deeply
