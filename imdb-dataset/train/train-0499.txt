<START> seriously what the hell was this movie about simply stupid i'd give it 0 but 1 awful is the lowest you can go seriously this movie is not worth watching waste of time i don't know what the hell is wrong with you guys voting this movie 7 out of 10 i seriously can make a better movie than this hire some other unemployed people 'n i promise i'll make a movie better than this this movie was so bad that i'll never watch a movie starring steve carrel again bottom line don't waste your time to download it off the net or rent it i'd nominate this movie for the worst movie of the century i mean the worst is something gotta give but after that this is the second
<START> for the first couple of seasons i thought the apprentice was a highly engaging and exciting show the combination between reality tv and a 16 week job interview was innovative and the producers of the show managed to keep the show relevant and not too out there br br the new season 6 is nothing more than a big joke and it has absolutely nothing to do with business at all in the earlier seasons they used to put a lot more emphasis on the business related tasks now the focus is mostly in the boardroom where the contestants are expected to do everything to keep them on the show that means lying trash talking backstabbing etc the boardroom can be entertaining to watch but it's entertainment at it's low point sometimes you wonder if you are watching a repeat of an old jerry springer episode the tasks on the show are at most boring and mostly a showcase for the companies who are dumb enough to pay nbc for the publicity and what is the deal about half of the contestants living in tents in season 6 that is just plain stupid and has nothing to do with business in real life br br i have absolutely no respect for any of the contestants this season they all seem like idiots to me in earlier seasons at least some of the contestants had a bit of integrity now it seems like the contestants would kill their own mother to keep them on the show it also seems like donald trump's massive ego becomes bigger and bigger for every season that pass by and to be honest i can't see why anyone with a common sense would want to work for him his rationality in the boardroom mostly doesn't make any sense at all and sometimes it seems he just like to trash people for what it's worth br br r i p the apprentice please nbc for god's sake get the show off the air as soon as possible it's just too embarrassing to watch the apprentice was once a great tv show but now it's just a big fat joke
<START> the film largely focuses on a bullying robert taylor as a ruthless buffalo hunter and the people who have to put up with him set amidst a hunt for dwindling numbers of buffalo it portrays the end of a tragic era of senseless slaughter and is full of drama and remorse for both the buffalo and the native americans taylor is blinded by his hatred of indians and his naivete that the buffalo herds will never disappear in one scene he shoots animal after animal while in another he murders indians and then eats the food they had cooking on their fire under this ruthless exterior lies an insecure person who is reduced to begging his comrades stewart granger lloyd nolan and russ tamblyn not to leave him it's not the most pleasant of films and is weighed down by the drama it creates leading to a dismal and very fitting conclusion in a blizzard
<START> insignificant and low brained haha 80's horror like there are thirteen in a dozen yet it can be considered amusing if you watch it in the right state of mind the special effects are tacky the acting atrocious and the screenplay seems to miss a couple of essential paragraphs the brain takes place in a typical quiet american town setting where every adolescent works in the same diner and where the cool kid in high school flushes cherry bombs down the toilet it is here that a tv guru named dr blake and his adorable pet brain begin their quest for nation wide mind controlling under the label of independent thinkers a giant cheesy brain sends out waves through television sets and forces innocent viewers to kill how cool is that now it's up to the meadowvale teen rebel to save the world the funniest thing about the plot is that it never explains where dr blake and his monstrous brain actually come from there are obvious references towards extraterrestrial life but that's about it meh who needs a background in a movie like this really there's not that much bloodshed unfortunately and the evil brain looks like an over sized sock puppet the only more or less interesting element for horror buffs is taking a look at the cast and crew who made this movie director ed hunt and writer barry pearson are the same men who made bloody birthday guilty pleasure of mine and plague both those are much better movies and they wisely decided to resign the film industry the most familiar face in the cast unquestionably is the great david gale whom horror fans will worship forever for his role in re animator a girl named christine kossak provides the nudity factor and she's obviously a great talentÂ she has exactly 3 movies on her repertoire of which this is her masterpiece in her debut she was credited as 'runaway model' and in 3 men and a baby her character is referred to as 'one of jack's girls' i really wonder how she feels about her career as an actressÂ
<START> high school friends andre kriegman and cal gabriel declare war on their classmates and plan a terrifying assault on their high school as they begin the deadly countdown to their final act of revenge the two start a video diary to explain their feelings and chronicle their mission br br there is another similar movie like this called elephant why do i bring this up to compare the two films of course i have to say even though i liked elephant this is a much better film what's the difference you ask well for starters this is shot differently much along the lines of cloverfield blair witch project and diary of the dead this makes the movie all the better because it's much more painfully realistic br br but what won me over was how the movie was willing to show the other side of the story you get to know these two shooters unlike elephant i actually cared for one of the shooters and could understand their actions and why they did what they did this movie actually makes you feel sympathetic to these people and that's a good thing because it's not always black and white br br to be honest this is why i almost cried in this movie the characters are real human beings with logic and reasons behind their actions you get to understand them it's not like they want to kill people for attention overall this film is emotionally gripping and very haunting and much better than elephant
<START> oh man this thing scared the heck out of me when i first watched it and i was sixteen br br that creepy animated barbie is scary as hell i want to stop talking about her now
<START> almost from the word go this film is poor and lacking conviction but then again most people would struggle to show commitment to a script as uninspiring as this the dialogue really does not flow and sometimes as in this case more is less or should have been this is also backed up by odd scenes e g the cemetry slow motion walk that you think might lead somewhere but only seem to waste a few more seconds of your life br br the plot is a strange combination of gangster situation comedy which i am sure seemed a good idea at the time but if ever there was a case for someone needing to be honest with the scriptwriter then here was it br br martin freeman is okay but then he seems to have one character which always plays so i am beginning to wonder if he was given a script or just filmed and told to react as normal br br finally humour this reminds me of the 'python i think quote about shakespere of his 'comedies' if he had meant it to be humorous he would have put a joke in it well i didn't see one br br don't waste your time i did because i was watching it with a friend and kept hoping that it was going to get better br br it didn't
<START> i recently saw this at the 2009 palm springs international film this is the feature length directorial debut of veteran dutch actress monique van de ven and based on my observation it should be her last i hate movies that are so implausible that you are picking apart practically every scene this film immediately leaves you scratching your head as it begins a young photographer and his girlfriend who works for an international aid organization are having a leisurely drive through the taliban controlled mountains afghanistan having a conversation about their love when a rocket stops a truck in front of them they get out of their vehicle to watch as talliban fighters equipped with rocket launchers machine guns rifles handguns and grenades execute all five people in the truck bob waldemar torenstra starts taking pictures of all this when he is spotted by one of the insurgents who lobs a hand grenade at them that kills his girlfriend since they are with hand throwing distance they can't be more than 50 yards away yet he somehow gets away his girlfriend is blown up and he takes a picture of the moment of the grenade impact that kills her and wins a prize as photographer of the year for the photo every scene and situation in this film as as ridiculous as it's opening the following year bob finds himself on assignment for national geographic on a dutch resort island where he meets kathleen sophie hilbrand and inserts himself into her seedy underworld of international drug smugglers avoid this film i would give it a 4 0 out of 10
<START> in cold blood adapted by director richard brooks from truman capote's famous novel deals with the brutal and senseless murder of a family of four by a pair of hapless criminals the film excels as a character study of the killers particularly trigger man perry smith robert blake br br the cast includes few recognizable names but they nevertheless bring the story to life with ease robert blake and scott wilson are excellent together as two criminals with disparate personalities they play off of each other effortlessly while blake also gets plenty of opportunities to explore his character's idiosyncrasies the rest of the cast is merely average and isn't worth remarking on br br richard brooks received oscar nominations for both his script and his direction in my opinion both were excellent though the script does miscalculate with some ill advised narration in the late stages the oscar nominated cinematography by conrad hall is also top notch as is the editing also worthy of note is the jazzy score by quincy jones which secured the last of the film's four oscar nominations br br unlike so many other crime films this one doesn't glamorize violence brooks turns the killers into pitiable characters rather than flatly condemning them whether or not you agree with that sentiment the film does present an interesting alternative to the usual hollywood approach i recommend the film for this reason and also for the expertise with which the technical aspects are handled
<START> ice t stars as mason a homeless african american who finds himself hunted by wealthy hunters rutger hauer gary busey charles s dutton f murray abraham william mcnamara and john c mcginley however mason proves to be much harder prey then the usual targets in this ridiculous and slow paced actioner which takes too long setting up actionscenes and then totally botching them
<START> this is a hilarious film burt reynolds is a nascar star who signs a sponsorship contract with ned beatty's chicken pit restaurants the contract has all sorts of humiliating clauses in it such as forcing burt to wear a chicken suit during the race jim nabors is his not quite convincing chief mechanic loni anderson oh yeah is assigned by beatty to keep reynolds honest and strictly adhering to the contract this is a funny film in which burt proves that he ain't too proud i like it
<START> the 3rd and in my view the best of the blackadder series br br the only downside is that there is no lord percy who was the funniest character from the previous series but hugh laurie's prince regent is suitably madcap laugh a line br br as a package it's quality through and through with convincing regency sets superb cutting sarcasm and little bits of the wacky the 'macbeth' actors standing out and prince georges 'lucky us' chicken impression and the missing words from dr johnson's dictionary br br few comedies have been quite as both clever as they are funny okay the odd lame observation or line gets in but mostly it's a scream
<START> the ultimate homage to a great film actress the film is a masterpiece of poetry on the screen like great poetry it is timeless direction cast screenplay music lyrics in fact all the norms for movie making are perfectly chosen to suit the message of the film the muslim society in india has never been presented with such respect nobility and reality the script is memorable in the hands of meena ashok raaj kumar nadira etc to name a few personally i was most impressed by the regal looking kamal kapoor the master movie maker kamal amrohi's lasting legacy to the sub continent a very beautiful film on a controversial theme that makes humanity look up and face the reality of the outcasts in the world 'in ka naam pakeeza haan pakeza' such acting is unheard of in this age of sex dance and pornography
<START> unless you are mentally ill or the most die hard segal fan you will tire of this horrendous excuse for a film in under 5 minutes br br the plot even for a seagal film the plot is just stupid i mean its not just bad its barely coherent br br the acting unbelievably wooden literally seen better acting in porno's ironically this film tries to cash in on this audience which a 'lesbian love scene' which is utterly cringe worthy br br special effects wouldn't look out of place in a 60's sword and sorcery flick br br unless you suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other cures don't make the same mistake as i did and buy this dvd as you will be asking for that hour and a half of your life back
<START> this low budget digital video film has strengths in the right places writing and acting in addition the digital photography is the best of the lot so far in low light conditions the characteristic video umber tone prevails but surprising it rivals film stock for brightness clarity and saturation in brightly lit situations this is grass roots film making at its best with snappy dialogue carrying a midnight cowboy kind of story about grifters doing whatever it takes to survive in urban san francisco
<START> spectacular horror movie that will give you the chills once you get settled with it the atmosphere is very creepy and stylish the score is chilling but the best about the movie is it's performances it's rare to get scared by performances and this movie's solid acting plays an important part in the scare factor br br the story is very interesting and gets your attention since the first minutes though the woman in black does not have much screen time she makes the necessary appearances to chill the audience in some brilliant scenes the dialogs are very descriptive and make your imagination work and that's when it becomes really scary br br if you have the chance watch this on theater it's a totally different experience but as scary as this movie br br this is one of the best ghost movies ever and it's directed for people that want to get scared
<START> this very peculiar setting of wagner's last opera definitely grew on me when i first saw it i was somewhat annoyed by many of the films surrealistic images and felt that far too much was superimposed upon the story however if you can put up with a fair amount of rather recherchÃ© gimmicks i think you will find that the film does manage to capture the very strange other worldly atmosphere of the opera and that there are moments which are particularly fine br br personally i never really understood the role of kundry until i saw how edith clever portrayed her her performance a lip synchronized mime of the singing voice of yvonne minton is nothing short of dazzling from end to end and alone justifies the hours it takes to absorb the film br br another reason to delight in this film is that it captures the spectacular interpretation of robert lloyd of the crucial role of gurnemanz one which lloyd has performed to a crisp at opera houses throughout the world i have been privileged to enjoy him in the role of gurnemanz on the stage of the metropolitan opera several times and the lusciousness of his voice and the warm fatherliness of his interpretation of this noble character really needed to be preserved as did his performance in the character's two major monologues the karfreitag scene and the recounting of the prophecy in act 1 br br the version i have seen was a videotape made for america and so there were subtitles which alas could not be done away with this is especially unfortunate because the translation used is very inaccurate and forces an extremely christian interpretation on a film which is already forcing layers of interpretation on the opera this seemed to me to be quite contrary both to wagner's clear avoidance of christianity and his very deliberate attempt to generalize the christian elements of the story see footnote with spoiler at the end of this review i find it nearly impossible when viewing a film with subtitles to keep from absorbing them and strongly recommend that if in the dvd versions you have the ability to turn the subtitles off you do so and instead if the opera is unfamiliar to you that you read the libretto carefully beforehand br br the bottom line is that there is much in the film which i dislike and would just as soon have seen done differently but it has risen steadily in my estimation over the years since i first saw it and i find myself drawn to enjoy it again and again br br br br footnote containing a spoiler a good example would be kundry's famous line i saw him him and laughed this gets translated in the subtitles for reasons which escape me as i saw the savior's face it is especially irritating to me because throughout the libretto wagner very deliberately and carefully refers to this unseen character who need not be the biblical jesus as der heiland i e the german for the healer a reference to the wound of amfortas and to all wounds and maladies and the need for healing
<START> this is a really nice and sweet movie that the entire family can enjoy it's about two dogs and a cat who are taken away to live with someone else for a little while but the animals don't understand and they escape and go to find the family on their own the cat is named sassy and she lives up to her name chance is the younger dog who knows a lot about life on the inside of the pound shadow is the older and wiser dog who senses things put those three together on an adventure and it makes for a happy and fun filled time there are no special effects of the mouths moving so it isn't cheesy at all it's the best talking animal movie that i've seen so far it's a really good movie for families
<START> this movie is just another average action flick but it could have been so much better when the guns come out they really needed some choreography help someone like andy mcnabb who made that brilliant action sequence in heat as they move up the street from the robbery would have turned the dull action sequences into something special because the rest of the film was alright predictable but watchable better than you would expect from this type of movie then came the final scene the show down the one we had been waiting for but was like watching something from the a team in the 80s they shoot wildly nothing hits and they run around a house trying to kill each other same old same old
<START> what horrible writing and acting no personality what you can't make a good movie with a single character hmm it was done in castaway with self dialog br br so this kid goes on a trip to see his father the kid jason takes a plane and the pilot has a heart attack and dies mid flight so the kid crashes in a lake and survives then he runs around surviving in the wilderness until he gets rescued br br during that time he fights a bear twice the first time he fights it off in the lake the second time he makes a spear out of a branch and spears the bear two shots of fake blood spurting out of the bear's chest reminded me of monty python's the holy grail br br also the kid decides to kick a porcupine with predictable results br br gag
