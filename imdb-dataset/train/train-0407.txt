<START> i was a kid crazy about michael jackson his music his dancing he was and is the greatest of all times few days ago a friend gave me a present moonwalker dvd i just couldn't believe it so i took my time and saw the movie again after a lot of years and it kicked me back in time i almost cried not because of michael jackson but of the good old times i remembered back than when i went to his concerts enjoying music and dancing the movie gave me some other perspective than back then when i was a kid you can truly see the parody that michael went through his life thank you michael jackson to bring me back to those great times to your great music and dancing it's a shame that people has forgotten you i didn't because you gave me great moments with your music all the best to you where ever you are out there
<START> this movie really woke me up like it wakes up the main male character of this bravely different movie from his life slumber br br this guy john ben chaplin leads his mediocre safe life of a bank teller in a small provincial english town until the stunningly gorgeous wild girl to die for nadia nicole kidman ordered by email from russia enters his life to become his beloved wife by johns plan however a glitch turns up nadia does not speak a word of johns language although calm and emotionless on the outside john becomes so interested in beautiful nadia that instead of using the full refund policy of the matching service he buys her a dictionary to start the communication process br br what happens henceforth in the plot really shakes poor john from his slumber of a decently paid safe feeling clerk into a decision making decently thinking action figure giving the viewer a subliminal message you would have probably acted likewise br br kidman cassel kassovitz make a great team acting russians and they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing almost only due to the slight accent present in their russian dialogues however slight enough to amaze a native russian by the hard work done to get the words sound right nicole kidman proves her talent once again by playing a character quite different from the previous roles at least from the cultural background br br the pace of the film is fast and captivating and you certainly are not ready to quit watching when the end titles appear you rather feel that you're in the middle of the plot and are left with a desire to see the sequel as soon as it comes out br br my advice is to go out and get this film immediately and watch it and enjoy to sum it up it has an unusual plot great acting and ideas below the surface like the idea of the rude awakening from the artificial safe routine life of a wheel in a society's machine the life which members of the fight club were so keen to quit and the machine of which pink floyd sings welcome to the machine i bet that in the end john was rather off with sophia on their way to the unknown than not having met her at all br br thank you writers for the great story and everyone else for this great movie please make a sequel and you can stage it whereever and name the location whatever because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the 99 9999 percent of the potential viewers i am sure of it
<START> this is a good movie something fun about watching money be blown at a super rate especially from a kid's point of view take it for what it is a fun little movie about a kid's dream coming true and what a kid might do with 1 million dollars don't like it don't watch it they make movies for the watchers not the people that have nothing better to do then complain in their lives
<START> to be honest i watched this movie only because of my pubert needs i mean i couldn't get women at my age i was 9 or 10 so i thought watching elvira's cleavage was the closet thing to sex br br i ended up having a great time with this cult classic about horror comedy halloween parties sassy humor and some sexy evil displayed by elvira br br they just don't make movies like this anymore it had the feeling of an amateur effort mixed with a late night cable talk show host style br br the truth is that it generated plenty of fans because of it's humor and the ability to perform by cassandra br br this is classic that reminds me of the good days of usa up all night
<START> this movie got extremely silly when things started to happen i couldn't care less about any of the characters susan walters was so annoying and the leading actor forget his name also got on my nerves can't quite remember how it ended and so forth but the whole idea of aliens possessing human bodies and all just seemed stupid in this film things didn't quite carry off my dad told me it's s stupid movie i should've listened to him
<START> when the film began i was shocked to see it was filmed using a cheap video camera in fact the camera shakes and looks worse than the average home movie even direct to dvd films should have production values better than this heck a large percentage of the home videos uploaded to youtube have better production values all too often the film seriously appears to be made by sticking the camera on a tripod and turning it on with no camera person closeups and anything resembling camera work are absent in some scenes where they might have worked and in others there are too many or poorly framed closeups yecch br br the film is about two gay men who want to become married as if was made almost a decade ago their only option was marrying in vermont times have definitely changed however the recent acceptance of gay marriage cannot in any way be attributed to this film if anything it set the gay marriage supporters back instead of helping as the movie stinks and never really tries to seriously address the issue according to the film religious people are one dimensional idiots who carry bibles everywhere and shoot people as well as wives who have gay husbands are narrow minded when they learn their spouses have been living a lie go figure i'm sure glad it gives an honest chance to both sides on the issue br br the bottom line nothing about the film shows any professionalism at all and i even hesitate to call this a film it's more like a home movie and doesn't even merit a listing on imdb or even inclusion on imdb's bottom 100 list of the worst rated films of all time the acting is horrible the writing is horrible the direction if there even is any is horrible the camera work is horrible and the plot is horrible it's a home movie there is nothing positive i can say about this in any way except that it makes the films of ed wood seem like oscar contenders in comparison and i am sure the ghost of mr wood is smiling every time someone watches this mess br br i don't care if you are gay or straight this film is not worth your time and i don't know how they managed to create dvds of it i assume one of the actors burns them on his home computer during his free time seriously this gives new meaning to the word 'bad' br br by the way if the one lady in the film was a real lawyer wouldn't the ability to read be an important prerequisite i'm just sayin' br br finally with gay marriage being such a serious and important topic can't we have a film that's better than this that addresses the issue this one sadly only invites laughter
<START> it's been close to ten years since i've seen either of the last two sequels to phantasm surely due to my still vivid remembrance of them not being very good that being acknowledged to this day i'm still a huge fan of the first two installments so i thought i'd go back and re experience the 'final chapters' part three is definitely the worst of the series since it obviously takes itself less seriously and throws in a bunch of confusing stuff that doesn't make much sense again kicking off right where the previous movie left us reggie saves mike from the tall man who vows to come back for him later but things aren't safe for long when they come across jody who is inexplicably able to the take the form of a sphere apparently his soul is held prisoner by the tall man so mike is then dragged into the sinister double pronged netherworld and reg has to find him along the way he meets up with a ten year old kid and a nun chuck wielding black chick named rocky who assist him throughout his journey br br there's really nothing memorable about phantasm iii other than how stupid and forcefully humorous it tries to be only one positive aspect that didn't even help the movie and that was the return of a michael baldwin and bill thornbury who reprise their roles for the first time since the original 1978 classic the problem is they pretty much make cameo appearances reggie banister is of course back in his starring role but his bumbling love sick attitude makes his presence far too annoying to like angus scrimm also just didn't seem entirely into his role he talks too much here and is nowhere near as menacing and creepy in contrast with the quirkiness that the movie seemed to carelessly resort to most people's opinion on this flick seem pretty impassive and tend to think it's still entertaining maybe i'm just too much of a nit picker but i just couldn't get into this one i remember disliking it when i was a kid and after re watching it i can safely say nothing has changed don coscarelli rocked the scene with his original low budget nightmarish legendary film phantasm which i still rank as my top favorite horror flick and his respectable sequel kept things moving and darkly surreal and gory but lord of the dead stupid title just looked too rushed and slapped together to me the inclusion of the two new characters tim and rocky the only thing missing was scrappy doo was a strong indication of coscarelli running out of ideas and seeing how far he could ride the franchise br br so it's a phantasm movie with very little gore nudity and quadruple barrel shot guns need i say more
<START> i just finished watching this movie and i found it was basically just not funny at all br br i'm an rpg gamer computer type none of the dnd tabletop stuff but i found none of the jokes in this funny at all br br some of the scenes seemed to drag out a lot tilt and zoom could've been cut down to 5seconds rather than over a minute and it feels as though the director was just trying to fill in time br br i think i laughed a total of 2 3 times in the entire movie br br the acting itself wasn't all that bad around the standard that a b grade movie should have br br i'd suggest not bothering with this movie unless you're a huge dnd fan and even then it would probably be best to steer clear of it
<START> it's wonderful to see that shane meadows is already exerting international influence les convoyeurs attendant shares many themes with a room for romeo brass the vague class identity above working but well below middle the unhinged father the abandoned urban milieu the sense of adult failure the barely concealed fascism underpinning modern urban life br br but if meadows is an expert formalist mariage trades in images and his coolly composed exquisitely surreal monochrome frames serve to distance the grimy and rather bleak subject matter which meadows like veers from high farce to tragedy within seconds br br there are longueurs and cliches but poelvoorde is compellingly mad an ordinary man with ordinary ambitions whose attempts to realise them are hatstand dangerous while individual set pieces the popcorn pidgeon explosions the best marriage sequence since the dead and the deadly manage to snatch epiphany from despair
<START> live a little love a little is one of elvis' weirdest movies part slapstick part fluff part surreal and part strange elvis meets up with a very off beat girl with an annoying voice she looks like jennifer aniston story doesn't make much sense as is the case with most elvis presley movies and there a bunch of odd characters galore not much music in this one but what there is i liked although none are memorable strange continuity elvis and michelle carey go into her beach house at night but a few minutes later a delivery boy comes in and it's stark daylight what that's about the essence of the movie what oh two good things about the movie a elvis looks great and b the dog steals the show
<START> kirsten dunst is terribly overrated as an actress you can tell always she's just acting i like izzard though plot is awfully boring the viewer has no real connections to the characters never knowing who to really sympathize with or even care about slow dull movie with some laughs but few and not very funny anyway plot is not engaging or suspenseful in the least you can see each plot turn coming a mile away what is this movie supposed to be comedy drama who cares you won't by the end of this film
<START> this film attempts to follow the genre of low budget hand held camera flicks that have proved to be very effective and successful br br this one fails and how br br it's amazing how many so called awards this piece of garbage has got plastered on the cover it makes you wonder what these critics were on when they actually submitted this br br words fail to describe just how absolutely appalling this movie really is seriously it's that bad br br i watched it in 20 minutes flat on almost continual fast forward br br from rubbish lighting to dreadful directing grainy visuals to muffled sound and of course not forgetting the abysmal acting this was one completely and utterly pathetic piece of so called film making br br it seriously has no redeeming qualities whatsoever save your cash and watch a decent low budget horror flick there are plenty out there dead end the blair witch rec to name but a few br br avoid this rubbish at all costs do not waste your money or time on this piece of trash pretending to be an actual film br br take heed of all the other comments you've been warned
<START> i took part in a little mini production of this when i was a bout 8 at school and my mum bought the video for me i've loved it ever since when i was younger it was the songs and spectacular dance sequences that i enjoyed but since i've watched it when i got older i appreciate more the fantastic acting and character portrayal oliver reed and ron moody were brilliant i can't imagine anyone else playing bill sykes or fagin shani wallis' nancy if the best character for me she put up with so much for those boys i think she's such a strong character and her final scene when well you know always makes me cry best musical in my opinion of all time it's lasted all this time it will live on for many more years to come 11 10
<START> this movie maybe really bad but it is alot of fun the bad acting and poor direction enhance the film's hystericalness the twins are very funny in their conanesque roles if you go into this film expecting the first conan or excalibur than you will hate it if you watch it while in a good mood and accept it as good dumb fun you will have a good time watch for the scene where they try to hang the brothers its funniest scene in the film i wish mystery science theatre 3000 would have done this
<START> i have bought the dvd of this version to compare against the current bbc 2005 version which is brilliant the 1985 was adapted by arthur hopcraft who adapted tinker tailor soldier spy for tv and who died this year 2005 i remember great acting especially from rigg and elliott and moving music music in the 2005 version is far more understated but very telling just to pick up other commentators on a couple of points richard carstone is ada claire's boyfriend not esther's esther had no uncle charlie drake never played krook in either version nor did he play toby esterhase in ttss krook is played by comedian johnny vegas in the 2005 version toby was played by bernard hepton br br both versions are honourable and admirable adaptations of dickens' great novel now read the book it's not perfect and the sentimentality may make you wince at times but i defy you not to cry and laugh
<START> adam jones has a brilliant sense of humor there is nothing i didn't like about this film cross eyed was beautifully shot adam does a great job of not only developing the main characters but also the minor characters br br cross eyed gives hope to every low budget film out there that you don't have to spend a lot to create something worth watching there is something to like for everyone if you've had a terrible roommate if you've ever picked on a dork in high school if you've ever parked anywhere in the city if you have any type of sense of humor at all you will love this film this is the type of film that will be around for a long time and ends up resurfacing again once adam makes a bigger name for himself i look forward to adam's future projects
<START> the story of the film was as simple minded as its morality go find a girl marry her live with her happily ever after though the film had some fine moments and turns most of it stayed at the surface of what might have been shown in a film with the same storyline br br the baptist mormon struggle was only touched superficially and was mocked about probably intentionally a more interesting story would have been a mixed couple br br if you wanna see a film which doesn't need too much concentration which can be watched by the whole family and which teaches your children modest and conservative values besides the modern tolerance stuff you will be fine with this film might be shown at a family home evening
<START> my cable tv has what's called the arts channel which is a catch as catch can situation sometimes sometimes films sometimes short clips of films or ballets and i came into this just as the bar scene came on where they tear up their coupons excellent exquisite ealing wins again my wartime glasgow raised mother would love this should i ever find a copy of it some of britain's best artists from mr holloway to wayne and radford and the delicious miss rutherford having a wonderful time gently sticking it to the home office loved the last scene where as soon as they are back in england the temperature plummets and it rains
<START> this is one of the most daring and important of the so called pre code films made in hollywood during the 1930s unlike some pre code films that occasionally dabbled in subjects that would have never been allowed after 1934 5 this film fully immersed itself in a very sordid yet entertaining plot from start to finish the conventional morality of the late 30s and 40s was definitely not evident in this film as the film is essentially about a conniving woman who sleeps her way to the top and with no apologies along the way this broad both enjoyed sex and used it on every man who could help her get rich something you just never would have seen in films made just two or three years later br br the film begins with barbara stanwyck working in her father's speakeasy in addition to being her boss he is also her pimp and encourages her to sleep with a local government official so that he'll allow the illegal bar to operate with impunity while not especially clear here it appears as if daddy has been renting his daughter's body out for a long time br br however after nearly being raped and attacking this man by breaking a bottle of beer over his skull barbara has had enough and heads to the big city it doesn't hurt that the still blew up and killed her father but her feeling that she was whoring herself out and had nothing to show for it appeared to be the impetus to move br br despite the depression barbara uses sex to get a job at a huge mega bank she starts out at a pretty menial job as a file clerk but in the space of what seems like just a few weeks she sleeps her way from one job to another to yet another until she is sleeping with the head of the bank and his future son in law this all ends in tragedy but babs doesn't seem too shook up over the deaths of these two men in fact some time later she is able to insinuate herself into the life of the new ceo and once again she's on top perhaps in more way than one br br now so far this is a wonderful movie because it was so gritty and unrepentant barbara played a 100 sociopath a woman with no morality and no conscience just a desire to squeeze as much out of life as she could no matter who she hurt in the process however the brave writers and producer chickened out and thought it important to tack on a redemptive ending considering that this woman was so evil and conniving her change of heart at the end was a major disappointment and strongly detracted from the film in many ways this reminded me of the ending of jezebel as once again a wicked person somehow sees the light and changes at the not too convincing conclusion br br my advice is to try watching red headed woman and downstairs red headed woman is much like baby face but features no magical transformation at the end the leading lady really is a skunk down deep in downstairs a film very much like red headed woman the roles are reversed and a man john gilbert plays a similar conniving character both are classics and a bit better than this film br br this film is an amazing curio of a brief period of often ultra sleazy hollywood films and in this light it's well worth seeing for cinephiles also fans of the duke take note john wayne plays a very small part in the film and it's very unusual to see a very young wayne playing such a conventional role
<START> i realize it's not supposed to be bsg and i can handle slow paced shows if they're interesting but i find myself completely uninterested and bored with this series br br the formula for bsg seemed to be action adventure scifi suspense mystery drama br br the formula for caprica seems to be bland drama moderate scifi br br maybe it will get more interesting but as of episode 3 i can barely watch it in fact it's at the bottom of my to watch list for the week this is a sad state of affairs the syfi channel really destroyed their friday night lineup whatever happened to the glory days of sg1 stargate atlantis and bsg on friday nights they had a good thing there
