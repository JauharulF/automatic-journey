<START> okay first off seagal's voice is dubbed over for like 50 of the film why because apparently there were rewriting the script and story as they were shooting and they need to change his dialogue for story continuity as they have multiple versions from the very beginning you just scratch your head because the overdubs are not only distracting but they make no sense br br that said the story still sucked and doesn't make any sense at all when i got the the end i was just scratching my head cause the movie was so pointless and the ending didn't even make sense br br avoid like the plague this movie made me stop watching seagal straight to video movies cause they just get worse and worse
<START> preminger's adaptation of g b shaw's ''saint joan'' screenplay by graham greene received one of the worst critical reactions in it's day it was vilified by the pseudo elite the purists and the audiences was unresponsive to a film that lacked the piety and glamour expected of a historical pageant as in ''peeping tom'' the reaction was malicious and unjustified preminger's adaptation of shaw's intellectual exploration of the effects and actions surrounding joan of arc her actual name in her own language is jeanne d'arc but this film is in english is totally faithful to the spirit of the original play not only on the literal emotional level but formally too his film is a brechtian examination of the functioning of institutions the division within and without of various factions all wanting to seize power as such we are not allowed to identify on an emotional level with any of the characters including joan herself br br as played by jean seberg whose subsequent life offers a eerie parallel to her role here she is presented as an innocent a figure of purity whose very actions and presence reveals the corruption and emptiness in everyone as such seberg plays her as both saint and madwoman her own lack of experience as an actress when she made this film which does show up in spots conveys the freshness and youth of jeanne revealing both the fact that jeanne la pucelle is a humble illiterate peasant girl who strode out to protect her village and her natural intelligence by no means did she deserve the harsh criticism that she got on the film's first release it's a performance far beyond the ken and call of any first time actress with no prior acting experience shaw and preminger took a secular view towards joan seeing her as a medieval era feminist not content with being a rustic daughter who's fate is to be married away or a whore picked up by soldiers to and away from battlefields her faith her voices her visions which she intermingles with words such as imagination and common sense leads her to wear the armour of her fellow soldiers to lead them to battle to chase the invading englishman out of france br br and yet it can be said that the film is more interested in the court of the dauphin richard widmark the office of the clergy who try joan led by pierre cauchon anton walbrook impeccably cast and the actions of the earl of warwick john gielgud then in joan herself the superb ensemble cast all male portray figures of scheming machievellian although the story precedes niccolo opportunists who treat religion as a childish toy to be used and manipulated for their own ends the sharp sardonic dialogue gives the actors great fun to let loose john gielgud as the eminently rational earl whose intelligence albeit accompanied by corruption allows him to calculate the precise manner in which he can ensure joan gets burnt at the stake and anton walbrook's pierre cauchon brings a three dimensional portrait to this intelligent theologian who will give joan the fair trial that will certainly find her guilty richard widmark as the dauphin is a real revelation as against type a casting choice you'll ever find widmark portrays the weak future ruler of france in a frenzied comic caricature that's as close as this film comes to comic relief a comic performance that feels like an imitation of jerry lewis far more than an impetuous future ruler of france br br preminger shot ''saint joan'' in black and white the cinematographer is georges perinal who worked with rene clair and who did ''the life and death of colonel blimp'' in colour it's perfectly restrained to emphasize the rational intellectual atmosphere for this film preminger's preference for tracking shots of long uninterrupted takes is key to the effectiveness of the film there's no sense of a wasted movement anywhere in his mise en scene br br it also marks the direction of preminger's most mature and most neglected period his focus is on the conflict between individuals and the institutions in which they work how the institution function and how the individual acts as per his principles these themes get their most direct treatment in his film and as always he keeps things unpredictable and finds no black and white answers this is one of his very best and most effective films
<START> steven rea plays a forensic scientist thrust on the job in sovie russia in 1982 in the very first hours of his job a body of a murdered girl is brought in he has his workers go back to look for evidence and they bring back five more bodies this starts the story of the hunt for one of the worst serial killers in modern day history it is a stark depressing dark movie that explores how the bureaucracy of the old soviet union indirectly contributed or caused the deaths of many of the killers victims it also explores in donald sutherland's character how the proper usage of bureaucracy in a communist govt can help achieve the ultimate goal of finding a monster a gripping movie not for all but for those who like a good detective story that will hold your interest this is definitely a must see on a scale of one to ten 9
<START> if the writer director is reading this and i imagine you are since you should now be out of work then i must tell you i have seen some bad movies in my time but this one gets the distinction of having the worst premise i've ever heard br br spoilers nothing happens br br a total waste of time i laughed out loud at the end br br side note if the whole movie was her in a coma then does the scene where she sleeps with that guy mean someone raped her while she was knocked out br br utter rubbish
<START> someone had a great idea let's have misty mundae do her own r rated version of lara croft firing two guns not only in skimpy outfits but topless as well it was indeed a great idea the problem is that the people who had it couldn't come up with any sort of script or budget to support it therefore we get a film that barely reaches medium length by replaying many of its parts often in slow motion and was apparently shot entirely inside a garage the appeal of misty mundae is still evident she is unbelievably cute and has a natural girl next door beauty however her two female co stars here with whom she shares a lengthy lesbian scene are nowhere near her league if mummy raider was presented as a youtube video i'd rate it higher but as a film destined for dvd consumption it cannot get more than 1 2 a out of 4
<START> but this just isn't working and i am surprised to see how many people consider it good on what grounds there are some loose hints here and there but the whole material is self indulgent and unconvincing lynch's movies are generally intriguing because they generate a sense of confusion and yet are very playful when doing that there is some visual sense there are some subplots characters ideas etc but this is dull and yes pointless because whatever there is to explore is either to small either too far fetched or simply told before in a superior manner it's just lynch exploring dv nothing more so it should be treated like this 1 10
<START> after reading tons of good reviews about this movie i decided to take it for a spin i bought it on dvd hence the spin pun i'm a dork the beginning was everything i hoped for a perfect set up along with some quotes that i've heard on various wu tang albums to what should have been a good movie but the plot i heard was so great was so predictable every time i saw a character except for the lizard i guessed which venom he was plus the only cool character gets killed off in the middle of the movie ok so the plot wasn't very good but at least there was some good kung fu right wrong the fights were very short and few and far between granted the different styles were all pretty cool but i wish the fights were longer i kept hoping to see the lizard run and do some crazy ish on the walls but it never happened i was hoping to see the centipede do some tight speedy ish but it never happened i was hoping to see the scorpion in the movie for more than 7 total minutes but it never happened in short not much happens the fighting is all pretty routine don't be fooled just becuase this movie has a plot it does not mean it's a good one
<START> batman and superman iconic the better part of a century old who doesn't know of these two there must be countless of fans who would die to make a film about them sandy collora went ahead and put together a trailer for such a film which does not exist and is not being created much less by this team perhaps what this has most going for it is how polished it is throughout the cinematography is solid the editing is spot on the production values even with the costumes looking more like their comic counterparts than the ones of the feature films featuring these character are quite high it looks quite hollywood this trailer the physical types fit for as far as i can tell every single character the lines are reasonably written the shots are well thought up nicely achieved and fairly effective however this does have problems and in spite of looking good it doesn't quite match the energy and skill of grayson which only had the problem of teeter tottering too much back and forth between a short and a trailer as well as unbridled passion leading to the inclusion of too many characters and ideas the acting is perhaps the most evident it's not good even some of those who only have one line and or hardly appear on screen at all manage to fail at delivering a good performance the actors cast in the parts seem to have been chosen more for how much they look like the characters they're playing than their talent then there is the writing really the plot well what minuscule amount there is this and this character team up something about some evil plot is fine there is a problem in the characterization while most characters seem to fit two face is well about as much as a cackling lunatic which is quite simply as far as i've understood not what the character is as he was in batman forever and having your work on portraying any element of the batman universe compared to joel schumacher's efforts can be considered the greatest insult to a fan also putting that character in this is going to cause comparisons between this trailer and that film honestly collora is practically begging for it with such a similar initial reveal to be made and let's face it this loses in every respect michael antonik most definitely does not possess the screen presence that tommy lee jones does and the make up which in aforementioned reveal is essential isn't as strong as that of the film whether or not it was good in the film is another matter the sad thing is that while fiorella john who created grayson seems to be far more into the comics and get them the depth of them better not to mention possessing more of an ability to come up with compelling plot grayson had enough material for half a dozen feature films or more collora seems to be the one with access to funds and the one who's more likely to have contacts on account of having non indie credits on his filmography to actually have a shot at making an actual feature out of his trailer i intend to watch other of collora's work but fiorella is the one of the two whose work i will most definitely be most interested in i recommend this to fans of the characters 7 10
<START> i saw this gem of a film at cannes where it was part of the directors fortnight br br welcome to collinwood is nothing short of superb great fun throughout with all members of a strong cast acting their socks off it's a sometimes laugh out loud comedy about a petty crook cosimo played by luis guzman who gets caught trying to steal a car and sent to prison while in prison he meets a lifer' who tells him of the ultimate bellini' Â which to you and me Â is a sure fire get rich quick scheme it turns out that there is a way through from a deserted building into the towns jewellers shop Â which could net millions sounds simple Â well throw in all kinds of wacky characters and incidents along the way and you have got the ingredients for a one wild ride Â word passes from one low life loser to the next and soon a team of them are assembled to try and cash in on cosimos bellini' lead by failed boxer pero superbly played by sam rockwell Â surely a star in the making and reluctant crook riley william h macy who is forced to bring his baby along with him as his wife was locked up for fraud br br based on the italian film i soliti ignoti big deal on madonna street which also inspired a similar film to collinwood' Â palookaville' this knocks spots of the latter effort and although its written and directed by the russo brothers it definitely has shades of the coen brothers about it produced by steven soderbergh and george clooney who has a small yet hilarious part as a crippled safe breaker
<START> this film is about a group of five friends who rent a cabin in the woods one of the friends catches a horrifying flesh eating virus suddenly the friends turn on one another in a desperate attempt to keep from contracting the disease themselves br br cabin fever is a horrible film for one it tries to be many genres at once is it supposed to be a homage a slasher a black comedy or a scary movie with unintentional comedy nobody can tell there's a serious scene at first and a second alter it turns funny when the film tries to be funny the humor is quite bland excluding the ending i liked the ending a lot br br but apart from the ending i was pretty disappointed and disgusted the violence is cringe worthy more looking away from the screen than being scared the tone changes within each scene sometimes funny sometimes scary and sometimes quite random in fact you see a girl doing karate in slo motion what are we supposed to get from that this same girl would bite one of the characters was that supposed to be funny i don't know br br some of the performances were decent and many were quite amateurish i didn't care for most of the characters i liked the plot but the execution was done horribly as a horror film i didn't know what it was trying to be i didn't find it funny tense nor scary by the end you're left indifferent thinking what have i just been through unfortunately you'll never know the answer to that question
<START> i'd never heard of this then found out it's the man with the deadly lens which i'd heard of but not seen connery's presence drove me to buy it and it's not good it wants to be a sort of cross between dr strangelove and mash but it just isn't that funny unless you find the name general wombat funny it comes across as a flat 70s thriller until the last ten minutes when it springs to life there are many many flat scenes in the whitehouse between the president and his aides which don't work it's almost as if the initial cut was too long and the first half was edited down to get to the whole nuclear bomb ransom storyline and the suicide bomber attacks which i think are meant to be played for laughs but again aren't that funny the location filming is excellent but the studio stuff looks like cheap tv i could not believe the man responsible for key largo crossfire and elmer gantry did this only laugh connery throws away his wig before putting on his helmet and jumping out of a plane it makes never say never again look like genius
<START> i thought that the sentinel was going to be a mediocre movie when i finally saw it i took a good surprise the movie isn't great thing but it's very fun and the action scenes are very well done this movie reminded me tv series like 24 or alias it's very similar to that series and it reminded me too to the wolfgang petersen's thriller in the line of fire if you're going to expect one of the most original and and one of the greatest thrillers in the history of movies you will be disappointed but if you go with little expectations you will enjoy the sentinel br br rating 7
<START> what a sad sight these tv stalwarts make running out the clock on their careers stumbling about a little rusting hulk of a ship boat might be more appropriate the whole production feels cheap and shabby and it's not helped by a big name star who is barely capable of spitting out the few lines that he's given in a credible fashion br br at no time do the supporting cast rise above the material they're clearly watching the clock here bang out the scenes get the pay cheque go home and try to forget all about it br br it's not particularly badly scripted or filmed there are no real clangers it's just utterly anodyne and shot in a very limited number of cramped sets with a small cast of extras the pacing is a little bizarre an embarrassingly tentative romantic sub plot is only begun after the main action starts which makes it feel irrelevant br br maiden voyage scores a couple of points for being competently scored and for being a fun game of spot the kiwi bit parters most of the cast are graduates of shortland street or xena warrior princess the saddest thing about this production is that this film probably constitutes their big break
<START> although i had no earthly idea on what to expect from this movie this sure as hell wasn't what i would have had in mind had anything actually come to mind once i heard of its existence all i knew was that i had to own a movie called please don't eat the babies unfortunately i could only find a copy under its alternate title island fury looking back i guess i could call it a lose lose situation on one hand i still don't get to be known as the guy who owns a movie called please don't eat the babies and on the other hand island fury would ultimately reveal itself to be an awful pointless boring unwatchable piece of garbage yeah definitely lose lose br br i'm not even sure what genre they're going for here just early 80's badness with a flashback that might actually be longer than the non flashback first up two teenage girls are being chased by two bad guys once caught the bad guys bring to our attention that one of the girls have a coin on a string around her neck and somehow these bad guys know of a lot more of these coins hidden on an island somewhere and this is where things start to get weird somehow these guys know of a trip the girls took to some island years earlier when they were only 10 i guess this is supposed to mean that the girls should know exactly where this alleged treasure is so now we're in the past while the girls try to retrace their steps so these bad guys don't kill them although i wouldn't have minded if they had in the flashback the 10 year old counterparts are on a boat trip with their sisters and the sisters boyfriends eventually stopping by an island for some air they get mixed up with some kid and his killer grandparents any potential suspense or reasons to keep on watching never shows up but the flashback was undeniably better than the present which still isn't saying much br br for a while there i had forgotten about the original story at one point i ithought maybe the director had too and when the flashback ended that would be the end which would have worked for me considering this disappointment would have been a half hour shorter this pointless movie within a pointless movie does eventually end and real stuff does happen but it's stupid i guess i didn't exactly expect a movie filled with infants being devoured or anything like that but i did expect some form of outlandish b entertainment mostly just a confusing inept storyline unsure of its genre my advice would be to seek out something worthwhile like attack of the beast creatures if anyone i would only recommend this one to serious b movie collectors who must have them all anyone else interested probably has brain damage what really gets me is that i still have no idea why they called it please don't eat the babies 3 10
<START> somewhere i'd read that this film is supposed to be a comedy after seeing it i'd call it anything but the point of this movie eludes me the dialogue is all extremely superficial and absurd many of the sets seemed to be afterthoughts and despite all the nudity and implied sexual content there's nothing erotic about this film all leaving me to wonder just what the heck this thing is about the title premise could have been the basis for a fun if politically incorrect comedy instead we're treated to cheap amateurish unfinished sketches and depravity and weirdness for its own sake if i want that i'll go buy a grace jones cd
<START> just finished watching american pie beta house and i gotta say this was such a garbage pile of crap the first 3 american pies were hilarious the last 3 were a joke and should not have been called american pie br br as you figured out from the title of the movie beta house is about a fraternity freshmen girls and the most original part of them all falling in love of course the guy that has his way with the chicks is stifler who along with his mates tries to complete another apparently impossible task it was unrealistic and super fake its just really predictable and the plot is so weak both sides of the college battle to see who gets the whole thing something like that to sum it up awful acting dull script wrong use of the american pie franchise total waste of time this movie is unbearable i give it a two out of ten although most of it sucked there were lots of nudity and pretty girls like 2 funny scenes
<START> i wrote a review of this movie further down after buying it on dvd and being sorely disapointed br br i tried watching it again after reading a few of the comments made since then being a film student and making similar budgeted movies myself ie no budget shot on digi cam i stand by my original comments this is a no budget student project and not a particularly good one released on video dvd to look like an award winning film if you read the cover so deceving the public into thinking it's something it's not i want my money back under the trades description act complete rubbish
<START> this episode introduced the holodeck to the tng world the jarada have to be contacted and a precise greeting must be delivered or it would greatly insult them a tired picard decides to take a trip into the holodeck and a wonderful adventure begins the settings are superb and almost movie like alas the jarada probe sent shortly thereafter damages the holodeck and all it's safety devices stop working picard and now guests must outwit the mobsters of gangland 40s america and return to the jarada rendezvous picard greets the jarada correctly and a new day dawns between humanity and the jarada this gem of a first season episode set the holodeck for many interesting and unusual adventures to be had there
<START> inspector dirty harry callahan once again angers his superiors with his maverick approach to police work refusing to take a vacation he is given a simple case which takes him outside of san francisco however he soon discovers a link between a recent murder in the city and a murder outside of the city which leads him to the trail of a revenge killer br br as an entry in the dirty harry franchise the film starts with some very promising moments including the legendary go ahead make my day line that eastwood delivers wonderfully through clenched teeth before single handedly foiling a robbery very badass and it just what fans can expect from him however the film soon shifts gears and focuses on the mysterious revenge killer the problem is that this killer isn't all that mysterious as she is characterized as much as harry is this really detracts from the presence of the main character who ruled all of his previous film appearances with pardon the pun magnum force br br on the bright side this new storyline does draw several parallels to harry's own unorthodox methods and gives his character dramatic depth that was not there before but fans that were looking for another badass harry outing will more than likely be somewhat disappointed however a tense climax ends the film on an exciting note so if you don't mind something a little different it is a good movie for fans 7 10 br br rated r for violence and a rape scene
<START> neatly skipping over everything from the coup in cuba to his undercover entry into bolivia part two of soderbergh's portrayal of che guevara is that of the tragic hero as with che Â part one this rather rambling guerrilla warfare escapade through the colourful mountains of bolivia is probably destined to disappoint more people than it will satisfy so why was the film and particularly benicio del toro's performance so loudly praised at cannes br br james rocchi for instance called it a work of art that's not just the story of a revolutionary but a revolution in and of itself the guardian's peter bradshaw called it a flawed masterpiece i return to my original contention for part one Â that the value lies particularly in depiction of a hero figure and in an age when there is a surfeit of poor hero role models could it not be salutary to see a strongly honourable one even if stripped of some of the less endearing episodes of his life this is the psychological hero enshrined by the great scottish essayist thomas carlyle in his seminal book heroes and hero worship heroes can be real or imaginary or somewhere in between but should genuinely inspire us to higher goals a higher purpose compare this with the unrealistic 'heroes' of standard western storytelling where a person undergoes trials and tribulations before obtaining a barely believable reward Â usually everlasting love or material wealth Â as if by divine studio intervention real heroes have an excess of moral courage Â not lost ark dare devilishness or james bond super toys they rise and empower others to rise to be the best that they can be in part one che succeeds in part two he fails it is not for want of moral courage but since a not all good plans can succeed and b being human mistakes are inevitable br br guevara's intellectual clarity is flawed when he equates conditions that justify armed struggle with conditions that make that armed struggle able to succeed it is a serious miscalculation br br high in the mountains from la paz the colours are breathtaking there is an air of mise en scene authenticity that was occasionally lacking in che part one the u s would not allow soderbergh to film in cuba visual treats are heightened by maximising natural light and the extreme flexibility and realism offered with groundbreaking red cameras this is a high performance digital cine camera with the quality of 35mm film and the convenience of pure digital designed for flexibility and functionality the package weighs a mere 9 lbs shooting with red is like hearing the beatles for the first time says soderbergh red sees the way i see so organic so beautifully attuned to that most natural of phenomena Â light if che had stopped with the successful cuban revolution it would have enshrouded him with an almost mystical invincibility that he fails in bolivia shows not only that he has human limitations but that it is his moral virtues that are remembered not the political triumph critics will say Â and with some justification that his armed struggle inspired much less noble characters to achieve tin pot dictatorships his development of guerrilla fighting tactics are not good or bad in themselves and have since been used for both br br but for all its praiseworthiness the film often seems to lack dramatic and narrative tension we stumble from one escapade to another knowing that he will eventually meet his death i found myself glancing at my watch and thinking it could have been shorter but the work that has gone into this Â interviews with people from all sides and even getting one of guevara's ex comrades to coach actors on the minutiae of the bolivian operations Â make the film a commendable achievement it might not be top flight entertainment but it demonstrates integrity in documenting a significant slice of history br br there is also another very important point in the che 'hero' figure here it's about failure that if you try your utmost even if you fail your effort will not have been in vain because it may give others hope and moral courage one could cynically call it a 'martyr' complex and it is found of course in many religious figures as well but che does not 'sacrifice' himself he does what he does best to the best of his not inconsiderate ability and so provides an example success or failure in any particular instance become mere details br br with the u s 's longstanding and illegal blockade of cuba all in the name of 'freedom' i am tempted to write that che parts 1 2 are too good to be wasted on the u s but that would be to invite a contention that the film has sought so earnestly to avoid one must hope that many viewers will have the skill to view che without politics and the bias that inevitably engenders whatever its faults it rehabilitates soderbergh from the populist nonsense of oceans 11 br br but if you haven't heard of che guevara or seen part one or if you can't get past the phrase 'murderous marxist' without frothing at the mouth i might struggle to imagine what you would get from this film the same can be said for many who have and can
