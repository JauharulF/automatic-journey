<START> five deadly venoms is not as bloody and violent as story of ricky or super ninjas but it features some of the best hand to hand fight sequences in hong kong film history director chang cheh creates what is considered by many to be his masterpiece this movie launched the careers of the five men who play the venoms meng lo plays yet another bad ass he would go on to be in super ninjas kuo chui who is philip kwok would go on to story of ricky and hard boiled any chop socky fan can apperciate this but i still think it ain't as good as super ninjas also made by chang cheh but all chop socky is good and this is one of the very best
<START> a mix of ninja stuff mixed with a sub james bond storyline the result is incredibly awful and boring being just the stage for endless gun battles i can't believe this was released in theaters terminate this movie
<START> obsession comes in many flavors and exists for a variety of reasons for some it may be nothing more than a compulsive disorder but for others it may be an avenue of survival lack of nurturing combined with an inability to negotiate even the simplest necessities of daily life or the basic social requirements may compel even a genius to enthusiastically embrace that which provides a personal comfort zone and in extreme cases the object of that satisfaction may become a manifested obsession driving that individual on until what began as a means of survival becomes the very impetus of his undoing and as we discover in the luzhin defence ' directed by marleen gorris a high level of intelligence will not insure a satisfactory resolution to the problem and in fact may actually exacerbate the situation obsession it seems has no prejudice or preference moreover it gives no quarter br br at an italian resort in the 1920's alexander luzhin john turturro is one of many who have gathered there for a chess tournament the winner of which will be the world champion luzhin is a master of the game but he is vulnerable in that chess has long since ceased to be a game to him rather it is his obsession that one thing discovered in childhood that saw him though his total ineptness in seemingly all areas of life and enabled him to cope with the subtle disenfranchisements of his immediate family so luzhin is a genius with an achilles heel a flaw which perhaps only one other person knows about and understands and furthermore realizes can be exploited for his own personal gain at this very tournament that man is valentinov stuart wilson luzhin's former mentor who after an absence of some years has suddenly reappeared and made himself known to luzhin br br valentinov is an unwelcomed disconcerting presence to luzhin and once again life threatens to overwhelm him not only is he about to face a formidable opponent in the tournament turati fabio sartor against whom in a previous match he emerged with a draw after fourteen hours but he is also attempting to resolve a new element in his life his feelings for a young woman he's just met at the resort natalia emily watson and genius though he may be dark clouds are gathering above him that just may push luzhin even deeper into the obsession that has been the saving grace as well the curse of his entire life br br to tell luzhin's story gorris effectively uses flashbacks to gradually reveal the elements of his childhood that very quickly led to his obsession with chess and as his background is established it affords the insights that allow the audience to more fully understand who luzhin is and how he got to this point in his life for the scenes of his childhood gorris textures them with an appropriately dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding that carries on into and underlies the present more pastoral setting of the resort the transitions through which she weaves the past together with the present are nicely handled and with the pace gorris sets it makes for a riveting yet unrushed presentation that works extremely well she also underplays the menace produced by the presence of valentinov concentrating on the drama rather than the suspense which ultimately serves to heighten the overall impact of the film making luzhin's tragedy all the more believable and unsettling br br the single element that makes this film so memorable however is the affecting performance of john turturro for this film to work luzhin must be absolutely believable one false or feigned moment would be disastrous as it would take the viewer out of the story immediately it doesn't happen however and the film does work because the luzhin turturro creates is impeccably honest and true to life he captures luzhin's genius as well as his inadequacies and presents his character in terms that are exceptionally telling and very real it's a performance equal to if not surpassing geoffrey rush's portrayal of david helfgott in shine ' and when you compare his work here with other characters he's created from sid lidz in unstrung heroes' to pete in o brother where art thou ' to al fountain in box of moonlight ' you realize what an incredible range turturro has as an actor and what a remarkable artist he truly is br br as natalia emily watson is excellent as well turning in a fairly reserved performance through which she develops and presents her character quite nicely though she has to be somewhat outgoing to relate to luzhin watson manages to do it in an introspective way that is entirely effective most importantly because of the detail she brings to her performance it makes her accelerated relationship with luzhin believable and lends total credibility to the story you have but to look into watson's eyes to know that the feelings she's conveying are real it's a terrific bit of work from a talented and gifted actor br br the supporting cast includes geraldine james vera christopher thompson stassard peter blythe ilya orla brady anna mark tandy luzhin's father kelly hunter luzhin's mother alexander hunting young luzhin and luigi petrucci santucci well crafted and delivered the luzhin defence' is an emotionally involving film presented with a restrained compassion that evokes a sense of sorrow and perhaps a reflection upon man's inhumanity to man we don't need a movie of course to tell us that there is cruelty in the world but we are well served by the medium of the cinema when it reminds us of something we should never forget inasmuch as we all have the ability to effect positive change and to make a difference in the lives of those around us i rate this one 9 10 br br br br br br
<START> expecting to see another nunsploitation movie with a mean mother superior abusing and torturing her charges flavia turned out to be much more than i had anticipated br br it actually has a feminist storyline though i don't think such a term existed in the era in which the movie is set it certainly wasn't practiced women and the jews and the poor are very downtrodden and locked into menial spots in society throughout the story sister flavia florinda bolkan witnesses the tyranny of her time until she just can't sit there any longer and actually does something about it albeit with disastrous results br br the pre credit sequence has flavia as a young adolescent near a battlefield she sees an injured evil muslim soldier one of the few still alive and tries to assist him before she can her hate filled father beheads the soldier and waves his head in her face great family dynamics huh after this her father forces her to join a convent where she witnesses even more injustice though scenes do involve violence rape and nuns i would consider this more of a historical drama than nunsploitation br br indeed many of the ingredients for a trashy exploitation piece are there but the acting camera work storyline and music are too good to keep it down in that level most nun films i've seen usually have the basic premise of a good girl somehow winds up in a convent where the mother superior is a supreme bitch that likes to whip people and or make their lives a living hell br br flavia spends much of the first part of he movie passively questioning all of the atrocities happening around her much of her passivity is forgotten when she becomes acquainted with the strong spirited but slightly loony she likes to pee outside like me but it's a lot easier for guys sister agatha when a group of muslims attack their abbey flavia and agatha do not cower in fear like the other nuns their attackers actually function as their liberators of the cruelty and near slavery of the abbey in fact it is a christian not a muslim invader that impales dear sister agatha br br it is agatha's death that sends flavia on her violent crusade against those who have oppressed her her father treats her like dirt her muslim lover deserts her at a very inopportune time i don't want to give out too much of the rest of the story but be prepared to be shocked devastated and saddened at the conclusion this is a great film so don't be put off by its undeserved reputation as a trash epic plus how on earth could a movie featuring florinda bolkan and claudio cassinelli go wrong i am not familiar with marÃ­a casares' other works but sister agatha is a hell of a character br br i have read many great reviews of the synapse us release but i love my german x rated kult dvd copy it isn't anamorphic 16 9 but actually has a little more picture information on all of the edges than synapse's release br br and there are also many great wise or funny lines of dialogue many from sister agatha br br why is god male the father the son and the holy spiritÂ they're all male flavia br br these men are afraid look at them sister afraid their power will be taken away from them sr agatha regarding christians fleeing after the muslims arrive br br woman where are you going the moslems can do nothing to you that the christians haven't done ha ha ha sr agatha to a group of fleeing christian women br br lord bless these moslems for putting fear into these pompous christians flavia br br does it take the mere sight of a moslem to make you h t your underclothing sr agatha br br closing message flavia gaetani not yet a muslim no longer a christian was punished as a runaway nun the idea for the film came from events which occurred during the musalman invasions of italy culminating in what even today is remembered as the martyrdom of the 800 at otranto
<START> this film has a special place in my heart as the worst movie i have ever seen it is about as fun as doing hard manual labor with stomach cramps the movie starts out bad i would rate the first few minutes of the film a 1 10 and then it get progressively worse minute by minute the only way to rate it at all would be some kind of abyssmal spiraling negative number that grows for ninety long minutes unfunny is not a real word but it best describes the humor in this video somehow the video manages even to make cute scantily clad females and sex look grotesque and distasteful this movie is amazingly bad i would say it would be better to be locked up with the titanic theme playing over and over and with buscemi's character from escape from la droning on in your ear than to watch this movie the sequels are not nearly as bad if you have to rent a troma film get tromeo and juliette or combat shock i would rather watch 5 tony little infomercials back to back than to see class of nukem high again don't get me wrong it took some kind of criminal genius to make a movie this terrible and if ever a movie deserved an award for being awful this is it
<START> i thought the racism and prejudice against carl brashear was grossly overdramatized for hollywood effect i do not believe the u s navy was ever that overtly racist i cannot imagine a full captain the commanding officer ever telling his chief to intentionally flunk anyone certainly not at the risk of his life and there has never been a chief petty officer as unabashedly prejudice against everybody but wasps as deniro's character no chief as slovenly and drunken as he was played would have ever risen to master chief in the first place cuba gooding saved an otherwise badly done movie
<START> i saw this movie about a year ago and found it to be completely laugh out loud funny a real winner in my mind it had the underlining of a stupid comedy but indeed had an actual plot as well much like the hit comedy elf in fact it had a few serious moments sandwiched between hilarity when stiller shot black's horse an ordinarily sober moment you found yourself laughing at his bumbling antics you can actually find common ground there as i'm sure many people have done something they wouldn't want a friend to find out about lest your friendship should end br br when i found out how much people disliked this movie i was completely dumbfounded that absolutely terrible movies like napoleon dynamite had ratings higher than it makes me wonder about the sanity of people on imdb take my advice and rent it if you don't find yourself laughing at least once i'll compensate you the rental fee d
<START> i had seen this film way back in the 80's and had nearly forgotten it when i noticed it was on tv again and watched it i remembered having liked this little sleeper when i first saw it and i liked it even better on second viewing br br all of the actors especially robert duvall glenn close wilfred brimley frederic forrest and jason presson as the twelve year old boy who feels responsible for the accidental shooting death of his older brother are superb the film has a very genuine feel to it an understated quiet deeply moving story of a family aching with grief the dialogue is sparse but telling and the nonverbal acting is outstanding sort of like a simpler rural version of ordinary people sans psychiatrist but equally impressive family dynamics br br the stone boy is well worth the time and emotional energy involved in watching it
<START> suggesting nothing less than a movie length version of the 1970s tv hit love american style decked out with flashes of nudity superchick 1973 is a lighthearted piece of fluff that somehow still manages to entertain and the lead character here tara b true really is some kind of superchick a stewardess not flight attendant who's so good looking that even her plane's autopilot has made a pass at her and with a hunky boyfriend in every port this wingin' swingin' gal really does put the lay in layover what with her germaphobe surgeon beau in new york her playboy with gangster problems in miami and her creatively challenged rock star dude in l a tara sure does keep busy and when she's not draining these guys of all their manly energies as the viewer learns she's liable to be taking a karate class mile high clubbing fending off flashers and rapists attending groovy pot parties and stopping a hijacking attempt on her airplane as i said lighthearted fun and surely good for a night when you're feeling somewhat brain dead and just want to veg out in front of the tube future astrologist joyce jillson does bring some vacuous charm to her role as tara and the film looks handsome enough to please disappointingly buxom '70s faves uschi digard and mary gavin aka candy samples are wasted here in very small roles but still get to do what they do best show off their chesticles though the picture is never laff out loud funny and doesn't really have many thoughts in its metaphorical head it does succeed in being consistently amusing and i suppose that is something strange that the end credits should call attention to ms jillson's body double however don't think i've ever seen that before
<START> i can't imagine anyone would ever in a million years want to watch this movie not because it was one of the worst ever made it wasn't but largely because it's about 20 years old and oh so out of the mainstream i was trying to find out where i saw an actor before and this popped up so yeah a kid stops playing little league because he doesn't like nukes this prompts major media attention and a quick resolution to the cold war the end a fantasy to be sure but one so cockeyed it would make john lennon blush since terrorism has replaced communism as the ism that scares the hell out of us this movie really has no relevance except as an innaccurate look back at those times the writing acting and film craft are similarly undeveloped the reason i rated it as highly as i did was because i watched this movie around 50 times while i was 5 6 years old and still have a little place in my heart for it but i now realize that it doesn't quite cut mustard so if the law of large numbers holds true and someone eventually does decide to check out this movie realize that there are much better ways to spend your time but also much worse ones i will refrain from a john q tirade for now
<START> i thought this was a great idea but boy was it poorly executed we do get a broad sense of how complex and challenging the backstage operations of a show are but virtually no specifics about any of it works the producers don't seem to have found any way to tell a story or give the viewer a through line which is not to say they didn't try but having the stagehands relate a synopsis of the ring cycle as the program's narrative does nothing to tell us about the job of physically mounting an opera br br we see lots of things happening but are told little about what it is that the people are doing and why there's little sense of who is who or how the various production departments fit and work together for instance several times we hear about a problem of some sort one expects then to see the problem and its consequences and or how it gets resolved but instead the filmmakers generally just cut to something else generally pretty generic footage of people pushing stuff or talking into headsets br br overall the film ends up feeling more like a pastiche of images that you'd see run under the closing credits of a show rather than anything worth watching for its own merit
<START> i rented this flick for one reason tom savini i respect his work but this was a real let down i had horrible clichÃ©s half of the film was naked women so called fallen angels running around trying to act scary oh and then there was the occasional blair witch black and white motion sicken camera scenes tom's character was really awful horrible script and you got to love these lines they use is anyone there who is out there this isn't funny no but your acting was i wish i could give this flick a 0 oh the names of the characters judd molly ally emilio but they did leave out anthony the breakfast club reunite in the forest of unforgivable acting
<START> this has to be some of the worst direction i've seen the close up can be a very powerful shot but when every scene consists of nothing but close ups it loses all its impact br br tony scott has some very beautiful scenery to work with the backdrops of mexico the cantinas the beautiful estate where anthony quinn lives and the dusty towns costner rolls through on his journey for revenge unfortunately we only catch quick glimpses of these places before the camera cuts to a picture of a big giant head even the transition scenes where costner is driving alone across mexico quickly cut to a close up br br the score is over dramatic and intrusive dictating every emotion we should feel the story itself should have been handled much better among other things too many people pop up out of nowhere to help costner along it's just bad writing br br it's a typical thriller storyline but many others have taken the same premise and done outstanding things with it costner's no way out had a somewhat similar storyline but it was a much better movie br br the ending was completely anticlimactic and suffered from the most melodramatic scoring of the film this movie was never going to be great but if we saw more of mexico and less of giant heads this film might have been watchable
<START> incredibly intriguing and captivating i found it impossible to turn away once i began to watch i am usually one of the harshest critics but to me this film was just brilliant strange as this may sound i could almost smell the air and feel the textures of the locations br br from a cinematographic i thought there was great use of light and texture from the orange glow of the summer light down to the plastic wrapped couch all had a distinct air of realism to me br br from a character perspective i thought the notion of victor vargas as almost the glue that connects the story was quite inspired each of the other members of the family having a more complete background simply caused greater intrigue in the main character himself br br beyond that having known someone just like the grandmother and having been on the receiving end of just such a situation i can say the situation felt particularly realistic the awkwardness the accent the cooking and even down to the comments made felt so authentic to me br br i think this film worked for me because i began to watch it with no expectations and found it completely immersing and brought back memories of teenage emotion well worth a watch
<START> this movie is a riot i cannot remember the last time i had such a great time at the movies i've seen a few good comedies in my time and usually they are pretty funny but this one is wall to wall great lines i think best in show is the last movie that i laughed so hard and so much in the movie was non stop until the end when they did the 5 minutes of sentimental plot clean up other than that it's a constant barrage of one liners and goofy situations i'd like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the zucker movies where you don't get all the jokes the first time around you have to see it two or three times to get it all in br br as far as the actual film goes it could have used a better edit it's choppy at times but we have to be forgiving for that all the characters are great it's not like an adam sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke i think i will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so likable no victims in this movie also thank god they got a 45 year old actress to play his girlfriend catherine keener plays her and she is a sweetheart in this film you just wish that women like her really existed she's not a 10 like some of the other leading ladies but somehow her smile is warmer than julia roberts overdone overbite br br if you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it i assure you the trailer does not do it justice they do not give away all the good jokes just some of the mediocre ones br br oh and one more thing i hope critics put this on their top ten list many of them complain that comedies don't get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they don't put it on their list this means you ebert
<START> a fascinating look at the relationship of a single father in 1998 and a single mother in 1881 tied together by a time traveling teenager reminded me of somewhere in time richard matheson's bid time return as rendered by christopher reeves and jane seymour
<START> fido is to be commended for taking a tired genre zombies and turning it into a most original film experience the early 50s atmosphere is stunning the acting terrific and the entire production shows a lot of careful planning suddenly the viewer is immersed in a world of beautiful classic cars eisenhower era dress art deco furniture and zombie servants it would be very easy to dismiss fido as cartoon like fluff similar to tank girl but the two movies are vastly different fido has structure a script that tells a story and acting that is superior make no mistake this is a daring black comedy that succeeds where so many others have failed highly recommended merk
<START> this isn't exactly a great film but i admire the writers and director for trying something a little different the film's main theme is fate and small seemingly insignificant things that can greatly change the future in some ways this reminds me of the film sliding doors though instead of focusing on one random event seemingly random stuff happens repeatedly and each one helps build to the cute conclusion plus an odd bald guy seems to understand all this and he talks about this during one brief scene like he's some sort of omnipotent being but there's absolutely no explanation of him in the film like the two guys that fight each other in the clock tower in the hudsucker proxy br br the dvd jacket shows just audrey tautou this is capitalize on her success in amelie though she is only one of many actors in the film and there is no one starring role the pace is brisk the acting fine and the conclusion isn't bad at all the only reason i didn't score it higher is that some of the characters were a bit uninteresting and i think the movie could have perhaps been tightened up with a few less subplots
<START> there is so much that can be said about this film it is not your typical nunsploitation of course there is nudity and sex with nuns but that is almost incidental to the story br br it is set in 15th century italy at the time of the martyrdom of 800 christians at otranto the battle between the muslims and the christians takes up a good part of the film it was interesting when everyone was running from the muslim hoards that the mother superior would ask why do you fear the muslims they will not do anything that the christians have done to you certainly there was enough torture on both sides br br sister flavia florinda bolkan is sent to a convent for defying her father in the process she witnesses and endures many things the gelding of a stallion the rape of a local woman by a new duke the torture of a nun who was overcome during a visit by the tarantula sect and a whipping herself when she ran off with a jew the torture was particularly gruesome with hot wax being poured on the nun and her nipples cut off br br sister flavia is bound to continue to get into trouble as she questions the male dominated society in which she lives she even asks jesus why the father son and holy ghost are all men br br eventually she joins the leader of the muslims as his lover and they sack the convent here is where you see more flesh than you can possible enjoy at one time but tragedy is to come she manages to exact sweet revenge on all including the duke and her father but finds that the muslim lover treats her exactly the same she is a woman and that is all there is to it br br i won't describe what the holy men of the church did to this heretic at the end but it predates the torture of saw or hostel by decades br br nunsploitation fans will be satisfied with the treats but movie lovers will find plenty of meat to digest
<START> i have seen my fair share of comedy and standup movies but this one is so original so fresh it will make you wonder why you always walked right pass it in the video store murphy has some pretty raunchy jokes but this is just too funny to pass if only every movie could be this funny it should be called 107 minutes of the most incredible comedy murphy is a comic genius in this film and will make you say this is the guy that did dr doulittle he talkes about the ice cream man shoe throwing mothers his aunt with a mustache racism and everything else you could possibly think of and the ones you couldnt please if you ever see one comedy in your life this is it if only all movies could be delirious
