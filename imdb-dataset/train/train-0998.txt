<START> i too loved this series when i was a kid in 1952 i was 5 and my family always watched this show my favorite character was the one played by marion lorne as a rather stuttering bumbling and very lovable aunt type person i can still recall her ubba bubba um um type comments as she would try and say something important and then when she came back and played aunt clara in bewitched it was great casting br br it was the first time that i can remember seeing walter matthau whose career i followed as a fan for many many years br br i have a question if anyone can verify was the title or end credits music the swedish rhapsody by hugo alfven every time i hear it played on my classical radio station here in southern california it brings back memories of the image of mr peepers walking away with his back to the camera i'm not even certain if this image in my mind's eye is correct
<START> diana muldaur appears on star trek for the second time but this time as a different character no one on board seems to notice maybe it was the hair regardless this time she is not the receptacle for a god see the previous episode but is a very famous lady with magical powers that enable her to communicate and see a medusan without going crazy the standard human response unfortunately the man that is most in love with her is a few cards short of a full deck and he tries to kill the medusan ambassador who oddly lives in a small crate this is a lousy way to travel and unfortunately muldayr isn't wound all that well herself what happens next is kind of dumb and by the time the episode was over the first time i saw it i was pretty relieved watching all the men on board go ga ga over muldaur was pretty silly and the acting of spock when he briefly went crazy was pretty campy do yourself a favor if you haven't seen the show before pick a different episode
<START> spoiles lame south of the border adventure movie that has something to do with the blackmail of a big cooperate executive rosenlski the president of unasco inc by on the lamb beachcomber david ziegler who's living the life of reilly or ziegler in his beach house in cancun mexico having this cd that he gave to his brother james that has three years of phone conversations between rosenlski and the president of the united states involved in criminal deals this cd has given david an edge over the international mobsters who are after him br br the fact that james get's a little greedy by trying to shake down rosenlski for 2 million in diamonds not only cost him his life but put david in danger of losing his as well ropsenlski want's to negotiate with david for the cd by getting his ex wife liz to talk to him about giving it up rosnelski made a deal to pay off her debts if she comes through david is later killed by rosenliski's mexican hit man tony with the help of a great white shark who just doesn't go for all this peaceful dealings on his boss' part br br tony had taken the cd that liz left for his boss at a local hotel safe and now want's to murder james like he did david and at the same time keep the cd to have something over rosenlski br br david who had secretly hidden the diamonds that james had on him at the time of his murder is now the target of tony and his men to shut him up for good david also wants to take the diamonds and at the same time give his boss rosenlski the impression that the cd that david had is lost but use it later without rosenlski knowing who's behind it to blackmail him br br the movie night of the sharks has a number of shark attacks in it with this huge one eyed white shark who ends up taking out about a half dozen of the cast members including tony david who's a firm believer in gun control uses knives high explosives and molotov cocktails as well as his fists to take out the entire tony crew even the killer shark is finished off by tony but with a hunting knife not a gun when it came to using firearms to save his friend and sidekick paco a girlfriend juanita and his priest father mattia lives from tony and his gang guns were a no no with david he was more of a knife and spear man then anything else br br the ending of the movie was about as predictable as you can make it with david thought to be killed by the one eyed shark later pops up out of the crowd after rosenlski was convinced that he's dead and leaves the village david continues his life as a free living and loving beachcomber with no one looking to kill him and about two million dollars richer to david's credit he had his friend paco give rosenski back his cd but under the conditions that if anything happened to him his cousin who rosenlski doesn't know who and where he is will shoot his big mouth off and let the whole world know about his dirty and criminal dealings
<START> zero day is based of columbine high school massacre and its a video diary of two boys at first you don't know whats going to happen you think it is just a bad student film until they start talking about the horrible things they are going to do in this quite school until they start talking about pipe bombs and guns and going shooting in the woods they is a lot to say about this movie all know this film is well a film you forget you watching a film and watching a real video two boys made br br the two boys act like they are in a weird cult they burn all there stuff like play station games books dvds homework stuff school stuff these two boys can be anybody your friends you brothers or the people you see walking down the street it goes through there daily actives and that is making a gun in the videos they make it mentions the bullying that happens to them and how people said stuff about there clothes and the things you are into i'm not saying its right but many people do do things like that br br and also the thing is with this people are suspected to like it because of the sensitive topic they have chosen on this film br br so thats my review on zero day br br and lets just say the end shooting scene is messed up
<START> i first came across this film when i read a book written in the 1970s about the career of mitchell leisin i have to admit that over the years i have watched many of his films and find his best work really high quality swing high swing low was supposed to be one of his best while it did not bore me it did not impress me as much as hold back the dawn death takes a holiday kitty or even golden earings i suspect it just dates too much now to be well liked br br working at paramount leisin had a problem in those films that he did which were musicals most of the scores he worked with were fairly mediocre it's true that twice standards appeared in his films but they were really rare cases cocktales for two appeared in murder at the vanities and mona lisa came out of captain carey u s a but the rest of the score for murder at the vanities was forgettable mona lisa was the only tune in captain carey it shouldn't have been this way leisin's studio had rogers and hart working for it in the early 1930s why couldn't he have been assigned to a project with them the score for swing high swing low is pleasant but forgettable unfortunately the movie is centered in the entertainment world as fred macmurray demonstrates great talents as a trumpet player he even works carole lombard into his act by looping his arms around her when he blows his trumpet the song sung by lombard about how her lover's playing thrills her is important to the plot it works in the film but it would have been better if the song was more memorable br br there is a picaresque style to the film it begins on an ocean liner that lombard works on as a manicurist she is constantly being bullied by her boss franklin pangborn the ship's barber then the ship is entering into the panama canal and we see macmurray as a soldier who's enlistment is ending shortly their first scene together has a nice leisin touch in it macmurray is talking to lombard she on the deck of the boat and he on the edge of the wall of the lock nice way to keep the action going while the dialog hits a dull bit br br the film follows the rise and fall of the skid johnson macmurray as he meets lombard and begins his reputation as a trumpet player but meets the other woman in the film dorothy lamore the best moments in the film deal with the collapse of the relationship with lombard and his collapse as a jazz trumpeter his appearance and need for alcohol is very untypical for a macmurray character even his darker figures like walter neff or mr sheldrake or the naval officer who pushes the caine mutiny did not demonstrate a reliance on alcohol br br lombard is good as the woman loved but wronged by macmurray lamore has little to really do possibly the film had more scenes with her in it but one stands out is her attempt to get macmurray onto the wagon again in his opening bit pangborn is fine rarely noticed in films small part actor carl judels is effective as a fair weather fan friend of macmurray who drops him as he goes under though he gives him a hand out br br charles butterworth is as trivial in this film as usual but he does have one moment when he looks sheepishly at his hands on the keyboard of a piano in the rooms he his girlfriend macmurray and lombard share his red faced appearance is due to embarrassment about a lie that macmurray is insisting is true it was a nice subtle moment if only his subtlety had been in his acting rather than his moments of diffident humor
<START> everything a great documentary could be yeah if one is deaf dumb and blind everything but meaning wit visual style and interesting subject matter aside from that br br seriously volken this is a movie that is completely inauthentic an adventure doc with no adventure a war doc with no feeling for war a campy send up with no trace of wit it means nothing feels like nothing and carries the implicit message that absolutely nothing matters no wonder it has so many imdb fans of course going in you know a movie starring the great skip lipman will have no culture no intelligence no wit other than a corrosive adolescent jokiness and no recognizable human emotion Â just adrenaline darkon isn't a movie it's a panic attack avoid there too many real documentaries and too little time in life to waste it on toilet build up such as darkon
<START> everyday we can watch a great number of film soap on tv sometimes a miracle happens a great film with real feelings with great actors with a great realisator director for me there are two films that everyone needs to see the first is the pacula sophie 's choice with meryl streep the second is journey of hope as human beings we need to learn about humility about love of the others about acceptation of other civilisation other way of living we also have to struggle against racism and fascim we must avoid judging criticize we only have to love our earth companion this wonderful film helps us reaching john lennon his dream imagine all the people living live in peace these two films are difficult to see watch these but sure you will be hurt but better great film great actors terrible story pain and cry guarantee but also better understanding of the others enjoy it
<START> for those who like depressing films with sleazy characters and a sordid storyline this one is for you from the bleak new york city atmosphere which comes across as an extremely grim and almost hopeless place to two diverse lead characters devoid of much sense of morality this movie is a real downer br br why it won the academy award was because it was so shocking at that time that hollywood brand new its freedom to show anything it wanted with all moral codes abandoned wanted to celebrate that fact filmmakers then were like an immature six year old with an unlimited expense account at the local candy store so hollywood gave theater viewers for probably the first time a dose of rape prostitution homosexuality child nudity homeless existence and other such wonderful sights and sounds only its twisted brain would think is appealing and then awarded its work br br it also hoped i'm sure to shock mainstream audiences well it succeeded on that level audiences were stunned at what they say and heard and the academy proud of itself for being able to display filth and make money at the same time couldn't help but bestow honors upon this piece of gilded garbage br br forty years ago as a very young man i found this film fascinating too however seeing it again in the 1990s left such a bad taste in my mouth i never watched to view it again br br the acting was good but so what acting is good in many films nobody ever said dustin hoffman and jon voight couldn't act hoffman was particularly good in his younger days in playing wacked out people he was kind of like the johnny depp of his era playing guys like ratso rizzo in this film and then going to be the rain man later on yes ratso is a character you'll never forget and joe buck voight is one you want to forget but the story is so sordid it overwhelms the fine acting br br this movie isn't art and it isn't worthy of its many awards it only pushed the envelope big time in 1969 and that's why it is so fondly remembered in the hearts of film people and critics it's two hours of profanity and ultra sleazy religious cheap shots glorifying weirdos andy warhol even gets in the act no surprise and generally despicable people br br i did like the catchy song everybody's talking' that helped make harry nilsson famous but even that was bogus because fred neil wrote the song and sang it better before nilsson did it and few people have ever heard of neil which is their loss and as mentioned the name ratso rizzo kind of stays with you br br the film is a landmark but in a negative sense i fear this marked it as official that hollywood had gone down the toilet and it has remained in the sewer ever since
<START> a vampire's's henchman wants to call her after falling in love with a five dollar hooker in this extremely low budget horror comedy i can't explain all the positive comments on this movie i'll chalk it up to mass hallucination but it's disconcerting none the less the one redeeming factor and this is me being extremely generous here might be the grandfather who's the only semi likable character in this whole mess don't waste your money or time in fact here's a word of advice if troma puts it out on dvd but does not make it themselves in all likelihood it's crap br br troma dvd extras commentary with omar and kirk second commentary with cast and crew deleted scenes bloopers troma interactivity radiation march clip from terror firmer theatrical trailer trailers for the rowdy girls teenage catgirls in heat cannible the musical and toxic avenger 4 br br my grade d
<START> wow i knew this film was going to be bad but not this bad spoilerific comments ensue br br roddy roddy piper is sickly sweet retired cop cliche helping out everyone smiling like a post op lobotomy patient through out and lamenting over his dead son his adopted son returns from armed forces special ops and because he's seen things portrayed by clenching his teeth if anyone mentions anything about the past time to clean up the streets from another guy who once knew piper and his dead son who the bad lad killed and his adopted son br br oh the love interest is a pretty young lady who decides for no reason that she wants to jump the bones of the ex army bloke this happens in about 2 minutes of 1 scene br br the action could have saved this film but it's even worse than the storyline and acting it's all been done before it's all been done much much better ong bak is a prime example this is the worst film i've ever seen and i've seen waterworld twice br br erm the film is called honor spelt wrong for the americans and the tag line has from the makers of bloodsport and kickboxer check out director david worths other films and you'll soon realise why they put these 2 films on there even though they are over 10 years old such classics as shark attack 3 megalodon says it all really br br i'll give you Â£10 if you don't go to see this film br br ps apologise for not know character names tells you something though
<START> i just blew four dollars renting this movie why alliance atlantis would promote such a poor excuse for a film is beyond me but even more surprising was the reasonably good reviews that a couple of canadian newspaper critics gave this film i'm tired of our media justifying a film simply because it's canadian and low budget it's like they expect canadian films to be lousy so they give it a good review regardless br br now about the movie the acting was below average with the exception of the lead male character who was actually pretty good the film quality was poor which i guess could be expected from the extremely low budget the script was absolutely horrendous an example is the story which revolves around one of the lead characters a female drug dealer who flirts with one of her clients so that she can recruit him to fix and steal bicycles for her gang whose only purpose is to randomly destroy suv's supposedly many of her gang members' bicycles are destroyed in these activities i don't know how she can't afford to just buy new ones since she is supposed to be this big drug dealing connection from vancouver to toronto br br anyway the point of the story which isn't revealed until well over halfway through the movie is that the drug dealer plans to firebomb buildings in the toronto area to attempt to make houses more affordable as no one will want to live in the area br br need i say more br br shame on the toronto film festival for accepting such a film telefilm for supporting it and the globe and mail and georgia straight newspapers for giving such biased reviews br br a film shouldn't get special treatment just because it's canadian
<START> if 1977's exorcist ii the heretic did him no favors it's hard to imagine what thespian extraordinaire richard burton saw in this drab exercise in non thrills you've seen it all before burton plays a writer who discovered at an early age he possesses the power to move inanimate objects through force of his mind and you thought carrie had no impact on hollywood though adapted from a novel by peter van greenaway medusa plays like recycled goods though the special effects in the cathedral finale are solid if typical lee remick is somewhat present as a doctor but otherwise the supporting cast is extremely weak burton is hammy but weary not even telekinesis could save him at this point 1 2 from
<START> i first saw this absolutely riveting documentary in it's initial release back in 2001 and it really had a profound effect on me so much that i bugged several of my friends to see it with me on repeat screenings the bottom line none of my friends walked away disappointed ever this stellar film is about scottish conceptual artist andy goldsworthy who creates some absolutely beautiful pieces of art using natural materials wood water flowers rocks etc to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form a statement in the temporary state of everything we get to see goldsworthy create several works of temporary art as well as some of his long term installations in major galleries around the world as well as a few pieces in the natural world as well german film maker thomas riedelsheimer directs photographs edits this meditation on the creative process that is a real treat for both the eye ear with an ambient musical score composed performed by fred frith who's music is generally edgy experimental noise textured guitar as well as a capable ensemble of musicians although this film has been available on dvd for some years now if you can find a cinema that is highlighting a revival of this fine film by all means seek it out it's easily a film that was composed for the large screen with a proficient sound system to truly experience this film the right way no mpaa rating but contains nothing to offend unless the live birth of a sheep on screen is destined to offend or disturb
<START> i saw a special advance screening of this today i have to let you know i'm not a huge fan of either dane cook or steve carell so i really had no expectations going into this i ended up enjoying it quite a bit br br dan in real life is the story of a widower with 3 daughters who goes to spend a weekend with his family while at a bookstore he meets the woman of his dreams only to find out that she happens to be his brother's girlfriend br br this movie is pretty well made the soundtrack cinematography and acting are all top notch especially steve carell my problem with it was mostly that there seemed to be a lack of character development mostly with dane cook's character we never really get a close look at the relationship between dane and steve's characters and i felt that it could have helped a bit in showing what dan's inner conflict about being in love with dane's girlfriend was like other than this though dan in real life is definitely a solid sweet film definitely a nice break from all the horror and action movies we've been getting this year
<START> if you as i have a very close and long relationship with the world of tintin do yourself a favor and watch this beautiful documentary about hergÃ© and his life creating tintin i'ts so brilliant and a very cool production the whole background story about hergÃ© and the people and also very much the many different situations he was influenced by for good and worse is amazing there is a very fine and obvious connection between the comic books and just this i will for sure be in my basement digging up the tintin albums again also the movie itself are very well told and has a great ambient sound to it i really do hope people will find this as intriguing as i did
<START> there are only two movies i would give a 1 10 to this stinker and the man who fell to earth i remember seeing protocol at a theater in the early 80s when i was in high school the script is insulting to anyone including a high school student's intelligence it completely lost me with the hillarious gag of someone getting shot in the butt goldie hawn is supposed to be charming but comes across as vapid and moronic then there are offensive stereotypes about arabs followed by goldie winning over everyone by spouting populist dribble the acting was terrible including goldie hawn's i could not stand to see another movie she was in until imo she redeemed herself in everyone says i love you this is the kind of movie you make if you want to put no effort into screenplay writing the worst
<START> i'm glad the folks at imdb were able to decipher what genre this film falls into i had a suspicion it was trying to be a comedy but since it also seems to want to be a dark and solemn melodrama i wasn't sure for a comedy it is amazingly bereft of even the slightest venture into the realms of humour right up until the ridiculous twist ending which confirms what an utter waste of time the whole movie actually is it is hard to describe just how amateurish the hazing really is did anyone involved in this film have any idea at all what they were supposed to be doing actually worth watching so that you can stare at the screen in slack jawed disbelief at how terrible it is
<START> i have wanted to see this for the longest time james merendino is a great director slc punk is one of my favorite movies and in the first ten minutes of this film i thought that it was a great follow up after that though it begins to drag the acting and direction were terrific in fact everything in the film seemed to flow except for the script at times the only thing keeping my attention was the fact that in the cast was the most beautiful woman in the world claire forlani this film was good but i expected more br br p s look for great cameos by chi mcbride and chris mcdonald
<START> after reading only two of the comments herein as a lifelong bronte fan beginning with olivier's heathcliff and enduring with the many versions of charlotte's rochester it is more than eye opening to see that it is the unsung bronte sister who gave the lie to the male chauvinist period the trio inhabited of course the miracle in all three versions of 19th century british domesticity is that the girls were all spinsters and their only realistic brushes with men were their vicar father and their wastrel brother that said finally it is anne bronte who has in her single assay proved the feminist point way way ahead of contemporary types and including the voting franchise ranks however history evinces more than a few who preceded including the greek heterai and sappho and the likes of an ancient emperor's yang kuei fei and how about eve and her apple
<START> i loved this movie it's truly bizarre extremely funny morbid witty it makes no sense to tell about the contents of the movie because then i'd be giving out the outcome you have to see it without knowing what is it about everything is connected and has its why because it starts subtly and then the things start rolling faster and faster until they culminate in the most insane outburst you can imagine it's even more fun to watch the movie the second time once you know all the tricks the actors are excellent especially ivan trojan whose final scenes are a real master piece i highly recommend this film it's one of the most original ones i've ever seen
