<START> i found this a bit hard to follow to the extent that it seemed to dip in the middle while i tried to make head or tail of who was fighting who and why one of the problems is the cultural language one here we have a chinese taiwanese japanese problem of which we know little and because we are simply reading english subtitles inevitably loose some of the subtleties another problem is that there seem to be just too many only half explained twists and coincidences nevertheless it seems unlikely that there is a wholly bad miiki film and this certainly is not that plenty of stylish and bone crunching violence a window upon some less than orthodox sexual goings on plus the family aspect all in all a decent ride but maybe checking out the storyline might actually be helpful before watching this one
<START> i've never seen many online movies in most of my life but if i'd pick any of them i'd pick spatula madness a clever reference to most movies like star trooper etc using a camera and wits of steel jason steele mastered the art of turning a normal image into a painting and then putting it all together with frame by frame animation to get a world inhabited by spatulas the story begins at the middle hows that for directors delight then the middle is at the beginning and so on when i first watched it i expected a soggy pixely look but jason like me loves looks so took every detail to the max although i don't recommend it for children or would anybody besides me like it but please search it up on the net its a short film look up film cow its style reminds me of south park but less violent 10 for the look 6 for the laughs and 6 for the story it all comes to a 10 10 good work br br jason steele i'm anxious to see the movie
<START> i saw this by accident one lazy summer afternoon it was playing on the family programming channel of hbo at first i was drawn in by what i thought was a disney animation but then after a few minutes i found myself searching for the remote so i could find the 'info button' to find out what in the world was on my tv i have nothing against harvey f i enjoy him in many of his films but one thing he is not is a voice over artist sure he has one of the more unique voices in hollywood but it works only as a part of a bigger visual package attaching his voice to a cute duck made watching somewhat difficult as for the rest of the cast uninspired i suppose working on this film didn't appeal to the really good voice over talent out there br br so weak voice talent strong animation who was this film targeting gay adolescent ducks i don't get it is there really such a dearth of role models for young up and coming homosexuals that we must resort to animated ducks cute story and like the title this movie i found hard to love just like an ugly duckling
<START> it follows block heads and a chump at oxford two films that are hard to top not that saps at sea is a bad film it is the last good comedy unless one insists on jitterbugs or another of the later films that laurel hardy made it's just that it is a toss off little film without the crazy destructive crescendo of block heads or the astounding sight of stan's real personality in a chump at oxford to revel in at 57 minutes it is shorter than the other two films a bit but that actually is not a bad point for it it has just enough time to it to hit the right notes it's just not as special as the other two br br stan and ollie work in a factory that manufactures horns i suspect that there was a bit of chaplin influence in this sequence one recalls a similar assembly line incident in modern times only four years earlier ollie's nerves finally snap and he goes on a rampage he goes home and naturally his roommate stan does not help stan has a music lesson with an eccentric professor on his instrument you've got it a trombone after beating up the poor professor ollie has problems with the incompetent janitor engineer ben turpin in a nice brief appearance and then faces his doctor jimmy finleyson and his nerve tester a balloon that inflates as you push air out of ollie's stomach finleyson announces that it is a bad case of horniphobia and ollie needs a vacation with plenty of quiet and goat's milk they end up going to a ship but ollie and stan know nothing about seamanship so they plan to sleep on the ship unfortunately the goat gnaws the rope until it breaks and the ship sails off also unfortunately on board is richard cramer an escaped dangerous criminal this is not going to be a peaceful vacation br br saps at sea like a chump could have been three shorts one at the factory one at the apartment and one on the boat each would have been a successful short and they all make a funny film but the stitching of the parts together shows there are some very amusing moments in the film the discoveries of how turpin's ineptitude causes various mishaps with water taps and stoves in the apartment the accidental remarks of building manager charlie hall when stan or ollie runs by him and asks for directions can you help me find the basement asks stan certainly you can't miss it it's downstairs says hall who realizes what a stupid comment he just made and cramer's mistreatment of his two hostage slaves he calls ollie dizzy and stan daffy an allusion to the dean brothers of the st louis cardinal teams of the 1930s see dan dailey's the pride of st louis cramer has the boys cook him up some food and they make a synthetic meal boot laces for spaghetti for instance to get him sick to be overpowered when he realizes what they have done he forces them to eat the meal themselves their reactions are brilliant br br saps at sea is not on par with the top line of laurel hardy films but it is a good film on the whole and a good conclusion to the best years of their film career 1927 1940 when they were with hal roach in the immediate couple of years before it appeared the boys and roach had serious problems involving production costs our relations where stan was producer on the film artistic problems scenes from swiss miss were cut meaninglessly and contractual arguments leading to ollie appearing with harry langdon in zenobia stan and ollie hit back with the flying deuces wherein the production was not roach's but boris morros' at last a two picture deal of a chump at oxford and saps at sea concluded the arguments and problems and on a high note the boys left roach unfortunately they never found any subsequent film relationship with a producer as satisfactory as this had been
<START> incredible does it get any dumber than this not a chance the stupidity in this movie would shame even ed wood de palma and woo if the first part in the series had mediocre dialog and the second one had bad dialog then this one has cretinous dialog amazing but this time the story has been lowered to the level of the dialog too in spite of the acting and the dialog i liked the first two films but cube zero will surely kill the franchise the utterly moronic plot so obviously stems from the pen of a frustrated left winger br br i sometimes wonder if such leftists even themselves realize just how anti democracy and pro dictatorship they are in this movie they obviously target the us Â a democracy why don't they target korea iran syria china zimbabwe etc in anti military movies sure most of these places are hardly likely to produce a cube like this any time soon but that's beside the point it's obvious writers of garbage like this actually admire these kinds of regimes whether they are aware of it or not i would even go as far as to say that anyone who adamantly attacks us foreign policies all the time has anti democratic beliefs in his core br br back to the movie apart from being so far fetched that it isn't even funny any more the film has many obvious illogicalities for example for some reason the two men who supervise the cube have done it for a while and are oblivious to the pain and sadism that the project entails yet the first one than the other suddenly turn against the system anyone who has any idea at all about human nature will see right through this idiocy or how about that cretinous character the one eyed evil bureaucrat who talks as if he's in a bad mel brooks comedy in fact as soon as this creature appears the movie loses all seriousness and hence any chance of being exciting it really does become a comedy
<START> in the sea of crap that hollywood and others continue to put out this is one of those diamonds in the rough a small simple movie that is very entertaining and leaves you with the feeling that you didn't just waste an hour and a half of your life br br ashley judd is really quite amazing in this movie i had never really been a fan or had noticed her before but going back and seeing this early performance of hers convinced me she's extremely talented br br watching this film was an assignment in a college course for me so i was skeptical i would even care i thought oh boy some dumb chic flick or feminist male bashing indie crap i was pleasantly surprised without analyzing the many relevant themes i'll just say if you haven't seen it do yourself a favor and check it out sometimes the down to earth slice of life movies are the best and this is a great one
<START> so prom night was supposed to be a horror and thriller movie i'm a big wuss and was scared to see this movie at the beginning but upon seeing it it is neither horror or thriller br br i was basically making fun of the movie in my seat because it was so predictable you could predict what was going to happen next the young actors were alright at playing their characters but i'd have to say the killer was definitely at the top of the game acting wise br br yes i'll give props for the plot because it was good but it's not thrilling or scary there were almost zero jump in your seat scenes so don't waste ten dollars seeing it in theatres wait 'til it comes to dvd
<START> rather foolish attempt at a hitchcock type mystery thriller improbably exchanging espionage for archaeology and based on the robin cook novel incidentally iâve recently acquired another adaptation of his work â coma 1978 â in honor of the late richard widmark for the record director schaffner had just made the boys from brazil 1978 â a similarly fanciful but much more engrossing suspenser and unfortunately sphinx was a false step from which his so far impressive career would not recover br br despite its scope and reasonably decent cast however this one proved a critical and commercial flop â mainly because the narrative just isnât very thrilling in fact itâs quite dreary feeble attempts at horror â the archaeologist heroine having to put up with entombment rotting corpses galore and even an attack by a flurry of bats â notwithstanding lesley anne down is the lovely leading lady stumbling upon a lost treasure â itâs actually been hidden away by a local sect to prevent it from falling into the hands of foreigners who have appropriated much of the countryâs heritage under the pretext of culture for far too long sir john gielgud turns up in a thankless bit early on as the antique dealer who puts down on the way of the loot and pays for this âact of treasonâ with his life br br typically it transpires that some characters are the opposite of what they claim to be â so that apparent allies such as maurice ronet are eventually exposed as villains while an ambiguous figure frank langella whom i saw at london in early 2007 in a west end performance of âfrost nixonâ which has now been turned into a film goes from downâs antagonist to her lover and back again as he determines to keep the wealth belonging to egyptian high priest menephta a national treasure
<START> this film is terrible every line is stolen from 8mm the italian dubbed version at least if you like trash real trash give it a try but beware this ain't the so bad it's good kind of flick in its cheapness it may really look like a porno but believe me if you're looking for snuff s m hardcore softcore or even an ordinary erotic thriller go find something else in store i'm telling you this 'cause the absolutely uninspired and unconvincing shooting acting plot dialogues the only good lines as i said before are the ones they stolen from joel schumacher's 8mm will bore you to tears in a few minutes and the happy ending is absolutely revolting i'll give it one star a half for the sudden shot in the back scene after the eyes of the victim monologue stolen from 8mm as well and a half for mom daughter's sexy bodies that didn't manage to keep me completely awake while watching this turkey anyway
<START> my wife and i watch a film every night with no distractions and mostly artsy films that require thought i have tons of patience for films that are slow to blossom my wife has double the attention span that i do all that being said this film is just plain empty and boring it went nowhere never blossomed it started fairly strong with a promising plot then she bakes cookies goes to spain she sulks she stares the credits roll uneven full of holes false starts dead ends we ff'd through several extended sequences of her just staring off into space artificial depth was implied when she played with the mud and cried zzzz it's like a beautifully shot chick flick that's pretending to be deep or artsy you never get to know nor understand morvern at all about halfway through you just don't care anymore we just wanted to see at least one of the plot lines develop don't waste your time on this i'm shocked it scores so high
<START> breathtaking this is without doubt the best anime cartoon ever made i first saw castle in the sky in the late 80s as a child and it left a lasting impression years went by and i forgot the title of the film and only by chance browsing on the internet i found this masterpiece again after reading other peoples reviews and analysis i'm not surprised it has such acclaim and touched so many because it does leave an impression a true fantasy adventure a must see for all children and adults its best not giving the story away so i would say watch this movie will a clear and open mind if you have kids treat them to this i promise you they will love it there's not much to say about this piece of art but if you've not seen it watch it and enjoy
<START> origins of the care bears their cousins if you saw the original film you'll notice a discrepancy the cousins are raised with the care bears rather than meeting them later however i have no problems with that preferring to treat the films as separate interpretations the babies are adorable and it's fun watching them play and grow my favourite is swift heart rabbit the villain is a delightfully menacing shapeshifter i could empathise with the three children since i was never good at sports either cree summer is excellent as christy the songs are sweet and memorable if you have an open heart love the toys or enjoyed the original this is not to be missed 9 10
<START> i'd never heard of this movie but boy was i surprised when i caught it on tv great cast great acting excellent movie how can a movie with william h macy neve campbell and donald sutherland go wrong i wonder why i never heard of it before
<START> if you hit your head with a shovel write the script with your feet you may come close to the intelligence level of this movie there is nothing in this movie that hasn't been done a thousand times in other gangster flicks and done much better those who think scarface was some kind of hero to be looked up to or saw goodfellas menace ii society or dead presidents and thought mmm that's the life for me will like this movie i thought i'd give the movie a chance since the premise was perfect for a prequel i should have known better after seeing mario van peebles and sean combs were involved anyone above a 4th grade education see the original with pacino a real actor and be satisfied
<START> i just found the imdb and searched this film and i was moved almost to tears by the comments of all the people who saw this film as i did when 6 or so years old in 1967 i saw it before the jungle book so i was eagle boy for a few hours and then mowgli for the next year i burst into tears at the cinema when the boy turned into the eagle and always wanted to see the film again when we got home we had a roast chicken dinner and i got the wish bone and guess who i wished to be my dad then said 'i bet you wished to be an eagle' and of course we all know that wishes are broken if someone guesses so more tears and a little resentment to this day for not being able to fly away
<START> 1914 was an amazing year for charlie chaplin it was his first year in films and he appeared in more than 30 films while most of these films weren't particularly good they did give him a chance to slowly evolve his screen persona however by this film the familiar little tramp character was still in development sure charlie looked the part but his character still lacked the sweetness and decency that he later developed instead chaplin often hit kicked or did other nasty things to people for seemingly no reason at all br br as for this very slight film it is interesting to watch for the cast while they are not familiar today chaplin stars along with mabel normand chester conklin and mack swain all exceptionally popular stars with keystone films the problem with this film is that while it has a few nice scenes the plot seems very vague and improperly developed chester and mabel got to the race track a very common theme in keystone productions it must have been located near a race track charlie and mack show up and sneak in mack is chased by the police for doing this while charlie slaps chester around and steals his girl in the end for no apparent reason the cops take chester and mack away leaving charlie with mabel who oddly didn't seem put off by charlie's boorish behaviors br br unless you are a huge silent comedy buff or film historian this is a very forgettable film that is only important in the evolution of chaplin what he and the other actors actually do on stage while not unusual for a keystone film isn't particularly funny when seen today
<START> in all of low budget history this movie has to be one of the worst true ther are some humorous sides to the movie but in general it was just plain awful i just can't understand what person could not out run a bunch of slugs i mean they have to be one of the slowest creatures on the planet the only part worth while in this movie is the close up of a slugs attempt to bite the finger of a man this was rather amusing
<START> i saw this on dvd it s known as corrupt in this format and the blurb on the casing really hyped up how harvey keitel s character frank is so much like the one he played bad lieutenant in this gritty and powerful police thriller what the casing didn t mention was that this is an old italian movie how old is it theo well when a character plays music he doesn t put on the cd player he pulls out a big plastic pancake thing puts it on a sort of revolving hob where a sort of mechanical arm touches the pancake thingy causing music to be heard you see my point about this being an old film the dvd case gave no clue this was a movie made 20 years ago it s also a film with poor production values like so many other italian films masquerading as american ones with the exception of keitel the cast are awful though johnny rotten s performance is bizarre rather than terrible the cinematography is static with the picture and sound quality giving the impression that i was watching a fourth generation pirate copy i don t know if it s down to a dodgy dvd or if it s a very bad film print and worst of all is ennio morricone s score it s impossible to belive the man who did the irritating intrusive incidental music for corrupt is the same one who did the music for those clint eastwood westerns br br all of this is a pity because corrupt does have its moments it s by no means the greatest psycho thriller ever devised but it did hold my interest and as always keitel puts in a good performance as a violent nutcase cop just a pity the rest of the movie didn t match up to his high standards
<START> i really liked this summerslam due to the look of the arena the curtains and just the look overall was interesting to me for some reason anyways this could have been one of the best summerslam's ever if the wwf didn't have lex luger in the main event against yokozuna now for it's time it was ok to have a huge fat man vs a strong man but i'm glad times have changed it was a terrible main event just like every match luger is in is terrible other matches on the card were razor ramon vs ted dibiase steiner brothers vs heavenly bodies shawn michaels vs curt hening this was the event where shawn named his big monster of a body guard diesel irs vs 1 2 3 kid bret hart first takes on doink then takes on jerry lawler and stuff with the harts and lawler was always very interesting then ludvig borga destroyed marty jannetty undertaker took on giant gonzalez in another terrible match the smoking gunns and tatanka took on bam bam bigelow and the headshrinkers and yokozuna defended the world title against lex luger this match was boring and it has a terrible ending however it deserves 8 10
<START> this movie was excellent i was not expecting it to live up to all the hype but it did like all the bourne movies the action is fast paced realistic and intense if you liked the other two movies in the trilogy you will love this one also the movie's plot is straightforward and there are no plot twists that are too unrealistic ok julia stiles character showing up in the italian safe house was kind of far fetched especially after what happened in supremacy but it makes sense that she is the only character in treadstone that bourne knows that does not want him dead and he could possibly trust and the only person to lead him in the right direction the action is driven by characters and their reactions to what is happening all around them the thing that i always loved about the bourne movies is that bourne can kick butt but when matched with people as good as he is the fights are struggles and he takes a lot of damage in them they never treat the audience like idiots br br all the actors were solid in their performances i believe that damon could play bourne in his sleep and receives excellent support from joan allen reprising her role from supremacy david strathairn and scott glenn i recommend this film and the trilogy i do miss franka potente though
