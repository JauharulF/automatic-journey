<START> for that matter one of the worst films ever made plot goes as follows slog through jungle looking areas for 10 minutes or so have bo go somewhere and strip slog through the jungle some more give bo another excuse to strip back to the jungle oh look there's a tarzan looking guy strip bo strip kill the safari people tarzan looking guy has a fight scene saves bo bo strips run credits run credits run
<START> this was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly isn't that great sure chaos and inside man are literally the same movie just with variations in suspense but i found chaos more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film swordfish the reason this film is more popular is because this got released in the states and chaos was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters but has yet to find a distributor in the u k and u s a br br it's true that this film makes lots of tributes to classic films like dog day afternoon and other spike lee films but that doesn't mean that it is a pleasant film to watch br br watch it if nothing else is on t v but you'll probably get bored with after awhile
<START> our song is a marvelous example of passionate movie making at its aesthetic best it is in fact a genuine wonder of a movie a penetrating and insightful work of art that chronicles the lives of three young inner city crown heights brooklyn girls during a particular summer in their lives when the perplexities of their approaching adulthood will compel each of them to make a number of difficult life altering choices that will likely re define who each of them is as well as how they will continue to relate to one another in years to come br br jim mckay's writing direction is graceful and uncluttered there is no sappy gratuitous sentimentality nor are there clichÃ© ridden solutions in this film what we see here seems at times to be heart breakingly real there is a naturalism a credibility if you will in our song that surpasses that of other giants in this genre including american graffiti and cooley high br br much of the credit for the film's spirit goes to its principle actors the combined presence of melisa martinez maria kerry washington lanisha and anna simpson joycelyn is dazzlingly powerful it would be easy and of course blatantly obtuse to dismiss as some apparently have the performances of these three as apathetic or unemotional in fact their quiet charm their instinctive sense of dignity and their raw sometimes unconventional intelligence throughout the film are absolutely riveting one would have to be completely out of touch with or completely indifferent to the behavior of teenagers to miss the resounding authenticity in what these three young ladies bring to the screen likewise the supporting cast particularly marlene forte as lanisha's mother compliments the work of the three girls as well as the overall tone of the film br br our song is a film not to be missed by anyone of any age
<START> as a long standing barbra fan any posting like this will be biased that aside this film ranks as a classic it has it's flaws emphasized in other postings but gives a glimpse of a time late 70s that will never be there again and is fascinating to watch unfold on screen br br streisand fought hard to make this movie her own i don't think she was ever satisfied but it gives her fans a new barbra for the time with live singing a young fresh appearance and some very heavy duty acting br br the story is rough but exciting and holds your interest throughout the extended one frame finale is hard for most non barbra fans to sit through but it speaks volumes to those who admire her talent br br
<START> horror movies can be a lot of fun with low budgets bad acting and a bit of panache i think the film is just missing panache because one thuddingly dull scene after another people make laughably harmless claw handed grabs at the air if it weren't so boring it might be funny br br a horror film can go a long way with a tired concept like college kids in a haunted house in much the same way the evil dead movies had a lot of fun with a similar standard plotline hallow's end unfortunately doesn't go a long way actually it doesn't go anywhere it spends the better part of an hour setting up faceless and anonymous characters with what seem like endless interpersonal drama i have nothing against character development not even in a horror movie but these are strictly one dimensional characters the alpha male the milquetoast the um throwaway characters that exist mostly for sex scenes spending forty plus bloodless droning minutes with them was more horrific than when the bloodshed started br br well implied bloodshed anyway when the college kids turn into whatever they dressed as for their haunted house one's a vampire one's wearing o r scrubs and some white pancake they look pretty much the way they did in their amateur haunted house costumes the dead hate the living using a similar theme is a masterwork in comparison there isn't really any gore to speak of nor are there any real scares br br i've thought about this one from almost every approach if it was supposed to be a tight suspenseful horror movie which would explain why things moved so slowly the pathetic sex scenes and cheap monsters would invalidate it if it was supposed to be a genuine blood guts horror movie which would explain the schlock where's the blood and guts and the anticlimax is one of the unexciting endings to a movie i've ever seen it's the kind of movie that though it doesn't have a narrator through the film is bookended by voice overs because all of the meaningless dialogue just wasn't enough br br this was a hard one coming out of it i wonder if i've just sat through a christian horror film maybe the i know hell exists of the opening wasn't meant that way but there are some hints or misdirection i'm not sure which for all the profanity in the film a line like gosh darnit comes off a little absurd and so does most of the crucifix worshipping god fearing and satan dreading especially after some lecherous t a sex scenes one heterosexual one lesbian br br if it a christian company highland myst's logo even has a bit of a crucifix resemblance then this film weighs in heavily for the atheist camp an omnipotent being can't be this bad a filmmaker br br
<START> what were they thinking at cannes one of the most irritating films of all time every detail of this film no matter how meaningless was shown if i had to watch her put on those boots one more time i think i would have shouted if the point of this film was to show how pathetic a life rosetta had then it was covered within the first fifteen minutes of the movie and then the credits should have been running but no we had to see countless redundant scenes over and over the whole thing was filled with un likeable and unsympathetic characters they deserved the misery that was rosetta and to think i passed up tumbleweeds to see this over hyped film of boredom it was like watching grass grow only that is more exciting
<START> although i didn't like stanley iris tremendously as a film i did admire the acting jane fonda and robert de niro are great in this movie i haven't always been a fan of fonda's work but here she is delicate and strong at the same time de niro has the ability to make every role he portrays into acting gold he gives a great performance in this film and there is a great scene where he has to take his father to a home for elderly people because he can't care for him anymore that will break your heart i wouldn't really recommend this film as a great cinematic entertainment but i will say you won't see much bette acting anywhere
<START> okay the story makes no sense the characters lack any dimensionally the best dialogue is ad libs about the low quality of movie the cinematography is dismal and only editing saves a bit of the muddle but sam peckinpah directed the film somehow his direction is not enough for those who appreciate peckinpah and his great work this movie is a disappointment even a great cast cannot redeem the time the viewer wastes with this minimal effort br br the proper response to the movie is the contempt that the director san peckinpah james caan robert duvall burt young bo hopkins arthur hill and even gig young bring to their work watch the great peckinpah films skip this mess
<START> if you like deep purple you will enjoy in this excellent movie with stephen rea in main role the story is about the most famous rock group back there in 70s strange fruits and they decided to play together again but of course there is going to be lots of problem during theirs concerts jimmy nail and bill nighy are great and song the flame still burns is perfect you have to watch it
<START> this film quite literally has every single action movie cliche and all of them work to its advantage straight from lethal weapon gary busey wisecracks shoots and chuckles through this film with such reckless abandonment it can't help but amuse and entertain there are tanks helicopters machine gun battles grenades and ice cream vans and if they aren't good enough reasons to watch this film then how about the best one danny trejo and if you don't know who danny trejo is then you probably won't like this film
<START> jean harlow and clark gable were a great on screen team and this may be their best movie together br br yes hold your man can be cheesy and predictable but that's not what i love about the movie i love seeing harlow and gable together and in this film they are simply wonderful it is obvious that they really enjoyed working together and that is part of what makes this such a wonderful film br br the witty dialogue great script and attention to detail are the other things that make this such a good movie i loved this movie the first time i saw it and on each subsequent viewing i always notice at least one new detail to me that is a mark of a great film br br the dialogue and script are better than most movies from this time period early 30's i adore classic movies but i admit that most of them are just average and at times don't hold my interest hold your man is one of the exceptions br br this has a lot to do with the fact that hold your man is a 'pre code' movie the hays code was not enforced until a year after hold your man this movie could not have been made under the code well it could have been made but it would have been an entirely different story thank goodness the code was not enforced until 1934 otherwise we would have missed out on this gem
<START> that word 'true' in this film's title got my alarm bells ringing they rang louder when a title card referred to america's civil war as the 'war between the states' the circumlocution preferred by die hard southerners jesse james thief slave holder and murderer is described as a quiet gentle farm boy br br how dishonest is this movie there is no mention of slavery far less of the documented fact that jesse james's poor widdered mother owned slaves before the war and that jesse and his brother frank actively fought to preserve slavery according to this movie all those civil war soldiers were really fighting to decide whether missouri is a northern state or a southern state that's all missouri it's a candy mint it's a breath mint black people are entirely absent from this movie except for two glimpses of a pair of beggars one of whom wears a help the poor sign that's very implausibly typeset instead of handwritten some shots of 19th century newspapers are inaccurate too with 20th century type fonts br br this film has a weird flashback structure there's some very impressive stunt riding and some fine work by stunt horses and one excellent montage i savoured one line of dialogue 'some of those boys will never taste beans again ' the movie gets a few facts straight agnes moorehead as jesse's mother conceals her right arm in the scenes following the raid by the agents of pinkerton here called 'remington' in which jesse james's real life mother suffered injuries requiring the amputation of her lower arm some errors here are pardonable during his bushwhacking days the real jesse james accidentally shot off part of his left middle finger but robert wagner in the title role here does not have a stumpfinger i've seen a photo of jesse james's real wife if she had looked half as glamorous as hope lange looks in this movie jesse james might have stayed home more br br there's plenty of revisionism here and most of the male actors wear 1950s hairstyles but many of this movie's errors were avoidable jesse james's mentor william quantrill is mentioned several times but all the actors mispronounce his name we see jesse and his wife moving into an elaborate two storey house where he will soon die after paying a rent of 18 actually jesse james's last residence at 1318 lafayette street st joseph missouri was a simple one storey cottage renting for 14 there was no upper storey so when jesse james is killed his wife could not come running from upstairs as hope lange does here she was actually in the kitchen br br one continuity error robert wagner with no stunt double does an impressive job of taking a slug to the jaw and falling over while his hands are tied behind his back but when he gets up the rope binding his wrists has vanished br br the screenplay does some weird and unnecessary juggling of dates following the northfield robbery attempt jesse says he expects to get home by his birthday the actual northfield bank raid by the james gang 7 september 1876 was two days after jesse james's birthday maybe he meant next year's birthday later we see jesse and his wife moving into their st joseph home on a fine summer day while jesse tells her what he plans to do when christmas eve arrives but in real life mr and mrs jesse james moved into that house on 24 december 1881 so this scene should be on christmas eve these errors were entirely avoidable br br some of the fictionalisations here don't make sense according to this movie the northfield bank raid failed because one fictional henchman was late in cutting the telegraph wires if this had actually happened it would indeed have hampered the james gang's getaway but it wouldn't have affected the robbery itself which failed for other reasons br br there are good performances here by jeffrey hunter as frank james moorehead alan hale jnr as cole younger and by stage actress marian seldes in a rare screen role i was disappointed by robert wagner normally an under rated actor elsewhere wagner has proved his impressive range by convincingly portraying heroes villains and morally ambiguous characters here he can't seem to decide whether to depict jesse james as a goodie or a baddie so he doesn't much bother john carradine phones in his performance in a brief role as a fictional jackleg preacher who baptises jesse and his wife at their wedding in fact jesse james was baptised in childhood by his uncle a methodist minister but perhaps this second baptism is a topping up br br jesse james was no robin hood i doubt that robin hood was robin hood either but that's another story there is not one single documented instance of jesse james ever sharing his loot with anyone beyond his own family after some of his hold ups he didn't even split the swag with the rest of his gang in this movie jesse gets gunned down right after he vows to give up his bandit ways forever in reality the night before his death jesse james and the ford brothers stole horses that jesse planned to use the next day in a robbery of the platte city bank as preparation for most of his robberies jesse james stole horses from local farmers the same poor folk who in the inaccurate legends were supposedly the beneficiaries of his largesse i cringed at one scene here in which the fictional jesse james is so gol durn refined that he disapproves of an oil painting which tastefully depicts nudes br br 'the true not much story of jesse james' is wilfully dishonest about a thieving murderer and likewise dishonest about the civil war for the very impressive stunt work one good montage and a few fine acting turns i'll rate this obscenely dishonest movie 2 points out of 10
<START> although there's flying guillotines as part of the title of this movie it has no connections to the original flying guillotines 1975 and its sequel flying guillotines ii 1978 the two originals are masterpieces of kung fu movie and still stands out as a classic this is a much inferior copy of the original and even as a regular kung fu movie it's below average br br first of all this movie doesn't have much acting it's one senseless fight scene after another and flying guillotine doesn't even play a major part in them story is about some shaolin monks who are tracking down some villains who've took off with a sacred book and an evil prince who owns part of this book is part of the plot the same evil prince has plans to lure the monks in and use the flying guillotines on them br br there are four movies with flying guillotine as part of its title this in my opinion is of least quality the design of the flying guillotine in this movie is different from the other three indicating that this movie was produced by a different entity from the other three br br the movie has no chemistry asides from being unintentionally funny due to poor production br br best skip this and watch the two originals
<START> spoiler warning br br first of all i rated this movie 2 out of 10 br br the idea is good but there are too many stupid errors in the movie failing to make it the psyching drama that it might have been first of all she never fights alone after an initial very strange doubt from her mother which is not believable when the mother proves to be so supportive and loving later in the movie the rape victim is not alone br br she is also unbelievably naive always falling into the crew's strange traps br br her friends are unbelievably nasty br br the thing that i find most unbelievably is that ethan fails to control the crew when he changes his opinon ethan is very much the leader of the crew hey they even say so and people seem to think the other guy is a jerk but when ethan changes his opinion he just doesn't manage to convince even one single person in the crew that he is right and that his former friend is wrong everyone just simply hates him why the movie provides no explanation how did he ever become the leader br br a funny note is that my girlfriend thought i was watching beverly hills when she came in two actors from the same successful tv series a cheap way to get viewers
<START> ned akelly is such an important story to australians but this movie is awful it's an australian story yet it seems like it was set in america also ned was an australian yet he has an irish accent it is the worst film i have seen in a long time
<START> granting the budget and time constraints of serial production batman and robin nonetheless earns a place near the bottom of any cliffhanger list utterly lacking the style imagination and atmosphere of its 1943 predecessor batman br br the producer sam katzman was known as king of the quickies and like his director spencer bennett seemed more concerned with speed and efficiency than with generating excitement unfortunately this team also produced the two superman serials starring kirk alyn with their tacky flying animation canned music and dull supporting players the opening of each chapter offers a taste of things to come thoroughly inane titles robin rescues batman batman vs wizard mechanical music droning on and our two heroes stumbling toward the camera looking all around either confused or having trouble seeing through their cheap halloween masks batman's cowl with its devil's horns and eagle's beak fits so poorly that the stuntman has to adjust it during the fight scenes his utility belt is a crumpled strip of cloth with no compartments from which he still manages to pull a blowtorch and an oxygen tube at critical moments br br in any case the lead players are miscast robert lowery displays little charm or individual flair as bruce wayne and does not cut a particularly dynamic figure as batman he creates the impression that he'd rather be somewhere anywhere else john duncan as robin has considerable difficulty handling his limited dialogue he is too old for the part with an even older stuntman filling in for him out of costume lowery and duncan are as exciting as tired businessmen ambling out for a drink without one ounce of the chemistry evident between lewis wilson and douglas croft in the 1943 serial br br although serials were not known for character development the earlier batman managed to present a more energetic cast this one offers a group going through the motions not that the filmmakers provide much support not one of the hoodlums stands out and they are led by one of the most boring villains ever the wizard great name actually they are led by someone sporting a curtain a shawl and a sack over his head with a dubbed voice that desperately tries to sound menacing the prime suspects an eccentric professor a radio broadcaster are simply annoying br br even the established comic book regulars are superfluous it is hard to discern much romance between vicki vale and bruce wayne despite the perils she faces vicki displays virtually no emotion commissioner gordon is none too bright unlike in the previous serial alfred the butler is a mere walk on whose most important line is mr wayne's residence they are props for a drawn out gimmick laden incoherent plot further saddled with uninspired repetitive music and amateurish production design the wayne manor exterior resembles a suburban middle class home in any sitcom the interiors those of a cheap roadside motel the batcave is an office desperately in need of refurbishing the costumes are kept rolled up in a filing cabinet br br pity that the filmmakers couldn't invest more effort into creating a thrilling adventure while the availability of the two serials on dvd is a plus for any serious batfan one should not be fooled by the excellent illustrations on the box they capture more of the authentic mood of the comic book than all 15 chapters of batman and robin combined br br now for the good news this is not the 1997 version
<START> when i first got my n64 when i was five or six i fell in love with it and my first game was super mario 64 and i loved it the graphics were great for it's time a good plot great courses and above all the best music i heard in a nintendo game br br i don't remember the plot completely but i think princess peach was kidnapped by bowser and mario has to rescue her the object of the game is to get 120 stars from the curses in the castle each had about five or six challnges to get the stars there are secert parts of the castle where you can get more stars but of course you have beat bowser i think there are three levels to beat bowser on lets start with the characters mario is the main character and gets helpful advice from toad so he is basically one of your only alliances i heard that luigi and yoshi are in the game towards the end the main villain is bowser and there are a bunch of other characters like boo and goomba the characters are really great br br next how about the graphics people say gameplay is more important then the graphics and i agree completely but with he great plot there are great graphics especially for it's time i have a whole bunch of other nintendo games like 007 and their graphics don't compare to super mario bright colors great effects and awesome sound effects i found the graphics in the water courses very very good next to the bowser world ones it has the best graphics in the game br br now the music this is my favorite part of the game growing up when i played this at a young age i'd gladly leave the game on all night so the music would put me to sleep especially the music from jolly roger bay which was peaceful and wonderful there are others that are great too especially in once again the worlds with bowser are the ones that stick with me the most and are my favorites br br this game was my favorite past time as a developing gamer and i love it this game gets 10 10 or 5 5 go play the game
<START> the producers made a big mistake casting mark lester who couldn't act or sing in the title role aside from his very bad acting all of lester's singing had to be dubbed by a girl i don't know why they cast him at all since there would have been so many boys who could have played the part infinitely better and done their own singing as well shani wallis was far too old to play nancy who was only supposed to be 16 the current west end version is so much better than the movie in every way ross mccormack is the best artful dodger of all time and he is certainly far better looking than jack wild ever was it was clearly political to award this old fashioned musical so many oscars after the tumultuous events of 1968
<START> spoilers like other posters i felt that the ending was a bit abrupt i would have liked to have seen the crew adjusting to life back on earth after their return i suppose the writers anticipated this problem by front loading some voyager on earth sequences at the beginning of the episode of course that time line has been eradicated so it's all moot i did like how admiral janeway died for the voyager crew as fans we get to have our cake and eat it to by having janeway both make the ultimate sacrifice and live on i admit that the scenes of janeway and her older self having conversations was bizarre and so easily could have crossed the line into camp fortunately mulgrew s pulled it off
<START> simple meaningful and delivers an emotional punch i regularly trail through dull short films and it's always nice to come across something that has a simple and enlightened message without pretensions or self indulgent directing br br a boy at school has to attend a lesson when his friend plays truant and is given the most important lesson of his life only to find that when there are not enough copies to go around he has to share with the school bully br br unlike most short films featuring children or actors these kids hold their own and it's believable the soundtrack nicely complements the emotion of the piece and the punchline of the film works well
