<START> i've seen enough of both little richard in interviews and in performances and enough of poor leon pigeonholed into these 50s 60s musical bio pics to know that leon was not the right actor for this role leon was so right as david ruffin in the temptations but fails utterly to capture the essence of little richard in this film br br actor miguel nÃºÃ±ez who played little richard in why do fools fall in love was a much more suitable choice having pulled off the musician's powerful but effeminate persona br br if the performances are unconvincing then the film will be as well and this is what has happened here glossed over or missed entirely are lr's forays into homosexuality and voyeurism what the temptations did so well in capturing the rise of the group warts and all this film misses by a wide mark br br what is going on with director robert townsend who started off so well with the hollywood shuffle he's a talented funny guy but hasn't delivered anything near that first effort
<START> don't bother trying to watch this terrible mini series it is a six hour bore an unbelievable love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other there is no heat in this story no real passion no real romance it is a dry boring drawn out and uninspired as they come and it doesn't even meet the expected level of technical proficiency take those six hours of your life and use them for something more worthwhile
<START> engrossing drama of four men on a canoing weekend down a remote river they are pacifist ed jon voight adventurous violent lewis burt reynolds obnoxious bobby ned beatty and nice guy drew ronny cox the first 40 minute are great there's the incredible dueling banjos sequence interesting interplay among the characters and just stunning widescreen cinematography by vilmos zsigmond then two hillbillies attack ed and bobby one of them rapes bobby and the trip becomes a nightmare br br just unbelievable the scenery is incredibly beautiful yet this horrific violence is taking place to be truthful beatty's rape has never bothered me i'm very aware it's being faked despite the good acting this movie also shows how the characters change ed has his pacifism tested lewis becomes weak bobby is violated by one of the people he mocked earlier on and drew tries to keep himself sane direction by john boorman is also very assured and the sounds of the forest and the river help the mood immensely br br the acting is mostly good voight is just ok in the lead he's been better beatty is also just ok but it is his debut film and he has guts for taking such a risky role cox is very good especially when things start falling apart and reynolds is just superb one of his best acting jobs ever how this wasn't even nominated for an academy award escapes me also bill mckinney and herbert coward are way too believable as the hillbillies br br a powerful film not for children try to see an uncut version the tv version is butchered also letter boxed viewing is essential to capture the breathtaking images
<START> you like beautiful girls yeah me too what is there bad to say about beautiful girls women nothing imo so why would i give this movie only 2 stars out of 5 although it got the talents of chiaki kuriyama and aya ueto br br if i really wanted to watch beautiful people i'd watch mtv or something that's why this is a movie a so called action movie nevertheless so by definition it does not even really need a plot right i'm not agreeing 100 but let's say yes to that so what does it need 20 minutes footage from part 1 i might be exaggerating a little bit but it felt like more than 20 minutes that would be no but then again you never know the people who watched part one might not know what they ate this morning for breakfast so hey let's remind them hey maybe remind them even twice just to be sure they won't forget at least until the credits roll of course br br so forget about the story about character development about real emotions about the acting and no i don't think women in skirts walking and or fighting is accountable for acting what does that leave yes the action scenes the action scenes are not bad and that's the reason i gave the movie 2 stars instead of 1 i was giving this movie a chance but it was a waste of time you have better things to do watch believe me
<START> this is an anthology horror film it's made up of 4 short stories taken from the fiction of robert bloch who wrote for weird tales and was personal friends with h p lovecraft but is most famous for the original story psycho the quality of the stories is very uneven and i didn't think very much about the film was creepy or horrific at all it would have been better to do it as a comedy like comedy of terrors only the last of the 4 stories was really done in a humorous way and it's probably the best of them the one with ingrid pitt i've seen a few of these amicus anthology films and the only one that was really worth my time was freddie francis' tales from the crypt the anthology style works well for the producers because it means that they can hire a bunch of big name actors employ them for only one week of shooting or so and then bring in the next big name so you essentially pay for 6 weeks of movie star salary but get 5 or 6 different names on the marquee but that's very unfortunate for the audience because the audience would like to see some scenes with peter cushing christopher lee and ingrid pitt actually acting together instead they're stuck in these vignettes by themselves so let's take them one at a time briefly br br the first story has denholm elliot who does a really admirable job of trying to bring some dignity to his silly role as a writer terrorized by his own character unfortunately the actor who plays dominic the source of the horror tom adams just looks silly which ruins any possible horror there's some hilarious stuff if you want to laugh at it though like the scene where dominic kills elliot's psychiatrist it's the patented scene where the killer creeps up behind the victim but nobody is watching so the whole audience is supposed to shout out look out behind you the second story is the one with peter cushing god i love that man so much too bad so many of his films like this one pretty much stink in the story he's supposed to be pining away for a long lost love and he sees her likeness in a wax museum it's a completely predictable story that goes nowhere br br then you have the bit with christopher lee where he plays the father of a little kid who turns out to be a witch again this bit could have been fun if it had been played for laughs but instead we're supposed to be horrified when lee slaps the child and surprised when she turns out to be evil the actress chloe franks was pretty good in that type of bad seed role though br br the last story is kind of amusing ingrid pitt plays an actress and jon pertwee plays an actor who accidentally buys a vampire cape that turns him into a real vampire that's about all the story has to offer i was surprised at how bad ingrid pitt's english is i guess she must have been dubbed in some of the other films i've seen her in br br not a very memorable film or one that i would recommend to anyone but horror completists
<START> joe don's opening line says everything about this movie it takes place on the island of malta the island of pathetic men and involves joe don baker tracking down an italian mobster joe don's character is named geronimo pronounced heronimo and all he does in this movie is shoot people and get arrested over and over agin everyone in the movie hates him just like everyone hates greydon clark i liked an earlier greydon picture angel's revenge because it was a shirne for thriteen year old boys avoid this movie at all costs
<START> the one reason i remember this is that it was shown the week after nigel kneale s brilliant quatermass serial was broadcast the trailers made heavy emphasis that the main character had a mutilated arm which had me hoping he d be like victor caroon from the quatermass experiment stalking the streets of london br br no such luck because the racing game is just a rather drab thriller with the gimmick of having a hero with a physical disability trying to get to the bottom of investigations of corrupt horse racing i suppose if you re a fan of dick francis you might enjoy it but setting it in the context of the late 70s when the sweeney had just finished and the professionals was still being produced there s something lacking about the racing game one trailer featured a car over taking another on a motor way if it d been a trailer for the sweeney you d see jack regan over taking a car and beating a confession out of the slags who d done a blag while the professionals would have over taken a car and blown away the terrorists inside i think that sums up what s wrong with this series
<START> maybe it's because i saw the movie before reading the book but i really love this movie i've seen it many many times and will be watching it many times more it's a compelling story that's interesting from the beginning to the end it has everything action romance etc
<START> a film crew is shooting a horror movie in an old supposedly cursed house where over the years seven people have mysteriously died one of the crew finds an old book of spells and it looks like it would be perfect to use in some of the ritual scenes in their movie it is reasoned that the spells in the book are better written than the script they are using but as the book is read the graveyard outside suddenly comes to life now the cast and crew are faced with real danger br br imdb lists a running time of 90 minutes for the first 60 of those minutes nothing happens far too much time is spent on the movie within a movie are we supposed to be frightened by the horror movie that they are shooting we already know that their movie isn't real these scares just don't work br br there are very few things to enjoy about the house of seven corpses the acting is atrocious most of these actors would have trouble making a elementary school play the score is terrible it is very reminiscent of a 70s television series and provides no atmosphere speaking of atmosphere other than a few moments at the end of the movie there is none to speak of character logic is all but non existent even in a movie you expect characters to behave in a certain way here i don't think i remember one scene where a character didn't choose the most illogical avenue available to them and finally there's those first 60 minutes of the movie that i've already mentioned can you say boring br br i haven't rated the house of seven corpses any lower because of instances where the movie probably by accident actually works my two favorite are the beginning and ending the opening title sequence presents the deaths of the seven previous owners and may be the highlight of the movie and the ending scenes on the massive staircase as the zombie menaces the film crew are somewhat effective what a ringing endorsement overall though these moments aren't enough to make this a good movie
<START> e tv is a great channel and talk soup is so funny in a flash you can view the episodes change we want more funny writings by the best writer ever stan evans the patron saint of the mindless masses he is a truly talented gifted writer actor comic producer director and creative consultant anna nicole loved him but he was not a billionaire so he left him for a billionaire many super stars wanted to make films with the actor stan evans who has a humphrey bogart clark gable acting style he should make many more movies maybe with stephen spielberg or perhaps many other talented producers we wish him a moment of fame with a great fortune to gain has he produced any mock u dramas or perhaps any docudrama a project about bernie madhoff would be a great tv movie written by stan evans how many screenplays has he written is he under billion contract with disney he should earn more than 50 million he could also write a tv movie about the late king of pop michael jackson we want to view a lot more of and by stan evans in the movies and on tv thank you so very much elvis has left the building
<START> we stumbled upon the documentary grey gardens last sunday and got sucked in without warning everyone who entered the room became transfixed on the television and the haunting images of edith and edie who seemed to be living out their lives in practically one room of a large filthy mansion on the beach eating ice cream and corn on the cob which was cooked on the bedside table and the cat urinating on edith's bed and her unbelievable words i thrive on it the smell we had not seen the beginning and wondered what we were watching and how these aristocratic women managed to get in the position they were in spellbinding a must see
<START> would anyone really watch this rubbish if it didn't contain little children running around nude from a cinematic point of view it is probably one of the worst films i have encountered absolutely dire some perv woke up one day and thought i will make a film with little girls in and call it art stick them in countryside and there isn't any need for a story or explanation of how they got there or why they don't appear to live anywhere or have parents because p rn films don't need anything like that i would comment on the rest of the film but i haven't ticked spoilers so i will just say avoid avoid avoid and find yourself a proper film to watch
<START> i have become quite fond of laurence olivier in the past few weeks and was thrilled when i discovered this gem i have always found it wonderful when i run across a film where i do not have to have my finger on the remote control in case nudity rears its ugly head br br the divorce of lady x is charming till the final scene and must have been a true delight for viewers back in 1938 i only wish people today could accept and love true humor instead of the horrid trash talk people now call funny br br the divorce of lady x is well worth anyone's time
<START> visconti's first feature ossessione is an adaptation of james m cain's the postman always rings twice now i'm not familiar with that book or the other film versions but i am a big fan of cain's double indemnity much more so than i am a fan of billy wilder's film version of it in fact the two novellas seem like they must be very similar both involve an illicit love affair where a ravenous wife complains to a morally weak man that her husband is worthless and mean to her giovanna the woman in this italian version played very well by clara calamai is not evil incarnate like the wife in double indemnity but she seems very spoiled her husband a great performance by juan de landa is a bit cruel to her but she strikes me like she is at least as uncompromising with him he's older than her and unattractive so she's rather fickle when gino shows up a young muscular man it takes her about five minutes to get him into bed she sweats she wants to be with him forever but she's stuck with her husband they break up at first but when they meet again they apparently although this is intentionally vague plan to murder the husband they are successful and they move back to the woman's home town to run the bar that her husband owned gino is very unenthusiastic about this idea he wants giovanna but the one thing that he certainly doesn't want is to sit around in one place for the rest of his life their relationship quickly crumbles ossessione is a very complex film with complex characters it's always fascinating but it does go on a bit too long at two hours and twenty two minutes i can't for the life of me figure out how it took that long this is partly due to the neorealist stylistics that visconti was inventing within this film it was after all the first film that won that label we see a lot of the action prolonged as it would be in real life without any hurrying to the next plot point i've seen many of visconti's films and the only one i like better than this one is rocco and his brothers 1960 his direction is as great as it ever was with the camera moving brilliantly and the editing perfect i also feel the need to point out the film's best performance by dhia christiani as a young exotic dancer and part time prostitute named anita whom gino meets after he begins to try to break away from giovanna she's only in the film for maybe five or six minutes and she has only a few lines it's shocking how much visconti and christiani are able to do with this character in such a short time she's absolutely heartbreaking 9 10
<START> i really enjoyed this movie the humor was a bit absent at times but i enjoyed how the story moved between dramatic and serious throughout the film this is the only the second movie where i saw verdone acting the other was 'un sacco bello' and i can see why italians find him tiresome but he think he played his role well as the loving father br br my one drawback with this movie was that i knew it took place in italy somewhere in the center or south i presume but i felt like there was no representation of a place this movie could have taken place in new york boston melbourne new dehli i always think it is important for movies to have a place to give the viewers something to relate to maybe i missed something if you like italian films then i think that you will enjoy this it's not a fellini or a rossellini it's not realism or neo realism it's a comical story with serious moments that could really happen to any of us
<START> meek tiny almost insignificant polanski finds the invisibility of his characters and makes something enormous out of it in front and behind the camera he creates one of the most uncomfortable masterpieces i had the pleasure to see and see and see again it never let's me down people even people who know me pretty well thought think there was is something wrong with me based on my attraction or i should say devotion for le locataire they may be right i don't know but there is something irresistibly enthralling within polanski's darkness and i haven't even mentioned the humor the mystery surrounding the apartment and the previous tenant the mystery that takes over him and naturally us me that building populated by great old academy award winners melvyn douglas shelley winters jo van fleet lila kedrova for anyone who loves movies this is compulsory viewing one two three many many viewings
<START> here's one more beauty in the string of beautiful films directed by eytan fox the movie presents the story of star crossed lovers one israeli one palestinian in modern tel aviv the film's effectiveness comes not only from its depiction of cross ethnic conflict but of conflicts personal and political within ethnic groups as well for example there's a telling moment when one of the secondary characters openly gay is visited in the hospital by his boyfriend who brings him flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his visiting family and suddenly we see a wave of awkward discomfort wash through the room clearly the young man is not as open as he seems and the family not as accepting as he might want them to be while the boyfriend is confused and rejected a good deal of complexity is packed into a fleeting moment as we know from yossi jagger fox is a master at efficiently packing emotional and psychological complexity into brief sequences the film is also effective for the even handed way it presents the mutual brutalities that israelies and palestinians inflict on each other if you're not heartless you'll cry through the last third of the movie though the plot is melodramatic it's so intelligently written and acted that it reminds us of how satisfying good melodrama can be
<START> while i don't claim to be any sort of expert in marine life i must say anyone with a modicum of intelligence could not possibly buy in to this notion of a whale and not even the mother having a clue about revenge because it witnessed his dead mate having a forced abortion by humans i mean really this is basically the whole plot richard harris must have been extremely hard up for roles to have accepted this junk this is the kind of movie that is so bad that if you paid 50 cents to see it you would feel like demanding your money back
<START> other than some neat special effects this movie has nothing to offer they threw in some gore and some nudity to try and make it interesting but with no success kevin bacon's acting was pretty good but he couldn't salvage the movies lack of plot
<START> i have an awful pan and scan videotape of boom and i want to see it in all its widescreen glory so i voted 1 and hope you will too together we can pull this movie down into the pits of cinematic dross and hope that someone will see an opportunity for big money in releasing boom in its director's cut extended version the movie is one of my howling favoritesÂyou just look at the people involved the director the actors the cameraman and you say to yourself yep i guess you can fool some of the people for a lot of time producers considering the dvd release of boom should note that everywhere it's been shown there have been sellout crowds in the theaters but it hasn't been up to frostbite falls yet
