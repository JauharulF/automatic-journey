<START> pier paolo pasolini or pee pee pee as i prefer to call him due to his love of showing male genitals is perhaps the most overrated european marxist director and they are thick on the ground how anyone can see art in this messy cheap sex romp concoction is beyond me some of the stories here could have come straight out of a soft core porn film and i am not even so much referring to the nudity but the simplistic and banal often pointless stories anyone who enjoyed this relatively watchable but dumb oddity should really sink his teeth into the der schulmaedchenreport soft porn german 70s movie series because that's what decameron looks like to me br br besides the movie is sloppy on nearly all levels from start to finish br br 1 editing an example at 1 hour 15 minutes 45 seconds there is a chasing scene that is put quite clearly in the wrong place it was supposed to be placed about a minute later but i guess that pasolini must have hired boozed up editors who have little time for the fine details of movie making pee pee pee's fans would probably counter this by saying that it was placed there intentionally which i very much doubt besides even if that were true that would be even worse because that story gains absolutely nothing by making it harder to follow this isn't exactly eraserhead or one of tarantino's broken form films br br 2 acting vey sloppy triple pee's fans all 8 of them proudly declare how 3p o uses real people instead of actors aren't actors people or are they martians sure many actors have sub par iqs but does that mean we should treat them with contempt other directors have used amateurs and succeeded such as alan parker or de niro so why are ppp's amateurs so utterly awful in his movies the answer is once again appalling sloppiness pasolini is sloppy in everything and that includes trying to get as much out of his toothless amateurs as he can he is a lazy director an imperfectionist if you like the anti kubrick i suppose pee pee pee's principal goal when casting must have been to find as many toothless old people as possible and young men that are to his liking in pasolini's world there is a simple formula lack of teeth strange face realism it's all well and fine to have them toothless but at least try to eke out some at least semi decent performances out of these inexperienced neo thespians otherwise you're an amateur yourself an amateur director in pasolini's case whether 3p 0 wasn't capable of this feat or simply didn't care doesn't change anything who knows maybe he didn't even notice the awful acting br br 3 audio the synchronization if 3p 0 felt that microphones are too much of a hassle when filming a movie then he ought to have at least made a concerted effort in post production i e getting all these bum actors to say their lines on cue in the studio so that we the viewers wouldn't have to watch mouths move while the elusive dialogue floats elsewhere in the movie br br 4 lack of concept we have close to a dozen stories which aren't connected in any meaningful way some are anti church more on that later while some are merely sex yarns i e cheap male sometimes gay fantasies designed to titillate and nothing else the stories and characters are not amusing if at all on an intelligent level but on the basest level 10 year old kids can laugh here and there is nothing wrong with that but then don't call it exalted intellectual art br br 5 as a result of point 4 there is also a lack of logic in the order of the stories that goes without saying pee pee pee could have arranged the order in any other way and we would have had the exact same movie this also means that you can feel free to start from the middle then go back to the beginning etc decameron is like a bowl of spaghetti that way when you start eating it you can begin with any thread you want it makes no difference at all br br 6 the pointlessness of the stories' resolutions most stories end with a cheap gag joke i e some damn dumb punchline straight out of a porn comic book whereas some stories don't even have a conclusion they merely end finito at best the stories are watchable semi anecdotes barely any deeper meaning there unless you find deep meanings in a porno there is of course nothing easier than looking for and finding meaning where there is an absence of it hence even any hardcore porn film can be philosophized mused over endlessly it's easy and fun try it oh ye 8 ppp fans br br as for the church bashing some viewers get all excited about his attack on catholicism and what not in principal that's all well and fine after all i'm an atheist myself but what those people ignore is the simple but essential fact that pasolini was a marxist it's like the pot calling the kettle black a marxist criticizing the church for hypocrisy and stupidity where does he get the nerve besides pasolini wasn't an atheist hence his high and mighty and self righteous stance isn't justified after all marxists are believers they merely substituted the accepted god with the idea of a utopia which is merely another supernatural wishful thinking fantasy hence i cannot get excited about ppp's anti religion antics br br this sophomoric humpdorama anthology ends with pasolini saying rather pretentiously i wonder why produce a work of art when it's nice just to dream about it he wasn't actually referring to this silly little movie as art was he in case he was the poor deluded man then i have to wonder why he didn't just leave it at dreaming and not make all those bad movies br br wanna read my altered

<START> australia's first mainstream slasher film hits the screen with a bang and a stab and a slice and a scream or two and plenty of blood frights red herrings and lots of laughs br br in fact there's lots of first surrounding cut it's the first script of dave warner's to be produced although he has several others either optioned or in negotiation it's the first major film from director and former hoodoo guru kimble rendall and it's also the first film for producer martin fabinyi and for a bunch of guys dipping their toes into this genre for the first time they sure know their stuff br br cut tells the story of a bunch of australian film students who hear about a slasher film hot blooded that was never finished because its director hilary kylie minogue was killed by the actor playing the psycho killer in the film br br despite their lecturer who was assistant director on the night hilary died warning them that whenever someone tries to start up production of hot blooded again someone dies director raffy jessica napier and producer hester sarah kants decide to go ahead and complete the film they put together a crew and manage to get the original star vanessa turnbill molly ringwald to return to australia in fact to the original location to complete hot blooded Â 14 years after shooting shut down br br of course this being a slasher film lots of bloodletting ensues Â long with plenty of laughs a few good scares and a rocking aussie soundtrack cut shows that australia can make a good mass market horror film just as well as hollywood br br it's a finely crafted feature with excellent special effects a taut plot and a killer scarman that's a welcome addition to the ranks of michael jason and freddy
<START> ghost train is a fine and entertaining film typical of the better british comedy chillers of the 1930s and 40s the antics of comedian arthur askey are not as funny as they once apparently were but this can be overcome by viewing him as a period piece or a curiosity br br for a low budget wartime production ghost train is atmospheric effective and it provides some genuine suspense great fun for a dark and yes stormy night lighten up take off the critic's hat and enjoy
<START> a huge disappointment from writer hamm and director dante their previous collaboration on the first season's homecoming was twisted and darkly hilarious in all the right ways this poor handling of an intriguing premise left me bewildered the supposed payoff showing generic aliens extracting something from the brains of the infected psychopaths was completely unsatisfying and explained nothing if the point of the story was an extraterrestrial cleaning of the planet of it's human infestation why did they go about it in such a gratuitously sadistic and misogynistic fashion why not just unleash a completely lethal virus a la stephen king's the stand instead of having the male population butcher the females i kept hoping the episode would improve as i kept watching but it just got more pretentious and preposterous the religious subtext simply seemed forced but it was clear sam hamm must have thought it was profound by the weight he gave it i like a lot of both dante and hamm's work but this was just unwatchable
<START> brilliant technology but what good does it do if the content is hollow and foolish i have left after than 30 minutes of watching being bored and irritated br br the theatre administration returned my money but the time waisted and aggravation remained i have been had and no thanks to the stars whose names were the main attraction br br george meryl bill i hope you were well paid you might have even liked it so i apologies for my limited mind a lot of people seemed to like it too look at the comments oh well br br wish to know what is remotely redeeming in a story about mr fox the husband the father the citizen the whatever

<START> let me be clear i've used imdb for years but only today i went through the trouble of registering on the site just so i could give this movie the lowest possible rating i've seen hundreds of films some of them bad a few awful never though have i seen such a contrast of pretense and incompetence of high intentions and failure br br mira sorvino is horribly cast as the princess but entirely unbelievable as phocion a young boy fiona shaw is always an entertaining character but the dialogue in the film is much worse even than in the insipid french play that is the source marivaux never reached hollywood until now and we should keep it that way br br to illustrate for example that leontine is a brilliant passionate philosopher and scientist she is shown frantically pouring chemicals from beaker to beaker shouting out names of famous scientists and the romance between agis and the princess is played even sillier for this the pair should receive a joint 'clair danes' award which in a just world would be awarded for gratuitously anachronistic and uninspired re interpretation of interesting teens from literature as brats of the 1990's see miss danes in les miserables br br aside from the atrocious plot and dialogue there are some attempts to introduce artistic tropes into the filming for example there are moments when a handful of spectators are faded in and out of view of the action sitting in chairs watching the principal characters the director wants us to realize she's adapted a play i get it but it doesn't happen at all until far into the film at that point seeing a crowd of people sitting in chairs for a moment then disappearing is creepy and distracting they're like some sort of un scary zombie crowd appearing through the mists filling us with dread when you see the horrible frolic and song that ends this movie you'll want to rouse your own crowd of zombies and kill them all for the grave injustise of poisoning your mind for 112 minutes br br matthew mcguire
<START> this 2003 made for tv movie was shown on a women's channel naturally as a man why do i even attempt to watch this i don't know but i should have my head examined and director and writer simon gornick should be ashamed of himself to give men an injustice as he does he takes away any strength and conviction a man could have by having several boring women do him in number one bore is joyce hyser as the wife i couldn't wait for him to drop her her revenge was silly and stupid and very confusing through most of the movie the other femme fatale was nichole hiltz about the coldest person you'd ever want to meet her looks didn't warrant our leading man to go that ape over her and her acting was so obvious only a fool could miss definitely a loser tembi locke was pretty good but slow on the uptake as to the slut seducing her own husband again played as a guy who is a loser by david deluise rounding out our cast of losers is anthony denison as a boss who has little to do but scowl at our hero stephen jenkins as our hero or should i say victim was not that good at first i thought he just a bad actor but later i believed it he never got the part off the ground and was repetitive throughout although as a man i became enraged when the two women got away with it men beware of this channel that puts men down and women get away even with murder lmn is the channel beware note having watched this a second time by mistake i am convinced on my initial thoughts especially on the writer director simon gornick i still believe he has disgraced the male species and should be horse whipped only saving grace in this film is tembi locke who doesn't have a chance to show her talents with the awful acting of jenkins hyser hiltz and deluise around her plus the stupid plot that only makes it worse down with gornick's movie and his vacant stars in it please lmn don't show this trite again
<START> first of all let's get a few things straight here a i am an anime fan always has been as a matter of fact i used to watch speed racer all the time in preschool b i do like several b movies because they're hilarious c i like the godzilla movies a lot br br moving on when the movie first comes on it seems like it's going to be your usual b movie down to the crappy fx but all a sudden boom the anime comes on this is when the movie goes wwwaaaaayyyyy downhill br br the animation is very bad cheap even worse than what i remember from speed racer for crissakes in fact it's so cheap one of the few scenes from the movie i vividly remember is when a bunch of kids run out of a school it's the same kids over over again the fx are terrible too the dinosaurs look worse than godzilla in addition the transition to live action to animation is unorganized the dialogue voices especially the english dub that i viewed was horrid i was begging my dad to take the tape out of the dvd vhs player the only thing that kept me surviving was cracking out jokes comments like the robots joel mike on mst3k you pick the season honestly this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie survive it at the same time br br heck i'm planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on halloween for a b movie night because it's stupid pretty painful to watch unintentionally hilarious at the same time i'm giving this movie a 3 10 an improvement from the 0 5 10 i was originally going to give it br br according to my grading scale 3 10 means pretty much both boring bad as fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it then it will become as fun as counting to 15
<START> i rented this movie simply because rosario dawson was in it i sat down to watch it with my buddy and 6 minutes in we were glued to our seats not because of any intensity in those 6 minutes but because it was a real film no hollywood bs no explosions no corny one liners film it drew you in slowly reeling you toward a tragically human fate some people think they enjoy film but they are sadly mistaken they like movies mindless entertainment for entertainment's sake alone michael bay's transformers and the like were produced for just this audience no need to think people just watch and allow ever stereotype we can muster to slowly dissolve your brain we'll even place advertisements throughout the movie to keep you buying our products and don't forget the explosions we all love explosions here we make the distinction art can be entertaining but it's also thought provoking and moves you in hidden ways entertainment is rarely artful and even then only arbitrarily movie are entertainment descent is a film film is art br br if you still house a soul within your walking meat sack apparatus this rape scene is every bit as powerful as irreversable the distinction here is that irreversable was a violent rape scene involving two people whose paths have unfortunately crossed at the wrong time and hell ensued descent is about date rape no less disgusting no less depraved just different this is about trust violation soul desecration and the scars that run deep had the character maya been consenting it would have been a hot sex scene but seeing as she was desperate to escape the scene is sickening jared is a sick and manipulative serial rapist and it's wholly unsettling because it so closely resembles a passionate love affair how could maya ever be close to anyone again when even in the midst of raping her jared's slick lover boy facade only ever hints at slipping she is ruined br br the film as a whole is beautiful the camera work and lighting at times removes the surroundings and focuses everything on maya and the silent inner workings of her mind all this accomplished by rosario with facial expression and gesture the soundtrack was excellent a blend of everything my particularly favorite scene being a synchronism of all these film aspects working together maya dancing in a sea of writhing bodies something inside her awakening becoming aware all set to a beautifully sad jeff buckley tune br br i don't think i've really spoiled anything here but i'm stopping before i do bottom line i think this was the best film of 2007 hands down unfortunately it seems that everyone is so jaded these days that if you don't hack and slash gang rape or nuke anything then people just can't be bothered death isn't the worst thing that can happen to you it's only the last thing that will happen in this existence the worst things that happen never leave you they are always in your thoughts when you shower when you brush your teeth when you buy a christmas present when you tie your shoe they haunt you they haunt you until that last thing releases you br br treat yourself challenge yourself watch this film
<START> this quasi j horror film followed a young woman as she returns to her childhood village on the island of shikoku to sell the family house and meet up with old friends she finds that one the daughter of the village priestess drowned several years earlier she and fumiko another childhood friend then learn that sayori's mother is trying to bring her back to life with black magic already the bonds between the dead and living are getting weak and the friends and villagers are seeing ghosts nothing was exceptional or even very good about this movie unlike stellar j horror films the suspense doesn't really build the result doesn't seem overly threatening and the ending borders on the absurd br br this movie is like plain white rice cooked a little too long so that it is bordering on mushy sometimes you get this at poor asian restaurants or cook your own white rice a little too long you end up eating it because you need it with the meal because what is chinese or japanese food without rice but it almost ruins the meal because of the gluey gooey tastelessness of it all 3 10 http blog myspace com locoformovies
<START> okay now i know there are millions of americans who believe in the rapture that moment when all people born again in christ will be raptured up to meet god and all the rest of humanity will be left on earth to perish in plagues and fire and the heartbreak of psoriasis as the antichrist battles it out with jesus in an uncharacteristically warlike mode and i know the books were best sellers among believers anyway and i mean no disrespect to all that br br but i have to say they stuffed this movie into a sack and beat it with the suck stick br br i'm sure the books are much better really br br the plot needs no reprising if you've watched this movie chances are you read the book i may be one of the only people on earth who actually watched this just for the sheer bad moving making experience and i wasn't disappointed especially not by kirk cameron the creepy little growing pains gremlin who came of age on that show found christ and decided that the show should reflect his christian values well kirk your career has gone to the dogs but now you can be happy that you're spreading the word of god in movies so bad they never even make it to theatrical release well that's not strictly true i guess this was the only movie ever made that went to dvd first with a voucher for a free viewing of the movie when it was briefly released in theaters i still have the voucher how many people do you suppose showed up i don't know about you but it never came to my town of course i live in nyc where we godless liberals sit around tearing pages out of the bible and use them to roll joints so there you go in fact i'll bet out of three million people on manhattan island not one would be raptured br br check out the supplementary materials on the dvd where you'll learn the creepy behind the scenes details of these movies the cast and crew all must be of the same religious mindset they don't come right out and say this but listen closely to what the filmmakers say it's like a bunch of pod people got together to make a pod movie how creepazoid is that honestly this stuff just preaches to the converted doesn't it can you imagine anyone who doesn't subscribe to the whole apocalypse thing watching this slapping his forehead and saying holy hoover dam i better get saved pronto anyhow i'm hooked i gotta see the rest of these christian fiasco movies especially the one with gary busey which i think is tribulations at least busey has an excuse for taking the part he cracked his head on some pavement when he crashed his motorcycle br br oy br br oh and one more thing what's with all the shots of poor innocent dogs whimpering their leashes dragging uselessly along the ground because their owners have been called to heaven what's up with that are we supposed to feel badly for the dogs and if we do what are we to make of god doesn't it irk people that there's no room in heaven for man's best friend foo br br this is one more reason i'm agnostic good night and good luck
<START> i gave it an 8 only because it had received such low votes this is definitely really about a 5 5 ummm it was kind of bloody had likeable shallow characters and it had some really hot babes in it i like the eclectic killer because he didn't kill people the same way everytime that sometimes gets old
<START> sorry to say i have no idea what hollywood is doing sure give us movies like batman begins oh by the way hollywood i think they may cover the story line in the movie batman but please don't entertain us what we would really want to see batman and superman together i really hated this trailer because it left me wanting for more i was looking around to see when it was coming out it was like a terrible practical joke the graphics where good the story line seemed solid and it had all the trappings of a great movie unfortunately it's not going to happen for now to the producers directors and all the actors great job but i hate you for doing this to me you left me wanting more
<START> this movie displays the kind of ensemble work one wishes for in every film barbara bain and donald sutherland who play husband and wife are positive chilling discussing the family business as if it were a grocery store or a dry cleaners macy campbell ullman and ritter are also terrific they play off each other like members of a top notch theatrical troupe who realize that a quality product requires each actor to support the others unselfishly and finally there's sammy david dorfman what an amazing performance from a child and what an uncanny resemblance he has to ullman whose son he plays br br we're treated to a unique story in panic and that's a rarity in these days of tired formulaic crap the dialogue is sharp and smart and this relatively short film nevertheless has the power to elicit a full range of emotions from the viewer there are places to laugh to be shocked to be horrified to be saddened to be aroused to be angry and to love it's not a movie that leaves you jumping for joy but when it's over you're more than satisfied knowing you've spent the last ninety minutes experiencing a darn good piece of work br br more of us would go to theatres if we were treated to quality fare like this when are the powers that be in hollywood going to wake up it's a real shame when something this good fails to get exposure beyond festivals and households fortunate enough to have cable
<START> i found this a very entertaining small kids movie that actually is geared more for adults with a lot of jokes and humor only they would understand a few things are inappropriate for the kiddies but just a few othewise the grinch jim carrey cracks so many jokes you can't keep up with them all ranging from sexual to cultural to insider hollywood to racial br br the film is very colorful and looks great on dvd the little girl in here cindy lou who taylor momsen is really cute and the costumes and hairdos of the little people in here are fun to view anthony hopkins' voice is pleasing too so having his narrate this elevates the movie further his rhymes are fun to hear br br i saw this in the theater though it was fair but on dvd it was far better i've seen in three times and it got better each time
<START> on the face of it a film about women wanting to see a football match wouldn't appeal much to somebody with little interest in football such as myself however this isn't about football it is about discrimination and the women's enthusiasm for the sport they love br br the film opens on the day of a crucial world cup qualifying match between iran and bahrain a girl is trying to get in to tehran's azadi stadium by dressing like a boy it looks like she will get in until a soldier tries to search her once caught she is taken to a small enclosure high up on the outside of the stadium where there are a handful of women who had already been caught here they are guarded by a small group of conscript soldiers who's leader would rather be back home tending his livestock we never learn the character's names but we get to know them as people as the girls plead with the guards to let them watch though a nearby gap in the wall and when refused try to get them to at least provide a commentary br br as well as making an important point about the rigid gender segregation in much of present day iran the film contains many hilarious moments such as the disguise one of the girls is made to wear when going to the toilet and the girl who disguised herself as a soldier and was only caught because she chose to watch the match from a seat reserved for a senior officer the girls enthusiasm for the game is such that by the end the viewer is likely to be on the edge of their seat hoping that iran will win and thus get to go to the finals in germany the soldiers aren't shown as fundamentalists they are just conscripts who are there because they have to be and when explaining to the girls why woman can't watch men's sports don't seem that convinced by their own arguments br br it is a shame that this film can't be seen in iran itself but it is good that the wider world can see it and thus see that ordinary iranians aren't a bunch of fanatics desperate to wage war on the west but normal people with the same passions and concerns as people everywhere the cast did a great job in making their characters seem like real people rather than mere caricatures
<START> i created my own reality by walking out of the theater i was roped in by my girlfriend into going to this dreck with her mom we my g friend and i walked out about an hour into it what a load of pseudo scientific new age jargon br br sub atomic particles are thoughts by taping labels to bottles of water and blessing it by a buddhist monk it grew little pretty crystals a drop of 25 in the murder rate in dc happened when a bunch of folks meditated wow what a rigorous scientific study i'm sure that someone ate cheerios for four days straight during the same time should we conclude that eating cheerios caused a drop in the murder rate br br hogwash hooey bull pucky br br btw it was funded by the ramtha cult the leader of which was one of the experts which were interview by the filmmakers no ulterior motives here right
<START> i was so impressed with doug mcgrath's film version of the jane austen novel emma and i loved the music score by rachel portman so much that when i went to the video store one day and discovered the two had re united for nicholas nickleby i immediately rented it without any other consideration br br i have read the book and for those overly critical fans of this jane austen adaptation i don't know what else mcgrath could have done to more perfectly capture the spirit and major plot elements of miss austen's work especially given the limitations of a two hour movie which some have complained about being too long and as far as gwen paltrow's accent is concerned i must confess i wasn't too familiar with her when i saw this at the theater initially and i was absolutely convinced at the time that she was an english actress br br i am taken aback by those who criticized the film for its lush scenery that is one of the things i enjoy and look forward to seeing in period pieces set in the english countryside the film's beautiful backgrounds are a major contributor to its appeal and success if your idea of escapist fare is something bleaker then perhaps you should rent something like death wish iii br br the english country settings are as attractive and charming as the cast and combine with the story and soundtrack for entertainment that makes you not tire of repeat viewings mcgrath is a wonder at choreographing the interplay of subtle expressions that are so essential in conveying the complicated romantic intrigue that occurs in this story br br this refreshing movie could also be a clinic on how enjoyable a film can be minus sex violence or even a villainous antagonist the story is often amusing endearing and at times quite touching br br i have seen many competent jane austen book adaptations but this is without question my favorite
