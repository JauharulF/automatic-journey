<START> i used to watch this on either hbo or showtime or cinemax during the one summer in the mid 90's that my parents subscribed to those channels i came across it several times in various parts and always found it dark bizarre and fascinating i was young then in my early teens and now years later after having discovered the great arliss howard and being blown away by big bad love i bought the dvd of wilder napalm and re watched it with my girlfriend for the first time in many years i absolutely loved it i was really impressed and affected by it there are so many dynamic fluid complexities and cleverness within the camera movements and cinematography all of which perfectly gel with the intelligent intense and immediate chemistry between the three leads their story the music and all the other actors as well it's truly cinematic i love arliss howard's subtle intensity ambivalent strength and hidden intelligence i'm a big fan of anything he does and his interplay with debra winger's manic glee they are of course married has that magic charming reality to it that goes past the camera i wonder if they watch this on wedding anniversaries big bad love should be the next stop for anyone who has not seen it it's brilliant and dennis quaid in full clown make up sneakily introduced angled hidden and displayed by the shot selection and full bloomed delivery is of the kind of pure dark movie magic you don't see very often quaid has always had a sinister quality to him for me anyways with that huge slit mouth span hiding behind his flicker eyes lying in wait to unleash itself as either mischievous charm or diabolical weirdness here as both both howard and quaid have the insane fire behind the eyes to pull off their wonderful intense internal gunslinger square offs in darkly cool fashion in fact the whole film has a darkly cool energy and hip intensity it's really a fantastic film put together by intelligence imagination agility and chemistry by all parties involved i really cannot imagine how this got funded and it looks pretty expensive to me by such a conventional imagination less system but i thank god films like this slip through the system every once in awhile in a great way with all of its day glo bright carnival colors hip intelligence darkly warped truthful humor and enthralling chemistry it reminds me of one of my favorite films of all time grosse pointe blank now that's a compliment in my book
<START> my brother is an avid dvd collector he took one look at the cover two models on toilets and had to add it to his collection i stayed up with him to watch what turned out to be likely the most cringeable movie i use that term loosely i've felt obligated to sit through i dared not make eye contact with my brother quite certain he must have been cursing the receipt in his clenched fist the biggest name in the whole movie is michael clark duncan who appears in one scene which the filmmaker decided to show every take of about four total throughout the movie in fact the whole movie pretty much follows this suit the fact that the dvd contained deleted footage was a shock i went to bed without viewing it however to no surprise at all i found this disc without its case behind the tv about a week later
<START> this is a great game okay perhaps it didn't have some of the features it was meant to have but digital anvil have still come up with a good game there is a certain similarity to elite you can trade pick up weapons and cargo off destroyed ships go on missions however this game features a heavily scripted mission it is a great mission the control system is different it uses the mouse you basically fly you spaceship around a system and work your way up the game features some pretty good graphics even through it was made in 2003 it should run well on even a modestly specified pc the story features some great voice acting from john rhys davies george takei jennifer hale she appears in every computer game stick with the story it gets better and better as it goes on there is even a race section where you and an opponent have to race your spaceships around a course it involves you going through rings this section took me a while to beat it adds variety to the game some sections are a little tough here and there but overall you can beat this game the game has an active mod scene on the net pick up some mods to extend the game i haven't played any of the mods yet br br sadly a sequel to this was cancelled a shame
<START> ally mcbeal was a decent enough show but it was very overrated the characters become boring after a while and the jokes begin to fall short br br i think it chose an appropriate point in time to leave it was starting to outstay its welcome
<START> this is a film which had eluded me thus far but now that i've watched it emerges as one of the major entries in the noir style as usual with the divx format the viewing was far from ideal Â marred by the occasional video and mostly audio glitches Â but given that the film is still unavailable on r1 dvd this will have to do for the moment since the film's reputation is quite high within the genre itself i assume that the reason behind this oversight is because it does not have a well known actor in the lead br br anyway the belated entrance of the film's nominal star Â franchot tone Â packs quite a wallop especially as he is shown to be the villain from the first tone was a underrated actor Â he was rarely given meaty roles and this may well be his best making his paranoiac both fascinating and believably dangerous the female lead Â ella raines who would later feature in brute force 1947 as well as siodmak's own the suspect 1944 and the strange affair of uncle harry 1945 Â is quite lovely and capably takes on the role of the distraught secretary out to prove her convicted boss alan baxter innocent of his wife's brutal murder other key supporting parts are essayed by thomas gomez as the initially bullying but ultimately sympathetic police investigator and elisha cook jr Â the genre's quintessential fall guy Â as an ill fated ladies' man of a percussionist br br like brute force's jules dassin siodmak was on a noir roll at this point in his career and this film definitely benefits from his superb direction Â all tilted angles and terrific set pieces including the justly celebrated jazz sequence in which cook manically beats on his drums in a sexual frenzy brought on by the sluttishly attired raines who is putting on an act to get his attention and eventually drive him to confess that he withheld evidence at the inquest which could spring her resigned lover from jail another great lengthy sequence is the one in which raines follows a bartender another uncooperative witness around the streets of new york Â which results in his being mowed down by a car br br notable too is the trial sequence Â which is entirely depicted through the audience's reaction so that judge jury witnesses and d a are never actually seen although the judge's voice is recognizably that of veteran character actor samuel s hinds the centerpiece of the film is the scene in which gomez and tone discuss the nature of the criminal involved with the inspector's put down of the latter as mentally insane giving the initially smug tone dizzy spells the suspenseful climax finds raines alone with tone in his apartment where she discovers evidence of his guilt Â and he confesses to having had an affair with baxter's wife but killed her when she wouldn't desert her husband for him br br by the way i hit upon a little goof in the film while the story is clearly set in 1943 i noticed that during the taxi cab ride towards the beginning of the film Â in which alan curtis escorts the titular lady to the theater Â the establishing shot of new york comprising clearly of stock footage features a marquee promoting laurel and hardy's 1938 musical comedy swiss miss incidentally famed mystery writer cornell woolrich wrote the original novel on which this was based using a pseudonym
<START> i get teased all the time by family and friends for my tears over movies and they were not disappointed when i watched this one i cried numerous times but believe me it was not over sappiness i ached for the family and i ached for this man as he tried to redeem himself the only way he knew how denzel was fabulous as always and so was chris walkin mickey rourke i did not even recognized though the years have not been kind to him my husband is not one to re watch movies unless they are historically accurate war movies snore he has watched this movie 5 times now and i am going to have to get the dvd to watch it again because he has worn out the tape and it jumped the whole time i was watching
<START> 'metamoprhis' is the story of a dashing young scientist revered at the local college is brought under investigation by financial providers for the college this forces him to take shortcuts in typical bad hollywood melodramatic fashion br br my first thought after this movies conclusion was this not good but not bad for early to mid eighties of course i then realized that it was made in 1990 which almost propelled it down to a '4' but decided to keep it at the mediocre '5' that it is br br 'metamorphis' does on a few occasions seem like a good movie desperately trying to get out the acting while not stellar is mostly competent you can even see the occasional glisten of a modest quality pacing is a large problem with the movie after thinking i had been watching for ninety minutes i realized i'd only been watching an hour special effects aren't stellar but the director seems to be mostly competent enough to work around that weakness br br the lead a mildly charismatic male that seems to be attempting a blended channeling of tom cruise and christopher reeves reminded me mostly of matt dillon's character in 'wild things' the female heroine does an ok job but does not distinguish herself in anyway there's a 'naughty girl' role in here and the actress does what she can with it but it doesn't seem like much there is a child actor that the director can't decide if he's morose cheerful or just weird br br pacing as i said is the worst problem with this movie until a final battle with the bad guy that would make a power ranger blush it is bizarre and inexplicable until the final scene which is supposed to be dramatic but simply hilarious saturated with every bad camera trick and overacting that can be compressed in about thirty seconds br br a decent one time watch on the 'mill creek 50 chilling movie pack' nothing that is going to bring you back and nothing to buy on its own
<START> like the gentle giants that make up the latter half of this film's title michael oblowitz's latest production has grace but it's also slow and ponderous the producer's last outing mosquitoman 3d had the same problem it's hard to imagine a boring shark movie but they somehow managed it the only draw for hammerhead shark frenzy was it's passable animatronix which is always fun when dealing with wondrous worlds beneath the ocean's surface but even that was only passable poor focus in some scenes made the production seems amateurish with dolphins and whales the technology is all but wasted cloudy scenes and too many close ups of the film's giant subjects do nothing to take advantage of imax's stunning 3d capabilities there are far too few scenes of any depth or variety close ups of these awesome creatures just look flat and there is often only one creature in the cameras field so there is no contrast of depth michael oblowitz is trying to follow in his father's footsteps but when you've got shark week on cable his introspective and dull treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment
<START> this is exactly the sort of saturday matinee serial i loved during world war ii i was under ten years of age and that's the audience this serial is designed for looking at it now one must roar at its ineptitude and stupidity the budget must have been next to nothing given the shortcuts and repeats the acting well this is republic pictures 1944 they read the lines and no doubt had one take to make them convincing br br one and half stars
<START> really bad movie maybe the worst i've ever seen alien invasion a la the blob without the acting meteorite turns beautiful woman into a host body for nasty tongue bad plot bad fake tongue absurd comedy worth missing wash your hair or take out the trash
<START> this was the second of three films that irving berlin wrote for the astaire rogers franchise and it has by far the largest score and is somewhat unusual in that two of the numbers are performed by harriet hilliard leaving the rest to be divvied and or shared between the principals as usual the storyline needn't detain us though for the record it was based on a play shore leave that also served as the basis for a broadway musical hit the deck anyone who actually saw shore leave in the theatre may have been momentarily bemused inasmuch as the roles played by fred and ginger were created for the movie but what matters as always is the music lyrics and hoofing and this is all out of the right bottle it's a departure from the other titles in the franchise in that 1 we get to see astaire play the piano in real life he was an accomplished pianist and composed several songs one of which i'm building up to an awful let down had a lyric by johnny mercer and spent a couple of weeks in the charts and it is the only one of the series in which he played a serviceman albeit an ex hoofer who enlisted in the navy after being dumped by dancing partner ginger before the story starts he gets to perform a little known but excellent berlin number i'd rather lead a band as well as duetting on i'm putting all my eggs in one basket but the ultimate number is the prophetic in 1936 rumbles of world war ii were already being felt let's face the music and dance one of the most potent ballads ever performed by the team so what if randolph scott is a little wooden and fish out of water without either a horse or a six gun within easy reach and harriet hilliard doesn't exactly set the screen on fire we came to see fred and ginger and the only question is do they deliver answer in spades
<START> famous words of foreign nightclub owner roman maroni that lousy cork sucker who spends the whole movie not only as johnny dangerously's rival but butchering the english language as well br br another underrated classic that you can only find on afternoon matinÃ©es or late late late show 's johnny dangerously is a terrific satirical hit about a good hearted boy who secretly leads a life of crime to help pay for his mother's medical care and put his brother through law school br br yes there's a story but who cares a cast that includes joe piscopo dom deluise marilu henner and alan hale jr will keep you waiting to see what happens next br br there's too many laughs in this to put on here like airplane you have to pay attention or you'll miss something highly recommended to anyone who can use a good laugh or two
<START> this film though ostensibly a comedy is deadly serious its subject is imperialism with a capital i how britain foolishly humiliatingly tries to convince itself that it's still a great power after world war ii at home the empire is run by amiable dolts benevolent tories who are so in bred that they can't distinguish close relatives the offices of government consist of long forgotten archives a dig at orwellian paranoia inhabited by indolent rats and ante rooms wherein lounge bored synacures reading popular novels br br abroad britain clings to the old pomp but pomp out of context looks threadbare and silly especially when its embodied in bumbling twits carlton browne is an unsentimental picture of decline with none of the lachrymose rot that marred the supposedly anti imperialist jewel in the crown br br the film is also about the cold war bravely admitting that it's a dangerous farce whose participants deserve mockery and contempt not fear and respect it's about how colonialism characterised more by neglect than tyranny destroys the colonies it deserts robbing them of amenities power and most importantly self respect leaving them vulnerable to the machinations of dangerous cowboys br br it's the seriousness of course that kills it that's not to say that weighty subjects can't be treated in comedy the miracle of morgan's creek dr strangelove and the life of brian have all proved that indeed one might suggest that serious themes should only be treated by comedy it allows for a clearer eyed view br br the problem with carlton browne is that every situation must have a significance beyond the merely comic so that it becomes weighed down and unfunny in the three films mentioned above much of the comedy arises from character reaction to an extreme situation not the extreme situation itself here the script is too poor to sustain rich comic characterisations and some of the greatest comedy talent ever assembled peter sellers terry thomas raymond huntley and john le mesurier are criminally wasted br br terry thomas sublime so often shows that he couldn't handle lead parts and that he needed to play sneering arrogant bounders not brainless toffs the music is made to carry much of the comedy but its heavy irony only draws attention to the lack of hilarity on screen to be fair unlike the majority of british comedies of the period which were stagy and underproduced the boultings often try to make their points through film itself by montage and composition only huntley manages to raise genuine laughs and that's by essaying a character he could have played in his sleep br br none of the boultings' farces have dated well they're never thought through enough although carlton browne revels in the decline of the empire it also seems to be anti democratic and militaristic i'm sure this wasn't intended but these blunders are bound to happen if you allow worthy intentions to take precedence over comic intelligence and film form
<START> i remember this movie when i was 13 seems a lot of reviews are saying the same thing age 13 with a group of school buddies we all wanted to see billy crystal in his first movie and fell for the typical commercial ads telling us this was a great comedy we suffered through about 45 minutes of it and all agreed to leave the theater it was grotesque tasteless and a far cry from the ability billy crystal had to make us laugh we were not laughing i stumbled upon this review by accident and decided to register just to tell the rest of the world what a rot gut waste of film this was now if you rent this you deserve what you get you've been warned
<START> wow sheer brilliance br br turning a thriller suspense horror into comedy br br after watching this i never laughed so hard at a horror movie before a ridiculous plot with 3 characters that were just insanely developed either not written in depth or too much depth br br if you want to watch an absolutely written horror movie with stupid dialog messed up plot useless scenes wasted characters bad sound and lousy development overall then this is the one to watch br br be sure to keep focused for the classic food processor scene and the totally inept police investigation scenes br br this is a remarkable new low in screen performance and writing and to sit through it for the entire duration makes you either stupid daring or brave
<START> after seeing the trailer of this film in the cinema i thought that it was an original concept for a thriller setting it in the competitive world of computer companies the all star cast was another message that this film would probably be good but when i didn't go to watch it in it's first week of release then it disappeared by week 2 i feared something was a miss patiently i waited for it's dvd release then bought it rushing home for an enjoyable evening's viewing the anticipation on the way home was far better than the film for a start the direction is appalling there's no thought gone into it at all and the director just makes up a part for himself so he can appear in the film i wouldn't be rushing out to employ him in the future secondly the lead role is completely miscast as ryan phillipe phillipe normally the cool character as in cruel intentions and way of the gun but in this he's supposed to be a bumbling hero which he attempts to portray by slipping when he's running and having geeky friends but he just doesn't look right the female stars rachel leigh cook and clare forlani don't feature enough but when they do neither of the performances are close to their bests the only highlight of the film is tim robbins in a role that could have been made for him and it's his fiery temper and mysterious ways that drag the film along the final point is that this film is another one which fills the trailer with scenes you don't see in the film and instead feature only in the deleted scenes section of the dvd causing even more disappointment as although some of these scenes are crude they do fill in important gaps in the story
<START> twisted bizarre enchanting and hilarious i couldn't stop laughing watching this film darren stein presents the movies he made on the family camcorder growing up in southern california in the 1980's it's an interesting look at a budding filmmaker and his motivations and ability to manipulate for the camera manipulation is a strong word however don't we all watch movies to be manipulated in some way or another br br from the beginning i was amused at the fact that the boys in the films seemed to appear shirtless whenever possible later darren comments about his budding homosexuality and you can see it from the hints big hints of flamboyance at an early age maybe it was just the warm southern california weather who knows as a gay man who also grew up in a nurturing environment it's great to see that his parents supported and loved him and that his friends seemed to be entranced with his nascent talent behind the lens br br put the camera on me offers a look back to the 80's untouched by commercialism you'll remember the hair the music and the fashions i'm the same age as mr stein so the trip back to memory lane was welcome his solo lip syncing dance number is priceless enhanced by the frankie goes to hollywood t shirt br br the films deal with dark themes at time child abuse the holocaust nuclear war sexual fantasy and social dysfunction no childhood is completely carefree and the way stein deals with these subjects is interesting to say the least and hilarious to behold br br watch at your earliest convenience
<START> i originally saw this movie as a boy at the old rialto theatre as part of a saturday afternoon matinÃ©e triple bill which also featured vincent price's last man on earth and mario bava's nightmare castle i had nightmares about blood lusting ghosts for a week afterwards though i didn't know it then all three movies would prove to be classics of the genre no wonder i was so scared though all three films frightened me it was castle of blood that had the most profound impact br br it was the first on the bill i didn't even get to see it from the beginning as we were late getting to the cinema and missed the first 20 minutes of the movie that's lot to miss since the edited print only ran about 79 minutes the unedited runs 87minutes but despite this the dark creepy atmosphere complete with ruined castles fog enshrouded cemeteries shadows and cobwebs gothic set design strong acting and suspense especially the last 20 minutes scared the bejeepers out of me and made a lasting impression it took me years to finally get a copy of the film for my collection since it was a french italian import it wasn't a movie that showed up on the late show in winnipeg i couldn't quite remember the title remember i didn't get to seen the beginning of the film and was scared witless and to make matters worse the film had been released under literally a dozen different movie titles aka danze macabre coffin of terror castle of terror long night of terror etc and the usa uk working title castle of blood was very generic similar to dozens of other b horror and suspense films making it illusive but thanks to the internet and perseverance i found it at last what a treat to finally watch the film in its entirety after so many years it may not have had quite the sheer emotional impact that it did when i was a boy but as haunted house movies go it's stands up well and compares favourably to similar iconic films of the period such as the haunting the innocents or black sunday the film is a fine early effort of italian director antonio margheriti it stars 60's scream queen icon barbara steele and features a well written screenplay by sergio corbucci about a sceptical writer georges riviere who on a bet spends the night in haunted house and unsuspectingly becomes part of an annual ongoing ghostly story the hypnotic steele is well cast as the ghostly love interest as is arturo dominici as dr carmus and margarete robsahm as julia br br many of the tricks margheriti employs to create the film's eerie atmosphere cobwebs creaking doors fog etc are bound to seem clichÃ© to a modern audience but they work far more effectively in black and white than they ever could in modern day colour rather than using body counts and special effects the film creates scares the old fashion way relying on a good story stylish direction fine set production interesting camera work and strong acting performances margheriti does a marvellous job taking these elements and building the film's suspense as the horrifying paranormal secret of the house gradually reveals itself to the unwitting writer br br the film is not without faults the pace drags at the beginning of the film ironically the 20 minutes i originally missed this is probably worsened by synapse films effort to restore the film to its original length though fans will likely appreciate the chance to see the film restored in terms of the intro it may have been more of hindrance than a help the english voice dubs are merely passable and in the restored scenes the language shifts from english to french english subtitles provided which is sure to be annoying to some viewers br br however synapse films deserves kudos for the quality of the print clearly some effort was put into its restoration and deservedly so br br i enjoyed the film immensely and highly recommend it to aficionados of 60's italian goth films or anyone who enjoys a good ghost story br br rob rheubottom winnipeg mb canada
<START> i watched this on the movies with my girlfriend at the time and i can say that i didn't have the best time mainly because i didn't know about ned kelly or his story br br but since this is a biopic it's important to at least know what to expect from the character br br i don't know if the manner the events are told are true or if it everything is fictional but the way ned kelly is portrayed as a hero and a fighter for justice really makes me want to believe everything is true i don't think he's portrayed as a redneck criminal or thief but that's just my opinion br br this is a solid western type movie for everybody's tastes heath ledger is great as always and the sexy naomi watts charms the screen br br give this movie a chance if it airs on cable otherwise i don't think i could recommend it
<START> i have seen a lot of saura films and always found amazing the way he assembles music dance drama and great cinema in his movies ibÃ©ria shows an even better saura dealing with multimedia concepts and a more contemporary concept of dance and music another thing that called my attention is the fact that in this movie dancers and musicians dance and music are equally important the camera shows various aspects of music interpretation examining not only technical issues but also the emotional experience of playing the interest of saura on the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is one more ingredient in turning this movie maybe the most aesthetically exciting among his other works that's why i recommend it strongly to those who love good cinema good music good dance great art
