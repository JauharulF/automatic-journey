<START> birth of the beatles for being a us television movie released in the fall of 1979 has actually been so far the best movie which tells the tale of the the four lads from liverpool that revolutionized the music industry and the world as told by the point of view of former beatle pete best the performance from the entire cast is excellent but most especially the performance by stephen mackenna as john lennon and rod culbertson as paul mccartney the film was produced by a legend of the rock and roll era mr dick clark who a year earlier in 1978 had produced another tv movie that has stood the test of time starring kurt rusell in the lead role about another musical legend elvis that movie was directed by an unknown director named john carpenter who went on to direct other successful movies such as halloween escape from new york and the thing the same can be said for the director of the birth of the beatles mr richard marquand he went on to direct other theatrical blockbusters such as star wars return of the jedi eye of the needle and jagged edge among many the only other film that tells the story of the fab four that i know of is back beat which had a theatrical release in 1994 however the critics did not care for it nor did the public for it did not have a long life span in the theater birth of the beatles is very charming and simplistic film that gives you the essence of the beginning of the legend and the struggles hardships they went thru and ends at there pinnacle of success when they arrive in nyc and appear in the ed sullivan show in 1964 i highly recommend this film
<START> we all know a movie never does complete justice to the book but this is exceptional important characters were cut out blanca and alba were essentially mushed into the same character most of the subplots and major elements of the main plot were eliminated clara's clairvoyance was extremely downplayed making her seem like a much more shallow character than the one i got to know in the book in the book we learn more about her powers and the important effects she had on so many people which in turn was a key element in the life of the family in the movie she was no more than some special lady the relationship between esteban and pedro tercero tercero third by the way is the son and thus comes after segundo second and its connections to that between esteban and his grandson from pancha garcÃ­a not son who he also did recognize is chopped in half and its importance downplayed br br one of the most fundamental things about the book that the film is all but stripped of this is called the house of the spirits where is the house the story of 3 4 generations of a family is supposed to revolve around the big house on the corner a line stated so many times in the novel the house in fundamental to the story but the movie unjustly relegates it to a mere backdrop br br if i hadn't read the book before i would have never guessed that such a sappy shallow movie could be based on such a rich and entertaining novel
<START> a small funny film it is totally incredible unbelievable impossible but it is funny how an introverted masochist can become totally dependent and mesmerized even hypnotized by a girl he hardly knows but who was able to get down into his phantasms of course it is a denunciation of the foolish deals you can get to on the internet you must not believe ten percent of what you're told there and never ever ever accept to tie up your hands in a way or another to someone or something or some organization you do not know personally most of their businesses there are in a way or another going to fool you and raid you but here the chap deserves being the victim of such gangsters because he is not only naive he is absurdly silly but then the film becomes funny because it ends up with the victim of the crooked business having the upper hand and ending up playing the same game with his victimizer and winning one think is sure too security in english airports is not exactly what it should be but i guess it's not better anywhere else in the world and even now they have tightened up all rules and regulations it is just fun to go through their procedures and foil them systematically then they have their vengeance by losing your luggage a real plague on modern airports and don't expect to get fair compensation or even confiscating a bottle opener or a can opener because it may be dangerous i can see myself cutting my way through the side of the plane with a can opener funny isn't it dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
<START> antonioni really showed some 'cojones' when he had this movie made he went to america working under a contract from the most lavish studio mgm and he made the most damning portrait of american society i've ever seen having seen la first hand this is the most accurate portrayal of the crowded overheated and impersonal city if only antonioni had met bill hicks br br the subsequent burial by the studio is understandable after such a whopping investment and dismal return it is sad that people don't get to see this film any more as i believe antonioni has been proved right here he predicts the end of the hippie civil rights movement in the politics of america everyone is much more interested in what goes into their pockets and the relentless expansion of living space into the inhospitable yet beautiful desert and beyond how i would love to see interest in this film re kindled and a lavish dvd release br br i beseech people to watch zabriskie point with an open mind and an open heart we have a genuinely unique film commenting on a turning point in the history of the most powerful nation on the planet and we have forgotten about it br br an unexpected gem
<START> it pains me to write such a scathing review but by not doing so i'm simply encouraging these people first off just because a film is made on a small budget does not automatically make it good nor endearing in fact in this case the small budget is probably the films sole achievement in that it prevented large sums of money from being squandered on a one legged race horse with the shits have you ever seen a comedy at the theatre ever heard people laugh and thought what the dickens are you on well even these twats weren't laughing things got so bad by mid way my cat took his first ever bath this is not film this is children no monkeys making images that leave you feeling like moving to france got to go there's a clown at my door
<START> unhinged was part of the video nasty censorship film selection that the uk built up in the 80's keeps the gory stuff out of the hands of children don't you know it must have left many wondering what the fuss was all about by today's standard unhinged is a tame little fairy tale br br 3 girls are off to a jazz concert and right away you know the body count is going to be quite low they get lost in the woods wind up getting in a car accident that looks so fake it's laughable they are picked up by some nearby residents that live in the woods in a creepy house one of the girls is seriously injured and has to stay upstairs then there's talking talking about why the girls are here and how they must be to dinner on time because mother doesn't like it when someone is late and more talking yakkity yak some suspense is built as a crazy guy is walking around and harassing the girls and someone's eyeball is looking through holes in the walls at the pretty girls in something that looks like hitchcock's psycho i digress because there is so much blah blah in this film that you wonder when the killings are going to start in fact one of the girls gets so bored out of her mind that she walks in the woods alone looking for the town smart move she probably knew about the lonely virgin walking alone in the woods part but just didn't care more talk continues after this as we wait wait and wait some more until the next girl may or may not be killed br br and then there's the twist ending the expected unexpected for some viewers for others a real gotcha quite possibly the only reason why someone would really want to watch this i don't care how twisted it is nothing in this movie makes up for the most boring time i had watching it even with the minor impact of the ending the director just didn't have what it takes to really deliver a good story with it it would have made a much better 30 minute 1 hour tv episode on say tales from the darkside br br if you really must get this for any reason perhaps just to say you've watched every slasher movie do yourself a favor and have the fast forward button ready since the movie has so many unimportant scenes just zoom through them and in no time you'll get to the wow that's what it was all this time ending oh and halfway through the movie there's a shower scene with 2 girls showing boo bees horray for boo bees those beautiful buzzing honey making boo bees
<START> the british claymation series putting witty conversations taped from average people in the mouths of cute fanciful creatures at least had the advantage for non british viewers of seeming droll and the kind of rarefied cultured humor you couldn't get on u s television someone made the mistake of putting it on u s television br br sort of like the sadly miscast american version of the sublime brit com coupling which died in a month on nbc when the same basic scripts didn't translate from british english to american english what seemed droll and cultured and just a bit dull in england comes across in creature comforts the american version as simply boredom with puppets there's no through plot line no characters and after one and a half episodes watched of the three ultimately aired no reason to suffer through more br br the only positive thing to be said about the new summer series and the mercifully brief run it had is that the claymation is at least professionally done and coming as a set up for the single worst show on the cbs schedule the new adventures of old christine or how to be a horrible mother or person in one interminable unfunny lesson kids who wanted to stay up past their bedtime happily ran to bed rather than sit through this show and the adults could wait to tune in until 9pm when two and a half men guilty pleasure and how i met your mother actual quality writing come on
<START> 10 10 for this film br br i'm a british india doctor currently in india the word beckham put me off 'cos i'm a die hard liverpool fan and personally think that owen is really cool since liverpool and man utd are rivals i was dead sure that i wouldn't watch the film br br but then i was in delhi to meet some friends and i had an early morning flight so i thought what the heck let's bide time by watching this film 'cos it was a late night show br br what a moron i was i should've seen this film the day it was released i guess using beckham's name was to draw audience attraction which had back fired in my case but then i really can't think of a better title for the film br br and nagra knightley drop dead gorgeous and rhys myers did a superb job br br if you hate football dislike manchester united or england for that matter then this is definately the film for you in fact i'm just 29 yrs old a psychiatrist by profession but a kid at heart this film has knocked star wars off my no 1 position br br surprisingly there aren't very many comments on this film by indian brits like me i wonder why br br 10 10 for this film
<START> this is a good example a film that in spite of the low rating is more than worth watching the story is engaging and it doesn't take long before the chemistry between nicole kidman and ben chaplin grabs your attention the acting is first class and the characters are represented well sometimes it feels like the director couldn't decide himself between drama and romantic comedy ben chiller's portrayal of the law abiding and shy englishman with porn s m magazines hidden in the bedroom creates plenty of moments for laughs as does the look in nicole kidman's eyes when she is offering john his first taste of intimacy in a long time other times the actors and especially nicole kidman give this comedy quite expertly a dramatic slant
<START> without doubt beat street is the best film about the breakin scene everything about it is spot on the clothes puma the music and most importantly the dancing the storyline is basic but hey whats there to tell a story about the whole point of the film is to show what kids of that moment in time were doing what mattered to them it shows that teenagers in general are good all that mattered to these everyday kids was music dancing and friendship having watched the dvd recently i was plesantly surprised how well it had stood the test of time the clothes didn't look dated possibly because puma is now having a massive comeback the music still sounds fresh and the dancing is still captivating to watch a film anyone 10 25 years of age should see as part of their youth culture
<START> shakespeare's the tempest is a model for this exceptional science fiction film we look for differences prospero and his daughter miranda are stranded on a mediterranean island morbius and altaira are marooned on the 4th planet circling the star altair ariel is a spirit robby the robot is a man made servant caliban's evil hardly approaches that of monsters of the id shakespeare spares prospero morbius dies when altair 4 blows up the tempest is a comedy forbidden planet is a tragedy we wonder if mankind must suffer the fate of the krell in some future time anne francis is altaira jack kelly is lieutentant farman kelly starred with james garner in the comedy western tv series maverick
<START> i loved this movie you have to respect midgets that dressed up like tiny martians sure the story may have been thin at times but you can't take away from the way it was done i used to watch this over and over again when i was 8 its a kids movie and besides it has some of the greatest quotes ever blanzee's home on the range rendition is awesome br br very well done if you ask me 8 of 10
<START> thanks to some infamous home video distributor who brought in the so called german independent series four for venice is not only awful but really awful so awful that i have it dumped at the second hand goods store for extra cash br br nick and charlotte is a married couple who reached an agreement of having sex only on tuesday due to their hectic schedule of their profession eva and luis is a pair of couple living from hand to mouth where eva works as a waitress and luis an artist nick indirectly causes eva to lose her job as an waitress luis and charlotte had an affair at the back of eva and nick luis cheated on eva by lying to her that he would be flying off to london to do something related to his artwork but the fact is he is flying off to venice with charlotte for an adultery holiday eva kidnapped nick and dragged her 2 kids along to venice for confrontation the trip to venice ends up both nick and eva falling for one another br br the presentation of the journey from germany to venice between nick and eva marks the failure of the comedy it not only look senseless but also draggy in the film nick try to seek help for several ways but it ends to no avail it is either the strangers around him who acts like morons or they are just simply dumb br br the comedy also had the tendency to add in unnecessary scenes to lengthen the story while some of the problems that can be solved with common sense no one in the film are using common sense to solve the problem they prefer to go through one big round to solve the problem br br it fails so bad that even the beautiful sceneries in venice fails to pull up the reputation of the film
<START> amelia and michael are a married couple that are cheating on each other amelia has a long time lover in the hospital and michael hires a prostitute that doesn't satisfy him the two smolder with their infidelity but manage to connect to each other in the end br br there's not a whole lot to this particular short the direction is straight forward and dramatic which is good the acting is sincere but the story leaves a little bit to be desired why exactly do we care about these two people it's a little hard to see how this story sticks out from any other infidelity story except that it's much more pared down and doesn't search for meaning in it a welcoming change of pace if anything br br i don't know it's possible i don't connect to these stories because i've never experienced them but i have noticed that the blocking in these narratives are typically the same i e a couple talking together while avoiding eye contact by pretending to be immersed in magazines etc the nice things about short films is that they provide a bit more room for trying something different and i'd like to see a different take br br polarisdib
<START> in fact it's basically the same movie and they couldn't even get the time line of events correct maybe that was intentional due to laziness or not caring either way this thing is a real woofer it doesn't even deserved to be called a movie i viewed this as a so called second feature on the disc containing the original the boogeyman i thought my head would explode and i urge you to run as far in the opposite direction of this thing if you should be cursed with the misfortune of combing across it's path it should come with a warning label like warning may cause your i q to drop several points if you are within it's vicinity for me there's no doubt this thing is a 0 10
<START> i love this freekin movie walsh is a true master of the cinematic form his film have been sometimes in my opinion overlooked but this film is a favourite of mine because it really gives you the feel of the time the film was set in br br all the wonderful characters that existed the lifestyle the mode of dress the way they spoke ok they might be exaggerated but it is good to know that there were occasion when two men tried to outdo each other with insane stunts br br i just felt it was apiece of history thats should be wathced by many people and appreciated because of that fact br br can i get it somewhere on dvd i have only seen it on tv but for anyone wanting a slice of life movie about that period of time this is the perfect one
<START> this is an extremely dense somber and complicated film that unravels quite slowly revealing excruciating detail like the attention paid in a novel and watching this film is like watching a novel unfold while i didn't care for the narrator as i felt he was out of balance with the rest of the performances this film features some of the best ensemble acting i have ever seen and the lead summer phoenix is fabulous her innocence and naivete some might find implausible sort of a cross between cinderella and alice in wonderland i can buy that critique but she's still fabulous partially because she's unlike anything i've ever seen before br br this film is unbelievably beautiful filmed by eric gautier and part of what is so unique about this film is how it doesn't ever show what you'd expect it's always surprising and despite it's length the film never reveals more than it needs to at 163 minutes it's extremely concise to a fault i'd say which is one of the wonders of this film it's filled with brief moments which are simply stunning some of the best you're likely to see all year and all these moments add up in the end to an extraordinary film experience the family moments are unique ian holm is brilliant and what this film has to say about the theater hasn't been seen in films since cassavetes' opening night or perhaps chaplin's limelight but believe it or not this film is much less conventional i never knew where this film was going and now having seen it it still has multiple possibilities this is a powerful incredibly provocative film
<START> i think that the shots and lighting were very poor when i watched it for the first time i thought it was the old version 1956 when i really found out the true year of the film i was shocked i didn't know that there could be such a bad film made so recently thats really all i wanted to say this film had a good plot though nothing you couldn't miss out on if you would simply read the novel that george orwelll wrote all i really want to say has already been said except for this i can't believe that this film could have possibly received so many awards and nominations i gave this film a one awful because i felt that it was very badly made well that is all so long
<START> an interesting idea involving an alternative dimension inside a hospital it recalled stephen kings langoliers kingdom hospital and old twilight zone episodes atmospherically strong the set up was great there were also some very clever 'time loop' moments which always have that head melt appeal the story had plenty of vague references which led me to believe that all the ensuing weirdness of time slips ghosts a weird bat winged demon and a rather silly heavy metal attired ghoul thing would be explained and that was were dark floors severely let me down based on my viewing the movie gives no explanation as to what is behind the events whilst some ambiguity is always expected welcome in these kind of films dark floors took it to new heights of vagueness i don't expect things wrapped up in a pretty ribbon but neither should i be left feeling huh is that it did i dose off maybe i hit chapter skip by mistake dark floors left me with a deeply unsatisfying suspicion that it was all a dream which is a shame because up until the last reel i was very much on board and enjoying the movie
<START> when you go at an open air cinema under the greek summer night you usually don't care what the movie is edison started really good with some good effort from the singers who want to be actors and a once again great morgan freeman but in a movie there is usually a good start to catch audience done a bit boring yet story filling middle of the movie that is more about characters and less about action done and the third part is something really good so that you can remember the movie when you see 30 elite police officers packed with weapons that can demolish a building shoot at a guy behind a car fail to hit him even once while he kills all but 3 and then the guy takes out a flame thrower to kill the rest 3 you realise that the greek summer sky filled with stars is way too good to be distracted by a movie like this
