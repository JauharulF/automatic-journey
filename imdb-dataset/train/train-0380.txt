<START> the road rovers was a great show about canine superheroes chosen by the master to fight crime around the world the show was hilarious to say the least simple and complex jokes that could appeal to all ages running jokes throughout the series that could spawn a drinking game the action was mesmerizing and cleverly set up the characters were very original each with a very different personality but what made me enjoy the show the most was the depth of the characters each of them have struggles and emotional difficulties that are never expressed but implied in subtext hopefully one day there'll be some way to watch the rovers in action again
<START> 1st the good news the 3 d is spectacularly well done and they don't go for the gotcha gimmicks the film is based on the true story of the high point in human history and even features one of the actual participants in that story buzz aldrin br br and now the meat of the matter it's about flies for krissakes flies with big googy human eyes true but flies nonetheless remember when i likened the underworld movies to rats vs cockroaches that wasn't intended as praise and i never dreamed anyone would take it literally this one's got even less empathy going for it baby maggots ugh in one of those odd confluences of hollywood groupthink this flik was evidently on the drawing boards at the same time as space chimps also about critters in space br br go rent apollo 13 and see a 9 rated movie about the real space program rip
<START> by far the most important requirement for any film following confidence tricksters is that they must at least occasionally be able to pull one over on us as well as their dumb witted marks the cops the mob and ideally each other but this film never pulls this off every scam can be seen coming a mile off especially the biggen neither are they very interesting intricate or sophisticated perhaps mammet hoped to compensate for this with snappy dialogue and complex psychological relationships if so he failed the lines are alright but they're delivered in such a stilted unnatural stylised way that i thought perhaps some clever point was being made about us all acting all the time but it wasn't as for the psychological complexity the main character's a bit repressed and makes some ridiculously forced freudian slips about her father thinking she's a whore but she gets over it i really liked the street scenes though looked just like an edward hopper painting
<START> acting is horrible this film makes fast and furious look like an academy award winning film they throw a few boobs and butts in there to try and keep you interested despite the extremely weak and far fetched story there is a reason why people on the internet aren't even downloading this movie this movie sunk like an iron turd do not waste your time renting or even downloading it this film is and always will be a perma turd i am now dumber for having watched it in fact this title should be referred to as a perma turd from now on calling it a film is a travesty and insult abhorrent abominable appalling awful beastly cruel detestable disagreeable disgusting dreadful eerie execrable fairy fearful frightful ghastly grim grisly gruesome heinous hideous horrendous horrid loathsome lousy lurid mean nasty obnoxious offensive repellent repulsive revolting scandalous scary shameful shocking sickie terrible terrifying ungodly unholy unkind
<START> the next to last episode aired of the original star trek series is an interesting sometimes melancholy installment that proves the show was still exploring its characters even at this point in the third season though flawed 'all our yesterdays' has its moments and overall a moody compelling feel to it kirk spock and mccoy beam down to a planet assuming they are arriving in the nick of time to save or at least give some warning to whatever populace is there since the planet's sun is due to explode within hours but as it turns out the people there are all too aware of the planet's fate and using a kind of time travel device have escaped into the past each person has been able to choose the time and place in the past where he or she would like to live at a 'library ' run by an elderly man named mr atoz atoz assumes the three men are looking for a past to live in as well and shows them various periods from which they can choose on viewers there is some rather forced confusion at the start of the episode with lines like br br mccoy where did they go atoz wherever they wanted to br br the misunderstanding could be cleared up rather easily but for plot purposes it isn't and soon kirk finds himself transported back to a period resembling 18th century england while spock and mccoy are sent to an ice age 5000 years in the planet's past from here the main focus is on spock and his relationship with a woman exiled to this time by a tyrant as punishment spock begins acting increasingly emotional showing anger toward mccoy and deep affection for zarabeth the woman he eventually realizes that he is reverting back to the primitive emotional state of his ancestors on vulcan 5000 years ago kirk makes his way back to the library first and finally convinces mr atoz they don't belong in his planet's history spock and mccoy return just before it's too late leaving zarabeth behind the enterprise beams the three up and speeds away as the sun explodes destroying the planet the interaction between spock and zarabeth provides this episode's most memorable moments though kirk's adventure into the 'english' past is amusing all in all a very decent latter day star trek outing
<START> i remember originally seeing this film at radio city music hall when it came out i didn't really understand the humor back then but this movie can make me laugh out loud br br with all due respect to george burns rip walter matthau really deserved the oscar for this film his performance is amazing given the fact that he was 20 years younger than his character willie clark his mannerisms are first rate you know what kind of songs he wrote sh t and when speaking to the spanish speaking guy at the front desk no no no enchilada absolutely hilarious br br kudos to richard benjamin who played straight man to matthau br br i just wish this was on dvd because my vhs recording is getting a bit old br br i had no interest in seeing the remake with woody allen because in no way can it match the original
<START> after watching the first 20mn of blanche sorry i couldn't take more of it i have now confirmed she does not br br basically this movie is an insult to the real french actors participating in this farcical piece of junk it starts from a concept successfully used in french comedies deux heures moins le quart avant jesus christ la folie des grandeurs a historical movie with anachronic tone dialogues this can give brilliant results if supported by brilliant actors and a finesse of direction avoiding the dreaded heavy comedy stigma br br unfortunately the horsey faced lou doillon ruins everything and blanche instead of a comedy just turns into an horror movie horror to cinephiles who want to be puzzled and shocked watching fine actors such as decaune zem or rochefort struggling in the middle of this gaudy burlesque kitchy prissy farce
<START> thought at first this film would be your typical western film however it turned out to be very interesting and kept me spellbound right to the very end which turned out very unusual charlton heston sam burgade midway '76 had past experiences with james coburn zach provo deadfall '93 and zach never forgave sam and would stop at nothing to make sure he caught up with him and paid him back unfortunately barbara hershey susan burgade the portrait of a lady '96 managed to get caught up in this situation and found herself among sex starved men who never seemed to leave her alone sam burgade had to make some very hard decisions and and i was quite surprised at the conclusion this is a very entertaining film and the acting was outstanding
<START> raising victor vargas a review br br you know raising victor vargas is like sticking your hands into a big steaming bowl of oatmeal it's warm and gooey but you're not sure if it feels right try as i might no matter how warm and gooey raising victor vargas became i was always aware that something didn't quite feel right victor vargas suffers from a certain overconfidence on the director's part apparently the director thought that the ethnic backdrop of a latino family on the lower east side and an idyllic storyline would make the film critic proof he was right but it didn't fool me raising victor vargas is the story about a seventeen year old boy called you guessed it victor vargas victor rasuk who lives his teenage years chasing more skirt than the rolling stones could do in all the years they've toured the movie starts off in ugly fat' donna's bedroom where victor is sure to seduce her but a cry from outside disrupts his plans when his best friend harold kevin rivera comes a looking for him caught in the attempt by harold and his sister victor vargas runs off for damage control yet even with the embarrassing implication that he's been boffing the homeliest girl in the neighborhood nothing dissuades young victor from going off on the hunt for more fresh meat on a hot new york city day they make way to the local public swimming pool where victor's eyes catch a glimpse of the lovely young nymph judy judy marte who's not just pretty but a strong and independent too the relationship that develops between victor and judy becomes the focus of the film the story also focuses on victor's family that is comprised of his grandmother or abuelita altagracia guzman his brother nino also played by real life brother to victor silvestre rasuk and his sister vicky krystal rodriguez the action follows victor between scenes with judy and scenes with his family victor tries to cope with being an oversexed pimp daddy his feelings for judy and his grandmother's conservative catholic upbringing br br the problems that arise from raising victor vargas are a few but glaring errors throughout the film you get to know certain characters like vicky nino grandma judy and even judy's best friend melonie the problem is we know nothing of victor vargas except that he is the biggest gigolo in the neighborhood we know that he knows how to lick his lips and comb his fro and carry himself for the sake of wooing girls into the sack but that's all we know that nino plays piano and quiet well you could see it by the awards on the family piano we know his sister nicki is a gossip loving girl with an invested interest in watching tv we know that grandma is a hard working traditional latina woman who's trying to raise her kids with conservatively in a world of excess corruption yet where is the titular character victor vargas he's in this movie somewhere but we only know what the movie tells us this is by far the film's biggest flaw victor vargas isn't so much a character but a ping pong ball bouncing between scenes with judy and his grandmother but we never get to know who victor vargas really is this is important because as i've mentioned the only thing we know of victor vargas is that he's a sexually active teenager with a libido the size of manhattan he's a total alpha male victor vargas is not the kind of character i sympathize with at all why should anyone so by the end of the movie in the aftermath of the climax are we truly led to believe that somehow victor vargas has attained any depth and learned the errors of his ways how could such a two dimensional character have any depth if only the director had worried a little more about fleshing out his main character instead of worrying about getting that perfect hand held shot br br raising victor vargas brings to life the world of the latino inner city neighborhood to the big screen something that few films have done before in the past the film has been complimented for feeling so real and i won't br br argue with that i haven't seen this level of reality since cbs aired survivor seriously although the movie has some nice shots of the city the writer director peter sollett was way too dependent on close ups and hand held shots this problem is particularly noticed in indoor scenes that are so claustrophobic i was forced to perform deep breathing exercises to keep from passing out as the film continues the shots get tighter and tighter with faces cropped from brow to chin on the screen you can practically smell victor vargas's cheap cologne the overall effect is unrealistic in contrast the indoor scenes of inner city apartments make them look small and cramp which is not true i've been in those type apartments i used to live in one they're not splendorous but they have high ceilings and they're decent living spaces by the movie's standards you'd think that these apartments were 5x5 cells of brick and mortar chipped paint and cracked walls unfortunately sollett's constant use of close ups and one particularly bad shot with a zoom in on one scene come off as totally amateurish but raising victor vargas is only sollett's second film and his most well known a solid effort in filmmaking that will hopefully get better as he continues to make films one review i read summarized the movie as ethnicity for ethnicity's sake ' and i cannot agree more if victor vargas were truly a great film and story then the characters' applicability wouldn't matter whether they were latino chinese etc yet if you were to take this story and stick it in middle class suburbia with a bunch of teeny bopper white kids the results wouldn't be such glowing reviews and we'd see the film's flaws more clearly indeed some other aspects of the use of latinos in this film bother me while some aspects of victor vargas are accurate others i have to question for example victor nino and vicky all share the same room to sleep this set off an alarm for me because it seemed contrary to what i believe any self respecting latino family wouldn't have two older brothers sharing the same room with a thirteen year old girl at first i was unsure perhaps i was wrong but after speaking with my grandmother i knew my problem with this was justified considering how conservative the grandmother is you'd think that vicky would have been sleeping in her room br br as a latino who grew up in a somewhat conservative cuban household raised by my grandmother while my mother was working full time i could relate to the movie in many ways which is why my critical viewpoints are bittersweet because i really wanted to love this movie unfortunately my lack of respect for victor vargas sabotaged my feelings for the film maybe it's because victor vargas reminds me of those guys who were getting laid while i was playing with my sega genesis when i was seventeen maybe it's because without any further introspection by the film victor vargas is merely a stereotypical hot blooded latino who'll just end up shouting to girls from his car hey bay bee ju want to get into my luv mah cheen ' either way i don't like him so ultimately how can i like a film about him so if you'll excuse me i'm going to go stick my hands into a bowl of grits br br
<START> given its time of release the story that unravels in 1950 thriller 'panic in the streets' was hardly a surprise the corpse of a mysterious illegal immigrant is found and passed off as a nobody until further examination from a public health inspector who claims the corpse carries a strain of bubonic plague yet with the current drama in the world today this strangely helps this film in appearing credible for today's viewers the cast and crew are flawless richard widmark in his first role following his breakthrough performance in 'night and the city ' jack palance in his chilling film debut also starring in this film are paul douglas and a young and rather cute barbara bel geddes a whole slew of uncredited non professional actors typical of director kazan fill in the remaining slots elia kazan directs joe macdonald films he would later work with richard widmark again in 1953's much superior 'pickup on south street' and the great alfred newman scores it nearly everyone involved here has done better work 'panic in the streets' is quite the rewarding watch nonetheless especially for the film noir enthusiast
<START> having grown up in texas and less than 15 miles from what used to be gilley's i can tell you that this movie is nauseating the majority of texans do not live like this movie indicates the plot is weak and the fake accents are amusing and it reinforces the stereotypical image that all texans are beer drinking honky tonkin' rednecks the horribly fake texas accents is what kills it for me true there is a certain texas twang to most texans' accents but these people overdo it you can't get someone from new jersey and ohio to do texas accents it just doesn't work john travolta should have stuck to disco dancing or the 50s debra winger was more convincing as wonder girl than she is as a texan
<START> definitely spoilers in this review i adore american gothic and have done since i first saw it late at night when it first aired on ch4 in the uk when i was 14 the comparisons made to stephen king are just about right it's small town supernatural eeriness but with fantastic layered characters best of all and the reason i love it so much is it had the guts to never be black and white lucas buck though lacking any conscience often works by as he says giving people enough rope to hang themselves with his manipulation only works because of other people's weak morals caleb though generally a thoughtful kind insightful boy can at times show the latent dark side inherited from his father none of the characters are wholly good or bad with even the angelic merlyn showing a wrathful side through reckless vengeance in the plague sower not only that but having gail the closest thing to a mother figure for caleb not only sleep with but fall in love with lucas despite all she knows made me realise this show would just go there and not apologise for it i'm a huge buffy fan but when that show tried to go really 'dark' in later seasons it failed miserably because it lost it's humorous side and didn't commit fully to its ideas ag shows that you can have a morally bankrupt character right at the heart of the show and still have a hell of laugh doing it br br i can't even think about why it was cancelled as i'll just get too angry at the ridiculousness of it all so much rubbish on tv and good original shows get kicked around and stamped on thanks to the emergence of dvd at least i can see the show in it's entirety yes some of the visuals look dated now but the creepy strange atmosphere is provided well enough by the story lines the actors also all give such perfect performances that it more than makes up for some odd camera work br br the only reason why i think someone may not like this show is that it isn't like the x files where there are cases to 'solve' or lost where there's huge unanswered questions it's pretty obvious from the get go that lucas buck has some kind of evil powers and that the show is all about fighting for caleb's soul so this show might frustrate people looking for a purpose or an unknown 'truth' to find yes there are some mysterious unanswered aspects with some such as the truth about gails parents getting resolved but unlike lost and x files this show isn't about trying to find out more 'facts' about what's going on imo it's all about the characters and the way they have to confront moral choices in the twisted world of trinity personally i would just get such a kick out of seeing lucas turn every situation to his advantage br br all in all the main thing i have to say is check it out i'm pretty certain most fantasy horror fans will love it also even though it got cancelled all characters have arcs and there is enough in the finale to give some small sense of closure the only hanging thread i felt was dr matt having him not be in the final episodes is strange br br i would have done anything for a second season but at least the full 22 episodes exist and perhaps given how brainless some tv execs appear to be i should be glad this wonderful show got made at all
<START> from the creators of shrekÂÂÂÂ ok that grabbed my attention br br well the creators of shrek also made madagascar madagascar was half as good as shrek br br and now flushed away is half as good as madagascar br br that means flushed away isn't good the animation and all that special effects were extremely good but the movie wasn't br br the story of this movie was only meant for kids it's seriously not possible for adults to actually love this flick br br but there were many jokes meant for adults i bet kids dint understand the jokes br br despite that i dint like this flick br br i am completely disappointed 4 10
<START> i tuned into this thing one night on a cable channel a few minutes after the credits ran so i didn't know who had done it at first the longer i saw it the more i started thinking jesus this looks like an albert pyun flick wasn't quite sure though for two main reasons the photography was quite good and the utah desert scenery was beautiful and scott paulin gave an hilarious performance as simon a murderous cyborg but with some style and a sense of humor paulin must have ad libbed the many clever one liners he shot out because albert pyun hasn't written anything even remotely funny or coherent in his career unfortunately paulin doesn't have all that much screen time before he's gone and the movie's the worse for it lance henriksen playing the evil head cyborg growls his way through his part as he's done in countless other movies like this i don't know what the hell kris kristofferson is doing in this thing maybe he wanted to see what the utah desert looked like and get paid for it he goes through the movie looking and sounding like he just woke up and in fact spends most of the last half of the movie on his back in a tent kathy long the nominal hero has a great body is attractive has a great body fights extremely well has a great body and doesn't have an iota of acting talent but that doesn't matter in a movie like this this being an albert pyun film it's full of the trademarks that we've all come to know and love inane and idiotic dialog choppy editing and the impression that they lost a reel in the middle of the picture and figured ah nobody'll ever notice br br as bad as this movie is however it's a shade above most of pyun's other efforts this is citizen kane compared to his brain numbing adrenaline feel the rush for example the fights are pretty well done if repetitive after she knocks down eight or nine guys one after the other you find yourself saying alright already go to something else and long is very athletic and as a previous poster has noted has a great derriÃ¨re it's not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination but it's not anywhere near as incoherent and incompetent as pyun's usual extravaganzas you could do worse than rent this movie not much worse granted but worse nonetheless
<START> i don't know how or why this film has a meager rating on imdb this film accompanied by i am curious blue is a masterwork br br the only thing that will let you down in this film is if you don't like the process of film don't like psychology or if you were expecting hardcore pornographic ramming br br this isn't a film that you will want to watch to unwind it's a film that you want to see like any other masterpiece with time attention and care br br summaries may contain a spoiler or two br br the main thing about this film is that it blends the whole film within a film thing but it does it in such a way that sometimes you forget that the fictions aren't real br br the film is like many films in one br br 1 a political documentary about the social system in sweden at the time which in a lot of ways are still relevant to today interviews done by a young woman named lena br br 2 a narrative about a filmmaker vilgot sjoman making a film he deals with a relationship with his star in the film and how he should have never got involved with people he's supposed to work with br br 3 the film that vilgot is making it's about a young woman named lena ie 2 who is young and very politically active she is making a documentary ie 1 she is also a coming of age and into her sexuality and the freedom of that br br the magnificence and sheer brilliance of i am curious yellow blue is how these three elements are cut together in one moment you are watching an interview about politics and the next your watching what the interviewer is doing behind the scenes but does that so well that you sometimes forget that it is the narrative br br another thing is the dynamic between yellow and blue which if you see one you must see the other blue is not a sequel at all i'll try to explain it best i can because to my knowledge no other films have done it though it is a great technique br br think of yellow as a living thing actual events in 14 scenes a complete tale br br think of blue as all the things in between the 14 scenes in yellow that you didn't see that is a complete tale on it's own br br essentially they are parallel films the same story told in two different ways br br it wasn't until i saw the first 30 minutes of blue that i fully understood yellow br br i hope this was helpful for people who are being discouraged by various influences because this film changed the way i looked at film br br thanks for your time
<START> i had read many good things about this adaptation of my favorite novel so invariably my expectations were crushed but they were crushed more than should be expected the movie would have been a decent movie if i had not read the novel beforehand which perhaps ruined it for me br br in any event for some reason they changed the labor camp at toulon to a ship full of galley slaves the scene at bishop myriel's was fine in fact other than the galleys things survived up until the dismissal of fantine because we do not want to have bad things happen to a good woman she does not cut her hair sell her teeth or become a prostitute the worst she does is run into the mayor's office and spit on his face bamatabois is entirely eliminated because having children out of wedlock should also not be talked about tholomyes is fantine's dead husband rather than an irresponsible dandy valjean is able to fetch cosette for fantine before the champmathieu affair so they reunite happily yet another change then comes the convent which is a pretty difficult scene to screw up thankfully it was saved after this three minutes of accuracy however the movie again begins to hurtle towards classic novel butchering br br as cosette and valjean are riding through the park they come across marius giving a speech at a meeting about prison reform when he comes to hand out fliers to valjean and cosette he says the one line in the movie that set me screaming at the tv set we aren't revolutionaries i could hear victor hugo thrashing in his grave of course they are revolutionaries they want to revolt against the pseudo monarchy that is in place in favor of another republic you dumb screenwriters it's a historical fact that there was an insurrection against the government in 1832 br br at one point cosette goes to give marius a donation from her father for the reform movement and meets eponine except not eponine or at least not the eponine of the book this eponine appears to be a well to do secretary girl working for the prison reformers who are working out of the cafe universal as opposed to the cafe musain not to mention the audience is already made to dislike her thanks to her not period low cut tight fitting dress and her snooty mannerisms br br the prison reformers lead by the most poorly cast enjolras that i have ever seen decide that handing out pamphlets isn't good enough anymore so they're going to build barricades i don't know about you but i have never heard of reform movements tearing up the streets and building barricades and attacking government troops about three hundred people it was not supposed to be so many start attacking the national guard and building a bunch of barricades etc eponine does die for marius thankfully br br the rest of the movie is sort of accurate except that javert's suicide again seems hard to understand thanks to his minuscule screen time and odd character interpretation the movie ends with valjean watching javert jump into the river this is again inaccurate because valjean would never have let javert drown he saved the man's life earlier why let him die now then there's the whole skipping of valjean's confession to marius his deterioration and his redemption on his deathbed with marius and cosette by his side br br overall i can blame the script mostly for the problems while i am glad enjolras and eponine were at least present in the film they were terribly misinterpreted as was the entire barricade scene the elimination of fantine's suffering prevents us from feeling too much pity for her that cosette knows valjean's past from the start messes with the plot a good deal i did not even see thenardier and mme thenardier only had a few seconds of screen time the same with gavroche i did like frederich march's interpretation of valjean a lot however which was one of the redeeming features of the movie on the other hand charles laughton for all his great acting in other movies seems to have missed the mark with javert the lip tremble the unnecessary shouting and his acting in general all just felt very wrong he also like many javerts i have seen did not appear at all menacing something required of the character br br again this film would probably feel much better if i had not read the book i would not recommend it to book purists though i would also say that the movie would have been a good adaptation for the time had not the infamously accurate french version come out the year before
<START> why oh why can't anyone make a decent film out of a legendary tale this is the second adaptation of beowulf i've been disappointed with in a year but i have to say the previous version beowulf grendel starring gerald butler was far superior to this that one was only a little disappointing this one is a mess br br what bugged me most was it the useless plot elements they added in for no particular reason human sacrifices pointless love interest or the bad cgi or the inconsistency of the characters or the uninspired acting even worse was the way they made beautiful marina sirtis look so horrible and lets not even talk about that ridiculous crossbow br br and why did they continually remind us that beowulf had the strength of 30 men and yet he never showed the slightest sign of such strength throughout the entire film he was tossed around by both monsters he fought relying on his sidekicks to save his bacon even when he slugged the arrogant prince he didn't knock him out he was much too reliant on weapons beo wimp is more like it this was certainly not the powerful beowulf of the epic poem br br i'd like to end this on a positive note but i can't really think of one offhand all i can say is if you've ever read beowulf you'll be infinitely disappointed by this dismal inaccurate excuse for an adaptation
<START> 1st watched 11 07 2004 1 out of 10 dir jon keeyes over the top rehash of 70's supposed horror flicks like friday the 13th versions 1 thru whateverÂ i can't think of much redeeming here except or can i think of anything Âthe story revolves around a bunch of stupid people listening to a radio program one year after some kids were slayed in the woods as an 'homage' to this supposedly but lo and behold one of the stupid people have connections to the actual event because her sister was one of the ones murdered again how stupid is this that she would even be a part of this guess what the murderer is at it again and we're tipped off from the very beginning who it is so there goes any mystery whatsoever and besides all this where are the 'cops' and why doesn't someone call them i can't believe this movie was financed by someone and made you would think that by now the american people would be judged a little higher at least in their movie going experience but not so by this filmmaker
<START> 3 in young john travolta's trilogy of blockbusters he dances to disco rock 'n' roll and country he heads to houston to find work and love gilley's is the hot spot and it is the time of the mechanical bull not to be outdone i rode the bull at a club in nashville i recently saw this nearly forgotten film on television and remembered how good it was and how good a year 1980 was i wore a black cowboy hat that year just like travolta debra winger was in her prime she looks stunning in her red top there is plenty of charisma bud and sissy seem the ideal couple even if they are trailer trash they split up just because it feels so good getting back together urban cowboy has an amazing soundtrack we get to hear lyin' eyes by the eagles and lookin' for love by johnny lee
<START> br br when i first started watching this movie last night on cinemax i was shocked that it had been made cruel intentions in my opinion was one of the best teen oriented films made in years this prequel had certain things incongruent with the original sebastian's father married into wealth then why does he have a rich aunt on long island br br then i found out today that it was not really intended to be a new movie but rather a television series manchester prep after hearing that it made sense to me that it wasn't the same as the movie just as buffy the vampire slayer is different in tv form br br i think that roger kumble most likely added the ending that this movie had after the series wasn't picked up by fox it just seems like something that would happen too fast sebastian becoming the male version of katharyn and i just don't know where they would go with the next episode since it wouldn't be leading to the 1999 film which the newer ending is directed right towards br br one thing i didn't like was that it suggested sebastian and his father had married into the wealth which isn't typically looked good upon in this area of new york and sine katharyn's mother was just an adult version of her it didn't seem like something a woman in her position would do marry a man not of her social class br br as a prequel this is fairly lame but i would have been interested to see where this had gone as a series
