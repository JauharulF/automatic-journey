<START> this 1981 comedy still sparkles thanks to the combined efforts of writer director steve gordon and stars dudley moore and john gielgud sadly gordon only in his early forties died soon after completing this his only feature film it's an especially unfortunate loss since he shows a truly deft hand at character driven farce that makes the whole film irresistible it plays almost like a 1930's style screwball comedy revamped for contemporary tastes the plot centers on arthur bach a drunken diminutive millionaire playboy who is at risk of losing his 750 million inheritance if he doesn't marry the dowdy and boring susan johnson an heiress handpicked by his old money father and dotty grandmother of course he doesn't love her and by chance runs into linda marolla a working class waitress and of course aspiring actress after she pilfers a bergdorf goodman tie for her father br br the standard complications ensue but in a most endearing way with loads of alcohol fueled slapstick executed with classic Ã©lan by moore that he makes such a spoiled character likable is a credit not only to his comic talents but to gielgud's feisty acidic turn as hobson arthur's devoted but reality grounded valet it's the type of role he could play in his sleep but gielgud makes hobson such a truly memorable character that his fate in the film brings a welcome injection of poignancy in the proceedings in probably her most likable film role liza minnelli hands the picture to her male co stars by toning down her usual razzle dazzle personality and making linda quite genuine in motivation br br a pre la law jill eikenberry plays susan just at the right passive aggressive note while barney martin jerry's dad on seinfeld steals all his scenes as linda's slovenly father ralph the one fly in the ointment is veteran actress geraldine fitzgerald who overdoes the eccentricities of the grandmother and i have to admit that i still can't stand the very dated overplayed christopher cross song that inevitably won the oscar for that year's best song unfortunately the 1997 dvd certainly in need of remastering has no extras worth noting except some photos and production notes
<START> i'm gonna tip the scales here a bit and say i enjoyed this however the cartoon is really only going to appeal to those who have very absurdist tendencies it's definitely something that most people will not get as is the nature of absurdism br br the animation is horrible but yes that's the point the main character is foul mouthed violent and stupid no redeeming qualities whatsoever his wife shrieks and wails apparently just barely capable of the most basic communication skills most of these stories completely lack any kind of point br br but again that's the point br br if non sequiters foul language and complete and utter randomness are your thing you're going to love this br br it is really short so i would probably rent instead of buying
<START> first off let's start with the negative points 1 there are huge gaping wholes in the story line and questions that are raised that will get no where near being answered 2 the movie is not for all people so impolite viewers will get restless and start yapping during the movie br br point two above is important because the movie is very quiet in an older type theater like the one i went to you can hear the reel going through the projector at times i loved that the movie does not keep you busy with music nor effects it lets you reflect upon what is happening br br there is a lack of rhythm that generates an atmosphere that is fascinating an utterly enjoyable the same kind of atmosphere generated by stanley kubrick in eyes wide shut not for all people br br i would highly recommend it to fans of cinema as the cinematographic work is amazing those that base their appreciation of a movie solely on the story will be utterly disappointed it's the kind of story that you have to make up the links in your mind afterwards my version of it is pretty darn cool but probably quite off track if you do go catch the movie there is one very cool part when the two cops are talking to each other on their cell phones an ultra cool sound effect that really puts you in the moment hats off to the person that thought of doing this
<START> spoken like a true hard boiled u'an gangsta the story is no worse than any number of gangster flicks but never ever confuse this movie with the godfather i or ii or goodfellas it is not in the same league br br but what makes the film periodically painful to watch is all these italian americans swaggering around dropping bad gangsta lines in an even worse fake u'an accent pacino would have been great if they could just have dubbed him i was looking forward to see abrahams and loggia but their steenky accents spoiled the fun br br ah well the script ain't too hot either don corleone would have made this disappear five minutes after meeting him smiling and patting him on the back all the while
<START> i have always been interested in anything about bigfoot so when i was browsing around looking for a movie to rent this one caught my eye it was the worst 4 50 i've ever spent and i want my money back please don't waste your money on this this was one of the cheapest movies i've ever seen the entire movie was so incredibly boring and i found myself rolling my eyes a lot and i didn't even watch it all the way through i just got fed up with it the acting was horrible the effects were horrible everything was just really bad and tasteless it all added up to be a really bad boring movie and total waste of time and money i hope that one day they'll make a good movie about sasquatch but until then i'll have to sit through countless cheap duds like this one to find the real masterpiece
<START> the year is 1896 jeff webster james stewart doesn't like people there's only one friend he's got and he's ben tatum walter brennan an old sympathetic man they're driving a cattle herd with them that would be their key to richness in skagway they run into trouble when sheriff gannon john mcintire takes the cattle now jeff only has to get it back and drive it through the u s canadian border to dawson now they have a group of other people with them like the ladies ronda castle ruth roman and renee vallon corinne calvet there the two men get into the gold business anthony mann's and james stewart's fourth collaboration the far country 1954 is a fine western indeed the acting work is superb walter brennan makes a terrific sidekick to stewart ruth roman is brilliant and corinne calvet's delightful jay c flippen is very good as dawson marshal rube morris the great jack elam and kathleen freeman are seen in smaller roles it's fantastic to watch how jimmy stewart overcome's all the troubles in his way there's just the man and his rifle but also he's vulnerable
<START> a small town is attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty vampires the only hope is a lone avenger and a group of ragtag survivors br br released in 1993 darkness garnered something of a cult following upon release it's easy to see why it's loaded and i mean freaking loaded with gore and it's energy and enthusiasm like that found in other no budget cult horror flicks like the dead next door and the children of ravensback is actually rather infectious br br while that may be true that's sadly not enough to save it the film was shot on a super 8 so the image is grainy and dark making things very difficult to see it would have been great if it had obscured the protagonists dreadful mullet also grating is the soundtrack made up of annoying casio keyboard and even more annoying death metal seriously what is it with these no budget horror flicks and bad death metal while one isn't expecting oscar worthy performances the acting is still strictly amateur hour as the actors sometimes seem almost confused instead of frightened or threatened br br in the end i'm sure fans of no budget gorefests will love this everyone else though will wish there was a little more meat on the ribs
<START> love is overwhelming in all it's manifestations gorgeous absolutely gorgeous tudor chirila maria popistasu and ioana barbu one truly dramatic story about love in all it's shapes a story about the undecipherable ways of young hearts about life and lost innocence all directed by the skillful eye of tudor giurgiu with a magnificent soundtrack featuring faultline chris martin and vama veche it surprises in every way leaving behind the sour taste of misunderstanding love truly remarkable is it me or is romanian cinematography slowly but surely advancing and gaining respect this is a brilliant film two thumbs up to everybody involved
<START> this film is wonderful in every way that modern action adventures are not take some time relax enjoy think people who see this movie as slow or plodding or dull really need to take a week off and watch it several times until their short attention span mind comes to grips with the possibility of being involved with a cause or even beautiful story in a beautiful place for no other reason than because it isn't hurrying to make the points you so emphatically need it to make in the short time alloted at first i was apprehensive of brosnan playing a native american given the story line though i think it was apt casting now back to my hermiting jahfre
<START> as with all the other reviewers this movie has been a constant in my mind after 30 years i recall going to the library researching all that i could on this story i even wrote to the pbs station for more information despite all this all i was able to find out was that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early part of the 1900s br br fastward to 2002 after years of searching ebay for on a weekly basis and there it was a vhs copy of the movie there was one other bidder but i was determined to win this movie the losing bidder wrote me asking for a copy which i gave her despite owning a copy i still searched and searched finally finding a site that sold a dvd copy of the movie you can find it at http www johntopping com harvey 20perr war 20widow war widow html
<START> i am amazed at the amount of praise that is heaped on this movie by other commentators to me it was rather a disappointment especially the combination of historical facts fantasy and the main character's internal turmoil does not work at all in vonnegut's book slaughterhouse five and even in george roy hill's adaptation for the screen it does credibility is often overstretched too many questions are left open did i miss some central points or did i fail to spot the lines that supposedly connect the dots br br a boy called campbell jr grows up in upstate new york at home his father has many technical trade papers and one book it has photographs of heaps of dead bodies in it the boy leafs through the book his dad doesn't like his doing that what should this tell me the family moves away from upstate new york to berlin bang it is 1938 the boy is a married man in berlin and a theater playwright what kind of plays does he write in what language is he successful his wife is an actress and looks glamorous the parents move back to the usa and invite their son to do the same he does not why because having grown up in germany he feels more german than american because he is successful because his wife is because he likes his life there because he likes the nazis because he is just plain lazy and doesn't like change don't ask me br br possibly the man just does not care is not interested in politics is a kind of an existentialist he states that he is deeply in love with his wife he speaks of his republic of two meaning he and his wife there is little to no evidence proving his love for his wife in the movie it much more seems a republic of one br br on the request of an american agent campbell jr agrees to broadcast anti semitic nazi hate propaganda to american listeners as a device for transmitting encrypted messages to american authorities who read between the lines the crucial meeting with the agent on a berlin park bench is short unexciting and anti climactic the decision to play along comes pretty easily with no explanation the rise up to broadcaster seems to be uneventful and apparently fast br br so now we have campbell jr presenting himself over the air as the last free american the scheme for transmitting secret messages is fairly realistic and exciting although one wonders what happened when campbell jr really and honestly had to cough hiccup etc must have scrambled the messages terribly anyway the nazis lose the wife dies touring in the crimean for german troops i never heard such tours really happened on german front lines in ww ii campbell jr says he goes to the russian front but does not go is captured by an american soldier who recognizes his mug how come is dragged to a sight seeing tour in auschwitz is then released and resettled with the help of the crucial agent somewhere in the city of new york br br and this is where the story really starts br br bang from now on it is like a short story by paul auster it is 1961 campbell jr lives in new york tenement as a has been and mourns the loss of his wife nobody really cares or do they yes somehow they do and his neighbors offer some sort of distraction auschwitz survivors a painter some american supremacists Âdiscover him and want him to be their figurehead they even find his presumed dead wife for him or is she his wife anyway in the end campbell jr calls in at the israeli consulate and they obligingly give him the big war criminal treatment placing him in the cell adjacent to adolf eichmann's he writes his life story and once this task finished hangs himself on the typewriter's ribbons without getting sooty the least bit br br while i can see that there must be an issue of guilt and of loss i just had the impression that the main character is a person who at all times is pretty indifferent to everything and hardly capable of love for anyone so i found it difficult to sympathize for this looser who mourns his loss amazingly many reviewers focus on his status as a potential war hero having put his reputation at stake for playing the last free american i assume according to them this took a lot of courage as a matter of fact however the movie suggests that by accepting the assignment campbell created for himself a win win situation as he would have been politically on the safe side no matter who had won the war the danger of his being uncovered never comes up during the first part of the story br br one might argue that the whole story is a dreamlike fantasy and that nobody should bother with historical accuracy or a logical development of the story which explains everything but even then it fails to make a point primarily i suspect because the love affair in the republic of two falls completely flat this is a pity especially if you consider that the wife was played by sheryl lee a talented versatile and sensuous actress she has much too little screen time and is forced to use a ridiculous german accent another somehow neglected aspect are the different texts confession broadcast and hidden messages but i guess this is largely unfilmable maybe i should give the book a chance
<START> like watching a neighbor's summer camp home movies indian summer is a sleep inducing bore eight alumni campers are barely introduced when unbelievably boring flashbacks begin for characters we know nothing about fine actors alan arkin and bill paxton are totally wasted in this film one camper's observation that everything seems so much smaller than i remember it is repeated at least ten times enough to make you squirm the anticipated pranks are neither funny or original unless you think that short sheeting is a real howler this movie was a great disappointment considering the ample talent involved indian summer did not make me homesick just sick merk
<START> most horror movies are in fact horrible movies they get to be same ol' same ol' same ol' pack every minute with some cheap thrill usually 'splatter' and nowadays they can pack every second with gaudy special effects one of the goals of a really good horror flick is to suspend the sense of disbelief of the audience for instance i saw both of the recent mummy movies and nearly got dizzy viewing ridiculous special effects every second it probably costs a million dollars per second to make those movies and my sense of disbelief was never suspended it grew roots br br subtlety can be more terrifying less is more br br i first saw 'the woman in black' on the a e channel after flipping through the usual 987 channels of very bad television i stopped to watch it this movie almost has the feel of a 'masterpiece theater' production that was fine with me i've always preferred british tv movies anyway br br most viewers would find this to be too slowly paced but the slow pacing helps give the story credibility the special effects are few which lulls the viewer into thinking that this film is set in the real world thus making us a bit more uneasy the makeup and costume for the ghost are kept simple and believable hollywood would have made her look like a she demon from hell with glowing eyes fangs claws etc hollywood would have done an overkill and turned this idea into a mediocrity br br the woman only makes about five appearances in the film most of them are where she appears in the distance and even that creates a good fright if she appeared too often it could've cheapened the mood that gets set however this movie is so well made that through much of the film we're led into sensing that she is there the whole time but not visible the scene where she 'visits' arthur kidd late at night and we see her just a little too close is a masterpiece in horror br br this is just an extraordinary film that i think should rate as one the finest horror films ever made i have a copy of 'the haunting' 'the changling' and a zillion more i haven't seen anything that tops 'the woman in black' yet although i'm still looking this movie is so well made that it gives even the most hardened skeptic like me a moment where i almost had second thoughts about the non existence of ghosts i joke to people that i occasionally get brief fears that she could appear standing in the middle of the road or that i'd see her staring through my window etc maybe she could be in a crowd at the mall glaring at me with her look of hate this is how a really great horror film should be like a lafanu novel the woman in black very slowly pulls you in and wraps herself around your neck and before you realize it she's squeezing the life out of you and then it's too late br br closest thing i have to a criticism is that this was made for the small screen and it's a terrible shame that this is out of print i just paid over 40 for my second copy of this movie it's a major prize in my collection now i'm on a quest to find an even better horror movie that not only gives the chills but also qualifies a sound drama
<START> that's a problem i have with movies that come on television when there is nothing else to watch i somehow get sucked into really bad movies br br but this one was fairly watchable the concept of being the only ones left on earth after a comet then finding out zombies are around makes me laugh and that's why i gave this movie a 2 instead of 1 the story was stupid but in that way that makes you laugh too stupid funny br br i think i only watched it because the guy from star trek was the lead i was surprised to see him as a younger guy and he was the only funny character anyway
<START> as someone who has read the book i can say that this is vastly inferior to the big american version starring gwyneth paltrow there are various reasons for this firstly emma is too unpleasant yes she has faults and isn't the easiest person to like but the viewer shouldn't downright start to despise her secondly mr knightly is miscast his brooding and melancholy in this version are better suited to a bronte or gaskell adaptation than austen and throw the mood of the whole affair off thirdly samantha morton is too strong an actress to be relegated to the role of harriet and why was she made to look so sickly harriet is supposed to be blonde and blooming not to look as if she's going to be carried off by consumption in the next scene fourthly the structure has been mucked up and scenes cut at the end when emma decides she loves mr knightly it comes across as utterly baffling because this narrative hasn't been adequately shown and carried along throughout the film fifthly what was going on exactly with mrs elton's accent she went from sounding like an american actress trying to suppress her own accent at the beginning to all out american half way through and then back to english at the end finally this dragged at the end the book and the big film version end with the wedding of emma and mr knightly this version drags on confusingly after the announcement of the wedding without actually showing us the ceremony br br all in all a rather haphazard attempt read the book or rent the paltrow version instead
<START> and not in a fun to watch way it's just bad it's shocking that people have posted positive things about it here the story sucks the acting is bad it's not scary the special effects aren't special oh no the blackboard has hands coming out of it oh gee the mirror turned into water the hair clothes and makeup in the '50s scenes aren't accurate and they got a middle aged man with a receding hairline to play the high school version of himself this is like later on nightmare on elm street stuff i enjoy sitting down to watch a cheesy horror movie as much as anyone else but there are better bad ones out there to choose from
<START> some of the acting was a bit suspect i remember that asswipe alexander walker evening standard critic yeah ok he's now dead launched into a rant about this film saying it was a disgrace portraying ni protestants as murderers now with respect to all ni protestants this film was loosely based on the shankill butchers who were loyalists and who roamed belfast in the 1970's believe me they were not called butchers for nothing my main moan about this film is the it shows no ray of light or hope it's all doom gloom i mean did the little girl at the end have to die maybe this sounds corny but it could have taken the tact that not all prods tiags are bad or wholly good either
<START> ruby in paradise is a beautiful coming of age story about a young woman ruby lee gissing escaping her stifling roots to become herself although the title character is played artfully by the gorgeous ashley judd in likely her first movie role albeit one to be quite proud of the emphasis is not upon becoming somebody a la the next madonna whether jesus' mother or the lurid attention hungry singer br br it instead emphasizes following ones' instincts and being somewhat introspective about them to grow into one's ideal adult self note this isn't an action movie it uses an occasional voice over narration by ms judd while writing in her journal and oh i see i've just lost the male half of the readers out there but be patient with this beautiful movie where we learn that one's bliss can be discovered in oh i dunno carrying water and chopping wood br br actor director writer todd field who played nick nightingale in eyes wide shut co stars as ruby lee's noble love interest one who helps her heal her idea of relationships implanted from youth br br but not even his character is the answer for ruby lee there's no external hero imposed upon her the ultimate message is that we are responsible for ourselves writer director victor nunez who also wrote directed ulee's gold did an amazing job showing a young woman growing into herself confronting age old challenges of good v evil along the way br br the supporting cast is also stellar and the music used particularly the cuts by chanteuse sam phillips whom i hear is the wife of t bone burnett is right on most especially trying to hold on to the earth now when i hear the first few chords of that song tears spring to my eyes pavlovian and unbidden not sure if it's the music or the indelible connection to the movie's quiet charming message of empowerment br br this movie is highly recommended for any young person trying to find his her way for any woman of any age it is a must see the downside it is not on dvd except in spanish we learned however that it is legal to make one copy of a vhs version which can be readily found online my beloved husband found someone with a vhs copy and got a dvd copy made for me although this treasure of a movie occasionally pops up on air Â on an indie channel usually Â you can't count on that when you might need it most as a tonic to soothe the pressures of the world so buy a copy for yourself br br this movie should have a major re release and it would if i were queen of hollywood br br figgy jones
<START> this movie is still an all time favorite only a pretentious humorless moron would not enjoy this wonderful film this movie feels like a slice of warm apple pie topped with french vanilla ice cream i think this is cher's best work ever and her most believable performance cher has always been blessed with charisma good looks and an enviably thin figure whether you like her singing or not who else sounds like cher cher has definitely made her mark in the entertainment industry and will be remembered long after others have come and gone she is one of the most unique artists out there it's funny because who would have thought of cher as such a naturally gifted actress she is heads above the so called movie stars of today cher is a real actor on the same level as debra winger alfre woodard holly hunter angela bassett and a few others in that she never seems to be acting she really becomes the character convincingly she has more than earned the respect of her peers and of the movie going public br br everything about moonstruck is wonderful the characters the scenery the dialog the food i never get tired of watching this movie br br every time single time i watch the scene where they are all sitting around the dinner table at rose's house i pause the remote to see exactly what delicious food rose is serving i saw the spaghetti mushrooms i think but i can't make out whether they are eating ravioli ziti what is that main course it looks wonderful and its driving me nuts br br everybody in that family was a hardworking individual and they respected and cared about one another the grandfather wasn't pushed aside and tolerated he was a vital part of the family and he was listened to and respected for his age and wisdom he seemed to be a pretty healthy independent old codger too br br loretta's mom wasn't just a housewife she was the glue that held the family together and was a model example of what a wife mother and home manager should aspire to be she was proud of the lifestyle she had chosen but she didn't let it define who she was high powered businessmen aren't as comfortable in their skin as rose casterini was notice the saucy way she said i didn't have kids until after i was 37 it ain't over 'til its over you got the sense that she had been the type of young woman who did exactly as she pleased and got her way without the other person realizing what had happened she was charming quick witted and very smart what a great mom br br i didn't actually like loretta right away because she seemed like a bit of a know it all who wasn't really as adventurous and as in control of herself as she wanted others to think she could tell others about themselves and where they had gone wrong but she really didn't apply common sense to her own life she was going to marry a middle aged mama's boy simply because she wanted a husband and a sense of identity and purpose to her life she was more conventional than her own mom she dressed and wore her hair like a matron at a house of detention and seemed humorless and bored but underneath you sensed that she was vulnerable and lonely and had a lot of love to give the right man she would probably end up making an awesome mom too br br i could see in the future a house full of loretta and ronnie's loud screaming happy kids and rose and cosmo enjoying every minute of it
<START> andy goldsworthy is a taoist master of the first order expressing the way through his sublime ephemeral art indeed time and change is what his work is fundamentally about i bought his first book several years ago and my family has marveled at it many times so it was a treat to get to know the artist personally through this film he is just as patient and gentle as you would expect and has some wonderful things to say about the natural world the deepest of which are expressed in his occasional inability to say it in words at all he is like most children who play in the great outdoors alone if they do anymore creating things from sticks and sand and mud and snow before they outgrow it mr goldsworthy was given the gift and the mission to extend that sort of play to create profound visions of nature and to open our often weary eyes to it in brilliant new ways and always with the utmost respect gratitude and humor of a wandering and wondering monk
