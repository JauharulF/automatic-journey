<START> one would think that a film about a young person's coming to terms with his burgeoning homosexuality would be anything but boring think again this production should be bottled and sold as a cure for insomnia because it's about ten times as potent as any sleep aid on the market it's almost as if the film maker considered making a movie but got lazy and decided instead to run a series of random and randomly boring images and go nowhere scenes throw in a couple of actual scenes featuring actual acting pretend that good lighting ins't important in the film making process and wrap it up under the auspices of an arthouse film this is exactly kind of crappy product that makes it easy for a lot of traditional film makers to poo poo the indie film movement and which keeps the general public from more easily embracing indie films br br if you're interested in films covering this subject matter you'd be much better off tuning in to some of the great short films available at logo's website or renting get real better yet read stone butch blues whatever you do skip this long winded piece of dreck
<START> arg the shuffling dinosaurs are back to take another bite out of our sanity in this all awful third film this time european terrorists irish i'd say hi jack an army convoy supposed to be transporting uranium they pull into a shipyard open the truck and discover our old friends the carnosaurs pandemonium comes visiting then when the rubber dinos chomp the terrorists the cops and some marines the whole film seems to be again largely inspired from alien as carnosaur 2 was with the pathetic marines going through the claustrophobic shipyard guns at the ready this third opus is probably the driest and ungoriest film of the lot with only one spurt of blood when a rubber dino rips a marine's head off the dinos are stiff shuffling creatures as usual and the t rex sounds like an enraged elephant when it roars it also appears to have no eyes one of the goofiest scenes of the film is when the coppers arrive on the scene they enter the building where the hijacked truck is kept and hear some weird noise coming from another truck on opening it surprise the rubber reptile gang burst out and devour them why were the dinos locked up in the second truck after escaping from the first how did they get locked in as the truck door could only be locked from the outside what was the point of filming this scene oh bother who cares both thumbs down for the over sized rubber iguanas
<START> todd rohal is a mad genius knuckleface jones his third and most fully realized short film has an offbeat sense of humor and will leave some scratching their heads what the film is about at heart and he would almost certainly disagree with me on this is how a regular joe finds the confidence to get through life with a little inspiration or not you just have to see for yourself the short is intermittently making rounds on the festival circuit so keep your eyes peeled and catch it if you can you'll be glad you did it is hilarious and check out todd's other short films also popping up here and there from time to time single spaced and slug 660
<START> i am truly beginning to believe that seagal is on a mission to see how crappy his films could become this particular movie was a complete and utter waste of time to see my first complaint was the cover of the dvd where they have doctored his pic and made him look slimmer and younger when in the film he looks like crap he has his big pot belly and double chin going for him and the most miserable and bored look on his face br br the whole plot was ridiculous to begin with and drawn out way too long the whole film was leading up to the finale where seagal and his team had to take on a bunch of people under the influence of a top secret military chemical adrenaline enhancer there was way too much useless dialogue and not to mention the ridiculous and constant dubbing of seagals voice even in the middle of a statement the dubbed voice sounded like a man with a frog in his throat and was quite comical br br the fight scenes in the film were horrible half the time when seagal fought you could not even see what was going on there would be tight shots of him flapping his arms at the camera and then the person flying through a wall or something it was reminiscent of the old kung fu series on television they used way too much slow motion for the fight scenes br br i believe this is seagals worst film to date and i am glad i did not purchase this film or i would have been very upset since i am a huge fan of seagal the aikidoist the action star is quickly fading away and seems to be getting worse with every performance
<START> ok hollywood is not liberal br br obviously i'm lieing because it is im a conservative but the politics i will leave out of my opinion of the movie this movie was anti bush anti middle east anti big oil propaganda but that is not why it was bad br br fist off i will give credit where credit is due i saw this film opening night because i happen to like these kinds of films and am a political science major in collage the cinematography was excellent and the acting was as far as i could tell very good br br the plot was impossible for me to decode however i have been tested and have an iq of 138 but no matter how hard i tried there was no way i could piece together the story line of the movie and what characters where doing what br br the story and scene sequence was totally incoherent and poorly organized br br unless this is one of those movies that is meant to be watch many times to get the full depth pf the story which it very well may be i have no idea exactly what was going on br br which makes sense because if you want to make a political argument and not receive any criticism then make your argument impossible to critique if you cant dazzle them with brilliance then baffle them with bull s
<START> i watched this movie for a project on love please tell nicolas cage to learn what it would feel like to be his character and then re read the lines he's saying my life cannot go on i accidentally cut off my own hand my brother was close by obviously his fault and since when have happy endings included the nice guy who takes care of mom sad and alone no closure bad script and doesn't have enough extension of minor characters save yourself unless your up for a good laugh costumes were done appropriately and extras did a fabulous job i'm sure it would have been a fun movie to make but keep it more genre specific i can't recommend this movie to anyone i know because it is not an intellectual movie it is not a chick flick it is not a strict romantic and i can't show kids because of the sex and questions to follow all in all just not a good flick
<START> damon runyon's world of times square in new york prior to its disneyfication is the basis for this musical joseph l mankiewicz a man who knew about movies directed this nostalgic tribute to the crossroads of the world that show us that underside of new york of the past frank loesser's music sounds great we watch a magnificent cast of characters that were typical of the area people at the edges of society tended to gravitate toward that area because of the lights the action the possibilities in that part of town this underbelly of the city made a living out of the street life that was so intense br br some of the songs from the original production were not included in the film we don't know whether this makes sense but this is not unusual for a hollywood musical to change and alter what worked on the stage that original cast included the wonderful vivian blaine and stubby kaye and we wonder about the decision of not letting robert alda sam levene isabel bigley repeat their original roles these were distinguished actors that could have made an amazing contribution br br the film visually is amazing the look follows closely the fashions of the times as far as the casting of marlon brando otherwise not known for his singing abilities frank sinatra and jean simmons seem to work in the film sky masterson is after all a man's man who would look otherwise sissy if he presented a different 'look' frank sinatra is good as nathan detroit jean simmons as sarah brown does a nice job portraying the woman from the salvation army who suddenly finds fulfillment with the same kind of man she is trying to save br br vivian blaine is a delight she never ceases to amaze as miss adelaide a woman with a heart of gold who's nathan detroit's love interest ms blaine makes a fantastic impression as the show girl who is wiser than she lets out to be stubby kaye makes a wonderful job out of reprising his nicely nicely johnson br br the wonderful production owes a lot to the talented abe burrows who made the adaptation to the screen the costumes by irene sharaff set the right tone
<START> ok let's get this clear i'm really not into sci fi but for some reason i love stargate sg 1 br br jack o'neil takes his team sg 1 through a stargate a round device that creates a wormhole it gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds it might sound like your usual sci fi series but it's not the plot is set today not in some distant millennium like many other sci fi series i find that great it gives you things happenings and such you can relate to and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all the gadgets they have some of course but thanks to o'neil who likes to keep a simple terminology there's not many br br the series has a nice blending of action humor and drama if you enjoy loads of special effects you're not going to find it here they don't use many bad ones but a limited amount of well made special effects
<START> when i was little my parents got this movie for me to watch i really liked it and i watched it over and over again even when i was in 3rd grade i still watched it from time to time recently i watched it again just for the sake of nostalgia and though the show was not aimed for my age group i'm in my late teens i still found it entertaining and educational this show teaches good lessons about imagination and getting along well with others some parts i found quite entertaining also this show does not have any bad content so you can leave kids alone with this show and not worry about them picking up any bad language or whatnot i would recommend this
<START> a teenager who seems to have it all commits suicide it leaves his family and his best friend keanu reeves asking a lot of questions and blaming themselves br br good idea badly handled for starters this has been done before 1988 mostly in tv movies and after school specials aside from some swearing and dialogue hence the pg 13 rating this added nothing new the outcome is predictable and reeve's attempts at acting were truly painful to watch he's good now but not in 1988 aside from that his character was dressed like a slob and always looked so dirty is was hard to build up sympathy br br that aside the movie is dull i saw every scene coming and every surprise was telegraphed i basically couldn't wait for this thing to get over br br i have a vague recollection of seeing it in a theatre in 1988 and hating it it bombed badly it still looks lousy almost 20 years later the subject is worth handling but it's been done better with better acting in countless other movies ordinary people comes to mind you can skip this one
<START> this show is good i like the acting funny bits and the cuteness of it the actors lee pace ann friel etc they all did great in the show the show started off great with its funny illogical basic idea of bringing dead people back in the first series and honestly as what people said the first few episodes of the second series were a bit of a let down but it later came back looking good anyway and now i really hate the fact that it's going to be cancelled why doesn't abc just let it finish until the very end when all the episodes are already done i really wanna know how the story's going to be i think it should be given a chance as there're still so many viewers who love it
<START> i myself feel this film is a rare treasure not only is it the beginning of shirley temple's career but a rare look on how our society has changed you have to understand certain things we today would view as sexual back then would be considered innocent for example the parents of the children in the film as well as the many parents who took their children to see this movie saw this as just children mimicking adults most people didn't think of anyone viewing children sexually attractive other than teenage boys lusting over teenage girls to them it wasn't sexual mind you this was before we had internet tv etc most sex crimes weren't openly brought up occasionally there would be a whisper about the kid with the funny uncle but that was often all that came of it yes very sad but it is kinda sad today for even i too can see this film as anything other than what it was intended innocent and funny when i saw shirley dance like that and the boys eye balling her yes i felt disturbed i have to remind myself the time this took place those children didn't know what sex was the parents knew that both those of the children in the movie and those watching it the thought may not have even entered their minds in the eyes of the average adult back then this was no more sexual then if shirley was playing house even today kids will enter beauty contest many dressed up extremely maturely for a three yr old however the child is merely pretending i don't blame the child for wanting to act like an adult or the old movies that display this in all honesty our media has made a lot of things seem back then seem sick and wrong this sometimes can be for the best but i truly believe this movie isn't one of them it gives a rare look of an innocent mentality that we have long lost
<START> it's been a while since seeing this the first time so i watched it again with the second movie in the series while i realize there is a 3rd movie out that i haven't seen yet i'll review under the original title br br just from the standpoint of production value screen writing and movie making this movie fails on many levels though it succeeds on a few as well what can you expect from a low budget b movie not much and it works from the standpoint of production however the writing is certainly disjointed with little in the way of character development exactly what i'd expect when there is an agenda to a film i didn't have a problem with the acting the cast is solid however the screenplay in both movies gives the actors little opportunity to really stretch themselves because the film is christian this is predictable as you can't very well portray violent chaos of the end times without also breaking some of the ethics which are normally associated with christianity in other words the mistake comes in making this into a g rated film when the content even in the most conservative of bible interpretations would be r rated by any measure so if the purpose of the movie is to scare people into christian faith then the movie should be somewhat scary right however you can't comment on a film adaptation from a book without commenting on the book or in this case series of books there are certainly plenty of christian materials worthy enough to be made into movies but not the left behind series and these movies ultimately fail because while being best sellers they are poorly written novels based on bad theology br br as a southern baptist minister i confess that the books were a guilty pleasure for me though i have yet to finish the last two books of the series i have described them as decent fiction and if the books would take the point of view that this is one possibility or interpretation of the subject of biblical eschatology study of the end times then i could live with that however this series is divisive in christian circles because it promotes the literalist interpretation of all scripture above a more proper hermeneutic inevitably this leads to the pre trib pre millenial dispensation point of view which confines an all powerful god far too by humanity's world in other words as i've always said god shouldn't need our helicopters and bombs to do his ultimate work but because many people particularly unstudied christians can't think beyond their own world views we are left with a pro conservative fundamentalist stance with regard to bible interpretation and attempts to push it through as the only interpretation br br thus the books carry with them an agenda not so much to get the lost to understand their need for christ but to state that the fundamentalist point of view is the only valid way to understand the bible i recall very clearly reading several years ago in the second novel a scene where the characters reference a person who was left behind because of his non adherence to this point of view as if real christians worthy to be raptured couldn't possibly hold to another eschatology this is disturbing for several reasons the least of which is because a rapture is only briefly mentioned in scripture and it's connection to real end time prophecy is tenuous at best br br but the real issue with these books is comes in the way they divide the christian community and how they portray true christian behavior ultimately i feel they harden more people to an otherwise legitimate faith religion instead of win people towards it it turns all christians into caricatures equally disdained and laughed at by the world despite the fact that there is theological room for a wide diversity of believes within christian thought and practice as a christian body on the whole we've done enough of that kind of damage to society over 2000 years of history and we certainly don't need to promote it by film to thousands maybe millions of others br br thus the left behind movies fail because the left behind books aren't worthy to be interpreted into movies
<START> something about paulie touched my heart as few movies do it is a witty funny yet emotional movie i'm a late comer in becoming a fan of this movie i didn't see paulie until may 2004 and have since ordered the widescreen dvd from a seller at ebay br br the special effects of showing paulie talking are superb my son asked me how the bird knew so many phrases probably my favorite part of the movie is when paulie is in gena rowlands ivy's company followed by cheech marin ignacio tony shalhoub misha plays an excellent part as the good hearted human you root for him all the way through the movie br br you can't go wrong renting or buying this movie
<START> some films manage to survive almost on originality alone wonderland is certainly one of those films the script manages to throw everything into a near fever pitch but without making it incoherent the speed of this thriller is not to chosen to cover up a weak script but rather to accurately reflect the drug addled reality br br as director james cox as a very peculiar way of working his actors most of the characters are perpetually on edge and often because they're rather quite ugly personalities val kilmer has described john holmes to be a hustler able to manipulate and control no offense to kilmer but his version of holmes seems only able to control the drastically weak minded nonetheless it's a stunning performance comparing this to kilmer's more 'hollywood' roles like in the saint it seems to prove he is far more at home in gritty indie flicks br br the actors are the main force holding all together there are various little performances that stand out especially the women carrie fisher kate bosworth and lisa kudrow all have limited screen time next to their male counterparts but they are all fantastic aside from kilmer ted levine and dylan mcdermott give a weird stunning energy to their roles br br i originally put off watching wonderland because i assumed it was a film about a porn actor in the strictest sense yes the story revolves around john holmes but it has literally nothing to do with his professional career basically this film is a murder mystery and as such it's excellent br br rating 7 5 out of 10
<START> how much could the general hollywood director learn from this movie all when it comes to actually scaring people this movies truly shows that it is possible to really frighten and scare a viewer and that monstrous monsters and long knifes never will be the best way of achieving this all who love a real psychological thriller must see this movie it is the best of it's kind
<START> the film was okay quite entertaining the cast was pretty good and i'll second what the comment before me mentioned glenn quinn was outstanding and he alone is reason enough to watch this movie he played the selfish evil friend and manager of the band brilliantly br br there are a lot of songs performed by beyond gravity in this film but this doesn't really come as a surprise considering the film is a vh1 production however if the soft rock pop music isn't to someone's liking one might as well flash forward those scenes br br the plot of a band trying to make it to the top in l a but having to overcome many obstacles on the way isn't too original but quite entertaining with some surprising plot turns here and there
<START> forbidden planet is the best sf film from the golden age of sf cinema and what makes it a great film is its sense of wonder as soon as the spaceship lands the audience via the ships human crew travels through an intelligent and sometimes terrifying adventure we meet the unforgetable robbie the mysterious dr morbuis his beautiful and innocent daughter altair and we learn about the former inhabitants of the planet the krell who died out overnight or did they br br you can nitpick and say the planet is obviously filmed in a movie studio with painted backdrops but that adds to a sense of menace of claustraphobia i feel and bebe and louis barron s electronic music adds even more atmosphere br br i m shocked this film isn t in the top 250 imdb films

<START> i have to admit that this re imagining of the original 1968 film was a huge disappointment specially when taken into consideration that this is a tim burton film he is defenetly one of the most original and might i say cool directors hollywood has produced br br i am personally a great fan of his work but something obviously went wrong with his latest flick the planet of the apes i really enjoyed the original film when it first came out people expected just another cheezie 70's science fiction film but a very surprise anding totally proved that theory wrong it had indeed a clear cut message an obvious anti war message fear of the cold war where it was taking the world and fear of the use of nuclear weapons played a big role in the mind of the film makers those reasons made the film rise above all expectations and it became a instant classic although the new film the re making or whatever leaves us with nothing no message no ideals behind it it is just another money minded summer blockbuster br br visually tim burton does not let you down the dark and creepy settings were excellent and of course the make up was terrific br br obviously that is not enough to keep people intrested in a film there has to be an exciting plot or storyline in this movie the plot is highly uninteresting and it is extremely badly thought out the script is very lame and it is full of gaps it looks like this film had been written in a big hurry the explanation for why the apes where there and why the ruled the planet was indeed very stupid and proved the script writers ignorance br br it raised a lot of questions which had no reasonable answers to br br for example why did the apes speak english why were there other ape species than chimps on the planet given that there were only chimps in the space ship that crash landed on the planet where the hell did all of those humans come from how were a few chimps able to evolve into a huge raise of all kinds of monkeys in only a few thousands years i mean it took a few million years for us to evolve from monkey to man br br and finally the bad surprise ending was just plane dumb it was probably just thrown in because the original film had such an end then they felt that the audience were expecting the same kind of ending the ending also raises a lot of questions which i know donÂ´t have intelligent answears did theid learn to work the space ship which was power less and learnt to fly back in time and take over the earth single hand and what did he do breed with all the women and lets say that that would happen i higly doubt that history would stay the same like washington would be built exactly like it is today i mean wouln't there be a huge banana instead of the memorial br br well just to say something posative about the film some of the cast was great helen bonham carter's character was interesting and well acted as for tim roth as theid he was very good a little exaturated at some points of the film michael clark duncan was also fine i was not happy with marc whalberg he is not much of an actor and plays here a very macho colour less character very unbielevable and is nothing compared to hestons character in the original and the main female character had no reason or place in the film she was just casted for the looks hardly said a word throughout the entire film br br well i think that in the future when people think about the planet of the apes they will think about the original one the latest will soon be forgotten
