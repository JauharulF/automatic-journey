<START> i purchased this film on the cheap in a sale having read the back of the dvd case and assuming that either way i can't lose it if was rubbish then no loss if it was any good then bargain br br then i watched it br br i am normally a fan of christopher walken but in this film he commanded very little screen presence seeming not to do a whole lot even the death of his friend near the beginning which sparks off the action in the plot seems to affect him very little and his eventual revenge is just boring and undramatic br br normally a film which has themes as grand as revolution and revenge are able to capture the audience and snare them into feeling something for the characters however watching this film felt more like seeing a series of confused and almost random events that loosely tied together towards it's eventual conclusion br br at this point i wept br br i thought this film was the most horribly painful piece of viewing i have ever been subjected to the scene where the pilot sacrifices himself by refusing to jump out the explosive laden truck due to not wanting to kill any civilians is not so much tragically sad as it is unnervingly horrible and painful although not quite as bad as the emergency surgery on the wounded girl the acting was poor all round the script and story was weak the action was even weaker and the visuals were but bluntly not all that visual to summarise there are films which are good films that are bad films that are so bad they are good films that are terrible br br and then on a whole new level is mcbain
<START> to me this review may contain spoilers but i like watching movies with no idea of what is going to happen so therefore i think many of the other reviews here of this movie contain spoilers br br i just watched this movie again and i must reiterate that it has the best ending to any movie ever ever ever the real translation 'the beating of the butterfly's wings' is oddly not used as the translated title i suppose they thought most americans wouldn't know what chaos theory is except for those who saw or read jurassic park the movie is based on chaos theory and how one small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events which all lead back to one event the movie is a whirlwind of wondrous cause and effect as we follow the chain of chaos as it intertwines between several characters about 20 in a way the ending seems inevitable despite this but if you think about it it is a perfect ending think to yourself what else needed to be said it is at the same time a very brave ending too bad we have to go overseas for a gem like this one but an ending like this would never come out of hollywood br br
<START> when i saw this movie first it was long ago on vhs video i did like this movie because it was funny and excitingly some years ago i saw another movie called andy colby's incredible adventure in this movie were parts of wizards of the lost kingdom used in they called this movie kor the conquerer i began to search for the kor movie many years because i wanted to see the complete movie not only the parts which were used in the andy colby movie no shop had this kor movie to rent and no shop did know this movie many years i watched my old vhs tapes i had at home and what a wonder i had this movie since many years still at home but the movie had a different title because in germany it has 3 or 4 titles so i was happy to find this tape at home and this time i had much more time in watching kor the conquerer again the music is great during the hole movie but the best part of filming in combination with the music is this moment when kor is walking drunken through the green forrest the music in the background had some kind of magic i like bo svenson and also the boy who played simon in the movie both of them did their job very good manfred kraatz germany 26 10 2004 thanks to all for reading my comment
<START> i had heard this movie was good from a lot of my friends that saw it and they all said it was amazing so i had very high expectations and nancy drew exceeded those high expectations it had funny parts it kept me entertained with the action and all the dudes trying to kill her and emma roberts was amazing as nancy drew the rest of the cast was very good also i would definitely recommend this movie br br nancy i wonder why those guys were trying to kill us corky yeah i was wondering that too actually it's kinda creeping me out br br nancy i hate when people try to kill me it's so rude br br nancy drew
<START> sarah silverman is a dangerous bitch she's beautiful sexy funny and talent dark and demonic i read the other 'comment' on this show as well as the message board stuff and people just don't get it nothing that appears on t v is an accident too much money time and work is put into the production of a t v show for there to be mistakes this show is stupid because sarah wanted it to be stupid this show is juvenile because sarah wanted it to be juvenile i thought the jokes were great and the theme show as well as the other musical numbers are wonderfully bizarre it's a lot like pee wee's playhouse for maladjusted slacker twenty something glue sniffing future pornstars of america from the valley the cast is awesome the scenarios and action is well paced i hope this show succeeds since comedy central didn't let david spade keep his show who plays sarah's sister she not in the cast listing on the show's home page i would love to see her stand up does anyone know about her up coming show dates or dvds that may be floating around out there
<START> when you start watching this animation masterpiece you quickly notice that it's a european production although the europeans have sadly integrated some of the clichÃ©s you would normally find in an american production of this kind most are missing one of these is that there is an overwhelming evil that only our very few and very unlikely heroes can vanquish another is that one of the group is only in the business for the money is greedy runs away when the heat is up but somehow gives in to his better nature this movie would have been better off without both br br the movie is based upon a tv series that was out four years before the movie unlike the movie the tv series is a cartoon and not a computer animation at first i thought the computer would kill the charm and character of the plot but i was quickliy convinced whoever did the animation knew his or her stuff although the characters are obviously fictional in stills they don't even look real they seem as alive and sentient as the audience following their quest making characters who by normal standards could be considered deformed those micro legs could never carry that giant body let alone make it jump so alive and lovable is more than just a highlight the creation of the world is another masterpiece not so much because of its looks but because of the inventiveness of it the world our heroes travel is not solid like our own but is made of many pieces of land varying in shape and size that seem to be floating in mid air when a person steps on a smaller fragment of ground it nods a little bit as if feathering from the weight in some cases up and down no longer apply but our heroes still manage to get a foothold somewhere although the world of floating islands is completely surreal in this movie it is absolutely believable and after a short time it doesn't seem any weirder than running into a car somewhere in new york br br i wrote that the looks of the world aren't as breathtaking as the idea as true as that might be to my mind the quality of the world the characters and the attention to details is staggering although the faces of the characters have relatively few attributes emotions can be read as clearly as in sean connery's or dustin hoffman's face the world around the characters is wonderfully colourful and no two settings are alike the background is always in motion something is always going on which makes the world seem even more alive if you stop the movie and look at the background you will be surprised how many details you can find br br the existence of hector actually puts the cherry on top hector is a furry little thing possibly the equivalent of a dog in our world who is totally lovable and extremely funny although he isn't really important for the main plot he would be missed like scrat would be in ice age the really cool thing about hector is that you need to speak gibberish to understand him br br if the movie is so great why didn't i give it 10 stars well the plot in itself was rather thin two hunters are sent out to rescue the world from a really bad dragon who wants to swallow the world isn't really original that in itself wouldn't be much of a problem what i missed was the background information what kind of a dragon was this and why did it look that way i love mythical stories but if they get too thin then they seem to be written after the movie is finished in a feeble attempt to give the whole thing some depth br br another thing i didn't like was zoÃ© although a little girl like her could be considered adorable she was somewhat of a pain in this movie she seemed pretty resistant to all types of learning about reality kept dreaming of some hero from a story book and basically slowed the others down she would have been ok if she had developed a little more and a little earlier in the movie or had been less of a girly to start with to me the idea of this girl who was there to twist the story a little backfired on the writers br br all in all this is a really good movie for just about all ages
<START> what this movie does well is combine action and horror with comedy and drama in a unique way that teases more emotion form the audience than a typical horror movie unfortunately with disjointed storytelling frustrating plot holes and contradictory scenes this movie mainly caused me frustration and is hardly the greatest monster movie ever br br let's start with the good stuff comedy acting and special effects from the get go this movie starts off fast paced and cheeky the opening scene the monster's origin is campy and quick paying homage the the classic 'environmental' disasters that have given birth to so many other monsters the pacing is fast which was a welcome break from the long and often pointlessly dramatic opening scene from other monster flicks and allows the movie to jump right into the action with in the course of 10 minutes you get the 'why' 'where ' and 'how' of the beast and are ready for action in this the movie delivers br br after another short and well shot sequence the characters are introduced the lazy son and his precocious little girl kind grandfather and talented sister aunt and of course the monster the characters are introduced in context to each other and their conflicts are instantly apparent allowing the audience to feel for them when the monster shows up suddenly to wreak havoc in the river area where they live and work br br the monster it's self looks great alien yet familiar kinda like a dog and fish pooped out by a squid the effects of the creature are second to none and although it looks strange it is believable and at no point in the movie could you 'see it's strings ' even the movement of the monster was horribly familiar like a growing and excited rottweiler on linoleum the monster barrels through the crowd slipping on surfaces crushing and eating those in it's path when the monster's path intersects with the family and tragedy ensues it truly is a painful moment and you can feel the need for revenge but from there on out the movie's appeal begins to unravel br br following the dynamite beginning the movie quickly loses focus and continuity plot lines are introduced then abandoned characters change their position for no apparent reason and comedy is interlaced into dramatic scenes confusing intent while obstacles appear and disappear seemingly at random br br as for the comedy let me say this i'm willing to accept that a lot of the humor is probably cultural i am not familiar with korean humor so maybe things were lost in translation however as an asian studies major in college and as someone who has been living in japan for the last 5 years still here i'd like to think i have a better grasp on asian humor than the average white guy that being said there were many parts of the movie that i understood were supposed to be funny but to me weren't br br spoiler for example after the initial attack where the young daughter is lost the family is at the funeral everyone is mourning a new character is introduced a brother and tension is raised even higher as it becomes obvious that the two brothers are at odds with one another they both begin to grieve for their loss and wind up competing with each other over who is grieving harder this competition is at it's core funny two brothers who dislike each other so much they even compete at a funeral it shows the prickly nature of familial love common in asian comedy this subtle slap stick comedy poking fun at family and ritualized mourning is supposed to be funny but seemed really out of place in the context of a lost little girl end spoiler br br then come the plot holes there are so many points brought up in this movie that are never explained or worse are explained and fretted over only to be proved impotent and pointless in the end finding out an obstacle isn't an obstacle can be a good thing for a character but you'd expect some comment to that nature instead the audience is barraged by moments of anti climax when problems just 'aren't there' anymore and no one gives an indication that it was ever a problem to start so i ask you why even bring it up in the first place br br this was prevalent through out the film as problems gave rise to new problems and suddenly the world of the movie is filled with opposing forces that never resolved each other of course introducing new and greater problems is a time tested story telling tradition but if the introduction of a new arc leads the the forced shortening of another you would expect at least that the new arc gets full explanation not in this movie instead it was as if you get several stories each only explained 20 of the way and in the end the parts never converge to complete the whole br br again i'm willing to accept that a lot of this might be 'cultural ' maybe its in korean story telling tradition to put comedy inside a tragedy maybe it's normal for stories to go all over like a child who colors outside the lines on every page but never finishes one maybe it's ok to present a problem in order to develop the plot but then remove that problem randomly without any apparent solution or catharsis or maybe these are all hallmarks of sloppy work and bad storytelling rampant in a movie that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves
<START> the acting is good the women are beautiful and the men are handsome so if you're looking for well acted soft porn this movie is for you otherwise you are wasting your time the motivation of the main characters in particular the eponymous lead is often a mystery she could have just told the truth the truth as presented in the film not necessarily the historical truth and her lover would have been spared time in jail for a rape he did not commit was she protecting her father who went off half cocked as it were when he impetuously instigated a malicious lawsuit was she protecting herself with her reputation suddenly of concern when heretofore only her art seemed to matter during the trial this strong willed woman turns to mush before our eyes conversely her lover who starts off as a narcissistic jerk becomes a selfless hero during the trial at least his motivation is clearer he sacrifices himself for love naturally since no good deed must go unpunished we are told that she never sees him again
<START> robert duvall is a direct descendent of confederate general robert e lee according the imdb com movie database after seeing this film you may think duvall's appearance is reincarnation at it's best one of my most favorite films i wish the composer peter rodgers melnick had a cd or there was a soundtrack available wonderful scenery and music and all too true to life especially for those of us that live in or have moved to the south this is a real moment in time life moves on slowly but strangers we do not remain
<START> there's a lot of good that can be said for this cartoon the backgrounds are rich lushly colored and full of nicely done art deco details the animation is up to the usual studio standards of the time which are unquestionably higher than those of the present day however i find it tedious for a number of reasons br br the music it's definitely not up to scott bradley's usual standards although it's probably supposed to be evocative of a great gatsby setting it ends up being dreary sleepy repetitious and monotonous repetitious and monotonous are not the same as beethoven's 5th symphony attests since most people including me tend to close their eyes when they yawn there's a lot of the visual part of the cartoon that will be missed by the average viewer br br the storyline i'm not giving away any secrets that aren't already in the plot summary country good city bad this is a common theme in films both animated and live from this era it's a misplaced nostalgia for a nonexistent rural idyll which in the present day is reflected in a similar nostalgia for values that never were
<START> i watched this over the christmas period i don't know why but it reminds me of christmas so i watched it so there we are br br arthur is a film i watch all the way through with a big dumb smile on my face and its a mixture of special performances great jolly music and a script crackling with wit and charm that causes it br br dudley moore makes a character that could well be hated very easily spoiled rich lazy drunk who feels sorry for himself but turns him into someone you love liza minelli is great as linda morolla a queens waitress who manages to pull off the tough soft on the inside lady arthur nearly gives up his world for john gielgud gets all the juicy lines and polishes them off with relish br br i can watch arthur again and again and it always makes me feel good check it out if you need a lift its a lovely film
<START> oh man this s u c k e d sucked i couldn't even get any camp value out of this and i sat through the whole thing on showtime don't bother waiting around for the 'naked' scenes either it's too late and only plastic jenna jameson is involved shows how much discretionary cash must be laying around hollywood just to get your name on the closing credits i guess showtime had to throw something in at 1am next time i think i'd even rather be watching espn loop around every 30 minutes
<START> one of the best tarzan films is also one of its most action packed and graphic br br picking up a year or so after tarzan the ape man niel hamilton's holt has asked a rich friend to finance a safari back to the elephants graveyard to collect ivory his friend arrives also carrying dresses and perfumes that holt hopes to use to win jane back from tarzan before they can leave holt finds his map stolen and it becomes a mad dash to try and capture a competing expedition when they finally over take the thieves they find the whole party dead and themselves surrounded they have no choice but to fight their way out and soon find they are out of the frying pan and into the fire eventually tarzan and jane show up and everyone is off on even more adventures br br infamous film was heavily censored to reduce the graphic violence its graphic even by todays standards it probably would get a pg 13 and to remove all hint of nudity there is a several minute long nude swim scene involving jane that is full frontal in its nudity it was only recently restored its clear watching the restored version why this film was reduced by 20 minutes in its run time for tv as it stands in its restored version this is a very adult film that is romantic touching action filled and everything else that a movie should be its an amazing film by almost any standard best of all its the sort of film that plays well both as a stand alone adventure one need not to have seen the first film to enjoy it but its also a film that deepens the characters and themes that were set up in that original film its an amazing thing br br i really like this film a great deal br br if there are any flaws to the film its perhaps that the film hasn't aged well the rear screen is often very obvious there are gorilla suits for many of the apes and some of the other effects are more quaint rather than convincing however on almost every other level this film is top notch br br you really owe it to yourself to see this make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and curl up on the couch and just let yourself drift back to a simpler time this is one of the great adventures
<START> this movie was the worst movie i have seen since date movie i was laughing through out the whole movie instead of being scared it was funny how the snakes would search for particular section of the passengers body to attack for example the eye the tongue the butt the breast if we have seen national geographic channel we know snakes wont stay clinched on the body once they bite for each particular scene the snakes would bite the passengers and would stay on the body biting the person i believe the producer did not study his information on snakes and their behavior i cant believe i wasted my money on this movie so i don't recommend this movie trust just wait until it is at the dollar theatre or rent it
<START> the power rangers is definitely the worst television show and completely ridiculous plastic toy line in the history of the united states br br there is absolutely nothing even remotely entertaining about this completely awful television show br br this is simply the worst show ever made with awful actors dressing up in multi colored spandex outfits that look completely ridiculous br br the owners of this show should be ashamed of themselves since there is no redeeming value to this nonsense br br kids of today should try watching better shows like the toy story movies instead of this garbage
<START> pufnstuf is what it is i saw this in the cinema at age 4 and i have very fond and vivid memories of it seeing this as as adult allows one to catch the references that are way over the heads of the target audience like the bit where jimmy's grey witch wig is ripped off and witch hazel cass sneers i knew she had brown roots it is of course heavily influenced by the flower power culture of the time and in some ways quite progressive the track different for example sends a clear message to the young viewers about being yourself not running with the pack and cherishing what is is about yourself that is different this could be an anthem to the gay community it should be great track br br martha raye cass elliot and billie hayes are all great as witches and the living island cast give it their all in the confines of their character suits includes billy barty felix silla and other famous names there is a lot of over acting in this film there's really nothing subtle and when little jack wild has to emote his concern for the kidnapped residents of living island it's really little more than yelling this is drama and comedy spread on with a trowel while i think of it i never could stand the flute though br br i love the soundtrack especially the above mentioned different but also zap the world pufnstuf and even jack wild's touching if i could what's more it is now out on cd from the tasteful people at el records in london see here for more www cherryred co uk el artists pufnstuf htm
<START> this movie was amusing at times hell sometimes it was even downright funny br br the underlying message i got from the film though was that women are responsible for all of the troubles of man every time a woman is depicted in the film she is being lazy being slutty or lambasting some poor guy for no apparent reason i don't think the message involved is good for women or gay men br br but it is a comedy and a piece of art so it is simply someones point of view even if i don't agree with it they are still entitled to it br br an amusing film but some of the comments others have made are just plain stupid best film ever my foot
<START> bangville police supposedly marked the debut of the keystone kops named after the studio they worked for in this one however they don't dress in the silly cop costumes or drive the fast paced car that's their trademark anyway mabel normand is a farm girl here who's begged her dad for a calf she later sees some strange men in the barn and quickly calls the police one answers and the chase is on next mabel slams her door just as someone is coming in turns out it's her mother who jumps to the conclusion robbers are in there so while mabel blocks her door with furniture the mother and father try to fight their way in this was perhaps the most amusing part of the short along with some explosions of the cop car this was a short 7 minutes that went by so fast it's over before it's begun the only real characterization that's developed is mabel's who exudes charm with just her face and big eyes and seems so optimistically cheery here except of course when she's frightened it's easy to see why she became a star it's largely because of her that i'd recommended seeing this at least once and why i'm giving this a 4
<START> this is definitely a stupid bad taste movie eddie murphy stars in what is written like a sitcom he is surrounded with his perfect family full of good family values if you're looking for politically correct entertainment this movie is for you but if you hate the idea of being the only one not to laugh at obscene gags in a movie theater full of pop corn addicts just flee
<START> very few so called remakes can be as good as the originals this one crosses that border with flying colors just a remake i don't think so i saw it theatrically at the age of nine and was completely entranced and enraptured by the film br br the film certainly invites comparisons to its 1963 counterpart the earlier film is also a enjoyable and entertaining movie but admittedly it tends to feel more like a nature documentary than a film this update is more epic and cinematic still i thoroughly recommend both films br br this film is certainly a must see for an animal lover we have the wise old golden retriever shadow the sharp sarcastic himalayan cat sassy and the young fun loving american bulldog chance the animals are brilliantly voiced by don ameche sally field and michael j fox respectively br br there is virtually nothing offensive in the film there is a bit of scatological humor but nothing extreme no hard violence save a few tense scenes involving a pounding waterfall an angry porcupine and a dark railroad shaft br br hilarious scary moving and above all real it surprised me to see that this film didn't win any awards not one nevertheless i will have to say this is just as good as some of the best picture nominees nowadays
