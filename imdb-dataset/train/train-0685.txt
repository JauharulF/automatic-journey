<START> what irving thalberg did in making this film today would never be attempted again making a chinese story with occidental players even if they are of the caliber of paul muni luise rainer charley grapewin and walter connolly among others br br perhaps it's partly because the story was written by a westerner pearl buck who got a pulitzer prize for her novel in 1932 ms buck daughter of chinese missionaries probably brought china closer to the consciousness of america than any other person not the political struggles of china but the lives and toil of the every day people we find in the good earth unfortunately later on pearl buck became an apologist for the kuomintang china of chiang kai shek in all its virtues and excesses the rest of her literary output never matched the good earth br br in the sundowners there is a great description of comparing china to australia by peter ustinov when asked the difference ustinov said china was very big and very full and australia was very big and very empty that's what you see in the good earth china very big and very full of people more than she can deal with at times br br the good earth tells the story of wang lung paul muni as a young man who purchases a wife from a large house where she was a slave the woman o lan luise rainer bears him two sons and sees him through all the good times and bad they have drought famine revolution and a climatic locust plague br br luise rainer won the second of two consecutive oscars for portraying o lan she may have set some kind of record in that it has to be the leading player oscar performance with the least amount of dialog everything she does practically is done with facial expressions her performance could have been on a silent film with very minimal subtitles i think only john mills in ryan's daughter had fewer words and he was playing a mentally retarded man br br muni is not always appreciative of how supportive she is in that male dominated culture rainer helps in the field bears and raises the kids does the housework when muni becomes a man of property he takes a chinese second trophy wife who causes him a lot of grief still rainer stoically bears it all still muni is not a bad man and it's a tribute to the film and his acting and buck's writing that you don't hate him and the culture gap is bridged br br we've got a group of oriental players now who do more than just kung fu movies i'm surprised the good earth of all films has not been remade at this point i'll bet the chinese government would even let some american company do it on an actual location br br till then we've got this great classic to appreciate and enjoy
<START> it's a funny business reviewing movies these days when internalized emotions and emotional detachment are favored over straightforward sentimentality it must be hard to stay faithful to your true feelings br br soon after completing jury duties at the 58th berlinale i managed to catch yoji yamada's kabei br br after the screening i watched folks dreamily amble out of the theatre hall watery eyed men women and reviewers alike even the director of the berlinale obviously a hardened viewer of cinema confessed to having been caught unawares and found himself crying three quarter's way into this unashamedly sentimental experience br br but what really surprised me were the reviews that came after despite being ineffably moved by the film many reviewers chose to be tepid and emotionally non committal in their writing apparently post weeping they had put on their thinking cap and consequently missed out on what i felt was the genius about kabei br br allow me to explain br br set in pre war japan the story of kabei revolves around one writer's family and their fate therein after he is held in jail for what was described as thought crimes against the imperial will through a series of protracted emotional scenes yamada gets us familiar with the man his loyal wife and two daughters as well as three side charactersÂthe man's pretty young sister a bumbling ex student and a cad of an uncle Â all come to help the family cope with their plight in the absence of the man of the house br br the story moves along at a slow albeit steady pace and heartbreaks occur at precisely the moments everyone is able to predict this of course makes it near impossible for anyone in the audience to get too emotionally distraught by any dramatic event br br in other words although you learn to love the family and their helpers and sympathize with their unfortunate situation you get so lulled by the certainty of the plot that you find yourself expecting a particular kind of ending br br however two hours into the film don't worry yamada provides the viewer with sufficient moments of gravity and levity to tide you along he slaps you with what i can only describe as the sting all that you have assumed to be what the story was aboutÂan innocent man wrenched from his faithful wife and daughters Â now suddenly points to one of the family helpers someone you have hitherto taken for granted is now thrown into an unexpected twist of fate br br at this point something curious happened in the theatre i was in everyone started sobbing with little or no inhibition br br my word i muttered under my breath it struck me then that kabei in the final analysis was more than a film about a family torn apart by an empire on the verge of war it was in fact a cunning examination of one common human foible how little we cared about the secret feelings of people who are closest to us br br now the most common criticism made about the film was that it was technically solid but lacked innovation that's what happens when reviewers put on their proverbial thinking cap i guess with kabei i believe yoji yamada knew exactly what trick he was going to employ to touch on one unique aspect of humanity a wicked old trick he so seamlessly applied in the tora san series and later in tasogare sebei br br after lulling the audience into a sort of narrative comfort zone he throws us into a realm of emotions rarely explored in cinema br br this to me is the most effective cinematic tool of all one which avoids detection but affects you deeply and proof of its effectiveness was a thousand wet pieces of kleenex thrown into a litter bin just outside of that thousand seater cinema hall br br now if only some reviewers would resist being so caught up with being smart that they forget what cinema is really about human emotions pure and simple
<START> i was in a bad frame of mind when i first saw this movie for some reason it clicked on all my levels tensions in a family loneliness and the want of someone to share your life with it didn't hurt that the someone to share your life with was such a beautiful girl as claire cyndy preston i also bought the sound track to this movie very hard to get loved it and hope it will someday come out on dv
<START> this film is just a kids against evil genre thunderbirds is just the hook to get people to see it but are almost incidental in use the fact that the action takes place on tracy island is just a ploy to pull in the public it was interesting to note what the film makers view of future london will be and how the world all fits together br br the best part of this film are some of the lines delivered by lady penelope which are highly comical these provided some light relief for those expecting a rerun of the tv series br br having said that it passes 90 or so minutes in a 'fun' way and so may just be worth watching
<START> how a director of altman's experience could ever expect us to want to spend time with or to care about what happens to a lead character who is neurotic a whiner a jerk with no redeeming qualities that is the central puzzle about this profoundly confused piece of work a monstrous piece of trash in addition to this crippling flaw the plot line requires serious concentration to follow the setup that the branagh character walks into is so obviously a setup from the start that we are inclined to wonder whether the writer and director have totally lost respect for their audience this latter issue is at the core of the film it represents directorial self indulgence with profound contempt for the taste values and intelligence of the viewer very unusual for mr altman br br patrick watson
<START> this film is a travesty and isn't fit to keep company with the superior original the plot is an absolute mess and the film is way too long everytime they're struggling they desperately inject a sentimental reminder from the first film br br gregory's girl is one of the top 10 british films of all time this one is awful
<START> this picture started out with good intentions bacon the scientist out to test the theory of invisibility and shue is cute as usual in her role it all falls apart after that it's your typical hollywood thriller now filmed on a soundstage with special effects galore minus any kind of humour wit or soul in other words don't waste your time watching this get the audiocassette tape with john delancie as the invisible man instead also starring leonard nimoy now that was good and hg wells is well served unlike with this mess
<START> i blind bought this movie and am pretty upset that i paid as much as i did but i would say that it's at least worth a rent for some cool deaths and laughable acting it is not a good movie in any way but i must say that i was pretty darn entertained i guess it could be called so bad it's good br br as i said the acting is awful i feel like i could have done a better job showing at least any emotion the story is nothing new and has been done better i guess i just have a soft spot for any carnival esquire type film i would say rent this or download it but definitely don't buy it it is not worth more than one watch
<START> rosalind russell executes a power house performance as rosie lord a very wealthy woman with greedy heirs with an auntie mame type character this actress can never go wrong her very real terror at being in an insane assylum is a wonderful piece of acting everyone should watch this
<START> preposterous sequel stretches credibility to a great degree as diabolical sociopath stanley kaldwell returns this time infiltrating the movie production of the novel he wrote for the garden drownings assuming the identity of a second unit director he murdered br br film pokes gleeful fun at hollywood with a tongue in cheek script taking shots at tyrannical directors who sleep with their actresses looking for a way up the ladder and dislike anyone challenging them for complete spotlight brian krause who i thought was dreadful overacting to the point where the satire felt incredibly forced portrays the loud temperamental director who doesn't like the fact that his second unit director and screenplay writer alison played by dahlia salem seem to be taking over the production andrew moxham is paul parsons who is the brother of a victim from the first film the film's dark humor this time takes the idea of a serial killer actually operating as director of a movie set and exploits it for all it's worth nelson again ably slides back into his psycho role without any difficulty with stanley as clever as ever using his brains to commandeer a film production killing whoever he has to in order to maintain full control of his work letting no one stand in his way that is until alison realizes who stanley really is alison is the type of ambitious writer who wants to capture the essence of her subject what motivated stanley to kill why would he do such a thing and what led such a man down this dark path the humor of alison actually working with that very man is also part of the satire at the heart of this dark comedy thriller of course you get the inevitable showdown between alison and stanley with a really ridiculous unbelievable conclusion regarding the killer's fate quite a hard pill to swallow unlike the first film which was photographed with sophisticated polish director po chih leong uses unnecessary techniques which are not needed such as shooting an all kinds of weird angles slow motion in a sepia color and several instances which are captured on video and rather annoy instead of impress this sequel to me just wasn't on target as much as the original with a lot of the humor less effective and more obvious
<START> br br once i ignored some of the implausibilities this was actually a fairly decent horror monster flick so i'll give some of the good points first the dragon was quite convincing especially as she prowled through the tunnels looking for lunch hint she likes humans the action was fairly non stop and after a weak beginning i got quite absorbed in the storyline sorry to say i was kind of rooting for the dragon she was probably the most convincing and consistent character in the movie br br now for the implausible stuff maybe some spoilers if you were hunting a fire breathing dragon in 1100 ad would you charge into its cave with a barrel of gunpowder under your arm duh a female character with an all american name blonde hair and obvious slavic accent trying to pretend she's spanish huh a lead scientist whose slavic accent you can cut with a knife and he's supposedly born in chicago educated in usa a military helicopter pilot who does his own repairs flies a huge transport copter with no other crew and is an expert marksman and combat soldier to boot ok uh huh i won't even mention his giving 3 different call signs in 2 minutes while communicating with his base br br it's still better than some of the japanese monster flicks from the 60's but not by much if we're lucky we won't see dragon fighter 2 though naturally the ending left that possibility wide open or maybe they'll hire a real director next time br br in spite of everything i gave this flick a 4 out of 10 add 2 more if they rewrite the plot and dean cain gets eaten in the first ten minutes grin
<START> jamie foxx is fun but this movie has been done before the bad guy plays a malkovichian character from in the line of fire the cops will do anything to find the bad guy and of course the good guy has two sets of bad guys and one set of cops after him all the while he is just trying to turn over a new leaf
<START> from the first scene i was really excited i can tell this is going to be awesome i thought the acting was so good i felt as though i was eaves dropping on these peoples' lives the music too was exquisitely unsettling the plot started with a sudden event and then drifted forward one could sense toward some irrevocable fate the build was slow but i personally love that kind of thing as long as the quiet tension stays on track and doesn't get derailed before it's ready to pay off br br so everything's going fine and then the fireworks begin and before you know it the credits are rolling what was all i and my movie night companion could say if you understand the director's intentions the blunt ending does make sense for those of you who have seen the movie already check out the very fascinating and hilarious interview with larry fessenden at filmcritic com but i can't help saying it was not pulled off quite right br br this probably could have been resolved with as little as ten more minutes of material before the climax in any case it's too bad those ten minutes could have made all the difference in the world but for those of you who don't write or make films you should know that crafting a story arc with the proper timing is a huge pain in the butt and i am certainly not making this critique from any kind of pedestal br br wendigo feels to me like a masterpiece that was given up on before it was finished but hay i'd take a blunted masterpiece any day over an over produced piece of dog poo over compensated with too many digital effects like most horror movies these days br br one other comment some of the monster scenes left me confused as to whether i should be scared or laughing i don't know how to explain it but there was a distinctively monty python feel about this monster in his more blatent monster forms although this may sound like a terrible criticism for a horror movie i don't know it still worked for me in some crooked way i will never look at deer antlers in the same way again
<START> this short is a puzzlement words fail me here as this is almost indescribable technically exceptional after more than 90 years the visuals are remarkable and even occasionally amazing this is not something you watch if you like things that are mundane or normal' because it most certainly is not either this be an odd one gang well worth checking out but if things like ren and stimpy make your head hurt you may want to skip this recommended
<START> the bourne ultimatum jason bourne matt damon in his best role ever the newest spy kid on the block brings his quest for his identity to a close as he also seeks to end the cia's latest program blackbriar to make super assassins like himself br br i was so psyched for this one that i watched it's predecessors yesterday and today identity was as brilliant as i recall and supremacy remains the weak but still enjoyable link in the chain for the weakest plot and aside from a car chase which this film's chase easily tops slight lacking in action and suspense br br hoo boy does ultimatum have suspense even when you know bourne will escape the authorities and boy do these films spotlight the police as inept it's still brilliant watching him do it it's mind boggling to think that two guys with handguns and mopeds can create 10x more suspense than anything those 150 million giant robots did in transformers br br chalk it up to paul greengrass who has this idiosyncratic style of shooting stedicam a la documentary even though he's filming characters that are far from ordinary in places like cia headquarters where no one within 10 miles would be allowed with a camcorder he seemed to listen to my various complaints with supremacy as the action in ultimatum is nothing less than awe inspiring with various implements used as weapons being a candlestick a hardcover book i'll never look at those the same way again and an electric fan don't ask the music also helped generate much suspense and there was hardly ever a moment to not nail bite over br br the acting is good and the evolution of julia stiles' character nicky put her situation into a new highly sympathetic light damon plays his signature role with reserve but competency which sounds minor but that it genuinely looks like matt damon could evade the cia and interpol is something but noticeable moments of poignancy as he still struggles to find his humanity this longing of his for a real life could get boring and almost did in supremacy but just works better in ultimatum better script br br i am reminded of a scene in goldeneye the only good pierce brosnan bond film in which sean bean's character asks james if the martinis ever silence the screams of all the men he's killed bourne regrets all the people he killed and he considers or at least made me consider the meaning of action without purpose life without meaning and how the government has transformed men into resources albeit resources that know krav maga and can make weapons out of anything br br sidenote it's always bothered me that despite being a superspy and hunted by the cia interpol and the police nearly anywhere he goes that bourne never thought to make even the smallest attempts to disguise his features or forge some new passports sunglasses maybe br br if you have a pulse and love action movies than bourne ultimatum is for you hell it's probably the best action film to come out this year of course you'd be a fool to see it without watching the others first it kind of drags a touch near the end but i almost feel tempted to overlook that this is the first 3 movie this summer to at least match if not exceed the original and that is saying something br br a
<START> peter o'toole is a treat to watch in roles where the lines he speaks are good and offer a chance for him to swagger in drunken stupor the lovely susannah york provides a good foil for o'toole's dramatic presence br br the film alludes to incest without a single explicit scene but it is able to entertain the viewer in its raucous social commentary though this is not major film by any reckoning it will be remembered for its entertaining performances br br even york signing the papers at the end is a treat to watch exuding tragedy silently the possible weakness here is thompson's laid back direction but the film floats because of the actors and the script br br i saw the film twice over a period of 20 years on both occasions with the name brotherly love country dance is a rather farcical and inappropriate title for this movie wherever it was released as such
<START> this is a pretty well known one so i won't get too deep into it the basic story is about two teens who find out about a slimy alien blob of goo that arrives to earth via meteor human contact with this slime ball burns through flesh like acid it also absorbs human bodies making it grow bigger nobody believes the teens steeve mcqueen and his girlfriend and when they finally do it seems that the blob can't be stopped it's really well done for it's age and unlike a lot of other 50's flicks the pace is pretty fast the story is very unique making it and a must see for any fan of old sci fi and monster movies if you can dig the gooey gore of 80s horror be sure to check out the remake from '88 as well
<START> this film about secret government mind experiments and the corrupt use of the citizenry by secretive and vile shadowy figures had the potential for being a really interesting movie but for me it failed i won't elaborate much on the rather confusing plot line but if you are looking for a detailed explanation the comment by user reluctantpopstar gives a good description of it br br but it didn't work for me i found it slow which would be okay but for the fact that it seemed to go nowhere the viewer is left in the dark about too many things to really be able to get a handle on this movie in some films one can argue that the filmmakers intended to provoke thought and left things ambiguous for that reason i don't think that this is the case here br br as for the frequent long shots of two buildings that have been frequently mentioned by other users i see that they do have a point they give the viewer time to get another drink without missing any of the action and i suspect many viewers would welcome the opportunity to have several beverages on board to get through this one
<START> castle of blood' aka castle of terror' is a well crafted surprisingly spooky entry from italian director anthony dawson exquisite black and white cinematography flawless dubbing superb casting fairly logical scripting deliberate pacing and a surprise though totally appropriate ending set this one apart only the films sometimes hokey music and the rather abrupt love at first sight' between elizabeth barbara steele and alan georges riviÃ¨re mar an otherwise surprisingly entertaining movie br br while visiting england edgar allan poe sits in a pub telling one of his ghostly stories to count blackwood recognizing the great writer alan a young news reporter requests an interview with poe during the course of the conversation poe reveals that all of his stories are true incredulous alan expresses his skepticism about life after death count blackwood offers to bet alan 100 pounds that he cannot survive this night in blackwood's castle a night following halloween when the dead walk alan cannot afford the bet so he bets his life for a 10 pound wager br br unlike mario bava's overpraised black sunday ' aka the mask of satan' castle of blood' is fairly restrained making the few moments of violence even more dreadful especially surprising from a director usually associated with those terrible italian space movies from the 60s br br it's a pity the only version of this film i've found is badly deteriorated and recorded pan and scan version even so it is well worth seeing and cries out for a modern remake perhaps with christina ricci or jennifer love hewitt in the role of elizabeth watch it and enjoy a film that compares well with robert wise's the haunting'
<START> i happened to love the show growing up along with millions of others so i tuned in to this movie thinking if not good it might be at least a bit dazzling and fun br br wrong i just have to wonder at the end of this was charlie's angels really that boring i don't seem to remember it as such but this movie as bad as movies of this type can be bore little resemblance to the excitement of that time period and show i did see it all in spite of the negatives it wasn't unwatchable but it was very bland which i do not fault the performers for at all particularly the women who played the angels as they really did look like them the movie just wasn't that interesting it tried to make each angel a character one angel is to feisty one is the good girl one is to into her husband all characters were portrayed with one major characteristic defining them and little depth beyond stereotypes the excitement of the show was missing and the dialog was dialog that's pretty much it br br not awful not the worst of tv movies but missable
