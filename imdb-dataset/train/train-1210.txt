<START> although i agree that it's a good but not great movie for many of the reasons other posters have mentioned i still enjoy it one reason is the music i'd call attention to the very cool appearance by the candoli brothers conte and pete in a well staged scene in the nightclub these guys were two of the best jazz trumpeters of their day and they manage to convincingly boggle the mind of jimmy stewart by playing an hysterical trumpet duet one trumpet in each of stewart's ears the candolis really did play that well too though i suspect the actual music for that scene was dubbed later by the two of them i don't know much about george duning who gets the credit for the music other than that he seems to have worked with the three stooges on more than one occasion but the casting of the candoli brothers as jazz playing warlocks was a real nice touch
<START> not to long after jeff jarrett left the wwf for good he spoke of that night owen hart and him where good friends and both 2nd generation wrestlers jeff first remarks i was literally pushed thru the curtain as my lifeless friends body was wheeled past me debra mcmichael steve austin's ex wife as well as steve mondo mcmichael ex wife br br as owen hart fell a video promo the ring was darkened as a blue blazer owen hart promo was played the fall and video of owen in the ring was never showed on tv there are a few news photos that got posted when they came back from the video promo jim ross was talking over a all we had was a crowd shot he stated that owen hart as the blue blazer has fallen and doesn't look good lawler then came back from the ring his face was ashen he told jim that the situation was very critical paramedics where working hard to revive him rock and hhh where going there match in a private room when another referee came in and told them owen fell at first knowing owen harts constantly being a prankster they thought it wasn't real but both later stated that the look of the referee face said it all in fact as he fell as mentioned in other post he yelled for the referee and ring announcer to move br br brother bret hart was a plane heading to la to do a angle on the tonight show he couldn't get any of the plane phones to work one of the captains got a message to call home something had happened when he landed in la eric bishoff was there told him what had happened and put him on a charter flight to kansas city to the morgue bret even later with owens widow martha went up to the top of the arena where owen was standing police found no foul play formerly closed as a accident br br most of the information in bret harts book as well as the book by martha hart
<START> perhaps the funniest 'backstage at hollywood' movie ever especially for a look at comedy short factories like keystone br br marion davies should get a medal for bravery for taking a part where acting poorly in front of a camera is part of the role plenty of cameos for film buffs
<START> as drunken millionaire playboy arthur bach dudley moore is perfect as a grown man trapped in childhood as it turned out the role fit moore so perfectly it trapped him as an actor as well many disappointments soon followed including this film's pale sequel yet that doesn't diminish the charm or appeal of this picture which is cleverly written and directed some of moore's drunk scenes are forced parts of the film are wobbly but the cast performs with so much relish it's a difficult movie to resist it has a very big heart and gives oscar winner john gielgud a sly dryly amusing role as arthur's valet hobson his relationship with arthur is delicious and they have a miraculous rapport liza minnelli as a blue collar love interest is sassy in a low key and moore is brash but deft and lively he never shook off the shadow of arthur but at least we have this document of a career high point to cherish from
<START> when i think 'women in prison' my mind often goes to sleazy italian spanish productions by directors such as jess franco and bruno mattei and while these films are often very sleazy they're also very samey and once you've seen one you might as well have seen them all i have to admit that these types of films generally aren't my favourites but in fact the idea of women behind bars has been done very well on several occasions outside of italy and spain and roger corman's new world pictures is responsible for some of the best of them caged heat is the directorial debut of oscar winning director jonathan demme and it's a well done little flick with plenty of entertainment value naturally the film centres on the story of a girl who is caught committing crime and sent to a women's' prison where she is introduced to a host of violent inmates this prison is ruled over by the stuff wheelchair bound superintendent mcqueen and she takes offence to a play put on by the girls leading them to plot an escape br br this film is much lighter on the sleaze than i'm used to in a women in prison flick but this is more than compensated for by some great action scenes and dialogue and that's what ensures caged heat entertains throughout it does have to be said that the plot is not particularly original or ambitious and basically follows a structure similar to many other women in prison films that came before it but that's not such a big problem the film never gets boring and is peppered with standout scenes including an escape attempt while out working in a field and a bank robbery the film is helped along by assured direction from the man who would go on to helm the masterpiece the silence of the lambs and a great cast with plenty of standouts including best of all the legendary barbara steele in the role of the head prison warden overall caged heat may not leave the viewer with much to think about by the end but it's a brilliantly entertaining little grindhouse flick and anyone that enjoys this type of film will surely want to track it down
<START> for the life of me i can't figure out why anyone would make a movie like this the plot is tired the acting is strained the language is consistently foul and at times the over use of the f word seemed like a lack of dialog was prevalent so 'let's throw in another couple of f's for good measure that's what the american public wants to hear' gossett was particularly foul and seemed to enjoy his part forget this c p rent 'shrek and have a good laugh
<START> the dinner party could quite possibly be in my opinion the greatest adult cinema production of all time it is produced in such an exquisite manner and the actors portray their roles excellently the kitchen scene starring yvonne and juli ashton is magnificent the use of the butter and milk really makes the scene additionally the doctor's office scene is well done the campfire scene is filled with enjoyable action though the choice of actors in this scene is questionable asia carrera's performance in the junkyard scene is incredible but who would expect anything less from her the closing scene is somewhat over used in adult films but is classic none the less i would highly recommend this film to all fans of adult films and those casual viewers run out to your video store and pick it up today
<START> this movie makes no sense at all there are plot holes big enough to drive enormous nypd vehicles through the characters do not act in any plausible way whatsoever i will put my comments in the chat board but save your time and money this is stupid i can't stand when hollywood spends millions of dollars on flash bang equipment and uses fancy editing and cool music and does not bother to have a plot that hangs together at even the most basic level but it is nice to see denzel w prevail over the man who comes in 3 flavors jodi foster mayor bloomberg and capt von trapp there is even a sweet little kid with a video game who is nice
<START> this movie is just boring br br it tries to copy some effects borrowed to a creative director like jeunet in amÃ©lie poulain but it is too much the dialogs are pretty bad some of the worst i have ever heard guillaume canet is not convincing i have almost never found him very convincing his father in the movie plays very badly the story is dumb the ending is stupid br br i think i have not dislike a movie so much since le pacte des loups brotherhood of the wolf from christophe gans and i watch see about 80 100 movies a year but at least that movie had some action and lots of good actors br br i had never commented here only rated and when i saw the rating and the comments i thought i had to write something down br br i guess we won't have problems to sell the dvd we were offered not such a bad movie in our large collection br br i am open minded i watch sf westerns drama comedies silents horror fantasy movies but this movie was so boring that i felt like i had lost one hour and a half
<START> a true anomaly in the french cinema this despairing work has no equivalent in the contemporary production one would rather have to look on the side of louis malle's le feu follet 1963 the fire within to find something not completely unlike harel's effort wry and cynical having lost all his illusions the hero a computer scientist has got no more reason to live absolutely none estranged from the human race he seems to live his life as some kind of entomologist studying his colleagues one of them catches his attention tisserand josÃ© garcia plays the most demeaning part of the decade then tisserand will become some kind of prey all his pessimism will rub off on this poor man the scene is the night club climaxes the strange relationship the hero tells his victim that his life will always be unfulfilled unless he well now the movie takes a more conventional turn so to speak clouzot's misanthropy maybe but just for a while br br the form is weird beyond comment there are two voices over one for the narrator who always refers to the main character as our hero one for the aforementioned hero the story takes place now in paris now in rouen guy de maupassant's town in a scene with his shrink the hero says the writer's madness was only the expression of his disgust for man and he draws a parallel between his despair and maupassant's one br br this depressing movie is only suitable for an informed audience not for the very short excerpts of x rated movies but because after watching it you may be feeling down in the dumps
<START> when you see the cover of the dvd you're convinced this is some class b cheesy cheapie a film made for 1 000 in somebody's backyard br br wrong br br this is quality material and really good it's a comedy and a clever one at that it also is very touching in spots with a nice spot of kindness the production values are very good this looks excellent the actors are known the film's direction and sets are great it's amazing who would have thought br br carrie ann moss playing against type is terrific as helen robinson the june cleaver like wife billy connolly is great as the grunting good hearted zombie fido tim blake nelson mr theopolis is a hoot is the neighbor with the sexy zombie girlfriend tammy and henry czerny and dylan baker as dads check are excellent too k'sun ray as young timmy robinson shouldn't be overlooked either in fact he probably has more lines in the movie than anyone br br if i explain the story it will sound so stupid that few of you would watch it you'll just have to take the word of the people here who liked it and found it to be a very very pleasant surprise you need a dark sense of humor though an appreciation of the absurd
<START> may contain spoilers br br i say that but anyone savvy enough to be reading this can probably figure out every plot turn right from the start br br this is not a movie that i liked i didn't hate it in the way of some movies that insult your intelligence but it all felt too predictable on its trudge to the requisite happy ending there were funny bits along the way to be sure but few were original at least it didn't go for the gutter br br christina applegate looks fresh and ben affleck works hard their scenes together are actually the only redeeming feature everyone else is a cardboard cutout including surprisingly james gandolfini who must have made this as a favor to someone br br all in all it's a harmless but not inspiring 90 minutes
<START> i saw this movie originally in the theater when i was 10 even at that age the 'humor' was mildly insulting to my adolescent intelligence br br in the past whenever i would see ed begley jr or jeff goldblum i would cringe and start to feel very uncomfortable and even slightly sad until i was reminded of the existence of this movie today i was unsure why i felt that way apparently i blocked my memory of this movie yet my negative feelings towards two of the perpetrators remained apparently i forgot that i saw this movie but subconsciously mourned the pieces of my soul that had been stolen nay eaten by the creators of this inhuman work br br i haven't been brave enough to try watching it as an adult i imagine that as part of the healing process that i should probably look at confronting this childhood fear so that i can truly put it behind me some regression therapy and or hypnosis might not be a bad idea either
<START> power rangers the moronic merchandising television kids show from the 1990s has got to be the most pointless and ridiculous television show ever created br br what exactly is the point of this show anyway other than to sell second rate plastic nonsense to children there is nothing even remotely redeeming or interesting about this show in anyway br br look at the costumes which look like spandex gone bad br br the mullet style hair earrings and fashions of the early 1990s look completely ridiculous these days br br avoid this show at all costs
<START> as a low budget enterprise in which the filmmakers themselves are manufacturing and distributing the dvds themselves we perhaps shouldn't expect too much from broken in disc form and yet what's most remarkable about this whole achievement is the fact that this release comes with enough extras to shame a james cameron dvd and a decidedly fine presentation br br with regards to the latter the only major flaw is that broken comes with a non anamorphic transfer otherwise we get the film in its original 1 85 1 ratio demonstrating no technical flaws and looking pretty much as should be expected indeed given ferrari's hands on approach in putting this disc together you can pretty much guarantee such a fact br br the same is also true of the soundtrack here we are offered both dd2 0 and dd5 1 mixes and whilst i'm uncertain as to which should be deemed the original the fact that ferrari had an involvement in both means neither should be considered as inferior indeed though the dd5 1 may offer a more atmosphere viewing experience owing to the manner in which it utilizes the score both are equally fine and free of technical flaws br br as for extras the disc is positively overwhelmed by them take a look at the sidebar on the right of the screen and you'll notice numerous commentaries loads of featurettes and various galleries indeed given the manner in which everything has been broken down into minute chunks rather than compiled into a lengthy documentary there really is little to discuss the 'anatomy of a stunt' featurette for example is exactly what it claims to be and the same goes for the rest of pieces as such we get coverage on pretty much ever aspect of broken's pre production production and post production and whilst it may have been preferable to find them in a more easily digestible overall 'making of' in this manner we do get easy access to whatever special feature we may wish to view br br of the various pieces then it is perhaps only the commentaries which need any kind of discussion then again there's also a predictable air to each of the chat tracks the one involving the actors is overly jokey and doesn't take the film too seriously ferrari's pieces are incredibly enthusiastic about the whole thing and the technical ones are well extremely technical of course we also get some crossover with what's been covered elsewhere on the discs but at only 19 minutes none of these pieces outstay their welcome indeed all in all a fine extras package
<START> as is nearly always the case when britain comes up with an entertaining and or successful sit com or quiz show the yanks will come along and poach the format and produce their own grossly inferior version man about the house is of course no exception to that rule the yanks' version three's company was unwatchable braindead pap that seem to run forever a prime example of quantity over non existent quality the original on the other hand is a fondly remembered gem that had the savvy like fawlty towers to pull the plug at precisely the right time unlike the 637 episodes of 'hilarity' that three's company came up with jo was cute there was brilliant chemistry between the ropers richard o'sullivan made it all look so easy the scripts whilst not exactly oscar wilde standard were consistently funny and chrissy was the most drop dead gorgeous woman who has walked the face of this planet since the dead sea was merely feeling unwell 'nuff said
<START> probably the first portuguese film i have seen in my life and i enjoyed it the plot is related of how the young army officers took the power in portugal in 1974 to finally defeat the fascist government of caetano and to also finalize the wars in the colonies i e mozambique angola and guinea bissau cape vert most of the events shown in the film reflect with exactitude the behavior of the army officers and soldiers to conduct the coup of the oppressed people who were very happy with this new development and the liberty the resistance of caetano's men and also in a subtle way of most conservative officials including spinola who took over as the new president the portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young officers but for me the most interesting part of the film was when the young captain expressed that portugal should develop itself democratically and this is what the country achieved some years after this coup or revolution the film also shows that the army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone even the most serious enemies were respected at the end
<START> despite some reviews being distinctly luke warm i found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as 'mills and boon' so what it is good to see a warm touching story of real love in these cynical times many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes you really believe that the young victoria and albert are passionately fond of each other even though for political reasons it was an arranged marriage i did feel though that sir john conroy who was desperate to control the young queen is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain as it is rumoured that he was in fact the real father of victoria as a result of an affair with her mother the duchess of kent it would have been interesting to explore this theory emily blunt is totally convincing as the young princess trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her she brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made victoria a great queen of england which prospered as never before under her long reign i believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie
<START> having read another review i thought this movie would actually be good i do enjoy the b movies but this couldn't even be classed as such the photography is probably the only half way decent thing in the movie but the editing left much to be desired it was very choppy and staccato whoever chose the music and sound did a terrible job the music was awful specially anything atmospheric or scene setting if the acting had been better they could have pulled the movie off unfortunately i've seen better acting in porn flicks if you want to see a b vampire movie check out 'blood ties' you'll be much more entertained
<START> well then what is it i found nicholson's character shallow and most unfortunately uninteresting angelica huston's character drained my power and kathleen turner is a filthy no good slut it's not that i don't get it it's not that i don't think that some of the ideas could've lead to something more this is a film with nothing but the notion that we're supposed to accept these ideas and that's what the movie has going for it that nicholson falls for turner is absurd but then again it is intended to be so this however does not strike me as a funny or b even remotely interesting this was a waste of my time so don't let the hype get the best of you it is a waste of your time with all that being said the opening church sequence is quite beautiful
