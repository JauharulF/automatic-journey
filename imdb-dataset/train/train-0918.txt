<START> being the beatlemaniac that i am i approached two of us with a combination of fear and fascination having seen 'in his life the john lennon story' i was quite concerned that two of us will turn out no better the fact that aidan quinn and jared harris look absolutely nothing like john lennon and paul mccartney Â even with some make up and proper hairdos Â didn't help one bit br br but i was more than a bit pleasantly surprised it's probably thanks to the involvement of michael lindsay hogg who directed let it be in 1970 and consequently probably knew john and paul quite well that the characters and the dialogue came across as convincing as they did the writing credit for two of us is given to a man named mark stanfield of whom i know absolutely nothing i feel confident that director lindsay hogg had more than a bit to do with the script two of us is not a biography of the beatles it has very little plot in fact and takes place all in one day in new york city what it does is imagine a meeting between john and paul in 1976 while john lived in new york that meeting is entirely fictitious of course Â though it can't truly be disproved that such a meeting actually took place but through that imagined conversation it gives us a glimpse into the personalities of these two great musicians Â their intelligence their sense of humor their different reaction to stardom and most of all their relationship what made them such a great team and what broke them up br br since it's a talk movie nothing much except for dialogue between two characters for an hour and a half it's likely to bore all but true fans of the beatles but it's a fantastic piece of writing and storytelling and is both informative and touching for those interested in these two musical giants very quickly you'll get over the shock of how different the actors look from their counterparts and feel like john and paul had come to life Â so intimate and convincing is the script and so committed are the actors two of us gives you priceless insight into the lives of two geniuses and a tale that is both sad and funny most certainly recommended
<START> wild tigers i have known it will only be showing in big cities to be sure it is one of those films so artsy that it makes no sense what so ever except to the director i hate those and all of those oh so alternative artsy people try desperately to find metaphors in what is evident horseshit br br there was no plot no story no moral no chronology and nothing amusing or even touching to me it was a bunch of scenes thrown together that had nothing to do with one another and were all for show to show how artsy and visual they could get it was an attempt at yet another teen angst film but missed the mark on every level humanly possible then the credits roll i was waiting for it to make sense i was waiting for the good part i own about 60 independent films in my dvd collection many of which could arguably be called art house films this will not be amongst them you will be very angry at yourself for paying to see this film much less ever buying it on dvd
<START> i really wonder how this show plays in the u k and the rest of europe it is so self loathing about being an american particularly white americans that could be a big reason for some of the venom and vitriol expressed here on this board i love the show but it is with some reservations and i feel it took the easy way out by spoiler spoiler br br crashing and burning everything at the end of the second season julie slammed the door shut on any hope of reviving the show unless her character lands on a haystack in the middle of some farm who knows it was a funny raunchy and on occasion kinda scary show
<START> for urban cowboy john travolta plays one of the stronger alpha males ever portrayed on the big screen he's a decent enough young kid who leaves his parent's homestead and strikes out for the big city of dallas where his uncle barry corbin has promised to find him work in the petrochemical industry in 1980 that was beginning to boom and texas was definitely a growing place in the usa br br travolta does a good job in making we the audience care about his character who when you come right down to it is a sexist pig he meets and marries debra winger who's from the same background but she's got some ideas that women should not be shadows of their men and when she beats him at gilley's mechanical bull a man's game that's it for him br br scott glenn who's an ex convict is working at gilley's and this film was his breakout role he's a real snake in urban cowboy he gets travolta's goat with a mere look and he moves in on winger travolta in turn takes up with rich girl madolyn smith osborne who's slumming at gilley's br br despite the characters urban cowboy was really one gigantic commercial for the self styled biggest honky tonk in the world gilley's is no longer there in the suburban texas community of pasadena but the memories do live on and the best thing about urban cowboy is the wonderful score of country western songs that were featured in the film i'm not sure if some of the songs were not written specifically for urban cowboy but it's the only reason i can think of why the motion picture academy ignored the musical aspects of this film i especially liked johnny lee's looking for love if it was specifically written for this film it's a disgrace that it wasn't nominated for best song br br i liked debra winger's character best in this film she doesn't lose a trace of femininity but she stands up to travolta and does it in style and this review is dedicated to that yet as unknown woman who will one day be the first woman bull rider in the professional bull riders
<START> a remake of alejandro amenabar's abre los ojos but this time with a living breathing mask as a lead for the dubious advantage of an english sound track we endure tom cruise's soulless performance as usual with zero depth yes the character is identified with his persona but we usually are given some character underneath that to hold our interest his empty posturing negates any erotic energy that could have been between his character and cruz or diaz br br there is an acting exercise that involves using masks to free the actor to enrich his presentation of character by verbal and body language means cruise's masking only painfully emphasizes his inadequacy as an actor do see the 1997 original amenabar open your eyes
<START> i rented this movie this past weekend cranked up the surround sound system and got some great sound from special affects this movie is a great movie rental the special affects where enough to scare my fiance but i noticed some looked suprisingly computer generated i didn't go to the movies and see this but its a scary late night don't feel like going out movie i would recommend it
<START> gÃ©dÃ©on and jules naudet wanted to film a documentary about rookie new york city firefighters what they got was the only film footage inside the world trade center on september 11 br br having worked with james hanlon's ladder company before jules went with the captain to inspect and repair a gas leak while gÃ©dÃ©on stayed at the firehouse in case anything interesting happened an airplane flying low over the city distracted jules and he pointed the camera up seconds before the plane crashed into tower one br br jules asked the captain to follow him into the towers the first thing he saw was two people on fire something he refused to film he stayed on site for the next several hours filming reactions of the firefighters and others who were there br br the brothers naudet took great care in not making the movie too violent grizzly and gory but the language from the firefighters is a little coarse and cbs showed a lot of balls airing it uncensored the brothers naudet mixed footage they filmed with one on one interviews so the firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions during particular moments of the crisis br br unlike a feature film of similar title most of the money from dvd sales go to 9 11 related charities very well made emotional moving and completely devoid of political propaganda is the best documentary of the sort to date
<START> this movie is so bad that i cannot even begin to describe it what in the blazing pit is wrong with the writers producers and director how on earth did they get funding for this abomination the plot is laughable the acting is poor at best the story what story the first fight in this movie is ok but then it keeps repeating itself until you want to turn it off br br i guess i'm the biggest looser for not turning this stupid movie off after the first minute br br spoler alert br br i only saw this movie because scott adkins was in it and he is in it for 30 seconds br br i give it 1 out of 10 because it's the lowest grade imdb has to offer br br do yourself a favour see an uwe boll movie instead twice it's more worthy of your time
<START> fans of goremeister herschell gordon lewis should look elsewhere if they are picking up this film for his usual buckets of blood being sloshed about for there is precious little in the way of bloodletting in this film instead lewis decides to try and tell the bizarre story relying on bargain basement special effects on a budget which could have probably been doubled if the cast had turned out their pockets for change one day oddly enough while cheap and very poorly acted especially by mccabe as mitchell the total outlandishness of the plot keeps attention throughout imagine what this film could have been like with a decent budget overall it strains for champagne tastes on a beer budget
<START> i watched this movie last night on one of the pay per view channels and while watching it i quickly wondered why i bothered in all honesty i really did expect something more from this film maybe something along the lines of 'conspiracy theory' why maybe because of the casting i mean nicolas cage and harvey keitel after all not to mention jon voight and christopher plummer now i'm wondering why did they bother but instead of an absorbing action cum mystery drama i was caught up in a pastiche of breakneck silliness a lÃ  'the goonies' which to my great surprise appears to have garnered some actual critical praise perhaps it's because 'the goonies' was clearly targeted toward the pre teen and teen audiences whereas 'national treasure' judging from the previews was seriously intended to appeal to an adult audience br br suspension of disbelief is one thing it's how one can enjoy sci fi and horror but i found myself actually resisting the heaping tablespoons of paranoid and conspiracy laden tripe being shoved at the audience oh the screenwriter threw around all the jargon intended to evoke a sense of serious engaged wonderment wow the masons the knights templars you know this could really be true i think the writer really lost me when gates said the founding fathers hid the treasure to keep it out of the hands of the british and just were did the knights templar come from new jersey oh i forget from france which goes a long way to explain how it ended up in philadelphia during the revolution it was brought there by agents of napoleon anyway you see what i'm getting at the premise of the movie is interesting and i really do think it could have succeeded as a serious mystery drama but it just comes off as another kid flick in grown up clothing in the end i think it asks the audience not simply to suspend belief but to render itself willfully ignorant to an insulting degree br br i've just finished watching several items by werner herzog and istvan szabo it's a shock to switch from fine dining to hollywood big mac and fries br br okay okay if you pant over chases explosions and 'gee whiz' gimmickry you'll enjoy 'national treasure' but it's the sort of movie well have you ever stood outside a cinema waiting to get in while the previous audience comes out and all the young kids are talking excitedly among themselves and saying things like wow did you see how that thing blew up that was so cool 'national treasure' is that kind of movie
<START> im not a big tim matheson fan but i have to admit i liked this film it was dark and a small bit disturbing with some scenes a bit edgy i don't know were to classify this film its a bit sf and a bit horror slash thriller i saw this at about 2 00am or so on my local channel there was nothing else on so i decided to watch it if you have not seen this film id recommend it its not really that bad the characters are interesting enough but not really explored to their full potential which could have made this film even more better i don t know if this film went to the cinema but it felt like it was made for tv or went straight to video i for one would buy this if it s on dvd it fits well with my type of film and has a small bit of the x files story attached to it government undertakings or shifty corporations involved in dodgy shadowy dealings overall a good film
<START> director warren beatty's intention to turn chester gould's famous comic strip into a live action cartoon with beatty himself cast in the lead as the square jawed detective had sweet overtures of innocent nostalgia quite unusual and intriguing coming from warren beatty unfortunately the picture is requisite ham fun for awhile but eventually tiring dick tracy attempts to bring down mobster big boy caprice aided by loving tess trueheart but tripped up by evil breathless mahoney for the first half hour or so the oscar winning art direction and set design are wonderful to absorb but as the plot creaks along predictably with no real sting in the writing things begin to congeal al pacino got a surprise supporting oscar nomination as bad boy caprice and madonna who is mostly used as a decorative prop gets to sing stephen sondheim's sooner or later i always get my man which copped the award for best original song lots of heart thanks to beatty who was dedicated to his vision but the picture is too cool and calculated it lacks heat 1 2 from
<START> i have not yet decided whether this will replace anaconda as the worst film i have ever seen br br even if you ignore the dodgy accents low production values and appalling camera work this film has absolutely nothing going for it i only went to see it as i had read the book and wanted to see how they would work the complicated plot into a 2 hour film br br the simple answer is they didn't characters appear with little to no explanation as to who they are and then proceed to play no valuable part in the narrative even the main characters act without reason so that by the time the film reaches it's climax you don't care what happens to any of them br br i can accept that books occasionally need to be rewritten to fit into films and that it is perhaps unfair to judge this film against the book it was adapted from but after my friends and i came out of the cinema i had to spend most of the journey home explaining what was supposed to have happened br br they even change the true meaning of the books title rancid aluminium by squeezing it into yet another piece of pointless voice over just so they can allow the film to have a cool title br br a real mess of a film from start to finish
<START> i am appalled at how bad this film is as a pastiche of early 20th century hollywood artistes it sets a new low even past the moderns or gasp cradle will rock i never thought i'd see a film worse than those 2 granted they were about a slightly different milieu period nevertheless the intents results were distressingly similar br br first off there's the horrible casting eddie izzard as chaplin excuse me peter did you owe this guy something jennifer tilly as loulla parsons kirsten dunst as marion davies holy smoke these people don't even begin to try to capture the look or sound of the period they are purportedly depicting br br well last picture show was a decent film but this thing is a disaster the rest of bogdonovitch's pics haven't been much better guess rubbing up against welles hitch ford wore off a long time ago still good for hosting tcm though
<START> lets first start this review with the fact that i signed up just to write the review and warn people to save their money br br this was one of the worst pieces of trash i have seen since the hulk the storyline was the most predictable garbage you could possibly come up with if you are expecting 24 but on the big screen flush that expectation down the toilet immediately along with the money you would use for a ticket you may get more enjoyment that way the acting was terrible the plot was completely unrealistic along with the so called twist in the end i must say this the ending did surprise me i am not referring to the plot twist that surprised me but instead the effortless manner that they put together what could be considered the only scene of somewhat decent action in the entire movie they rushed the ending so quickly that i didn't even realize that it was over until i saw the credits rolling and at that point i considered burning the reel of film if i could just figure out how to get into that screening room br br casting was awful for a few reasons first of all they must have accidentally switched the character assignments because michael douglas played the roll that clearly keifer sutherland should have been playing while douglas was sneaking around agents tapping phone lines hacking into systems and taking out people who are chasing after him sutherland plays the less capable agent who is always in a bad mood even when things aren't going that badly for him he plays a very bland agent nothing like his jack bauer type roll us 24 fans love br br i can just about promise you that this movie will disappoint in all areas it can be best compared to a remake of the the fugitive in the line of fire but written by people with mental disabilities
<START> rois et reine is a sprawling mess of a movie which will probably irritate as many viewers as it delights it focuses by turns on ex lovers nora emanuelle devos and ismael mathieu amalric as they each confront a major crisis in their now separate lives while nora's story is played straight and is sombre in tone ismael's is played mainly for laughs although it's not particularly funny nora's crisis is triggered by the terminal illness of her father louis maurice garrel and ismael's by his sudden incarceration in a mental hospital at the instigation of a mysterious third party ismael and louis are just two of the males who have shaped nora's life and in turn have been shaped by her the most notable others being her now deceased first lover pierre and their young son elias as events past and present are played out for the audience and the ex lovers become involved in each other's lives once more it gradually emerges that nora's personal take on her life story may be less reliable than first meets the eye br br cult director arnaud desplechin has fashioned a considerable oddity here one which has garnered major plaudits in france he wilfully eschews established narrative convention and develops the movie via a series of dramatic shifts in mood and tone had this approach been founded on a coherent unifying core idea or theme it might have worked but it's not clear in the end what exactly desplechin's film is actually about heavy handed allusions to greek mythology and freudian theory are evidently freighted with meaning but at least for this unschooled movie goer remain less than helpful in illuminating and interpreting the lives of the characters at other times the treatment lapses into kitsch but the use of the anodyne moon river as the film's theme tune suggests this is probably deliberate br br spoiler alert i suspect a major theme of the movie is the not very original observation that how we see ourselves can differ radically from how others see us or even how we think others see us this idea is most obviously represented in the film by the violent death of pierre and the revelation contained in louis' secret diary but unfortunately both events seem entirely disconnected from what has otherwise been revealed to the audience of pierre and louis' respective relationships with nora this seems a cheat on desplechin's part as if he is thrusting the idea upon us in unmediated form rather than illustrating it more subtly in the natural course of the narrative one or two darkly surreal touches imply the presence of an alternative but largely unconscious world of persons stripped frighteningly bare but again these are felt more as pretentious intrusions of film making technique rather than eruptions from a deeper reservoir of truth inherent in the story in fact for all its heavy handed hints at depth the characters are curiously undeveloped and unnuanced as if they function more as ciphers for their creator's many ideas about people rather than as real people in their own right much of the detail of their lives seems arbitrarily applied rather than organic for example ismael as we are constantly reminded is a viola player but more than two hours pass before we actually see or hear him play and the effect of his chosen instrument or profession upon his personality is never elaborated hence he may just as well be a marine biologist or a trapeze artist br br amalric brings a certain manic charm to the unhinged but ultimately sane ismael but i found devos cloying and monotone which may be intentional however as the elusive nora meanwhile jean paul roussillon as ismael's father elsa wolliaston as his psychoanalyst and magalie woch as the psychically wounded but defiant sinologist he befriends in hospital make the biggest impact amongst the supporting actors catherine deneuve's in it too though her role is little more than a self referential cameo br br ultimately rois et reine is very much an acquired taste should it fail to push your buttons it's very likely that desplechin's undisciplined and florid approach will frustrate and exasperate even as you somehow keep watching
<START> i caught this movie on the sundance channel on cable one late afternoon you might say who loves the sun is a perfect leisurely pastime of a story why ever not you get to hang out with the trio lukas haas is will returning after abruptly leaving everyone years ago molly parker is maggie we learn she's very much part of the family bloom and adam scott is daniel is he friend or foe or fiancÃ© by the scenic falcon lake manitoba canada captured in graphic compositions juxtaposed in vivid summer colors against sunshine and shadows and supporting the trio are two more family members in the revealing mix wendy crewson is mom mary bloom and r h thomson is dad arthur bloom writer director matt bissonnette has delivered an ingenious unfolding of story line and its various tentacle links worry not haas may have a 'listless' face but humor will come as parker and scott enter the circle of friends reunited wry smiles will break and knowing delights stir dialogs may be terse or even nil yet we'd get the flavor of what's cooking bemused or wondering br br yes who loves the sun can very well be categorized as a sleeper gem the chemistry between all five principals sure gels and 'combusts' giving an energetic ensemble performance after all it's all in the family and the film sure doesn't take itself too seriously br br looks like the official site is still available at wholovesthesun com and there are information on the soundtrack by mac mccaughan portastatic with guitar tunes and strings where score excerpts are being played and behind the scenes production notes interview with writer director producer bissonnette on how the movie and concept came about the casting and more have always appreciate molly parker since her spare yet mesmerizing performance in 1996 lynne stopkewich's 'kissed' and she's married to bissonnette who wrote the maggie part for molly
<START> joe don baker is one of a handful of actors who is often better than his material and almost always under appreciated he's been in a ton of films either as a heavy or a hero and has the type of strong solid presence that wallace beery did half a century before him baker can delivery material that would sound ridiculous coming out of another actor and that's what's so great about him he really seems to mean what he's saying regardless of how clichÃ© obvious or silly which puts him in a league with tommy lee jones oliver reed and don stroud it's what made the walking tall trilogy work so well and that same magic is here in final justice this was a substantial hit in theaters and on video in the 80s and it has aged a lot better than many of the perhaps better known action flicks of the era by moving the action from texas to europe there's a real timeless quality that doesn't jar you away from the action on screen to be honest i've always enjoyed the films of greydon clark who is a no nonsense director in the same vein as 1970s clint eastwood and this is one of his best final justice is one of the lost gems of the late 80s similar to man on fire in its true grit and violence i suppose if they remake this with the rock a whole new audience will come to love it as much as i do
<START> well what can one say firstly this adaptation is far too long at 4 hours for the complexity or lack of such of the plot the actors try really hard to make something of this film but there is too little content for the time available swayzee is really not a quatermain character at all after seeing sean connery's interpretation of the great man in the league of extraordinary gentlemen swayzee really does not make the grade this chap with the winchester repeating rifle has none of the strength stature subtlety or humour needed for the part and is upstaged by everyone including the witch doctor who incidentally seems from my point of view to be more convincing as an actor than the rest of the cast some of the vistas are pleasing but there are silly mistakes in the cinematography for example when the happy team arrive at the water hole in the middle of the desert their tracks are visible down to the oasis just waiting for them to walk in them climbing out of the mine leads to an exit on the next shot nothing like the exit seen from the passage they have climbed through et cetera i was waiting for doug mcclure to appear at any moment in some ways i wish he had br br the leader of the russians pursuing quatermain is a shoddily created stereotypical character who just shoots at everything br br swayzee does quite well as the sad father returned to london who is unable to obtain the custody of his son swayzee should stick to that sort of thing he is not able to carry the part of a courageous gentleman with a stout heart experience of life and sense of fair play br br 4 out of 10 barely
<START> a real blow up of the film literally this british film is boringly made br br what an exciting plot a terrorist places bombs on a train how could the writers and producers of this stinker turn this into such a dull story br br glenn ford as the expert called upon to defuse the bomb is given awful writing material to work with naturally just as he is called in his wife anne vernon is about to leave him no wonder we never heard of miss vernon after such a film it would be enough to end her career br br that elderly man who loved trains and interferes is our 1953 version of senile dementia i thought it was highly insulting to show this man even at the end
