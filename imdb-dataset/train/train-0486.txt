<START> this is one of those movies which makes you think would hulk the real american hogan have done the same frankly i don't think so and he'd have been right i'm italian i cannot go proud of my country for many reasons but i wouldn't have rowed for another team the french for example simply because i'm in love with juliette binoche besides the protagonist doesn't fall in love desire with a british girl at the end of the movie but with a fellow countrywoman so why rowing against yale as far as acting is concerned well all the players act very poorly and then you know i hated that dead poets society atmosphere in fact that's another movie i hate
<START> this film seems to get bad critiscism for some reason probably just by the mass populace anyhow this is actually a very interesting movie the film is an under budget sci fi movie which actually works due to an interesting storyline and well done scenes br br this movie may not be for everyone though if there are any sci fi fans reading this i truly recommend this movie if you like good ole science fiction the film has crazy ideas the setting includes nations going to war with gigantic machines which the entire countries invest all it's money in the world has been divied up into territories anyone can challenge anyone else to a war or rather a 'robot duel' the method of warfare is cleaner than nuclear war since now everyone is wearing those breath masks definetly a movie that makes you think intelligent well written and good effects for the measly budget br br i tend to like movies which have small budgets and actually work
<START> the first episode set the bar quite high i thought it starred william hurt as a hit man who is contracted to kill a toymaker we are given very little information on his character or who is paying him to kill indeed the episode is notable for having no dialogue at all returning to his modernist penthouse he is delivered a package containing toy soldiers this gives him a smile but he dismisses it and goes about his business but he is in for a night of hell the soldiers are alive and are about to wage war driving jeeps shooting machine guns and bazookas and even flying helicopters the special effects are good for a tv show and it becomes quite tense as he dodges around the apartment using his wits to survive sometimes getting the upper hand and other times not i wont spoil the ending but suffice to say it was a clever little twist this gave me hope for the rest of the series but i was in for a disappointment the other episodes were all rubbish and i lost interest by the fourth one stephen king adaptations are always a mixed bag and these are no exception
<START> i used to love sabrina the teenage witch and have seen every single episode i remember when i used to sit at 6pm every night and wait for it to come on nickelodeon however when sabrina left high school the show began to go downhill the best series has to be when she was friends with valerie i'm not sure which one that is from there the next series friends with dreama was still really good but when she left high school it just didn't seem right all the main characters seemed to have left which meant that it didn't have as much of the old sparkle however the first series where sabrina is in college is still relatively good and watchable however when her aunt's leave and sabrina moves into their house it just isn't right she is no longer a teenager so therefore the name of the show isn't right and without hilda and zelda and josh the show just doesn't seem right especially when sabrina nearly marries someone that isn't harvey thank goodness he came through in the last five minutes of the last episode to take her away all in all i still love to watch the old episodes of sabrina the teenage witch but i think the writers took it too far and should have left it with sabrina leaving high school because after that the show definitely lost some of it's magic
<START> i just watched the last wave in my school's fine arts library it's intriguing like all peter weir's stuff but it's not always as attention holding as i would have liked i found myself fascinated by the ideas being thrown at me because they are very well handled by the film's director weir but at the same time i was not stimulated enough by them aka i got a little bored in spots br br the plot surrounds an aussie lawyer who becomes obsessed with certain dreams he has which link him to an aborigone group he is defending br br it starts out with an intense weather sequence and has some very awesome mood effects throughout most notably the bizarre belching sound design and strong direction but it just didn't entertain me like weir's later films do i might just need to watch it again though br br good film about obsession and mystery because in the end the mystery that exists between the whites and the aboriginies offers some very severe consequences br br god bless peter weir though for him alone this film is worth watching very organic director like an aussie response malick i'd give it a 7 because it's got enough great ideas to overcome its boring moments
<START> the lowest score possible is one star that's a shame really i'm going to lobby imdb for a zero stars option to give this film even a single star is giving way too much am i the only one who noticed the microphones dangling over hopper's head at the station and the acting or should i say the lack thereof apparently talent wasn't a factor when the casting director came to town my little sister's elementary school talent show provides greater range and depth of emotion and those fake irish accents were like nails on a chalk board the only thing that could have made this movie worse would have been oh wait no no it's already as bad as it can get
<START> the only previous gordon film i had watched was the kiddie adventure the magic sword 1962 though i followed this soon after with empire of the ants 1977 he seems to be best remembered however for his sci fi work of the 1950s br br anyway i happened upon this one in a dvd rental shop hadn't i noticed orson welles' unmistakable figure on the sleeve i probably wouldn't even have bothered with it â since i know the film under its original title necromancy i'd seen a still from it on an old horror tome of my father's the actor's presence in a film about diabolism seemed like a great idea which couldn't possibly miss but the end result â particularly in this bastardized edition â is a disaster i honestly felt sorry for welles who looks bored and rather than in his deep and commanding voice he mutters the inane demonic invocations almost in whispers br br the plot is basically yet another retread of rosemary's baby 1968 a couple is invited to a remote community under false pretenses and soon discover themselves to be surrounded by diabolists the girl played by pamela franklin ostensibly has supernatural powers passed on from her mother who appears intermittently throughout to warn her â though as delivered in an intense manner through clenched teeth the latter's speeches end up being largely incoherent and the fount of immense hilarity every time she appears and is expected to revive welles' deceased young son from the dead for what it's worth franklin â a genre regular right down from her debut performance in the innocents 1961 â isn't bad in her role which requires some nudity and experiences several semi eerie hallucinations during the course of the film hubby michael ontkean however isn't up to the challenge of his john cassavetes like character some of the other girls look good as well â notably lee purcell whose belated decision to help franklin in escaping from town eventually proves her undoing br br events come to a head in an incredibly muddled climax which sees the satanists ultimately turning on franklin and have her take the revived boy's place in the coffin that's gratitude for you while the added scenes do stick out the hilarious opening ceremony and other would be erotic embellishments the overall quality of the film would have still been poor without them then again this particular version is further sunk by the tacked on electronic score â which is wholly inappropriate and cheesy in the extreme
<START> everything i remember about it was excellent great cast with sam waterston george innes before he became more familiar to us audiences excellent scripts as only the english can do edwardian sherlock holmes lord peter wimsey albert campion type mysteries but with a jules verne twist sort of like macgyver would have been had it been in england 80 years earlier right at the beginning of the scientific technological revolution of the 20th century br br i've often wondered if the creators of macgyver saw these shows macgyver first aired about 3 years later br br i still have 1 episode on a much deteriorated tape
<START> spoilers spoilers after two so so outings magnum force and the enforcer dirty harry seems to have regained his stride in sudden impact a gripping thriller that wisely plays to its strengths the charisma of clint eastwood who also directed and a story that spends just enough time on exposition and reserves its energy for the big scenes br br for once the case takes harry outside his native san francisco where he's again in trouble with his superiors for his shoot first ask questions later tactics to the hamlet of san paulo there warning potential spoiler a group of lowlifes is being gruesomely murdered one at a time by a woman whom they gang raped years earlier and whose sister has been in a state of catatonia ever since the attack br br the killer is portrayed by sondra locke and she makes the character of jennifer spencer an interesting mix of compassion and cold bloodedness locke's cold eyes and frosty voice when either trying to comfort her hospitalized sister or dispensing vengeance toward the rapists are very effective in painting a portrait of a woman wronged whose years of suffering and rage are now beginning to bear deadly fruit br br the rapists are a despicable lot especially the leader who has psycho nutjob practically stamped on his forehead and a lesbian who seems almost one of the guys despite her anatomical inability to participate the flashback scenes while not graphically explicit are nightmarish enough and clearly intended to make the audience cheer for jennifer as she kills her assailants br br some will dismiss sudden impact as trash a mindless manipulative revenge tale on a certain level this is true but it's well done trash what works to the movie's advantage is the strength of the sondra locke performance giving us a complex character whose wounds are more visible in her paintings than in her gestures or speech what we have here is an action movie with a point of view br br you can take or leave the idea that some wrongs deserve to be punished by any means necessary but as the mystery behind the slayings becomes clear to harry a realization that wisely is not spelled out with dialogue he is presented with a choice what to do about a killer whose motivations he can sympathize with but whose conduct he is bound by law to not tolerate this makes the story more interesting than the usual dirty harry fare br br the movie's other redeeming quality is eastwood's direction this is after all a dirty harry movie and eastwood knows the character better than anyone else the movie is directed with style and wit and edited to give the action scenes a big payoff some of the best harry moments in the entire series are here including harry's best known line go ahead make my day br br sudden impact is a movie that has the courage of its convictions in presenting a tale about a despicable crime and the brutal consequences that follow it is also a riveting detective story well made and well told and it is certainly never dull on those criteria it succeeds tremendously
<START> really i can't believe that i spent 5 on this movie i am a huge zombie fanatic and thought the movie couldn't be that bad it had zombies in it right was i wrong to be honest the movie had it's moments i thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it overall i think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again the movie could have been better if we could see some boob but i had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that buyer beware unless you are into masochism
<START> director douglas sirk scores again with this the grandaddy of all dysfunctional family films this lush trashy saga is a masterpiece beautifully combining all of the elements of sirk's soapers and strategically placing them all into one movie written on the wind very obviously influenced the 1980s tv series dallas and dynasty as this is basically a feature length version of those later nighttime soaps br br lauren bacall wonderfully and subtly plays lucy moore a new york city secretary who marries oil baron kyle hadley robert stack unbeknownst to both of them mitch wayne rock hudson is also in love with the quiet but sexy secretary they all go back to kyle's family's mansion in texas where we meet his white trash slut of a sister marylee dorothy malone in an oscar winning turn yipee the sparks begin to fly from the romances to the catfights this is a campy trip not only does mitch have to fight the feelings he has for his best friend's wife but marylee tries to sleep with everybody since she can't have her one true love who is mitch topping it all off kyle learns he's impotent but somehow lucy ends up pregnant br br this is pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment how can you not love it this film signals one of universal's most popular films and one of director sirk's best works some of the dialogue is absolutely sizzling and visual metaphors are thrown in every which way the theme of wind throughout is great the cast is great although bacall is completely underused despite receiving top billing behind hudson stack's oscar loss reportedly devastated him he considered this his finest performance and apparently was none too pleased to lose out and he did turn out a fabulous performance as the whimpering alcoholic what a stunning movie this film proves what i've been thinking for ages sirk is the master of classic melodrama where's his oscar br br
<START> this is a film i decided to go and see because i'm a huge fan of adult animation i quite often find that when a film doesn't evolve around a famous actor or actress but rather a story or style it allows the film to be viewed as a piece of art rather than a showcase of the actors ability to differ his styles br br this film is certainly more about style than story while i found the story interesting a thriller that borrows story and atmosphere from films such as blade runner and many anime films it was a bit hard to follow at times and didn't feel like it all came together as well as it could have it definitely had a mixed sense of french animation and japanese anime coming together whether thats a good thing or not is up to the viewer visually this film is a treat for the eyes and in that sense a work of art br br if you like adult animation or would like to see a film that is different from most films out at the moment i would recommend it all i can say is that i enjoyed the experience of the film but did come away slightly disappointed because it could have been better
<START> this is meant to be a comedy but mainly bad taste and nothing remotely causing a smile in the film the movie is about a couple trying for a child and those people in real life who are in that situation will wince at the depictions that are portrayed for instance scenes at a fertility clinic are not in the least funny and are quite frankly embarrassing the male lead who plays a construction worker and in his hard hat comes across as a poor excuse for a reject from village people the female lead is trying to look 20 years younger than she is both leads come across as unappealing unattractive and completely unconvincing there are various ridiculous and totally unassuming gratuitous scenes in the film for example with a budget airline which is devoid of any humor the only reason i give this 3 10 instead of 1 10 is one mark for shirley maclaine who is a a class above anything else in the pic and one mark for some half decent albeit old music
<START> those french and those germans sure have a long history of not liking each other it is interesting to note that kamerdaschaft or comradeship in translation takes place in 1931 only a few years later hitler would siege germany and begin his plans to take over the world france being a casualty of his ambitions but these are times of sereneness compared to the future a group of miners at the border try to cross over to france to get work they are spurned back and later at a nightclub by their french neighbors then a disaster happens in the mines of the french and a well crafted and written scene a troupe of german miners decide to come to the rescue a simple story is it not pabst was a poet of silent cinema and i am not sure if this is his first sound movie or not but his poetry is there to be discovered he isn't fussy but brings a rugged realism to the ordeal ther is even a flashback to a wwii event that beckons the point of this story supposedly based on a real event the movie does the events proudly with directness and terseness smetimes that's what a movie needs to be
<START> the comeback starts off looking promising with a brutal death scene by a mask wearing killer the mask itself is pretty cool too and looks almost identical to the one used in the 1990's slasher film granny from then on the film is mostly boring we get a few more deaths which again are good but there's not enough of them the reason the deaths are so good is because they are frenzied and bloody the story behind the film is actually rather interesting and would have worked very well had it not been so boring for the most part br br i would avoid this unless you're a die hard collector there's not enough here to even make it an average slasher flick
<START> i loved this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end i found the director actor's style of directly addressing me the audience very engaging br br what i found most exciting and refreshing about this movie was its ignoring and thus challenging of gender and class stereotypes the idiosyncrasies of the characters are portrayed as strengths and the absence of judgment and the characters' acceptance of themselves and each other enabled me to embrace them and allow myself to be drawn into their world without preaching and with intelligence and gentle and loving humor this movie has the power to open us to new possibilities and offers hope for a world in which people see and accept each other as unique and precious individuals i look forward to more offerings from this creative and talented director
<START> despite the patronage of george lucas this captivating and totally original fantasy in lumage a combination of animation through live action cut outs is about as far removed from the usual kiddie fare as anything made by ralph bakshi in his heyday brilliantly conceived characters such as the shape shifting dog ralph one of a duo of bumbling rejected heroes synonamess botch the hilariously foul mouthed villain and rod rescueman the pompous novice superhero breathe life into a uniquely clever concept frivoli vs murkwood or the eternal fight between dreams and nightmares in this context the mor infused songs on the soundtrack ought not to have worked but somehow they do it's a real pity therefore that i have had to watch this via a truly crappy looking boot culled from a tv screening of the uncensored version Â there is also a milder variant that toned down the language for its vhs release Â since the film is otherwise unavailable on dvd interestingly both henry selick and david fincher worked on this picture in subordinate capacities
<START> a somewhat dull made for tv movie which premiered on the tbs cable station antonio and janine run around chasing a killer computer virus and that's about it for trivia buffs this will be noted as debuting the same weekend that the real life 'melissa' virus also made it's debut in e mail inboxes across the world
<START> i'm on the opposite end of the previous comment br br first of all i don't think this was intended to be a straight sequel to the jerk i mean it's not titled the jerk 2 it's the jerk too which leads me to believe that while a lot of the character names are the same it actually revolves around a completely different person br br think about it virtually no connection to the previous movie other than character names a totally different story different cast and the fact that it's a partial musical br br i say give this movie some credit it does have plenty of laughs in it mark blankfield at his prime
<START> there are four great movie depicting the vietnam war they are in no particular order apocalypse now born on the fourth of july platoon and finally tigerland all but tigerland focus on the actual war and the men in it tigerland focuses on men in advanced training for the vietnam war the character of boz is one of the most important depictions of a man questioning war and the absurdity of it this has been done in many war movies but rarely in boot camp also this is a very complex character whose method with dealing with his feeling and emotions are the driving force of this movie the character of boz makes this movie so good it is a shame it did not get a major release it belongs on the shelf of any movie fan alongside the aforementioned movie titles
