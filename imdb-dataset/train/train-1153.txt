<START> this movie is a great example of how even some very funny jokes can go terribly wrong i really expected at least something from this movie after seeing the add which was funny as hell but the movie wasn't half as good br br the weird part is that the jokes are actually funny the spoofs of the smoking ban jo bole etc are genuinely good jokes but i don't know whom to blame this movie flop on br br the prime candidates may be 1 the hammers actors and hammeresses actresses and not even the funny kind 2 the director 3 the guy who cast the actors and or the director anyway if you are really really bored and i mean really see this movie or else get a copy of each and every ad or teaser of this movie and laugh your butt of because those will be far funnier than the film br br p s the only saving grace of this film is mahesh manjrekar and the funny chappu bhai
<START> this is the second eytan fox film i have seen the fantastic actor lior ashkenazi who starred in walk on water has a minor role in this film also br br but the real stars are the young israelis who live together in a tiny apartment noam ohad knoller lulu daniela virtzer and yelli alon friedman and the palestinian that joins them off and on ashraf yousef 'joe' sweid there is sort of a friends sex in the city thing going on mostly gay and they all just want the war to end so they can go on with their lives in peace br br but that's the rub no matter how many posters you put up or how many raves for peace you have the war is not going to end many have tried over the years to bring the two sides to the table but they just want to keep it going for whatever reason there are many on the israeli side both there and here in the us who just want it all and will not consider peace there are many on the palestinian side who apparently would be out of a job should peace ever come it is in no one's interest to end this war and the children suffer br br this is always on your mind as you watch this funny and engaging film it won't go away you know something tragic is going to happen and of course it does with the feelings on both sides running strong and revenge as the motivator tragedy always happens and that is what makes this an adult version of friends sex in the city there is no superficiality it is real life and it was a beautiful thing to see
<START> how do you spell washed up fat italian who can barely pull off a martial arts move without needing some heart medication in this movie we see steven seagal at his lowest level of accomplishment since his career started it has been a steady decline into pathetic over indulgent behavior that has scuttled his career in this movie it looks like most of his training consisted of ordering the fetuccini alfredo at his restaurant every day br br he is fat slow and very old looking in this movie hardly a martial arts action hero more like a laughing stock clown br br it's time for steven seagal to retire this movie is about 2 hours of reasons why br br plot fat italian guy with a big reputation on the force gets wind that a crime group may be playing around with a drug designed by the military to create the ultimate warrior response this pretense although pathetic and laughable gives opportunity for some over the top fight scenes that include blasting through walls like a comic book br br did i mention this movie totally sucks and steven seagal is a complete joke yeah i did
<START> former private eye turned security guard ditches his latest droning job and is immediately offered a chance to return to his previous profession his assignment to tail a mysterious french woman newly arrived in california and apparently wanted by suit and tie racketeers unsuccessful attempt to update the film noir genre without enough sting or wit or involving plot dynamics in the screenplay director and co scenarist paul magwood who later claimed the picture was edited without his involvement doesn't give off the impression of having high regard for the '40s films his chandler was borne from his nostalgia is appropriately rumpled but also bitter tinged and somewhat indifferent the handling is curiously commendably low keyed and warren oates is well cast as this '70s variant on the 'private dick' archetype but the movie doesn't have any snap nice to see leslie caron and gloria grahame in the cast though neither has much to do and caron's hot and cold running character is exasperating throughout vivid cinematography by alan stensvold nice location shooting but it fails to come to any kind of a boil 1 2 from
<START> i just bought the dvd and i must say after seeing brazil and fear an loathing in las vegas terry does it again as well of being a fan of the monty python movies terry gilliam's genius follows through in this sci fi thriller whom bruce willis plays a wonderful role as james cole and as well perhaps my favorite character brad pitt who played the insanity of jefferey goines a must have for sci fi fans or movie fan of any type really because it includes suspense drama action etc br br any way the plot in the future 1 of the world's population survives a disease intended to wipe out the human race which is unleashed in the past by the army of twelve monkeys james cole bruce willis is sent back to 1996 which is when the virus was unleashed to find out about the disease so scientists in his time can find a cure before i go further james cole lives in an underground society and the animals rule the world on the surface due to the disease that will kill the humans anyway when he is sent back in time he is actually sent back to 1990 where he is sent to a mental institution because of his tellings to people of the virus during his stay he meets jefferey goins brad pitt who is later mostly responsible for wiping out the human race he also meets his psychiatrist madelein stowe who eventually teams up with bruce to save the world as she sees that he is correct in his tellings he is sent back and forth from his time to the past and eventually sent to 1996 where he then questions his own sanity but later pulls through to reveal a suspenseful end quarter of the movie and later builds up to the somewhat shocking climax where he tries to stop the man carrying the virus not actually brad pitt and is instead shot by the police as the killer gets away
<START> well what i can say about this movie is that it's great to see so many asian faces what i didn't like about the film was that it was full of stereotypes of what typical racial characters would do in their role the asian girl without confidence who has to play someone else to get ahead the white guy infatuated with asian culture and chooses to leave his white world behind for the land of yellow and the keeping it real black cab driver plus all the coke shanghai tang and dunkin donuts product placement was a bit too obvious the story plot itself was fun but pretty much how i thought the story would unravel then again when watching romantic comedies you can't expect much but then again i would have been wanted to just be surprised at least once the parents are the best part of the flick
<START> i cant help it but i seem to like films that are meant to be scary and are just plain bad i have personally listed it in my own top 10 worst movies right under creatures of the abyss watch this film and have a laugh just don't expect to see any academy awards for acting more chance of understanding the film its self in all honesty though i have seen much worse than this plus some maniac cruising round the desert wiping the same people out that just died is that unbelievable that its got to be original i think its one of those love or hate movies you can make up your own mind yes its awful but it pulls it off somehow thats why i love it
<START> zombi 3 has an interesting history in it's making firstly it is a sequel to fulci's hit zombi 2 with zombi 2 itself being of course a marketing ploy to trick people into thinking it was a sequel to george a romero's dawn of the dead aka zombi confusing enough basically none of the films have anything to do with one another but who cares when they make money i guess fulci himself starting to not care about the production about half way through zombi 3 when he decided to walk out bruno mattei was brought on board to help pad the film with additional scenes to lengthen the running time br br zombi 3's plot is your typical zombie fare scientists develop a serum on an island in the philippines terrorists steal it unleashing a plague and zombie run amok the scientists want to create an antidote while the military is set on mowing down everyone without prejudice there are also brief inserts of a radio dj preaching about how we treat the planet br br overall i actually liked this film i heard horrible things but i find the goofy dialogue quite enjoyable the film seems to be an attempt at raising awareness about pollution corrupted military man playing god etc i get the feeling this was at one point a serious film but it veered off in a weird direction presumably when mattei came on board br br besides ripping off other zombie flicks this was very reminiscent of romero's the crazies you hear the radio dj breaking the good news with when you see the men in white suits gas masks run to them for help this is of course played to the images of the men in white gunning down zombies later they straight up steal a scene from crazies in which one of the regular uncontaminated people is killed by mistake br br the gore factor is pretty good in this one with zombie hordes around every corner how is it cool let me count the waysÂ1 zombie birth 2 flying zombie head 3 zombie birds 4 zombie with no legs swimming in a pool my favorite zombie was the machete wielding maniac at the gas station he was bad ass and nearly tore down the entire building trying to kill a girl br br favorite quote Â when a sergeant insists on cremating a zombie the scientists asks don't you think that once the ash is in the air it will fall to the ground and contaminate everything to which the sargeant boldly replies now you're talking science fiction he also continues to mention the science fiction told by the scientists even at the end when everyone dies br br extras gallery trailers and interviews most notably the one with mattei where he insists he directed 40 of the scenes yet cannot recall which ones or any other significant details br br bottom line a must see for zombie and fulci fans br br rating 7 10 br br molly celaschi www horroryearbook com myspace com horroryearbook
<START> this movie sucked they took something from my childhood and raped it in an outhouse this movie was so bad i wanted to go home and hold my dukes dvds and cry in a corner the cast was terrible it wasn't the dukes it was stiffler and jackass driving a car when was boss hogg evil when was rosco a tough guy they never were boss hogg was greedy and rosco was an idiot when did jesse smoke pot he never did now don't get me wrong i'm very liberal and there's nothing wrong with a little chiba but it had no place in this movie the only thing good about this movie was the trailers before the movie and the end credits it was a waste of money time and air avoid at all costs
<START> as with most rosalind russell movies this one is very entertaining it's fun all the way through it's definitely one of the last of this genre of film just good wholesome entertainment give it a try i don't think you will be disappointed
<START> this is one of my favorite family movies loved it when i was little and it still holds up with me now that i'm older i still laugh at all the same old jokes and might even shed a tear a times i never have much cared for animals talking or at least un animated ones but this one i'll stand up for it's a pretty old movie but it will always hold a place in my heart br br there aren't any other live animal movies that i can think of at the moment that i even could compare with let alone like as much as this one i might be giving too much praise to this movie but i don't think show i really holds that great message that home is where the heart is or at least that's the message i gained from it definitely recommended for a good old family movie night
<START> i don't have much to add to my summary this film ranks right up the there with top gun as one of the funniest films ever made while not trying to be i for one don't think it should be taken seriously when watched as it is very enjoyable br br i don't think it brings christopher walken's reputation down either as his reputation was on the wane back then anyway it took pulp fiction to wake him from the slumber he had been in as for michael ironside he has been in some of the great funny while not trying to be serious films total recall top gun what i think is amazing is the budget this movie had the scenes and actors and explosions etc are quite amazing so obviously someone liked it quite a lot and was willing to risk a lot of money whoever he or she was i like them because i love this film br br if anyone reads this looking for information on mcbain and i seriously doubt there'll be too many just know that it is a hilarious movie and should be viewed with a smile on your face
<START> it was a bit bizarre and evil and i enjoyed it a lot the characters in the show were great as well and complimented one another well i was sorry to see it cut off i would have loved to see where it could have went you found yourself leaning toward lucas buck the sheriff who had more secrets than anyone lucas was frightening and alluring and i would have liked to have seen more of him and how his character became i will however buy the show just to enjoy it was great to something different on tv and paige turrco who was caleb's cousin she was a big mystery as to where and what she meant to lucas its a shame it isn't around still or was never finished i would have loved to see what would have happened
<START> i watched this film in youth group where my otherwise intuitive youth leader and his wife squeed over it then some adult couple at a church related christmas party misled themselves into giving a copy of this movie to every single family in attendance and now my household is stuck with the film though it thankfully still remains in its shrinkwrap i cried bitter tears over these sad events and here's why first off this film has good intentions especially if you're a christian like me this movie is trying to show that you should put your faith in god and that it'll make your life better not so bad right eh it turns out a be a problem a big one this movie was made by a church so of course every single issue has to be dealt with as tastefully for christians as possible it is all black and white no gray areas god's grace and will in this movie is a predictable thing and it comes instantly to all those who do his bidding br br this is not the god i know this is not the christian life i am familiar with the god i believe in is a powerful and trustworthy god but he is not one that grants my every wish i follow him as best i can though the going is often hard yet the football team in this movie finds their humility and self control a lot easier than anyone should ever find it i cannot relate to cardboard cutouts who flip from bad side to good side in the course of a few structured movie scenes and when i do follow his commandments as laid out in the bible i certainly don't find myself showered in blessing as these characters do the largest of my immediate rewards is knowing that i have done the right thing everything else comes with long messy arduous work br br but take the example this movie sets grant taylor coaches the football team at shiloh christian school which has had 6 losing seasons in a row he may lose his job over it and he and his wife are low on money as it is they want a baby but the doctor tells him he is sterile oh and his car doesn't work and the boys on his football team are disrespectful to their parents whiny after their million losses and bad at kicking field goals this is sure one rundown community here br br but wait grant taylor decides he's going to trust in god for everything and he passes on his faith to his team so far so good not for long as they begin to obey blessing literally pour in on them suddenly the students stop disrespecting their parents the school has a big revival the team starts winning every game they even win the grand championship against the hardest team in the league coach taylor's job is reassured the school gets him a shiny new truck as a present which by the way is the epitome of shallow fair weather employers he gets a raise his wife get this even gets pregnant from his sterile sperm and that skinny kid manages to kick his first darn field goal right when it really matters wowzers woot yay praise the lord etcetera etcetera br br yipe just yipe nobody in my church has ever experienced christ in a such a cut and dry manner yes there have been miracles aplenty in my family as well as gifts and creature comforts and i attribute them to god's grace and lovingkindness but god isn't some faucet tap that you turn on and off by being good or bad he is by and large a mystery his gifts come unexpectedly often when you think you don't need them but you really do it's a long hard slog to the road of fulfillment and things never turn out the way you thought they would br br this movie has good intentions but because of its supreme shallowness and total escapism it tanks tremendously to a 1 10 the bad acting and sports movie clichÃ©s seem to be mere pimples next to the leprous falsehoods that this movie inadvertently pushes br br to all you future churches planning to make a movie don't be afraid to show real life even you have to add some inconvenient truths into the mix however much the baser populace is wowed by this cotton candy treat nobody has learned anything substantial from it give us the meat the bones the real stuff true life applies to everyone not just christians and that's one aspect facing the giants didn't manage to grasp
<START> all the kids aged from 14 16 want to see this movie although you are only allowed at 18 they have heard it is a very scary movie and they feel so cool when they watched it i feel very sad kids can't see what a good movie is and what a bad movie is this was one of the worst movies i saw in months every scene you see in this movie is a copy from another movie and the end it's an open ending why because it is impossible to come up with a decent en for such a stupid story this movie is just made to make you scared and if you are a bit smart and know some about music you exactly know when you'll be scared br br when the movie was finished and i turned to my friend and told a bit to loud him that this was a total waste of money some stupid kid looked strange at me these day i could make an oscar with a home video of my goldfish if only i use the right marketing
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have seen recently when a man says that he wishes he had a super power of being able to orally pleasure himself i pretty much consider the movie to be in the realm of childish 14 year old male fantasies the bed room scene was over the top and reduced an intimate moment into a farce of biological functions akin to passing gas in public from the first every other scene was a discussion about how little sex they where getting how long its been since they got some when their next sexual liaison will be and with whom it should be with on top of that the dialogue and acting was very poor and very forced not felt and they filled their lack of content with sleazy sex scenes this could have been really funny because the concept is actually interesting but it is poorly executed here please do not even think about taking anyone under 16 if you have to go and see it
<START> i'm sorry i had high hopes for this movie unfortunately it was too long too thin and too weak to hold my attention when i realized the whole movie was indeed only about an older guy reliving his dream i felt cheated surely it could have been a device to bring us into something deeper something more meaningful br br so don't buy a large drink or you'll be running to the rest room my kids didn't enjoy it either ah well
<START> this movie struck home for me being 29 i remember the '80's and my father working in a factory i figured if i worked hard too if i had pride and never gave up i too could have the american dream the house a few kids a car all to call my own i've noted however without a degree in something unlike my father that quit at ninth grade and a keen sense of greed and laziness you can't get anywhere br br i would like to know if anyone has this movie on dvd or vhs it's made for tv and i just saw it an hour ago ic an't find it anywhere i'd love to show this to my friends my pseudo friends family and other relatives see what they think and remind them that once upon a time americans would work for the sake of feeling honor and that we had pride in what we accomplished i think the feeling is still there but in a heavy downward spiral with so many things being made overseas
<START> walter pidgeon is braley mason a civil attorney who takes on a criminal case in the unknown man a 1951 film also starring ann harding barry sullivan keefe braselle and richard anderson a great believer in justice pidgeon accepts a pro bono case defending a young man rudi walchek braselle accused of murder and gets him acquitted shortly afterward he realizes that the man is guilty and was extorting protection money from his victim as well as other shopkeepers in the neighborhood he is advised by the da sullivan that rudi is small change that to wipe out the organized crime one has to find the top man mason finds the top man and is faced with a dilemma br br the unknown man is a small black and white film that manages to hold the viewer's interest with its various plot twists though the plot is somewhat contrived it's really the story of a good man seeking his god justice and what he is willing to do in order to attain it and that's the most contrived part of all i suppose there was a time before o j the menendez brothers etc etc when people believed in justice and the integrity of attorneys for this viewer anyway those days are long over br br walter pidgeon does an excellent job his handsome elegant demeanor and declamatory voice show us a successful confident man but also a deeply caring one pidgeon had a magnificent career spanning 60 years but never really rose to superstardom he was a solid actor who could play just about anything and did it may be because by the time he was getting leads he was well into his thirties and missed being a matinÃ©e idol or it could be he lacked that certain something or that he was typed early on as second lead to a big female star like greer garson hard to say he gives an honest and touching performance here br br very good movie with good performances
<START> alex d linz replaces macaulay culkin as the central figure in the third movie in the home alone empire four industrial spies acquire a missile guidance system computer chip and smuggle it through an airport inside a remote controlled toy car because of baggage confusion grouchy mrs hess marian seldes gets the car she gives it to her neighbor alex linz just before the spies turn up the spies rent a house in order to burglarize each house in the neighborhood until they locate the car home alone with the chicken pox alex calls 911 each time he spots a theft in progress but the spies always manage to elude the police while alex is accused of making prank calls the spies finally turn their attentions toward alex unaware that he has rigged devices to cleverly booby trap his entire house home alone 3 wasn't horrible but probably shouldn't have been made you can't just replace macauley culkin joe pesci or daniel stern home alone 3 had some funny parts but i don't like when characters are changed in a movie series view at own risk
