<START> i remember watching this film thinking was so interesting i really wanted to know what happens next i was amazed by how much they could fit into an 8 minute short we start in a school yard two friends are debating on skipping class kid b says to kid a lets not go to class today and kid a declines claiming they could miss something really important so kid b skips and kid a goes to class when he gets there the teacher informs him that today they were going to learn the only and most important lesson they will ever learn they were going to learn the meaning of life she gives everyone a pamphlet and when she gets to kid a she runs out and tells the boy next to him to share well the kid won't share so kid a goes looking for the teacher when he finally finds her he gets a shocking revelation on what the real meaning of life is i suggest everyone watch this short it will only take 8 minutes from your life but the message is so important it could help you for a life time
<START> so halfway through the season i got so caught up in school and my activities that i didn't realize that the show had been canceled halfway through which is crap br br i think the followers of this show should write fox and ask them to at least finish filming so that a the season can be released on dvd later maybe then they'll see how many people were disappointed that the show didn't survive its first season br br i loved the show and looked forward to it every thursday after the oc can you imagine my disappointment when i came back to try and watch the show only to discover that it had disappeared needless to say i'm not very happy with fox right now even more so after discovering that no ending was filmed i mean if you're going to work on a project at least finish it to see what happens a half filmed show is like a half made car it's pretty much useless fox film the damn ending and give some of the show's fans some peace
<START> i am an avid fan of lucio fulci and yet i must say that zombi 3 aka zombie flesh eaters 2 of 1988 which he made with two other directors bruno mattei and claudi fragasso was quite a disappointment especially compared to its great predecessor fulci's very own gore classic zombi 2 aka zombie felsh eaters zombie of 1979 this is vastly disappointing sure the low rating of 4 5 already suggests that it's not a good film but these low ratings usually come from people who are not into italian zombie flicks and as enthusiastic fan of italian horror films and low budget exploitation cinema i love many films that have only been rewarded with much lower ratings also many of my fellow italian horror buffs seem to think of this film as underrated which i sadly cannot agree with not that the film was a complete disaster it has some redeeming qualities above all fulci's nauseating gore effects that are always a pleasure to watch for an italian horror gore buff the basic idea behind the film is also not bad allthough far from original and i liked the ruthless portrayal of the military sadly that's about it while the great predecessor zombi 2 was extremely gory but beyond that also genuinely creepy this is not creepy or scary for a minute and the nauseating and often grotesque gore is the only true reason to watch zombi 3 the film is sometimes fun to watch but only for the gore and as an unintentional comedy i guess that it was mainly the gore that came from fulci and the disappointing rest that came from mattei and fragasso the first of which was involved in a bunch of nasty cult flicks such as d'amato's porno holocaust and the second of which is responsible for one of the worst movies ever made the god awful troll 2 overall this is definitely watchable for the gore but out of all fulci films i've seen so far this is definitely the worst and i've seen the majority of this great filmmaker's repertoire i am a fulci fan and i always will be but this sure isn't his magic moment it may be fun for the gore but i recommend to watch any other fulci film before this
<START> after being hugely entertained by mr brosnan's performance as a cad in the tailor of panama which i rate 10 10 across the board casting acting script story editing pace music emotional impact etc i enthusiastically anticipated this film i was hugely disappointed it is a script reading not a film vulgar for the sake of being vulgar bankrupt in every way that the tailor of panama is rich and satisfying blame it on the screen writing and directing i sat in the theater waiting for the good part it never came i neither laughed nor cried although one line of dialog did make me smile worth 7 hardly
<START> before all i'd like to point out that i have not read the book so there was no chance i'd be disappointed in that aspect the major flaw i spotted was historical detail with several cars trains clothes etc i think donÂ´t belong at that time br br possible spoiler br br the technical aspect of the film is ok nothing to brag about but the acting i think was terrific i don't have no experience in acting still i can't believe how people can consider this terrible maybe they've only seen two movies ever and the other one must have been very good indeed br br i specially liked jeremy irons and really understood his character someone who crawled up the social ladder with very hard work then fights against those who would take his life's work from him only he gets so involved in this fight he doesn't realize reason is no longer at his side and he ends up a beaten disappointed man irons made this so believable i sympathized with the character despite his brutality br br after jeremy irons winona ryder is also wonderful as a romantic young women who is drawn into the revolutionary ideals by her boyfriend banderas he had an under developed part i think and glenn close was also very good meryl streep had an average performance it was not bad just not up to the standards of the other actors watch out for miguel guilherme a fine portuguese actor between so many stars br br in contrast to today's movies here only the interpretations only people matter but at the same time it is not a pretensious film too worried trying to be intellectual the best proof i really liked it i'm writing a review 7 years later
<START> i will never forget this film or the events that lead up to jonestown in guyana it just seems so tragic but needs to be told powers boothe give a commanding performance as the leader rev jim jones from obscurity until total madness it would have won him an academy award easily if it was released in the movie theaters it is the kind of mini series you won't forget you won't forget the images of the cult's brutality control and obsessiveness of it's leader his rise and fall and the threat from the outside world to destroy what he considered to be paradise the mass suicide is horrifying almost unreal to anybody's imagination as to why so many people 900 went willingly or resisted jones' orders they don't make mini series like these anymore where we're left with out mouths open and hungry to know what happened to the others
<START> as with that film we follow the implausible if always engaging adventures of the 2 lead characters but whilst c j eschew sex for a girly trip back into childhood this pair revel in their carnality even to the point of exploring homoeroticism most of the sex they acquire from grudging or unwilling partners and yet despite their deeply un pc behaviour everyone emerges smiling like c g through it all they remain innocents at heart rebels against the quotidien the bourgeois the restrictive as someone else has commented i wouldn't want to know these 2 and it's a minor miracle that their trip brings scenes of mostly comedy and very little tragedy and what there is of that cannot be laid at their door and thus for that reason it left me beguiled but with a sweet taste in the mouth dare i say that only the french can get away with films like this and that is part of their genius
<START> first of all i think the below comment is unworthy for a site like this obviously you have no taste and you don't respect the taste of others not to give you a history lesson but i think it needs to be done black actors out there are just if not more successful as others if you are not a part of the black race you cannot understand the quality creativeness and vibrant of old movies such as sparkle and mahogany and cooley high since unfortunately you are not black you do not have the pleasure of feeling what we feel when we watch these classics so therefore you need to keep your freaking mouth shut and just stick to your non dancing race thanks
<START> that's what t v should be and pushing daisies lives up to those expectations a beautifully crafted and well designed show pushing daisies is one of the few shows left on prime time that has integrity is good for the entire family and sparks your imagination it's not about the normal action sex money or murder angles of every other show on t v it's a show that makes you think and laugh but although the basic plot may seem impossible the concepts are real to us all wanting something you can't have hoping for someone to want us running away from your past and searching for family even in the most unlikely of places etc br br i realize that abc has basically canceled this wonderful show at this point and will most likely replace it with some show beyond the point of integrity i suppose everything does come back to money it's too bad that there are now no other shows on abc that actually make you feel good after watching
<START> this is a very fine and poetic story beautiful scenery magnificent music score i've been twice in japan last year and the movie gave me this typical japanese feeling the movement of the camera is superb as well as the actors it goes deep into your feelings without becoming melodramatic japanese people are very sensitive and kind and it's all very well brought onto the screen here the director is playing superb with light an colors and shows the audience that it is also possible to let them enjoy a movie with subtle and fine details once you've seen this movie you will want to see more from the same director it's a real feel good movie and i can only recommend it to everybody
<START> how do i begin this movie is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen it has no redeemable qualities i just sat through this movie and it was a struggle it failed to get even a single smile on my face i find it hard to believe that anyone would distribute this horrible film i felt that this movie was a failed attempt at distasteful humor the only thing that was worth anything about this movie was the soundtrack i'm pretty sure thats the reason i wanted to see this movie in the first place i will wrap this up as i am going to try and forget the time i just wasted with this piece of crap i will leave you with this warning do not watch this film it sucks
<START> loosely intended as a satire of d w griffith's intolerance the three ages was buster keaton's first attempt at a full length comedy feature the only similarities to intolerance are the opening book scene and the fact that similar stories through the ages are edited together into a complete film keaton's reasoning for appropriating this style was that if it didn't succeed as a feature film it could be reduced to three two reelers fortunately the three ages succeeds brilliantly as a comedy and contains some of the funniest routines i've seen in any of keaton's film there is nothing unique or daring about the story lines they are simple boy meets girl boy loses girl boy gets girl plots but the period satires are riotous and set the standard for future works by mel brooks and all films of this genre however i don't believe that anyone has ever topped this comedy no one can play the lovable goof like keaton and the stunts in this film are some of his best in addition wallace beery's appearance as keaton's rival adds to this film's appeal anyone who thinks that comedy from the 1920's cannot be appreciated by modern audiences needs to see this movie
<START> eddie izzard is genius with his non stop humor i could listen all day his unique approach to life is quite logical his understanding of discovery such as the heimlich maneuver is creative eddie izzard captures the heart of what we think i don't know when i laughed so hard at anyone's off beat mind
<START> i was not only an extra in this movie i got to see it in boston to a sold out cinema over a thousand boston red sox farrelly fans jammed themselves into a movie theater near boston common to watch a comedy about them red sox fanatics drew barrymore and jimmy fallon star is this cute comedy about love and lust the love is between the two young lovers the lust is for the red sox winning the world series although fallon is not a great actor he is the best actor for the role he is funny enough and gets the most laughs barrymore on the other hand is the same old barrymore at times i felt supporting actress ione skye would have been a better actor for the role all in all all boston red sox fans will love this movie for the rest of the world this is just a funny movie
<START> i couldn't tell if the screaming skull was trying to be a hitchcock rip off or a modernized edgar allen poe tribute these days someone would have chopped it up a bit and presented it as one of those tv anthology episodes from the old tales from the dark side but only after an extensive rewrite br br the sad thing is there seems to be a nice nasty little story trying to get out from under the rubble of this movie and the actors are obviously doing the best they can with both their talent and the material they have to work with but the director just didn't know how to stage or pace a dramatic scene the special effects simply didn't work the screenplay telegraphed its threadbare plot points so plainly that a bivalve could have seen them coming and the soundtrack kept playing german oompah band music when it was supposed to be trying to scare the audience br br they tried they tried really hard but this is of interest only as a period piece i suppose someone very young who hadn't seen a lot of suspense or horror might get a charge out the screaming skull but someone that young probably wouldn't get most of the subtext or plot motivation mommy why is that nice man trying to scare the twisty faced scaredy cat lady
<START> i find it very intriguing that lee radziwill jackie kennedy's sister and the cousin of these women would encourage the maysles' to make big edie and little edie the subject of a film they certainly could be considered the skeletons in the family closet the extra features on the dvd include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women i'd say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating i e are they nuts or am i missing something this movie is hard to come by netflix does not have it facets does though
<START> my only minor quibble with the film i grew up knowing as stairway to heaven is the fact that the wonderful raymond massey is relegated to the last twenty or so minutes in the trial scene and the trial itself imo is the least interesting portion of this fascinating fantasy br br david niven and kim hunter are wonderfully cast as the young lovers but it's roger livesey who gives the liveliest and most credible performance french accented marius goring is a delight he even gets in a remark about technicolor as the heavenly messenger sent to reclaim niven when his wartime death goes unreported due to an oversight goring has some of the wittiest lines and delivers them with relish br br seeing this tonight on tcm for the first time in twenty or so years i think it's a supreme example of what a wonderful year 1946 was for films the technicolor photography somewhat subdued and not garish at all is excellent and the way it shifts into b w for the heavenly sequences is done with great imagination and effectiveness br br the opening scene is the sort that really draws a viewer into the fantasy aspects of the story and niven's tense talk with radio operator hunter while his plane is crashing toward earth unexpectedly leads to a memorable romantic encounter truly a marvelous film from beginning to end another triumph for michael powell and emeric pressburger
<START> i had never seen richard thomas play a bad guy i wasn't sure i would like him this way and i wasn't sure he could pull it off but this astounded me he sent shivers up my spine and caused me to take a closer look at street people the movie is engrossing and fast paced bruce davison is convincing but all he can really play is a nice guy the real talent here is thomas the ending was a little clumsy but perhaps that's the way real people would fight if you are a thomas fan you must see him here at his best being bad
<START> ironically the most talked about american film in the 2008 new york film festival is 98 in spanish the extra long film's controversy began at the cannes festival there were love hate notices and considerable doubts about commercial prospects as consolation the star benicio del toro got the best actor award there i'm talking about steven soderbergh's 'che ' of course that's the name it's going by in this version shown in new york as at cannes in two 2 hour plus segments without opening title or end credits 'che' is certainly appropriate since ernesto che guevara is in almost every scene del toro is impressive hanging in reliably through thick and thin from days of glorious victory in part one to months of humiliating defeat in part two appealing and simpatico in all his varied manifestations even disguised as a bald graying man to sneak into bolivia it's a terrific performance one wishes it had a better setting br br if you are patient enough to sit through the over four hours with an intermission between the two sections there are rewards there's an authentic feel throughout fortunately soderbergh made the decision to film in spanish though some of the actors oddly enough in the english segments especially are wooden you get a good outline of what guerrilla warfare che style was like the teaching the recruitment of campesinos the morality the discipline the hardship and the fighting as well as che's gradual morphing from company doctor to full fledged military leader use of a new 9 pound 35 mm quality red digital high performance cine camera that just became available in time for filming enabled dp peter andrews and his crew to produce images that are a bit cold but at times still sing and are always sharp and smooth br br the film is in two parts soderbergh is calling them two films and the plan is to release them commercially as such first is 'the argentine ' depicting che's leadership in jungle and town fighting that led up to the fall of havana in the late 50's and the second is 'guerrilla ' and concerns che's failed effort nearly a decade later in bolivia to spearhead a revolution a fruitful mission that led to guevara's capture and execution in 1967 the second part was to have been the original film and was written first and i think shot first producer laura bickford says that part two is more of a thriller while part one is more of an action film with big battle scenes yes but both parts have a lot in common too much since both spend a large part of their time following the guerrillas through rough country guerrilla an unmitigated downer since the bolivian revolt was doomed from the start the group of cubans who tried to lead it didn't get a friendly reception from the bolivian campesinos who suspected foreigners and thought of the cuban communists as godless rapists there is a third part a kind of celebratory black and white interval made up of che's speech at the united nations in 1964 and interviews with him at that time but that is inter cut in the first segment the first part also has fidel and is considerably more upbeat leading as it does to the victory in santa clara in 1959 that led to the fall of the dictatorship of fulgencio batista in cuba br br during 'guerilla' i kept thinking how this could indeed work as a quality european style miniseries which might begin with a shortened version of walter salles's 'motorcycle diaries' and go on to take us to guevara's fateful meeting with fidel in mexico and enlistment in the 26th of july movement there could be much more about his extensive travels and diplomatic missions this is far from a complete picture of the man his childhood interest in chess his lifelong interest in poetry the books he wrote even his international fame is only touched on and what about his harsh cruel side really what soderbergh is most interested in isn't che but revolution and guerrilla warfare the lasting impression that the 4 hours leave is of slogging through woods and jungle with wounded and sick men and women and idealistic dedication to a the cause of ending the tyranny of the rich someone mentioned being reminded of terrence malick's 'the tin red line ' and yes the meandering episodic battle approach is similar but 'the thin red line' has stronger characters hardly anybody emerges forcefully besides che and it's a really good film this is an impressive but unfinished and ill fated effort br br this 8 years gestating heavily researched labor of love how many more ocean's must come to pay for it is a vanity project too long for a regular theatrical release and too short for a miniseries radical editing or major expansion would have made it into something more successful and as it is it's a long slog especially in the second half br br it's clear that this slogging could have been trimmed down though it's not so clear what form the resulting film would have taken but with a little bit of luck it might have been quite a good one
<START> it's a bit easy that's about it br br the graphics are clean and realistic except for the fact that some of the fences are 2d but that's forgiveable the rest of the graphics are cleaner than goldeneye and many other n64 games the sounds are magnificant everything from the speaking to the sfx are pleasant and realistic br br the camera angle is a bit frustrating at times but it's the same for every platform game like banjo kazooie and donkey kong 64 br br i got this game as a christmas present in 1997 and since then i have dutifully gotten 120 stars over 10 times
