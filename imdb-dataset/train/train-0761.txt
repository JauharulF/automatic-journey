<START> uwe boll has done the impossible create a game adaptation that stays at least somewhat true to the game he has turned a game full of antisocial and offensive content into a movie full of antisocial and offensive content so as an adaptation it's a success br br unfortunately it's still uwe boll we are dealing with here so don't expect the movie to be actually any good while it does have it's moment postal wears out his welcome very fast and becomes a pain to sit through br br at its core postal is a satire on the united states as done by a twelve year old kid boll seems to think that offensiveness is linearly proportional to comedic value the more offensive the funnier and the more exaggerated the funnier this results in a movie that sets new levels of tastelessness while being extremely hit and miss yes some gags do work but it seems to be pure luck high points include the director satirizing himself and people getting hit very violently by trucks and other vehicles low points include well pretty much everything else br br after the initial surprise wears off postal simply becomes a bore to watch yes there is a good joke every and good point ten minutes but everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters shooting and chasing each other all over the place for what seems to be an eternity br br this probably would have worked as a short movie but it's just not enough content for something that lasts over 90 minutes although it feels twice as long there are nice ideas and nice tries but they get hopelessly lost in endless and pointless action scenes and content that is offensive just for the sake of it 4 10
<START> this is a kind of movie that will stay with you for a long time soha ali and abhay deol both look very beautiful soha reminds you so much of her mother sharmila tagore abhay is a born actor and will rise a lot in the coming future br br the ending of the movie is very different from most movies in a way you are left unsatisfied but if you really think about it in real terms you realize that the only sensible ending was the ending shown in the movie otherwise it would have been gross injustice to everyone br br the movie is about a professional witness who comes across a girl waiting to get married in court her boyfriend does not show up and she ends up being helped by the witness slowly slowly over the time he falls in love for her it is not clear if she has similar feelings for him or not watch the movie for complete details br br the movie really belongs to abhay i look forward to seeing more movies from him soha is pretty but did not speak much in the movie her eyes her innocence did most of the talking
<START> while this movie's style isn't as understated and realistic as a sound version probably would have been this is still a very good film in fact it was seen as an excellent film in its day as it was nominated for the first best picture oscar losing to wings i still consider wings to be a superior film but this one is excellent despite a little bit of overacting by the lead emil jannings br br jannings is a general from czarist russia who is living out his final days making a few bucks in the 1920s by being a hollywood extra his luck appears to have changed as he gets a casting call to play an imperial russian general fighting against the communists during the revolution naturally this isn't much of a stretch acting wise but it also gets the old man to thinking about the old days and the revolution br br exactly what happens next i'll leave to you but it's a pretty good film particularly at the end by the way look for william powell as the russian director despite being made in 1928 with the makeup he doesn't look much younger than he did in many of his later films
<START> this is without a shadow of a doubt one of the scariest and most intriguing episodes of doctor who this is a thrilling psychological ride and you will probably find your own beliefs being thrown into question riddled with spine chilling moments this is an episode no who fan can afford to miss br br starting from when the pit was opened after the events in the impossible planet the doctor and ida are trapped and are running out of air with no other alternatives they decide to find what lies at the bottom of the pit an event which surpasses even the doctor's expectations whilst there the doctor is forced to make what he considers to be the ultimate sacrifice br br meanwhile rose and the other members of the planet try to find a way to fend off the ood whose minds have been poisoned by the beast also is toby zed truly cured of his possession by the beast
<START> i for one really like this movie for some reasons i'll go into late but i want to touch on why i think people don't like it first off there are people out there who just like to hate tom cruise i don't understand it really second cameron crowe i think successfully p es off two groups of movie goers with this film the casual relaxed not looking to think too hard group of movie goers are left confused when the plot takes a complete 180 at the end of the movie and the deep philosophical mystery fans are devastated when crowe has one of his characters completely explain the mystery br br this is a good movie and tom cruise does a very good job in it i think it's probably his best performance from what i've seen all though i haven't seen all of his movies or even a majority of them probably the supporting cast is good as well penelope cruz gives a solid performance and jason lee was enjoyable br br i like the story and i think that's what vanilla sky is more than anything it's a mystery an adventure and a romantic comedy but it's mostly just a good story and it has a lot of philosophical undertones to it and many similar ideas and stories like this occur in historical philosophy david aames cruise is the man that had everything he wanted more or less lost it was given a second chance with a catch to regain it all back and in the end facing his demons and the full scope of what is happening chooses reality simplicity and normality to see if he can finally find the one thing he could never get a grip on happiness br br many people were disappointed that crowe laid out the complete mystery at the end i think it's necessary the audience then knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that david is aware of his circumstances and it makes the choice at the end all the more powerful br br and the music in the movie is great it's probably what makes the movie as enjoyable as it is particularly njosnavelin by sigur ros which is an amazing song br br all in all i'd give it 3 out 4 stars it's a movie with some substance for those who like to think things through and a great story for those looking to relax that moderate approach is probably why people dislike it so much because it isn't a full blown mystery or a full blown love story it mixes and matches different elements and genres
<START> if this movie as meant to discourage people from doing drugs it fails i was ready to start using them i got waiting for something to happen and nothing ever really did this movie is neither horror or drama it's just the paranoia of meth users this movie may win an award for the using the f word so many times and so uselessly it was not well stated but i felt like they were making meth to replace meth they owed to someone hector just got worse and more paranoid as the movie went on and the girl just got more hopeless the ending really made no sense the movie made no sense unless it was just showing how annoying is is to be stuck in a house in the middle of nowhere with a meth head i relied on the other feedback when i decided to watch this movie and the rating on this movie should be a much lower average
<START> i have a two year old son who suffers from the same condition as jonny kennedy i never got the chance to meet him but i have never heard anybody say a bad word about him i hope he knows how much the making of this programme has helped his fellow sufferers by raising awareness of this terrible condition this man has touched people in a way that a million charity leaflets could not i believe that this should be compulsory viewing in schools i also agree with other comments what have i got to moan about he took everything that life could throw at him and still managed to retain a sense of humour god bless i couldn't watch the part that showed his dressings being changed i have enough trouble with my son's
<START> i don't watch soaps my grandmother still watches that one with the hour glass i made fun of them it when i was ten it was so easy br br but this movie takes parody and spells it a new way i found the story pretty damn funny the fashions of the 80's shoulder pads sequins and polyester just top it off the huge hair the high heels and the histrionics what a combination br br and all the actors just go to town chewing up their parts and spitting them out in a big well scripted pile sally kevin elisabeth wonderful whoopi great robert downey refreshing to see him back when he had such potential before the tabloids and garry why did we have to wait so long to see him on film leesa gibbons hadn't been missing her but nice to include her as a real life entertainment reporter and where do you apply for that job anyway br br admittedly i could have done without sally climbing the drainpipe lucy ricardo did it how many times as has every comedienne from carol burnett to i don't know who and i'm so done with it now i could spit peanuts if i had them apparently it's what you do when you're being funny in a tall building in new york i'm just thankful they didn't pull out the flagpole bit br br but it was cute it was funny it had plot twists it had an after credits ending before that was common it had clothes worthy of a second glance it had a great cast and it's got personal memories for me really what more do you need
<START> not many reviews hence thought i would add one br br do not go by the other reviews this was a excellent movie br br rks is one of the very few indian directors that can actually put together a really good movie br br ab and akshay given yet another example of great acting as does bhoomika too which was a little unexpected but great to watch br br am surprised there has not been much hype around release br br or filmfare other awards nominations considering how good the movie was br br better then khakee i thought and i thought khakkee too was good movie br br is a fairly long movie but definitely worth it and while watching it definitely does seem long br br cant wait for rks next movie and the next ab akshay movie they always seem to do well together e g waqt br br bhoomika too has acted really well in the movie and should do really well if she continue in the same fashion in the future
<START> i saw this movie the other day in a film school class and i hadn't seen an almodovar movie before but went in expecting it to be good unfortunately it turned out to be a pointless film with only a couple of laughs mixed in with two hours of sheer boredom high heels is just a collection of random scenes that might have worked in their own separate movies but together don't add up to any kind of meaningful whole at all br br or so i thought then the next day my film professor spent the entire class period explaining all of the movie's hidden little details like how the mural depicting stereotypical flamenco dancers in the background of the drag queen scene is some kind of commentary on the lack of identity that spain as a nation has developed under fascist rule apparently the whole movie is chock full of clever little visual tricks and references like this br br great but you know what it's still a bad movie it takes more than depth and complexity to make a good film you still need to give the audience a reason to keep paying attention something to interest the viewer enough to actually care about all the subtle tricks high heels gives us strange off beat characters but keeps them in mostly mundane situations recycled from other movies and almodovar doesn't seem to be using them to make any kind of point what is the significance for example of the hitchcockian surprise character revelation that occurs towards the end of the film why is that even in there just to surprise us br br there is one funny scene that has to do with a news broadcast and that's it that's the only entertaining moment the rest of the movie is just nonsensical filmic references and visual cues that apparently exist only for the sake of showing us how smart pedro almodovar is but no matter what my film professor says it takes more than self indulgent trickery for a movie to be good
<START> i loved this movie it is a definite inspirational movie it fills you with pride this movie is worth the rental or worth buying it should be in everyones home best movie i have seen in a long time it will make you mad because everyone is so mean to carl brashear but in the end it gets better it is a story of romance drama action and plenty of funny lines to keep you tuned in i love a lot of the quotes i use them all the time they help keep me on task of what i want to do it shows that anyone can achieve their dreams all they have to do is work for it it is a long movie but every time i watch it i never notice that it is as long as it is i get so engrossed in it that it goes so quick i love this movie i watch it whenever i can
<START> james bishop matt stasi goes to a mental illness facility' for a medical residence assignment with dr mccort bruce paynes there he realizes that many interns are being killed by the ripper' who takes their souls to the devil in a cult promoted by dr mccort this story is so absurd and imbecile that it is impossible to write a summary the dialogs are so ridiculous specially when the character of helen the blonde fiancÃ© of james bishop arrives in the asylum that it is almost unbelievable that a writer has had the courage to include them in a screenplay and what about the return of james to the hospital to bring the files of the dead patients and the cast composed of ham actors and actresses honestly i do not know what or who is the worst in this film the screenplay the director or the cast the correct answer certainly is all of them i saw this flick on cable television and i am astonished how can a producer spend money in such a garbage this horror movie becomes very funny considering the absurd of the plot my vote is three br br title brazil demÃ´nio' devil'
<START> actually i never bought into the metal was satanic and stuff but this movie kind of played on that idea though certainly not a movie to take seriously or to rate really high it does serve its purpose in that it entertains while it is playing the story has a metal band burned to death in their hotel one of their fans has a dream to this effect and said band starts to go on a kill spree from beyond the grave so yes a bit of nightmare on elm street plot going on here granted freddy never molested a girl in a car before there was another movie featuring a heavy metal band in it but it was very different in how it played out as it had a band that kind of took over a town of kids and made them crazy this one simply has the one fan of the band kind of helping the killer spirit at first then trying to stop him nothing to gruesome in it as i do not remember all that many gory kills quite frankly the scene i do remember most is the scene of the girl wearing the headphones and then being molested by some creature incarnation of the band nothing great but a nice time filler
<START> if you've ever seen an eighties slasher there isn't much reason to see this one originality often isn't one of slasher cinema's strongpoints and it's something that this film is seriously lacking in there really isn't much that can said about pranks so i'll make this quick the film was one of the 74 films included on the dpp video nasty list and that was my only reason for seeing it the plot follows a bunch of kids that stay behind in a dorm at christmas time as they're in a slasher someone decides to start picking them off and this leads to one of the dullest mysteries ever seen in a slasher movie the fact that this movie was on the video nasty list is bizarre because despite a few gory scenes this film is hardly going to corrupt or deprave anyone and gorier slashers than this friday the 13th for example didn't end up banned but then again there's banned films that are much less gory than this one the witch who came from the sea for example anyway the conclusion of the movie is the best thing about it as although the audience really couldn't care less who the assailant is by this point it is rather well done on the whole this is a dreary and dismal slasher that even slasher fans will do well to miss
<START> so i had heard from a few people that this film had brought them to tears in the theater as i watched it for the first time i was expecting another romantic tear jerking barbra streisand film something like the way we were i was certainly wrong the chemistry between the two main characters esther hoffman and her john howard was nonexistent making it impossible to get attached to the characters there wasn't anything romantic about it streisand's character fell for an alcoholic drug addict who couldn't sing a single note without making me want to hit the fast forward button at one point her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and she forgives him about five minutes later there's nothing romantic about a deadbeat rock star and a woman who can't seem to realize it until he actually dies parts of the movie seemed to drag on and on and i kept asking myself when it was going to end br br the death of john howard was completely predictable there was totally obvious foreshadowing of his reckless behavior early on in the movie and when he died i felt no emotion whatsoever it wasn't a tragic accident it was him basically being an idiot not to mention throughout the movie i was distracted by his hideous beard br br the only parts of this movie worth seeing are the streisand songs the ending of the movie when she sings with one more look at you watch closely now was my reason for giving this film a whopping 3 10 those 7 minutes were the only part of the movie i actually felt an emotion other than irritation and anger
<START> zu warriors most definitely should've been an animated series because as a movie it's like watching an old anime on acid the movie just starts out of nowhere and people just fly around fighting with metal wings and other stupid weapons until this princess sacrifices herself for her lover on a cloud or something whether this princess is a god or an angel is beyond me but soon enough this flying wind bad guy comes in and kills her while the guy with the razor wings fights some other mystical god demon wizard thing the plot line is either not there or extremely hard to follow you need to be insanely intelligent to get this movie the plot soon follows this chinese mortal who is called upon by this god to fight the evil flying princess killing bad guy and soon we have a very badly choreographed uwe boll like fight scene complete with terrible martial arts on a mountain or something even the visuals are weird some might say they are stunning and colorful but i'm going to say they are blurry and acid trip like yes that's a word i watched it both dubbed and with subtitles and both were equally bad and hard to understand who am i kidding i didn't understand it at all it felt like i was watching episode 30 of some 1980's anime and completely missed how the story began or like i started reading a comic series of 5 at number 4 because i had no clue how this thing started where it was going or how it would end i was lost the entire time i can honestly say this was one of the worst film experiences ever it was like watching inu yasha at episode 134 drunk yeah that's right you don't know what the hell is going on don't waste your brain trying to figure this out
<START> words can't simply describe how awful this film is i watched it on video last night and i simply could not believe what i was seeing basically snakeeater is about an ex military man lorenzo lamas and his search for his kidnapped sister who has been held captive by deliverance style rednecks the film's acting writing direction photography and editing are deplorable along with a song called soldier that has to be one of the worst theme songs of all time br br however there is one treat horshack ron pallio from welcome back carter is in the film playing a laughable bad guy otherwise please avoid this mess at all costs
<START> in it's time this movie had controversy written all over it like most of verhoeven's projects br br containing very graphic depictions death scenes a parachute that doesn't open smack guys body on the floor a guy being eaten by a lion chomp teeth in the throat and a guy being run over by a speedboat zoom bloody corpse going down br br but besides gore this flick also contains some brilliant and stunningly beautiful scenes filmed in the gray fisher's town that is vlissingen br br thousands of rosebuds flying over the screen in a somewhat irrelevant part of the movie a beautiful holy woman putting flowers in a milk can surrounded by slabs of blood dripping meat and a steamy love scene between two male characters in a graveyard br br the story is concluded in a frantic but fulfilling 10 minutes that don't disappoint and will leave you sighing a breath of relief br br of course with the pros come the cons some special effects are too over the top and are obviously done to see how far verhoeven could push the gore factor e g the several eyeballs hanging out of their sockets also while the two lead actors jeroen krabbÃ© and renÃ©e soutendijk do an excellent job of breathing life into their characters the character of herman portrayed by the rather un charming thom hoffman just feels enormously underdeveloped making him hard to care for even after his tragic death br br i've done my best to give you a slight idea of what to expect of this amazing movie and as you can see it's not easily summed up in words so do yourself a favor if you happen to find this movie somewhere watch it and enjoy the unique style and substance of this masterpiece
<START> moon child is the story of two brothers and a friend trying to make it in a futuristic economically unstable japan after a cunning disaster gone wrong someone new enters young sho's life a special friend by the name of kei years later they have grown rather close and have found ways to combine both their talents into one unstoppable team during another escapade they encounter a new friend and his mute sister who become part of their band of friends before long disaster again strikes and the group falls apart alliances turn to enemies and their worlds are all turned upside down regrets and hopelessness claim some while power and success take others tragedy claims still others truths are revealed and lives are forever changed br br and you will never see a more beautiful sunrise br br this movie is a gripping tale of undying friendships webs of relationships and a team that not even death can keep apart for too long moon child combines sci fi drama and action with the perfect cast and talent to create the most sensationally moving movie of the time and great for most audiences it minimizes the everyday romances and puts more emphasis on the important values we can all relate to such as friendships loyalty and believing in yourself nothing could possibly compare i personally have never seen anything quite like it and i don't suspect i ever will again br br it appeals to the wider population in many ways and is a must see for all
<START> mean spirited ugly nasty retro action thriller about a bodyguard who is determined to find and destroy the killers of the girl he was supposed to protect this film is almost an anachronism in today's politically correct atmosphere director scott doesn't have any desire to apologize for the inherently immorality behind the film's dramatic structure scott is either not aware or doesn't care for 30 years of social advances i really don't think we will see a more violent film any time soon so you better go and see this one while you can despite its relentless grimness i think the movie is a powerful example of cinema at its most sinister exploitative and effective scott has a tough thing to sell but i think i'm a buyer the extraordinary technical aspects of this film are just too effective for me to ignore scott's directorial choices are simply astonishing and he pulls a great performance out of denzel washington sensitive souls need to stay away from this one but i recommended it to those viewers looking for a great action filled movie
