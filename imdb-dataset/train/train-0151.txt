<START> considering 'a star is born' had been made twice already by the time the 1976 film came into production the latest remake has a freshness about it that can be attributed to the fantastic chemistry between the entire acting ensemble a viewer could be forgiven for believing that kris kristofferson barbara streisand were a couple off screen as well as on with their incredible displays of pure affection towards one another br br the film has been described in the past as a 'barbara streisand concert on film set to a soap opera storyline' however for anyone that enjoys watching a film that takes you beyond the living room into a world where the characters seem truly alive a star is born is well worth the hiring price br br with its incredible soundtrack flawless acting and touching reality in regards to human emotions and the true frailty of life a star is born is a film that draws you into the world of esther hoffman the love of her life john norman howard br br a film for anyone that sees the beauty in real love the kind that keeps you devoted to a person even as they break your heart
<START> monarch cove was one of the best friday night's drama shown in a long time i am asking the writer to please write a long series and air it on lifetime soon each person was very interesting and did a wonderful job with their lines to make the plot come true however the movie needs to continue for a long time i would love to see bianca and jake's child grow up and get a major role in the movie along with the new grandparents planning for her educational future also bring kathy back to see her niece and help foster her life it was great seeing the grandparents work out their problems but the family business needed to be restored to working status and let us see how jake and bianca survive through the marriage years
<START> i saw that movie and i was shocked robert carlyle isn't hitler he is a man who sadly tries to be hitler the movie lies it doesn't reflect the truth in the scene were hitler hit the guy with his gun hitler never had hit anybody he wouldn't hit people with his fist but with the fists of soldiers understand another thing is it is too obvious that hitler is that evil he was more clever than shown in this movie no german would have accepted him as the leader because the can see that he is evil so the real hitler haven't shown his evil side to the people br br have any of you yankees watched the movie der untergang or the dawnfall this is a great movie with amazing actors and its a german movie i think this theme of nazi germany should not be realized as a movie by people who don't know anything of germany people watch der untergang br br http www imdb com title tt0363163 br br its a great movie about a very sad period of time for human beings around the world
<START> i hate plane crash movies all of them in fact i hate them all with a passion first of all they are cheap looking and have no craftsmanship secondly they insult the airline industry and say to the audience that all planes do is fall out of the sky and crash br br why i wince at such a film this could happen to any of us and with worser consequences than those suffered by the characters in said movie which is the only chilling aspect of an airline disaster yarn such as this i hate this movie because it's like all the 50 000 000 stupid ass airplane chaos movies before it freefall is like all the others nothing more than boredom before the clichÃ©d bullshit dramatic scenes take place br br first off we have same cast of retards on this flying death trap the cleaver esquire family of three the yuppie baastard and the bitch of a flight attendant complete with a big blond hairdo from 1987 scolding anyone who is the least bit frightened br br my second gripe is this shouldn't be a full length movie but a documentary explaining everything about the air canada gimbli glider incident a k a freefall right down to the safety precautions br br my third and final gripe is with all airline films of this caliber with the exception of fearless why the hell did the male steward instruct the passengers to remove there shoes i could understand high heels and sharp loose objects but c'mon like that's gonna' make them any more f king safer than they are now this plane if they the passengers didn't know any better knew they were going to crash land why would you force 100 injured people down a rubber slide that can cause skin to peel and bleed on impact only to walk in their stocking feet on a debris field does this make any sense to anyone br br fearless and the hit abc series lost had more depth and realism to air disaster than just plane malfunctions people panic stewards become assholes plane lands without wheels in a field people wander without shoes and jackets etc the same old crap from airport 1975 freefall was so typical of a air crash movie that i almost expect to see either charlton heston or peter graves burst into the damn passenger cabin at any moment could we at least see how these poorly acted characters go back to normalcy instead of people rejoicing amidst the impending tragedy that is staring in front of them typical moronic lifetime movie cheap and stupid br br the director of freefall should stick to cheap made for tv movies with white middle aged women with stupid teenage kids who do drugs and have marital problems as for suspense leave it to the professionals you hack why should we the audience sit through over an hour and a half of this airport wannabe rehash i hope to god they don't make plane crash movies like this anymore if this were like the abc series lost then it would be something to watch but this is utter crap and then some stop turning every plane disaster movie into airport 1975 this is not airport this is cheap pathetic waste of my time i would not recommend this movie or any made for tv air disaster movie to anyone not even my worst enemies
<START> the original title means the birth of the octopuses i must confess that i do not quite understand this title the english title is water lilies but after having written this i read the comment by another user the title in french is also suggestive prieuve or octopus suggest an individual having to juggle many pressures simultaneously thanks for your explanation br br the basic theme is the first sexual emotions of girls when it is not clear if they are directed toward the same or the other sex it is no different for boys i think that both floriane and marie will eventually have heterosexual feelings without any admixtures br br much of the movie is water ballet sometimes the girls will have their heads downwards and nothing above the water except their feet and lowers legs with which they will wave and kick in the air to people like me who had never seen such things before it was fascinating floriane is the leader of one team of water lilies br br marie tells her that she would like to see when floriane is training this seems to be their first contact that is not just ordinary soon they will walk together floriane takes marie to a garage where a boy is waiting for her and then goes away with him for an hour while marie is waiting for her to return i took for granted that the couple slept with each other but we will later learn from the movie that they do less than that br br i can supply some information which few users will find elsewhere there is a scene in which marie secretly steals floriane's garbage bag in it she finds an apple mostly eaten and marie proceeds to eat the rest Â there is a parallel scene in another movie kazetachi no gogo afternoon breezes by hitoshi yazaki japan 1980 this is about adult young females and a clearly lesbian woman is vainly in love with a heterosexual woman she also steals a garbage bag of the beloved and also finds a more or less eaten apple and eats the rest br br later floriane tells marie that she would like to have her first orgasm from her marie says she cannot do this br br but still later marie says that she is indeed willing to do it and she masturbates on floriane there is no nudity in this scene br br probably only a female director could have made such a fine psychological show or study of Â i would like to quote baudelaire les amours enfantines br br floriane is played by adÃ¨le haenel who made the excellent performance as the autistic girl in the little devils by christophe ruggia 2002 Â a very underrated movie
<START> i will admit that i did not give this movie much of a chance i decided pretty early on that this just wasn't my kind of movie br br for the most part it has an excellent look in terms of its cinematography the scenes of early 70's manhattan look very good as does the lead actress it is a very crisp black and white which could almost make the movie feel undated and fresh however some of the other techniques the filmmakers employ shoot that prospect all to hell the disjointed editing is very late 60's somewhere between surrealism and new wave the story also feels like it came from a very specific time somewhere between free love idealism and artsy experimentation br br the film follows a young girl around the city as she looks for a man who she had anonymous phone sex with as she meets other odd characters she reveals her quirks and they reveal theirs the movie seems to be meant as an off the wall irreverent comedy but adds an avant garde feel i would expect that if you like andy warhol movies you would be very excited to discover the telephone book br br some problems i had near the end of the movie one character tells a rambling anecdote that lasts over twelve minutesÂ brutal to sit through also there is a very explicit animation sequence that i found gross and juvenile that serves as the film's climax i did laugh out loud four or five times and i liked the ending minus the flat out disgusting animation and when the film switched to color for the final phone booth at night sequence i actually liked the way it looked even better it ended up being one of those experiences where i felt like i could have really liked it if it been a little different but this is what the filmmakers gave us it is obscure artsy and way left of the dial but none of those are reasons to recommend it on their own i didn't find it to be unique or creative so much as forced and pretentious
<START> the movie sucked it wasn't funny it wasn't exciting they tried to make it so bad that it would be good but failed and thinking it's cool to like this movie next to the hype are the only reasons that this movie is a success br br the fact that at this moment 50 voted a 10 out of 10 for this movie seems pretty concerning to me either the movie going public is going insane or this vote is unrealistic which can have numerous causes and should be dealt with anyway it is a less than average movie which bloomed through mouth to mouth advertising it's success can only be described as a marketing marvel
<START> i rented this movie thinking it looked like a wonderfully delightful historical piece what i got was a piece of pure garbage this movie was confusing in most spots choppy in almost every spot and dreadful in all spots mira sorvino's portrayal of a queen playing a young male scholar was depressing at best ben kingsley should have been stripped of his knighthood for even considering this film as one of his projects fiona shaw should definitely stick to playing petunia dursley at least the harry potter movies are more entertaining than this thing they call a play within a movie br br the cinematography looks like some college kid took a class in cinematography 101 and failed miserably almost every scene in the movie is chopped up for some sort of effect the end result of course being the cheesiest bit of editing i've ever seen jay rodan was almost good as agis too bad he had such a bad script to work with rachael stirling gives her best effort as the almost gullible lady in waiting in the end i really wish blockbuster video gave refunds i'm so glad i didn't spend 10 bucks watching this fiasco in the theater if they've been performing this marivaux play since the 18th century it makes me wonder how many people over the ages have had their best naps during this work if i had been there they wouldn't have hear the play over the snoring thank goodness for the modern convenience of dvd players you can skip past the boring or awful scenes guess that means i only watched the beginning and the end
<START> i'm biased towards any movie that paints a luxuriant picture of italy in my opinion the most romantic country in the world unfortunately the movie was rather short unusually so for a period piece and a little sparse on the cinematography aspect however the excellent story makes up for it the four ladies embark on a much needed relaxing vacation with problems on their minds over the course of the movie they realize their problems and begin fixing them they believe san salvatore the castle they stay in has an enchanting effect on people it's a tub of love says lottie wilkins you can watch their gradual change from dissatisfied to exuberant as the italian seaside works its magic on them br br all their problems and their solutions are plausible the actresses were great the background music seemed very appropriate for an romantic italian locale all in all a 10 10 movie for me
<START> now i've seen a lot of bad movies i like bad movies especially bad action movies i've seen and enjoyed all of jean claude van damme's movies including the one where he's his own clone both of the ones where he plays twins and all three where he's a cyborg i actually own the one where he plays a fashion designer and has a fight in a truck full of durians hey if nothing else he's got a great ass and you almost always get to see it with dvd you can even pause and zoom in that's why you can trust me when i say that this movie is so bad it makes plan 9 look like citizen kane br br everything about snake eater is bad the plot is bad the script is bad the sets are bad the fights are bad the stunts are bad the fx are bad the acting is spectacularly earth time bendingly bad very probably showcasing the worst performance of every so called actor in the cast including lorenzo lamas and that's really saying something and i'd be willing to bet everyone involved with this movie is lousy in bed to boot especially lorenzo lamas br br it does manage to be unintentionally funny so it's not a total loss however i recommend that you watch this movie only if you are either a congenital idiot or very very stoned i was able to sit through it myself because i needed to watch something to distract me from rinsing cat urine out of my laundry br br it didn't help much but it was better than nothing one point for ron palillo's cameo as a gay arsonist
<START> it's interesting at first a naive park ranger colin firth marries a pretty mysterious woman lisa zane he's only known for a short time they seem to be happy then she disappears without warning he searches for her and after a few dead ends stumbles upon some of her abused childhood and sleazy recent past which may include criminal activity and then it seems the filmmakers didn't know what to do with the story the beginning while not as suspenseful as it sounds is at least watchable then it ceases to be interesting or even make much sense and the ending is so lame so dull and so devoid of any excitement or intelligence you'll think the screenwriters didn't know what to do with it and got bored trying what a sorry waste of a good idea
<START> ed wood is eclipsed and becomes orson welles this film is fantastic vampire witches who fight in terribly choreographed scenes and dialog that could have breaking ribs with laughter plan 9 from outerspace dons't stand a chance against this described by the writer and psychic stephen armourae on the vampire forum as a masterpiece he's from england and thoroughly sarcastic br br it has stephanie beaton and the producers know whats going to save them from bankcrupcy by repeatedly using her though she leaves me cold as she looks more like the undead than all the devil raisers and eileen daly is just a lower rate elvira the whole thing is badly done br br watch it for the script though
<START> i've no idea what dimwit from san francisco came up with this stupid plot but apparently they need to get off whatever drugs they are taking and put their analyst on danger money now br br yeah this is a plausible story if you regard the alien abduction sequence in life of brian as plausible br br this film is little more than a leftist pipedream had the us and ussr give up nuclear weapons the result would've been to eliminate the only real obstacle that kept the two from engaging in a war bad as korea vietnam and other wars of the era were they were proxy wars fought to keep the superpowers from a direct engagement br br this film makes me think about how realistic it was when some group of high school kids would go on a hunger strike against nuclear proliferation as if someone would say mr president some kids at drastic high are not eating and ronald reagan would reply my god i'd better revise my defense policy right br br like this film wouldn't it be better if the soviet union would've collapsed because they could not support their massive arms build wait that happened
<START> piece of subtle art maybe a masterpiece doubtlessly a special story about the ambiguity of existence tale in kafka style about impossibility of victory or surviving in a perpetual strange world the life is in this film only exercise of adaptation lesson about limits and original sin about the frailty of innocence and error of his ways br br leopold kessle is another joseph k images of trial and same ambiguous woman and europa is symbol of basic crisis who has many aspects like chimeric wars or unavailing search of truth essence golden age br br methaphor or parable the movie is history of disappointed's evolution war peace business or lie are only details of gelatin time hypocrisy is a mask love a convention the sacrifice only method to hope understanding a painful reality
<START> a trio of treasure hunters is searching the west indies for a hidden fortune the lure of gold makes for a rise in tension as the men come closer to the treasure's location the deep sea divers hope to track down the gold but find that greed and hatred leads to murder according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis manfish is the name of their boat not a monster the skeleton who gives muscular captain john bromfield as brannigan his half of the treasure map is very good old salt victor jory as professor provides the other half of the map first mate lon chaney jr as swede plays dumb and sexy tessa prendergast as alita guards the rum not very well obviously serious editing and continuity problems mar the picture which otherwise might have amounted to something br br manfish 2 56 w lee wilder john bromfield victor jory lon chaney jr
<START> with part reconstruction and part direct shooting the directors made a formidably limpid documentary on a coup d'Ã©tat against president chavez in venezuela organized by a foreign secret service and fully supported by the wealthy venezuelan minority the political opposition the church a cynical laughing cardinal and the us government it was another chapter in the history of us foreign policy which steven kinzer calls 'overthrow' or 'sowing democracy american style' in fact this foreign backed intervention was not only a coup d'Ã©tat against president chavez but also against the democratic majority which elected him br br that this is a brilliant documentary is mightily confirmed by the violent reactions for and against it on internet as saint augustine said 'men love truth when it bathes them in its light they hate it when it proves them wrong ' br br this movie is a must see for all those who want to understand the world we live in
<START> i hate to be the one to rain on a parade even a small one like this but from the very first scene you could tell this film was going to be absolute shite its a shame really as i quite like martin freeman and danny dyer i was intrigued as to how they would mix in a film together but to my dismay they did not even have a scene together i think i need to repeat this the two lead actors who stand side by side on the advertisement posters and dvd covers did not have one scene together they did not speak to each other and never appeared on screen at the same time just about sums up this poor excuse for a movie false advertisement br br the dialogue was painful every single character in the movie was unrealistic and un human like the scenarios were far fetched the plot was crap the jokes were thin freeman tried too hard to be funny and played a poor mans tim from the office nobody was likable and worst of all some of the characters were so annoying that it almost drove me to switch off as i couldn't bear to watch or listen to them any longer br br this low budget stinker was an epic fail even danny dyer couldn't inject some humour and charm into this but bless he tried what a waste of time br br how anybody could rate this movie as 'ten stars' is beyond me ten stars seriously come on i won't even give some of the greats ten stars as ten stars implies that a movie was perfect this film was far from perfect almost the opposite meaning that it was almost completely dire throughout br br watch it if you like but if you've seen a lot of movies and watched a lot of great movies your review will probably similar to mine br br 1 10
<START> for a film that got little publicity and few people have heard about this was pretty good it's another one of these modern day british crime films that are quirky snatch sexy beast etc it's not wild like snatch but it's interesting and it has some rough characters br br it also has a corny and somewhat predictable ending but early in the show not late has some neat twists to make it very interesting for the first time viewer basically it's about a low key british male who sends away for a russian mail order bride who winds up with the aid of two russian male friends providing a couple of big surprises br br ben chapin and nicole kidman co star and are very good as are vincent cassel and matthieu kassovitz as kidman's russian cohorts this is a different kind of film and well acted kidman once again proves she's far more than just a beautiful face
<START> this gloriously turgid melodrama represents douglas sirk at his most high strung it eschews the soft wistfulness of all that heaven allows and the weepy sentimentality of imitation of life and instead goes for feverish angst and overheated tension and of course it's all captured in vibrant technicolor br br the cornball story has something to do with a friendship between rock hudson and robert stack that becomes a rivalry when hudson snags the affections of lauren bacall but who's really paying attention to the story dorothy malone won a best supporting actress academy award for her splendidly over the top performance as stack's sister who takes the family business into her own hands when no one else will a highlight of the film comes when this high spirited wild child breaks into a frantic dance in her bedroom unable to bear the restraints placed upon her by middle class propriety as so frequently happens in sirk movies the scene is both unintentionally hilarious in its absurdity and yet strangely moving in its effectiveness br br sirk came closer than anyone else to turning pure camp into high art satisfying the philistines and the high brows at the same time within the same films his was a unique talent and i don't know that there's ever been another film maker quite like him since br br grade a
<START> my grandmother bought me this film when i was 5 i've always love scary movies and even then i enjoyed it the atmosphere is awesome and the story original and entertaining i especially love the scenes where the rv is under attack in the desert the rocks are actually convincing for such a low budget flick the acting is above average for these kinds of films and the music is eerie this is definitely an uder rated gem i recommend it to anyone who likes these strange films from the late seventies early eighties such as alice sweet alice poor pretty eddie nightmare hospital massacre and return of the aliens the deadly spawn definitely a classic
