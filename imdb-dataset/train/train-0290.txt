<START> le locataire the tenant is without a doubt one of the most important horror movies ever made polanski stars as a trelkovsky a timid file clerk living in paris who answers an advertisement for an apartment only to find that the previous tenant attempted suicide by leaping from the apartment window trelkovsky is compelled to visit her in the hospital and there he meets stella isabelle adjani trelkovsky immediately moves in when the previous tenant dies and at first is quite pleased with having found such a nice apartment his happiness is soon replaced by waves of paranoia as he becomes increasingly suspicious of his neighbours who seem to be trying to provoke trelkovsky into repeating the previous tenant's suicide this film is great polanski manages to create a surreal atmosphere of dread and paranoia plenty of brilliant moments such as the classic scene where trelkovsky discovers the previous tenant's tooth in a hole in the wall or the fever dream where he wanders into the building's bathroom to find the walls covered with hieroglyphics the photography by sven nykvist is truly beautiful the tenant is a neglected gem it may be difficult to track down but it is more than worth the effort
<START> in a lot of his films citizen kane confidential report touch of evil orson welles gave him the role of an exuberant men in the lady from shanghai it's the only time i see him holding the role of the victim the role of the culprit he gave it to rita hayworth i guess it's because he was in love with her therefore it's an interesting film but i find the story excellent too the direction is genius as usual with welles two scenes are particularly brilliant the one in the aquarium and the final one with the mirrors this film is brilliant 10 10
<START> the plot sounded like it had promise to be honest i did not watch the entire movie after about an hour into the movie i had to make a decision is this movie worth watching until it conclusion the answer was clearly no it was not the fact that the human body could not receive a transplant from a different species without rejecting it nor the premise that he was being chased by secret government authorities for an human wolf transplant it was because the movie was badly written acting lacked emotion and i did not understand the several dream sequences with the wolves and buffaloes when he was running to the zoo with a dog pack and leaving them at the front of the zoo gate the saying if you can't run with the big dogs don't leave the porch kept running through my bored mind save yourself the time and skip this movie i can guarantee if you do dare to watch it you will sit there slack jawed as i did wondering why anyone waste money time energy and effort to make this insulting outrage to american cinema
<START> i haven't laughed this hard at a movie in a long time i got to go to an advance screening and was thrilled because i had been dying to see it i had tears in my eyes from laughter throughout a lot of the movie the audience all shared my laughter and was clapping and yelling throughout most of the movie br br kudos to steve carrell who i had already been a fan of he proves in this movie his tremendous talent for comedy he has a style that i haven't seen before and catherine keener is excellent as always thank god there wasn't a cameo from will ferrell love him but saw him too much this summer br br there were parts of comedic genius in this movie partly thanks to carrell and partly thanks to the writing also carrell the waxing scene and the speed dater with the obvious problem were absolutely hysterical br br i will definitely go see '40 year old virgin' when it's released my advice go to see it for huge laughs and an incredibly enjoyable movie on top of it
<START> i confess to have quite an uneasy feeling about ghosts movies and while i sometimes enjoy the genre when it comes to horror but when it comes to comedies they really need to be crazy to be funny 'over her dead body' seems to take afterlife a little bit too seriously and fails in my opinion from almost any aspect i can think about the story is completely unbelievable of course and did not succeed to convince me either in the comic or in the sentimental register the choice of the principal actresses was awful while paul rudd is at least handsome and looks like a nice guy the taste in ladies of his character seems to need serious improvement as eva longoria seems too aged sorry for him and lake bell seems too unattractive sorry again a romantic story without good enough reason for romance is due to failure from start jason biggs and lindsey sloane were actually better but they had only supporting roles the rest is uninteresting and uninspired with flat cinematography and cheap gags borrowed from unsuccessful tv comedies nothing really worth watching nothing to remember
<START> french director jean rollin isn't exactly known for great films and this confusing mess is one of the reasons why one of the most confusing things about this production is the title for a director who is well known for directing erotic films about lesbian vampires you would expect a film with the word 'nude' in the title to be a particularly bare breasted one but in fact there's not a lot of nudity here at all instead of erotic lesbian vampires with no clothes on we've got a cumbersome plot about a man who wants to unlock the secret to immortality a young woman whose affliction might hold the key and a suicide cult who don't get to do much the film starts off promisingly with a sequence that sees a young girl carried off by a mysterious bunch of people in masks under the watchful eye of a young french man who also happens to be the son of a man of importance through his investigation he soon discovers that this woman is not just a normal lady and as he delves deeper into the cult he discovers that cannot be killed by bullets drinks blood and can't go out in daylight sounds like a clear cut case of vampirism to me br br jean rollin keeps the fantasy atmosphere going throughout the film but it fails to be interesting because the plot is so badly executed it is possible to keep up with what's going on but only because there's so many other films that follow similar plots to this one the director seems to know that he's messed up the plotting too as the climax is basically an excuse to explain the film to the audience there is a twist thrown in at the end also but the film would have been better without it i guess this was jean rollin's attempt to be a little original but it comes off as a ham fisted attempt at such rather than a logical continuation of the story the cinematography is fairly neat with lots of the plot taking place in suitably gothic locations the girls on board complete what is a pretty picture and what rollin's film lacks in logic and consistency it somewhat makes up for in style in the film's defence it was made in 1969 which somewhat explains the lack of shocks but i can't recommend this movie as it doesn't have much about it that is worth taking note of
<START> more a snapshot of the most popular pinup of all time than your typical dragged out biopic this fun and fabulous film has the look and feel of the era with an excellent soundtrack and everything you would want in an indie type film i think the tendency would be to portray bettie page as some sort of sex vixen like a jayne mansfield but if you've truly looked carefully at bettie's poses she always looked happy not a you wish you could get with me haughty look nor the i'm just doing this because my acting career didn't work out look of a porn star and so the ladies involved with this film three female producers a female writer director female co writer and the lovely gretchen mol who i'm sure helped shape this role with her own sugary influence really captured the idea of a sweet somewhat naive southern girl who really enjoyed having her photo taken and hoped that good ol' jc wouldn't be too upset with her br br gretchen mol turns out a career high performance she may just have the most perfect breasts ever which i am happy about because she did have the curse several years ago she made the cover of vanity fair when no one really knew who she was touting her as the next it girl and let's be frank that was a bit presumptuous i mean unfortunately she has never made it to gwyneth status though not for lack of talent making a few poor film choices when you are a pretty blonde in fickle hollywood renders you forgettable i'm afraid if this doesn't put her back on the a list well i'll be a monkey's uncle br br intensely private bettie herself has not seen the film yet bettie left the pinup party on a high note and fell in love with her old flame jesus whatever floats your boat honey you were one helluva woman i hope you're happy wherever you are br br congratulations mary harron you've done our cult idol justice
<START> i wasn't expecting to be so impacted by this film portraying a family just like the one you'd expect to be living next door they are ordinary flesh and blood people not like the typical hollywood fare they face an all too common problem debilitating illness but the story line grips the heart with a powerful lesson casting script direction and acting flow together with a surge that draws the viewer deep into the story give this film your full attention and its message will truly inspire
<START> i've seen a slew of 80s rocker horrors over the years from rubbish like terror on tour to ridiculously fun gems like slumber party massacre 2 somehow i managed to keep putting this one off which is strange because it's probably the most popular and well received one well i finally caught up with it and it's easily the best of this mostly awful but almost always endearing subgenre the plot which was pretty much lifted in the film black roses concerns a mulleted misfit named eddie whose ridiculed by all in his high school for his taste in music he loves 80s metal especially his idol sammi curr played by the late great tony fields after sammi is killed eddie favorite radio dj gives him sammi's final recording once eddie plays the record backwards he discovers he's a bit tougher and bad things start happening to those who taunt him is sammi's music possessed trick or treat is well made and a total hoot the special effects are awesome even though it does feature the typical 80s laser beams i grew up in the 80s and while i wasn't a fan of heavy metal i do remember the urban legend about playing a record backwards hearing the sounds of satan worshipping haha i also remember being told by my older siblings and neighbors that both kiss and ozzy worshipped satan so it's very amusing to see them both make cameos as a harmless radio dj and a anti rock priest if only i had seen this film as a kid while the film seems to poke fun at the popular connection in the 80s between alleged devil worship and heavy metal the viewer never really finds out why sammi curr is back from the dead creating havoc and killing whoever gets in his way this is movie's weakest point but if you can overlook that it's loads of fun
<START> bette davis' cockney accent in this film is absolutely appalling i totally understand that americans and other nationalities mightn't realise this and that's fine but believe me it's about half as good as dick van dyke's cockney accent in mary poppins and that was a right load of old pony slipped into london vernacular there many apologies br br the remarkable thing to me is that the strange accents and exaggerated acting styles don't detract from the films' power of human bondage is a fascinating piece of cinema despite its superficial faults it also has to be viewed in perspective the technical and cultural limitations of film making at the time have to be appreciated and given those limitations john cromwell does a very good job directing the camera and allowing the narrative to develop cinematically rather than solely via the mannered acting and stilted dialogue a fine example of his skillful direction is the scene set at victoria station it is beautifully conceived shot and edited note too the stark shots of the prostrate mildred towards the end of the film they owe more to the early days of artistic film making than the sanitised formulaic world of the studio that was about to dominate br br the themes of the film are universally familiar and compelling ones sexual obsession unrequited love scorned passion self loathing manipulative relationships social divides and youthful folly though the dialogue is often rather hackneyed the difficult task of portraying these themes and the inner lives of the characters is tackled well albeit in a low key way some of the scenes of obsession and emotional rejection are uncomfortable to watch but the story doesn't descend into clichÃ© we're aware that the characters even the poisonous mildred are both victims and perpetrators and that their actions are motivated by their misunderstanding of each others feelings as well as by wilful selfishness whilst naive in style the story reaches to the complex heart of the human condition and the mannered nature of the acting and the occasionally grating exchanges don't diminish the veracity of the work br br of human bondage was one of the films that got bette davis noticed in hollywood and whilst watching it you are conscious of being witness at the birth of a celebrated career her unconventional beauty and screen charisma no one flounced or did disdain quite like ms davis grab your attention from her first appearance whilst hers is definitely the memorable performance in the film leslie howard is also excellent as the sensitive and fragile student philip carey they are a good combination though why oh why didn't he help her with that terrible terrible accent
<START> who loves the sun works its way through some prickly subject matter with enough wit and grace to keep the story not only engaging but often hilarious it's been a while since i've found such a thoroughly touching thoroughly enjoyable film br br the film is gorgeous drawing the eye with beautiful scenery and tranquil landscapes the peaceful imagery contrasts wonderfully with the tension between the very human very flawed and yet very likable characters due to the excellent cast all five of the major players are wonderfully interesting and dynamic br br i recommend who loves the sun it's a really funny movie that takes a poignant look at the hurts that we can inflict on each other and the amazingly difficult but equally rewarding process of forgiveness
<START> an absolutely atrocious adaptation of the wonderful children's book crude and inappropriate humor some scary parts and a sickening side story about the mom's boyfriend wanting to send the boy away to military school to get him out of the way makes this totally inappropriate for the kids who will most likely want to see it because of the book 3 8 yr olds don't waste your money your time or your good judgement
<START> do you like really inventive comedy or do you love the wedding crashers if the answer is the latter stop reading now i can't believe this movie is not higher rated basically meadows plays a character not unlike austin powers there are so many inventive moments in this gagorama from crudity leon playing with himself on the porch the ex boyfriend tricked into eating oh well to inspired lunacy clown sex the broadway routine the voice over meadows is great as the childish but very sweet natured leon some great lines don't blame the wang freaky deaky sex world too many why this movie wasn't huge is a mystery great comedy
<START> solino really moved me with its deeply drawn characters while being a simple tale of rivalry between two brothers it was not simply about hate or jealousy what i liked most about the movie was how i could identify with the feelings gigi was going through especially when he had to take his mother back to her home town in italy and miss out on attending the festival film awards ceremony his film was entered into to see this character who struggled so hard between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty to his mother was so frustrating even at the end when he makes one more attempt to reach out to his father was so brave and as in real life most fathers can never get past their walls to reach out to their children i could even identify with giancarlo the brother who while being the more self assured and elder brother had so many insecurities a really beautiful film that made me laugh and cry
<START> there's a lot going on in the college girl murders a mad scientist creates an almost undetectable poisonous gas before he can reap the rewards of his discovery the scientist is killed by a hooded whip welding monk after a co ed is killed in a church by the gas scotland yard is called in to investigate but the killing continues who can stop this mad killer who seems to be able to come and go as he pleases in and out of the college br br what works br br the killer what's not to like about a killer who sneaks around wearing a vivid red kkk looking outfit complete with red gloves the white whip he carries and uses very effectively stands out nicely against the bright red gown although the idea of a killer in a flaming red pointy head outfit sneaking around a girl's school is fairly far fetched it's one of the more sinister looking costumes i've seen br br groovy 60s music i really would like to track down the title music to the college girl murders it's got a jazzy hip 60s feel to it that i just loved br br bizarre touches beyond the killer's red gown and hood the movie features a sliding fireplace a pit of alligators with a cage handing overhead poison spraying bibles a strategically placed mannequin mini skirts go go boots and mile high hair i would describe it as a cross between the 60s batman tv show and an italian giallo the college girl murders is a real treat for the eye br br the end let's just say that there are more twists than a mountain road just when you think the killer has been uncovered here comes a twistÂ and anotherÂ and anotherÂand another br br what doesn't work br br chief inspector sir john i know the guy was meant to be comic relief but his buffoonish character has way too much screen time br br why have alligators previously i mentioned the alligators in the pit and while they are a nice touch they serve very little purpose why go through all the trouble and not use them br br plodding plot some of the college girl murders has no flow or rhythm to it there are far too many moments throughout the movie when things come inexplicably to a screeching halt better pacing would have made this a much more enjoyable movie br br i haven't seen many of these german krimis but of the few i have seen phantom of soho strangler of blackmoor castle dead eyes of london this may be my favorite this one has a real funky feel to it that i really go into had the plot flowed a little better i could have easily given the college girl murders a 7 10
<START> this movie kind of reminds me of a mary kate and ashley movie only worse just the rich sisters kind of thing i think even though alysons more the actress in this movie amanda michalka was okay sometimes but alysons acting stunk i think that after high school musical they needed to come up with somethihng better and this definitely wasn't it the story line wasn't that great and i think they should have gotten two other people to play taylor and courtney i'm not a big alyson michalka fan and this movie didn't make me like her any better i think they should definitely sick to singing and only watch this movie if you have nothing better to do which sadly i didn't
<START> spirit is a unique and original look at western life from the point of view of a wild horse and native americans the film focuses on the friendships and perils that a wild horse spirit encounters during his life br br very well done in the presentation using the technology available today to deliver stunning visuals that are breathtaking in their depth and realism br br the music is fantastic with songs by bryan adams and music by hans zimmer who also was responsible for the extremely popular music from the 1994 disney hit the lion king br br the story is not very deep but the fact that it isn't quite as in depth as some movies doesn't in my opinion detract from the film as a whole br br an excellent film which i enjoyed immensely and that is suitable for all the family not one to be missed 10 10
<START> lost 24 carnivale desperate housewifes the list goes on and on these and a bunch of other high quality shows proves that we're in the middle of a golden age in television history lost is pure genius incredible layers of personal and psychologically viable stories underscored by sublime cinematography incredible to use this word when describing a tv show a killer score great performances and editing anyone who isn't hooked on this are missing one of the most important creative expressions in television ever it may have its problems when watching only one episode a week but the dvd format is actually an incredible way to watch this hope they keep it up as i'm sure they do
<START> well because i'm a musician i thought maybe i'll check this movie out on tmc nothing else good on one of the worst mistakes of my life so far and it's only half done i seriously thought it was one of those soft core movies with crappy plot and crappy acting crappy filming and crappy effects but nope i don't even get the pleasure of that even the musicians weren't very good i was hoping for maybe some laughs but i wasn't sure if they were attempting to throw in one liners or not but now i have to sit here and watch the rest just until pulp fiction starts or maybe something better and now i get to sit here typing until i have 10 lines
<START> a young basketball playing professor of genetics is doing research on the genetic sequence using human fetuses he hopes to be able to find a cure for all diseases and aging he's pressured into concluding his research because he hasn't published so the university is having trouble justifying funding him i think br br he does a trial injection on a monkey which quickly dies he then tries it on himself he starts a relationship with the single mother of an extremely annoying little boy she's the one who had been demanding results from the research br br initially he seems to have no effects from the injection except some new strength he then realizes that he had some memory loss and starts recalling what happened additionally he starts to appear very unhealthy br br since the movie is named metamorphosis he does eventually change into something else you won't believe your eyes either what he turned into or the absolutely crappy costume the actor is wearing to depict what he's turned into incredibly there's a further change in store the end of the movie is really really absurd br br about the only thing this movie has going for it is that laura gemser is in it but she has a very small part br br i'd once seen a the video box for this with a sculpted plastic form glued to the boxcover possibly it might even have had some electronics in it at one time perhaps eyes that light up the main character's eyes occasionally turn green in the movie the copy i watched had a box that only showed tear marks where the glue had held on the plastic which had been removed the novelty boxcover if it still had it would have been the only reason i would have held onto this movie i'm definitely getting rid of it
