<START> in light of bad reviews or car crashes i feel possessed to get in gear and make a transmission to give merit where due and do a service i'm not sure people have license to say it was so bad almost automatically br br it's rare for a movie to have suspense this movie maintained suspense it's whole length for me despite any flaws that may be how many films can say that not even many big ones because of the simple premise you don't know if the people will get out of the life threatening situation which lasts the whole movie yeh the suspension was tight and over some bumps the shocks did their work it's not just a tv movie but an all action movie there is no point where it stops or deviates or becomes talky it would be hard to make a film like this always on the road only duel or speed are this that i recall the best thing in them also was the constant tension br br acting is not bad the judge is as good as ever and the others are br br script is good but the jury is out as to whether it sometimes may be or seem to be a little awry what seems unrealistic is not necessarily so your first judgments are not always right but i think the lead actor's was right in being in this movie br br stunts are mostly terrific especially for a tv movie their only failing may be the noticeable and again apparent slow speed but we all know how deceivingly slow grand prix cars can look br br i liked that the beginning said inspired by a true story so you are not going to go how much is true you know just the basis is the usual based on a true story makes me think it should mostly be true but maybe that's my error br br how to save them good idea of the reviewer to suggest a tow truck to lift the back wheels up just a few inches would do a stunt driver could do that at 100 mph odd that they didn't call a car expert or auto electrician or mechanic to see if there's a way br br i hope this review has put in reverse that this film is a disaster or at least neutral and help it become a runaway success br br pic quality is a little soft for a dvd br br spoiler they would have been winched out after the baby was but strangely that life saving idea was cleverly dealt with in some joking conversation to fade it out i guess we know why end of movie suspension of disbelief went out the top window with the baby
<START> one could wish that an idea as good as the invisible man would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effects but this is not the case the story the characters and finally the entire last 20 minutes of the film are about as fresh as a mad scientist flick from the early 50's there are some great moments mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets but alas soon we're back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable but schematic br br there has been a great many remakes of old films or tv shows over the past 10 years and some of them have their charms but it's becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol' classics under the noses of eager madmen like verhoeven who does have his moments is a very bad one it is obvious that the money is the key issue here the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough and as a result hollow man is seriously undermined with clichÃ©s sappy characters predictability and lack of any depth whatsoever br br however the one thing that actually impressed me beside the special effects was the swearing when making this kind of film modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them therefore the language and sometimes the violence and sex is very toned down when the whole world blows up the good guys go oh darn and oh my god hollow man gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them i'm not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear but it makes it more believable if someone actually swears i think we can thank verhoeven for that
<START> esther kahn is a young jewish woman living in an overcrowded jewish ghetto in 19th century england she is surrounded by looming oppressive dreary featureless worn brick architecture narrow sidewalks and streets blacked out windows and hordes of black and brown jacketed crowds br br she lives in a tiny apartment with her large family whom operate a clothes shop within the apartment as child she worked had no privacy wore colourless clothing shared a bed and remained silent to avert the mockery of her mother and siblings who ridiculed her for mimicking them out of boredom br br as a young woman her life remains the same she has no privacy lives in a state of mental and physical hebetude and lethargy and inertia exudes a blank featureless expression is clothed in plain unremarkable clothing and is continuously oppressed and dwarfed by the grey mundane massively imposing buildings and narrow streets and narrow hallways and narrow doorways and her loud mouthed mother and siblings and the prosaic banal lifestyle of her family br br her only form of mental escape is the yiddish theatre sitting in the balcony front row leaning over the rail there is a vast space between her mind and the stage a space that enables her to breathe think feel and yearn br br yet despite the freedom of thought the open stage provides for esther her face and body remain torpidly somnolent impassive dispassionate br br the plain and common looking summer phoenix brilliantly conveys esther's emotionless demeanour summer esther does not convey any desire to want anything or anticipate anything br br after an unusual explosive confrontation with her mother esther finally decides to break free from the bleak life she is trapped in br br she is eventually cast in minor parts in a few stage plays and meets nathan quellen portrayed by quintessential british actor ian holm who commences to teach esther the technical skill of acting br br from this point forward esther begins a grueling dual journey of learning how to act and learning how to feel br br she begins experiencing emotions she never felt before and she begins gaining the experience she needs to fully comprehend and wield the technical aspects of acting br br nathan walks her across the stage through the physical and emotional steps of surprise hesitancy anger disgust self loathing etc she then begins walking through those emotions in her personal life br br there are three truths nathan tells her the truth of how a character reacts the truth of how the actor would react and the truth that a character and actor are not the same person br br these technical steps and three truths slowly deconstruct esther's defenses and lead her to two edifying experiences in the denouement of the film which mark the beginning of her freedom of thought movement and emotion br br esther kahn is a technically challenging film to watch because of its odd and narrow camera shots lackluster photo direction which conveys the realistic lackluster setting of the ghetto and summer phoenix's characterless and insipid and unappealing portrayal which brilliantly conveys kahn's mental and physical hebetude and lethargy and lackluster nature br br a must see film for people who want to learn the technical craft of acting and for people who appreciate minimalistic films and character studies
<START> kurt russell is so believable and the action so non stop that it takes thinking about it afterward to realize that there were honest to goodness important themes overcoming fear of the stranger learning to rise above early conditioning the strength that love and friendship can bring etc in the storyline this is so very rare for a 'guy's action flick' that even i who thinks most a a is violent pap liked the film and have recommended it to every guy i know it's a shame this one was overlooked because by rights it should have been one of the biggest action adventure box office hits it has something for everyone without straining credulity or losing the nearly non stop action moments i'm afraid the answer to it not becoming a hit lies in the fact that adults did not go to see it anyone under 20 probably has not only seen more violent action in their video games but probably would either not catch the multi layered multi themed beauty or not care about it this film could convert anyone who avoids a a as mindless violence if a guy takes his lady or rents it or sees it in a cable listing to see this film he'll be much more likely to get her to go with him to other action flicks
<START> based on robert louis stevenson's st ives the film tells the story of a dashing young french hussar captain jean marc barr during the napoleonic wars captured in battle he is sent to a prisoner of war camp in the scottish highlands run by major farquhar richard e grant in short order he falls in love with a local girl anna friel strikes up a friendship with the major and discovers that his long lost grandfather who fled from france during the revolution lives just up the road spirited performances from all the cast and some memorable lines make this an above average offering
<START> pearl s buck was a brilliant author that was a first american lady won nobel prize in literature in 1938 and received her prize with enrico fermi an italian physit br br she wrote this romance in 1931 which was a second one after her first novel east wind and west wind in 1930 and her beginning in literature was fantastic upon her premier novels br br she won in 1935 pulitzer prize in literature on her eternal novel the good earth which made a brilliant panorama on the life of chinese peasant wung lung and his wife o lane and their efforts to face the hardness of hard positions in their earth to reach for their big fortune by their shoulders br br paul muni succeeded in this role as chinese peasant that he prepared himself in this role upon his sittings with chinese people in san francisco in their town to be chinese exactly as a real and true br br shara reiner succeeded in her role as o lane by this brilliant evidence that she won an academy awarded as a best actress in 1937
<START> i saw this film yesterday i rented the dvd from blockbuster in fact i know one of the actresses from the film i won't say who that's kept under wraps but i must admit it wasn't as good as i thought it would be tom savini hats down to this guy but it's a shame he wasn't in the film for long what lacks the film is the idea the script sound etc it may look like a good movie but it wasn't that entertaining br br well i'm glad my sister paid Â£10 for renting 3 dvd's from blockbuster i chose this one and i was disappointed anyway thumbs down for me not my cup of tea 0 out of 10
<START> i am 13 and i hated this film its the worst film on earth i totally wasted my time watching it and was disappointed with it cause on the cover and on the back the film it looks pretty good but i was wrong its bad but when i saw delta she was totally different and a bad actress and i really didn't know how old the 2 girls was trying to be i was so confused the film was in some parts confusing and i didn't enjoy it at all but i watched all the film just to see if it was going to get better but it didn't it was boring dull and did i say boring and i don't think many other people liked it as well as me boring boring boring
<START> like 'first blood' this attempts to make a point about the treatment of vietnam vets but there really isn't much time for that in between the monotonous gunfire burnings stabbings torture and explosions as an impossibly indestructible rambo takes out half of asia a ton of vietnamese soldiers most of the russian army various vehicles and anything else he can point a rocket launcher at the only woman in the middle of all these boys toys is soon bumped off allowing the testosterone to reach dangerous levels and the script to degenerate into a succession of loud noises helpfully supplying a few hackneyed musical cues is jerry goldsmith who carefully checks off all the clichÃ©d themes from russian rat a tat to chinese ching chang chong just in case we don't quite understand who we're looking at stallone has a brain in his head this empty nonsense is beneath him
<START> i was literally preparing to hate this movie so believe me when i say this film is worth seeing overall the story and gags are contrived but the film has the charm and finesse to pull them off that gag where jason lee thinks he has crabs and tries not to let his boss future father in law and co workers see him scratching himself isn't terribly intelligent but it sent me into a frenzy of laughter very few of the film's gags are high brow but they made me laugh as i said the film has charm and charm can go a long way br br the characters are likable too i must say i wish i got to see more of james brolin's character since he was a hoot in the very few scenes he was in plus i admire any romantic comedy that has the guts to not make the character of the wife who serves as the obstacle in the plot a total witch the selma blair character is hardly unlikable and there's never a scene where i thought to myself why did he want to marry her in the first place the ending is hollywood ish but it could've been much more schmaltzy br br the cast is talented i haven't had a favorable view of most of jason lee's mainstream work i just loved him so much in kevin smith's films that i couldn't help but feel disappointed at seeing him in these dopey roles and he never looks comfortable in these dopey roles even in this movie he doesn't look perfectly comfortable but he contributes his own two cents and effectively handles each scene but i still miss his work in independent films julia stiles proves again why she's so damn likable of course she's a very beautiful girl with a radiant smile that makes me want to faint but she also possesses a unique charm and seems to have good personality in other words her beauty shows inside and out i don't know the actresses' name but the woman who plays the drunk granny is hilarious julie hagerty also has a small part and she's always enjoyable to watch which makes me wish she received better roles i loved her so much in airplane and lost in america that it's a shame she doesn't get the same opportunities to flaunt her skills br br don't be put off by the horrible trailers and even more horrible box office records this is a funny charming film romantic comedies are getting so predictable nowadays that it feels like the genre itself is ready to be flushed down the toilet so it's always to see a good one among all these bad apples br br my score 7 out of 10
<START> homeward bound is a beautiful film y'know the part where shadow falls down the ditch thingy i cried considering i was only six i cried it takes a lot to make me cry the dogs and the cat are excellently trained a nice family movie not for completely hardened non fluffy people or animal haters but could for soft as crap a k a people like me br br a good film overall 10 10
<START> personnaly i really loved this movie and it particularly moved me the two main actors are giving us such great performances that at the end it is really heart breaking to know what finally happened to their characters br br the alchemy between barbra streisand and kris kristofferson is marvelous and the song are just great the way they are br br that's why i didn't feel surprised when i learned it had won 5 golden globe awards the most rewarded movie at the golden globes an oscar and even a grammy this movie is a classic that deserves to be seen by anyone a great movie that has often been criticized maybe because streisand dared to get involved in it surely as a co director her artistry is the biggest and that will surely please you
<START> i just saw valentine and i have to say that it was the best slasher movie that i've seen in years unlike the recent trend of 90's horror flicks this movie is more concerned with being eerie than it is with being self mocking for those out there that hated scream there is not one reference to the horror rules in this movie even though the old slasher movie rules do apply here br br this is the perfect blend of 80's and 90's horror you get the style cinematography and good acting of 90's films and the stalking slasher madness of an 80's flick i guess the year 2001 is going to finally give horror fans the kind of movies they were longing for this is definitely a move in the right direction br br denise richards stands out here as a fun character you can tell she liked her role and that makes her stand out i loved her in this movie
<START> if there's one thing that annoys me most in seeing a bad film it's seeing it done by experienced film makers who ought to know better this re imagining of planet of the apes could have used some imagination to say nothing of essential elements of character development nova the girl in the original planet of the apes was a better developed character than daena in this version for all that she does not say a single word one certainly expected a lot better from tim burton a man who has hitherto combined an incredible visual imagination with intelligence wit and humour all of which were notably absent from this production br br there were problems in basic plot development the first big mistake was allowing the humans to talk this was the fundamental difference between apes and men that made all the difference in the original film even while he was mute his ability to communicate was what marked out heston's taylor as being different from the other humans in the current film mark wahlberg encourages the talking human slaves to revolt but there is no overpowering reason for them to have not revolted and reclaimed their emancipation already they are dexterous tool users and have the ability to communicate in order to form plans something mute humans can't do it needs no man to fall from the stars to save them indeed since he comes from a technological civilisation and finds himself in a pre technology era without at first any gadgets to help him it is wahlberg who ought to be at a disadvantage not the humans who are used to living there br br it was sad to see helena bonham carter working so hard to generate some kind of spark between herself and that unresponsive brick wall mark wahlberg her best scenes were with the villainous tim roth br br the humans were practically ignored until they were needed in the third act at which point daena started showing some actual interest in davidson wahlberg and a young boy suddenly changed from part of the background to a feisty gung ho freedom fighter this was poor character development estella warren in particular looked as if she would have been capable of a great deal more than she was given in the script wahlberg's puzzlement at the end as to what these humans see in him was certainly shared by me as he has scarcely interacted with the humans throughout br br creating the apes half a plus point and two minuses ape make up was excellent on the males particularly michael clarke duncan who has incredibly expressive eyes which was why he was so good in the green mile and the makeup design allowed him to use them fully but the ape females looked like nothing on earth neither ape nor human the minuses were the ape jumps which looked about as realistic as flash gordon's rocket jumping apes looked as if they'd just been fired from a catapult they had none of the long limbed grace of genuine apes secondly the poor sound mixing when the gorillas roar it is quite clearly dubbed from some animal probably feline making them sound ridiculous and unrealistic br br in the original film the various human things the apes do and say are handled as light relief i never knew an ape i didn't like human see human do here the apes just talk matter of factly exactly as 21st century humans do and there is no humour in it at all the only genuinely original idea was ari writing with her feet br br nothing made me cringe more than the v ger from star trek moment near the end of the film first of all the apes had apparently been able to read roman lettering in the distant past for them to know the name of the forbidden zone in its partly concealed form secondly the mysterious inscription giving the name is merely covered with sand which wahlberg just brushes away something any ape could have done centuries ago this moment was for me far worse than the much maligned ending of the movie br br things of that nature however are typical of most science fiction movies of today back in the '60s and '70s they generally didn't have the budget to make convincing futuristic sets but they dealt with genuinely original themes and ideas which were truly science fictional i'm thinking of 2001 a space odyssey the 1967 planet of the apes thx1138 soylent green silent running and the 1972 solaris the first planet of the apes even utilised the only scientifically valid and physically possible method of travelling forward in time however this film includes just about every bad science fiction clichÃ© going space storms anomalies and worm holes straight out of star trek the planets of the solar system and their moons apparently all visible together as large globes in reality from any one planet all other bodies even their own moons are just points of light a conventional rocket powered shuttle travelling from saturn to earth in a matter of minutes instead of years two thousand year old equipment firing up and fully working the minute the hero presses the button to say nothing of a conveniently bulletproof internal glass door in a contemporary setting you'd have to explain why it was bullet proof but because it's science fiction you don't have to br br overall burton's most disappointing film
<START> antitrust could have been a great vehicle for rachael leigh cook but the director cut out her best scenes in the scenes that she are in she is just a zombie she is involved in a sub plot that is simular to a sub plot in get carter but she handles the sub plot better in get carter i blame the director the director's homage to hitchcock was corny it's the scene were ryan philippe's charactor realizes he may not be able to trust tim robbin's charactor at least i think it's a homage to hitchcock the dvd shows the scenes that were cut out i think the director should have trust his instincts and not listen to the test audiences
<START> dave is going through a divorce and his mind wanders back to his first love wanders is probably not the word i should say he fixates on the past girlfriend he recalls to the day when the relationship ended the dream sequences only lack the hazy transitions he fondly recalls their favorite songs and places they went i'm not a counselor but maybe this had something to do with the failed marriage dave goes to a support group and meets up with a lady half his age also divorced who instead of being turned off by his creepiness starts to become interested in him did i mention how creepy dave is he sometimes refers to himself in the third person he doesn't move his arms when he walks either it's just weird too make a long story short dave plots to hunt down mary the old gal friend and kill her err i mean confront her he does so which was really creepy he believes her to be married yet he still flies half way across the country to meet her he stakes out her house to make sure she is alone before he drops in on her he has an awkward conversation with her that ends with his sharing the gospel of christ in about 10 words or less and flies back to the new young girlfriend we enjoyed the movie mostly for unintentional comedic value i am still entertaining the wife with my dave impressions i heard another dave mary song
<START> there's so many things to fall for in aro tolbukhin en la mente del asesino inside the killer's mind that it's very hard to talk about it without giving any kind of warning let's just say that this movie is like an exercise in cinema but really really great done itÂ´s made with super 8 black and white shots 35 milimeters color interviews flashbacks aro tolbukhin itÂ´s like a movie made a documental or viceversa which most peculiar aspect relays on the doubt that leaves you wondering did he really ever existed the movie follows the later life of an hungarian sailor that arrived in guatemala worked in a religious mission and then killed some people an act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced the movie starts because some french documentalists got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death nowadays some more people got involved and make a deeper research of the character the one we are witness of the movie br br for the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside aroÂ´s mind mainly in order to decode why he did what he has done nevertheless the important thing is that the filmmakers never gives us a sided point of view they left the judging for all of us and even as we may understand his actions we clearly never justify them so the first half is based upon recollecting information later things turn into aro's childhood giving the movie such an incredible new force even tough never got weak or boring br br i don't mean and don't want to spoil anything so the only thing left to say is that if by any chance you get this movie near you believe me the trip to see it is more than worthy
<START> i put this movie on in the hotel room to entertain my children the morning we were leaving to go home because i had packed away all their toys toddlers don't like to watch regis and kathie lee or the view my four year old found one scene funny but told me the rest of it was too silly this is a four year old folks anyone over the age of say nine will want to kill their television rather than let this one play itself out br br to say this movie is bad is like saying the holocaust was a little mistake there are no words for how ridiculous and utterly terrible this film truly is the acting is bad the plot is stupid and the script is pathetically unfunny since this is supposed to be a comedy the fact that you cannot even laugh at the badness of the movie makes it even worse bronson balki pinchot is the worst with some weird fake accent irish pakistani bronx cockney cajun as far as i could tell but all the characters are awful i haven't watched a real laurel and hardy film in ages but i know that they had to be way better than this what is the point of ruining a classic comic duo with this br br bottom line derivative garbage avoid at all costs unless you have some freaky bronson pinchot fetish 2 10
<START> as a physics student i've become aware of many idiot professors and other so called experts in the field as i continue with my studies i learn more and more about real physics experiments going on and about the people who are doing things right br br then my friends tell me of this physics movie they want to see knowing nothing of it i'm excited hoping that the information will be presented well br br i've done real quantum mechanics this wasn't it br br this movie starts with the basic assumption that anything that occurs to a subatomic particle can and will occur to you if you just open your eyes let's think about that for just a moment br br our bodies are composed of somewhere around 10 30 such subatomic particles that is a million billion billion billion particles the more mysterious quantum effects of just two particles can have a 50 probability of cancelling each other out completely as you add more and more particles into the mix it becomes almost impossible to have a large net quantum result to tell us to believe that this is a valid assumption with no rationality behind it it's just stupid br br my friend also in physics and i counted 3 facts during the course of this movie but they were presented in the most misleading manner i've ever seen br br i cannot say as much for the neural portion of the movie as i have not had any kind of medical training it seemed as though it might have had a slight bit more truth to it remembering my days in biology but i cannot say br br at least this film had a redeeming quality the dancing peptides or whatever they actually were scene not to ruin the invaluable plot that drives this movie but the main character goes to a wedding where she sees all different types of personalities driven by their peptides and then the film cuts to the dance floor where we are spliced between people dancing sometimes surrounded by cg peptides and a fully cg scene filled with dancing peptides the film at that point was trying to tell us how we're addicted to emotions so we're treated to the full song of that smash hit addicted to love br br this scene was redeeming because anyone who could go through that scene and still take this movie seriously well you are the ones that need to open your eyes
<START> i first saw this movie on some movie channel hbo some time ago i was a fan of public enemy nwa and other early rap and had seen cb4 in theaters anyway the promo for it caught my eye and i wanted to see what it was all about well right off the bat i knew it was going to be good warning and i was right the parody songs alone make this movie worth watching over and over my peanuts but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was great you've got to love the satire of rap groups obviously nwa certain rappers eazy e flava flav ice cube and the humor of the three members of nwh who can forget tone deaf scratching with his ass it's too bad this movie didn't get the credit it deserved as it was overshadowed by cb4 during their releases but in my opinion is a much better film if you know and like 90's 'gangster' rap you'll be watching and laughing with this movie for a long time if you aren't into or don't like 'rap' you'll enjoy the jokes at the expense of the genre
