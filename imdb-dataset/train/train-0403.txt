<START> ivan reitman is something of a savior the most tired plots ghostbusters evolution come to life in his skilled hands even his occasional flop six days seven nights show signs of life and humor that make it worth viewing so i was disappointed that reitman could not take a fairly original plot man dumps superhero superhero gets superpower fueled revenge and shape it into something enjoyable girlfriend is an exercise in pointlessness the one trick pony plot is long in the tooth after the first 20 minutes the film can't decide whether to be romantic comedy or superhero drama the result is a film the flip flops between both with neither aspect being very well done uma thurman is tops as usual and luke wilson pulls off his role too though his slacker antics quickly grow tired what's even more maddening is that in certain scenes such as when a very turned on uma knocks a headboard through a wall you sense a witty raucous reitman opus practically screaming to get out but seconds later the magic is lost gone as quick as the superheroine whose movies disappoints in almost every way
<START> this one is quite a nice surprise cute little story of the heroine's quest very surprising metamorphosis of the four eye prissy soon to be spinster type into a raunchy dd cup sex queen br br visually a sight for sore eyes not only for two quite stunning actresses but also for most of the costumes and make up of the actors an unnecessary bit of cheapness came in some ridiculous castle imitation br br back to the positives the movie is spiced with some unusually explicit camera shots which you would not expect in a soft core loved that scene with the icicles absolute classics potential a slight minus only for very few odd scenes where bad acting by minor casts shortly suspended the suspension of disbelief br br 9 10 including an extra credit for the serious drooling effect
<START> this film is a jolt of punk rock fun from start to finish the ramones reigning princes of late 70s punk rock appear as themselves pj soles stars as riff randle the rebellious high school girl who lives and breathes rock 'n roll riff is obsessed with writing songs for the ramones her favorite rock band she keeps the school rockin' and encourages her fellow students to join her in her jubilant antics br br meanwhile the school that riff attends has just hired a brand new principal named ms togar she's a tall intimidating amazon of a woman and she vows to make the students 'toe the line' she even has a couple of the students act as monitors who report back to her with dirt on their classmates ms togar is especially determined to nab riff and put a stop to riff's anarchic shenanigans but riff has clever ways to foil togar at every turn br br kudos to the superb performance of mary woronov in her role as principal togar mary is a legendary b movie actress and in this film she plays the fascist ms togar with sneering relish pj soles as riff turns in an electrifying performance clint howard as the duplicitous eaglebauer has lots of fun with his role br br the ramones perform many of their hit songs in this film and so the viewer sees why the ramones were so influential in the 70s punk rock scene certainly this is a good film for ramones fans but even if you're not into the ramones or punk rock this movie is a terrific blast literally of energetic fun
<START> utterly brilliant powerful and evocative the most compelling documentary series ever made concerning war it's tone offers a stark contrast to the often gung ho attitude towards world war 2 that the media exhibits rather than opting for screaming about the horror of war it allows sir laurence olivier's quiet voice to take a back seat to the true images of war corpses everywhere explosions terrified citizens and soldiers broken men indifferent politicians mistakes that cost thousands of lives the suffering of the innocents most of all it truly brings home that mankind is capable of when all normal rules of civility are removed there is something distinctly hobbesian about man in a true state of nature he will return to a more beastly form capable of crimes that will still shock and fascinate 60 years on perhaps there could be a follow up series called the century at war for the twentieth century was truly the century of horrors i feel it is an irony of immense magnitude that it took an event which caused the death of 50 million people to produce such a compelling and excellent series such as this
<START> i wish spike lee had chosen a different title for his film summer of sam conveys the impression that the film is about the infamous serial killer david berkowitz it's not it's a gritty earthy portrait of nyc street life during the hot summer of '77 when berkowitz terrorized that city br br the film follows several young fictional characters in an italian american neighborhood and their reactions to the son of sam threat there's vinny and his wife dionna there's richie and ruby and several other characters br br the problem is that these characters are not likable they are routinely annoying and at times unbearable lee then belabors their high energy chaotic lives which are filled with anger lust and general turmoil there are at least two protracted fight scenes between vinny and his wife redundant disco dance scenes countless gabfests over and over i kept wondering where's the film editor br br meanwhile with all that bulk the film passes up the chance to convey any real sense of fear or dread arising from the son of sam menace which is too much in the background lee is more successful at showing a different kind of menace that arising from neighborhood vigilante groups br br the acting is uniformly good that combined with 70's disco music and lavish attention to costumes and production design make you really feel like you are in an italian american neighborhood in nyc in 1977 br br the film's atmospheric authenticity however is not nearly enough to offset a rambling overblown script about the lives of grossly irritating people
<START> to sum this documentary up in a few words is next to impossible every fiber of your body tells you that this is not happening right from the opening montage of rapid fire images through to the last shot of the clean up at ground zero but every frame is real the story was thought up by two french brothers living in new york jules 28 and gideon 31 naudet pronounced nau day want to make a documentary on new york city firefighters beginning with a newbie from the academy and follow him through the nine month probationary period to full fledged firefighter seeking the help of their close friend actor james hanlon 36 an actor and firefighter at station 1 engine 7 the naudets sift through the probies at the academy and find one tony benetakos to focus the bulk of their documentary on br br tony becomes the butt of jokes and slowly learns the ins and outs of station life through the members of this close knit family firefighters have a superstition about probies it is that they are either white clouds or black clouds meaning that with the latter all kinds of fires follow the probie the former means that very little fire activity follows but one day there will be the mother of all fires tony is a white cloud after some initial growing pains tony settles into the firehouse as if he were a seasoned vet then the unthinkable occurs br br september 11 2001 begins with a clear blue sky and an early morning call to go and see about a supposed gas leak not far from wall street because jules has had little camera experience gideon hands a camera to his younger brother and tells him to ride with the chief t k pfeiffer arriving at about 8 42 the firefighters begin to use their gas detectors over a grate then the sudden roar of what seems to be a low flying airplane rips past the scene and as jules pans upwards we see the first strike of the day american airlines flight 11 smashes into the face of the north tower of 1 world trade pfeiffer orders his men into the fire engine and they head for the world trade center once there jules asks to accompany the chief into the tower pfeiffer tells naudet to stick close to him once inside the full impact of the growing disaster begins to show on the faces of the men whose sole purpose is to save lives br br gideon naudet decides to leave the firehouse and walk down to the impact area once there he captures the impact of the second plane united airlines flight 175 with 2 world trade he knows jules is with chief pfeiffer inside the towers watching and capturing the crowds' reaction to the unimaginable gideon begins to capture on tape the growing fear in lower manhattan inside tower one jules records the last view the world or loved ones will have of their sons fathers uncles grandfathers husbands boyfriends friends as one by one each firefighter carrying 60 lbs of equipment begin the long arduous climb up 80 stories to rescue the injured and trapped jules also catches the last glimpse chief pfeiffer will have of his brother kevin as he leaves to do his selfless duty also caught on video is the gutwrenching sound of falling bodies hitting pavement from victims choosing to jump from the higher floors above the impact zones sooner than face death at the hands of the flames and smoke but jules is respectful never once does he capture a sensationalistic moment the money shot his work is professional through his baptism of fire he also catches the sight of debris falling from tower two after it is hit by the second plane and the ordered way the firefighters evacuated civilians from the building then jules is caught in the collapse of the south tower and the first official victim is taken father michael judd the chaplain for the fire department then as jules and chief pfeiffer make their way from the fallout of the collapse of tower two tower one begins its structural collapse br br what results is a breathtakingly poignant view from inside ground zero as jules and gideon work separately to document that day not knowing if either is alive each fearing the worst as each firefighter arrives at the firehouse they greet each other with joyous hugs at having made it back and in one moment of overwhelming emotion jules and gideon are reunited as jules cries on his brother's shoulder gideon embraces his younger brother as hanlon makes the filmmakers the subject there is one fearful moment when tony benetakos who left the station with a former chief is believed to have been lost but returns to the fold this probie has proven himself br br shown with only three interruptions 9 11 is a stunning achievement in documentary filmmaking it ranks up there with the hindenburg footage in showing history as it unfolds the naudets are to be commended for their deft handling of the subject in lesser hands the tendency would be toward the sensational but the naudets temper their eye toward dignity and compassion narrated by hanlon we get the feel of his words as he takes the audience through the events of september 11 robert de niro hosts the program in a sombre restrained way he never seeks the camera for his own glory rather he lays out the scenes you are about to see i also commend cbs for their bravery at airing this special chastised for their attempt at grabbing ratings they temper their editing toward the emotions of the relatives of those who perished this is a must see for anyone who needs to be reminded of what true heroism is it isn't about dribbling a basketball or selling an album of hate lyrics 9 11 is about humanity at its best heroism at its finest and the cost of freedom br br
<START> this is probably my favorite movie of all time it is perfection in its storytelling it will break your heart not because it's over sentimental but because you will truly feel every emotion these characters go through you feel for doggie because of the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in china at that time
<START> some things need to be clarified the picture of mark ferris is not the mark ferris who starred in this movie i know that because he was my dad please remove that picture also mark ferris was the writer at least one of them i have been trying to find a copy or a way to see this movie again it has been years and if someone can point me in the direction of obtaining a copy that would be great the movie wasn't all that bad and trying to compare it to todays world of star wars and other high tech sci fi's it futile if you watch it just enjoy it for the rediculousness and humor it possesses lighten up on being movie snobs and enjoy some less creative and innovated films
<START> the fully rounded character of the principal role of this movie that of the cop torn up by his past and on a path of self destruction so clear to the viewer is unique for its time 1950 br br along with the haunting music and the well written plot the film is a prime example of film noir at its best close ups of dana's eyes reveal the anguish within karl malden excels as his boss who brooks no nonsense but also has compassion for those under his command in the precinct br br otto preminger made this type of movie just about his own if there is any fault it would be with the breath taking beauty of gene tierney who seems oddly out of place with the hardened cop their scenes in the cafe however are wonderful and ring true br br tom tully in the bit part of her father is perfect as is gary merrill as the hood great lighting and mood setting the building where the deadly deeds take place highly atmospheric i love the old woman in the basement br br 8 out of 10
<START> this movie had the potential to be far more than it was but it not only fails to deliver it brings up nauseous self righteous preaching at the same time br br john cusack is even flatter than he was in midnight of the garden of good and evil the difference is that this time he is supposed to have an southern accent which he noticeably loses several times each scene br br al pacino does his shtick but seems to be walking through this film and collecting a paycheck he's good as usual but hardly standout br br supporting cast throw in female romantic interest which added little if anything to the story speaking of the story a convoluted who really cares tale where cusack is the self righteous mayor's boy who just has to search for the right thing to be done br br people don't act this way cusack's character loses all credibility at the end of which without revealing it is preach and nauseous the final scene makes the penultimate silliness seem profound it's also completely inaccurate but i won't get into law br br this is a bad by the numbers movie it seems interesting for the first 40 minutes and then it's really a preachy proselytizing self righteous film for the last hour better off with mindless crap than this pile of junk
<START> the odd couple 3 outta 5 stars br br like most people i will always feel that jack klugman and tony randall are the definitive odd couple their incredible work on the tv series from the early to mid 70s was a highwater mark for television at the time easily surpassing the stage and screen versions of the tale nonetheless how can you go wrong with a jack lemmon walter matthau pairing matthau is in especially good form as oscar the slob lemmon takes a bit of getting used to as felix particularly if you have previously seen tony randall's outstanding performance the script is good definitely neil simon's best i will go on record here as stating that neil simon is probably one of the worst most over rated playwrights of american theatre the storyline is simple felix a neat freak and newly separated from his wife moves in with oscar the slob who needs some help saving money for alimony payments their living arrangement becomes much like a marriage as well culminating in some amusing tiffs and spats lots of fun and some great one liners
<START> i think i agree that a lot of the comments here must be fake even if the movie is not necessarily bad its definitely below average dark remains is basically a ghost movie with a premise of your own ghosts and bad emotions haunting you the movie starts off already with 2 stories loosely inter webbed which even later are not tied together a couple loses its child which is found slashed in its bed they move to a country house to flee their past and guess what the house is haunted kind of from here on dark remains starts off very slow with some scary moments indeed the first ghost appearances are nice and the flashlight sequence also worked very good ok then woman sees ghost of daughter other ghosts of people died in accidents or suicides appear man tries to solve secret of houses past woman gets depressed strange neighbors appear its pretty much all been there but the premise of it being their own emotions is nice so you wait for the twist there is no twist you are just confused by a haunted house history story the strange neighbor a totally pointless creepy prison and the dead daughter thrown together with a photo idea reminding me a lot of the shutter the end is ridiculous because when you start and end a movie this slow and with piano music its pretty lame to include some hoards of ghosts at once which look like a zombie flick of course just to return to slow pacing and piano music br br to make it short dark remains could have been a nice scary ghost story if the script was not trying to go everywhere and arriving nowhere too many stories mushed together which just don't make any sense and contradict in the basic atmosphere of the movie and beside please never use abandoned prisons again its so worn off and in this case it even makes no sense at all hey there is this creepy prison uphill lets shoot there i guess a lot of ingredients in dark remains were thrown in the mix like this
<START> this is one of the first films i can remember or maybe the first one exactly the beautiful kind of film than introduce a kid sweetly into the world of violence and addictions were we live a little bit of babe casino and constantine all this well mixed into a carton and we get this i don't know if its truly rated for kids but i think it was very cool very funny and interesting i hate when a film spescially a carton can have a good end and its ruining because every character must have a happy end even if it sounds weird im not a bitter person but this was ok he simply goes heaven and they let it in that way br br all this is just a critic its a good movie an something new very touching and i gotta go
<START> i love and admire the farrelly brothers how come i only got to see this great movie 3 years after it's release it made me laugh it made me cry and it reeeaally warmed my heart big time it's hard to describe in my rotten english but i have to try anyway br br the cast is excellent throughout from the lead to the supporting roles the acting is great the dialogs are great and the film is perfectly directed and edited br br i think that the farrelly brothers movies are often underestimated they are not light comedies they're deeeeeep they talk about what life is all about i won't tell you br br in my case this movie affirmed to me what relationships are all about br br if you love somebody set them free let them be try to share the passion and the pain and always be true to each other br br i'm not a sports hater but definitely a sports ignorant but in this movie the vibes get you i could smell the atmosphere of baseball finally this movie explained to me what being a sports fan can mean to you and what cool fan families there must be out there br br thanks so much pete bob br br p s if you haven't seen it please check out kingpin
<START> version universal hong kong legends r4 dvd release cantonese english subtitles br br once upon a time five years ago the world was obsessed with 'the matrix' and i was perhaps one of the few fifteen year olds left who still believed that 'terminator' was better than 'matrix' i was but a simple teenage boy looking for a good action movie and then there was a shining light on a tv station i had never really watched a little station known as sbs one night i noticed in the tv guide that a movie starring jackie chan 'police story' would be on later being fifteen and having only seen 'rumble in the bronx' and 'rush hour' i said wow awesome and sat down to watch it and continually shouted wow awesome as the movie progressed two weeks later after sbs had shown the 'police story' trilogy i knew i had found my new favourite actor br br jackie plays chan ka kui a hong kong cop who busts a major drug lord chu yuen chor chu's secretary selina fong brigitte lin is being held by the police as a witness against chu and chan is assigned to protect her things go bad reaaaal bad when chu's case is dismissed and he decides he wants fong and chan dead br br 'police story' is one of the greatest action movies ever and certainly one of my favourite jackie chan films it starts off strong and ends with one of the most incredible action sequences ever filmed everything in between is great however some of the funny parts may seem a little tasteless to more than a few people br br as a story this is still one of jackie's better efforts for an action movie the story is pretty good and jackie is a much better actor in this than he is in the acting plot intensive 'new police story' this isn't 'miracles' but maybe that's a good thing br br 'police story' is one of jackie's finest works it got me hooked on jackie chan movies and should provide a nice start for any potential jackie fans the bad news for anyone who sees this first is that jackie chan movies don't come much better 10 10
<START> steve mcqueen has certainly a lot of loyal fans out there he certainly was a charismatic fellow one of the most charismatic the big screen ever knew but even mcqueen can't save this turkey of a film shot with what looks like a brownie camera in the actual locations in st louis br br mcqueen's a new kid with no criminal record brought into the planning of a bank heist by one of the other gang there's more than a broad hint that there's a gay relationship going on between young steve and david clarke he's not liked at all by the other heist members mainly because of his lack of criminal resume br br steve also has a girl friend in molly mccarthy and she suspects something afoot especially when he starts hanging around with crahan denton and james dukas as well as clarke all pretty rough characters that would certainly get my suspicions aroused br br the great st louis bank robbery had two directors charles guggenheim and john stix guggenheim did mostly documentaries and stix didn't do much of anything one of those two jokers decided steve's performance was best served by doing a bad marlon brando imitation br br this film may go down as the worst ever done by steve mcqueen i'm willing to bet that dick powell and four star productions had already signed him for wanted dead or alive because i can't believe they would have if they saw this br br or they would have seen something the public would have overlooked except for the dressing for this turkey
<START> this is a terrible remake of a marginal but well liked movie from the early 70's i have seen the original at least 6 times the 1997 version is a 20 minute movie 'crammed' into 2 hours or whatever the runtime is cheesy storyline which by the way is completely different than the original the major government involvement was far fetched there is no flow from one scene to the next in the original you could go get a beer or hit the bathroom and still keep up br br it only took a few hours movie time to change the oil pan on the car it takes many times longer than that in real life car guys notice this stuff also the fool or fools that chose to trash a 1968 charger and abuse a 1970 challenger should be shot in the heel with a dull bullet the fact they aren't 'car people' is painfully obvious and their passing will not be grieved br br the actors lacked any emotion everything was cut and dried one step above a monotone a barmitzvah is more exciting and energetic br br last but surely not least the radio dj made the statement that the challenger hit the bulldozers at 180 or 185 that is total garbage can you say aerodynamics or lack thereof hahahaha this movie is a joke don't waste your time watching this one
<START> the only thing great about the movie is its title in this case snake on a plane is example of not judging the book by its cover the title says nothing about the movie when i went to the theater i wasn't expecting citizen kane i was expecting independence day a movie that's pure popcorn fun but instead i got that horrible roy liotta movie called turbulence yes this is how bad soap is the only thing make soap better is its title and it's not even the apporiate title for the movie the wasn't even a glimpse of snake or plane 40 minutes into the movie what a false advertising if it wasn't for its title soap would be just another unforgettable cheap b grade summer movie and the r rating it has to be the most undeserved r rated movie of all time the makers of the movie only add a few f word to make this a r all of the violence are kept pg 13 level you know what's really r rated the r rated superstar edge see him at summerslam instead of waste your money on a snake
<START> this movie is absolutely pointless one of the good esamples how malcom mcdowall never got one decent role after clockwork orange this one may be one of the worst though no story crappy special effects shot in 4 3 or even worse cropped on dvd just avoid it
<START> being a fan of silent films i looked forward to seeing this picture for the first time i was pretty disappointed br br as has been mentioned the film seems to be one long long commercial for the maxwell automobile br br perhaps if the chase scene was about half the length that it is i may have enjoyed the film more but it got old very fast and while i recognize that reality is stretched many times in films without lessening a viewer's enjoyment what was with the mexican bandits i mean they are chasing a car through the mountains a car that most of the time is moving at about one mile per hour yet they can't catch up to it
