<START> this starts off bad what with the three women acting like simpering junior high school wussies sitting around giggling with their gin endless cigarettes and a caramel chocolate treat for the one who tells the best 'man' story and then it gets worse spoiler alert what with andie's character falling for the young organ player who used to be her student when he was 14 she's the headmistress of an english school believe it or not only to have him destroyed thanks to her bitch from hell 'girlfriend' and then from there it's basically unwatchable claptrap she forgives her 'friend' and has the organ player's love child and the 3 women end up as they started drinking more gin and smoking more cigarettes blah blah blah andie's character throws the caramel chocolates out in the street in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth have mercy
<START> personally i enjoyed cut thouroughly it was the first time i've seen a theatrically release australian slasher flick a genre normally restricted to the mainstream hollywood films br br with all the usual cooky comedies and dramas coming out of australia i loved being able to see a homegrown horror movie that wasn't a rip off of anything i didn't even think it was really a spoof of other movies it was a supernaturally theme horror like nightmare on elm street not scream or i know what you did last summer and therefore there was more of a suspension of disbelief i think it's about time australian films tried to get more into the mainstream genres br br cut was original scary enough and ultimately just a bit of fun i'd give it seven out of ten and wouldn't treat it as anything serious it did what i expected it to do entertain and scare me enough times to be satisfying i enjoyed it
<START> this movie is hilarious the problem is that it's not a comedy one classic scene involves kurt thomas just happening to find a pommel horse in the middle of a village square which he uses to pummel the bad guys another is the trek into the village of crazies too bad this movie wasn't made to be a farce or it may have gotten better ratings
<START> i went to see evening because of the cast i'd gone to see norman's room for that reason that movie offering diane keaton leonardo de caprio and also meryl streep and had loved every minute of it same for the notebook even though it was chick flit lite and my feeling was anything offering performances by vanessa redgrave meryl streep patrick wilson and glenn close would be at least as good instead i found sometimes even the greatest actors cannot overcome trite simplistic and on one occasion truly offensive material br br now i had no problem with the way the film was structured i actually enjoy movies that cut back and forth in time to tell a story so long as one era illuminates the other and vise verse but while vanessa's character being on her deathbed and recalling a past event she felt was a mistake was riveting at times the part actually showing what that past mistake was does nothing to clarify the matter in fact it makes it seem meaningless in the silliest girl meets boy girl gets boy girl loses boy fashion and in the most unbelievable clichÃ©d wrong headed way possible br br and from here be spoilers so bear that in mind should you continue reading br br first of all claire danes was brutally miscast not only does she not even begin to resemble vanessa redgrave as a young woman she has nowhere near the chops when it comes to acting don't get me wrong she can be good in the right role just not this one and patrick wilson was miscast though he has the acting chops to almost pull it off he'd have been better suited to the part hugh dancy played the rich confused wasp and not the object of sexual attraction to one and all he's a bit too wasp y for that hugh dancy one note i'm a tortured drunk and wait till you find out why and the why i'm a closet case in a sexually repressed world so i have to drink to excess and make a fool of myself in front of everyone i know was so offensive to me and the manner in which he died as you knew he would because that's the only thing that can happen to a faggot in the fifties so ludicrous wrong headed and mishandled i nearly threw my candy at the screen br br as for the modern part between toni collette and her sister her fear of commitment her jealousy of her sister's perfect life her sister wondering if she's made the right choices her pregnancy and her too perfect boyfriend which actually might have been more interesting and meaningful if played by patrick wilson and ebon moss bachrach might have been a more interesting harris given his dreamy eyes anyway all this was hashed over in the 70's and 80's and in much greater depth do we really have to present it again and all as if it was fresh and momentous br br and to top it off meryl streep doesn't even appear until the last ten minutes of the movie all in old lady makeup that hides many of her facial expressions she's still good but only because she's meryl and meryl can find a way to pull off even the silliest dialog under the heaviest of makeup br br so to put it simply this movie has every clichÃ© in the really meaningful message movie book and it adds a few that really had no business being trotted out again at two hours long and laced with lifetime movie of the week music that is guaranteed to rub you raw it's a complete failure in both the meaningful and moviemaking aspects i give it 3 only because of meryl and vanessa br br now if all you require from your films is twadd le then please set my comments about evening aside and have the time of your life but if you want a truly meaningful experience being served up by great actors and filmmakers who know what to do with a simple story about life and death and all the nonsense it brings rent norman's room and find out what truly great acting is
<START> ok i am blessed i have seen two very strong stage productions the one in new york with the original cast and another at the san diego rep rosina reynolds and monique gaffney you rock compared to either of these the movie is almost unwatchable i've been plodding through the dvd for the past two evenings and am still not finished way too much extraneous dialog and waaay too many added scenes and people yes the four major performances are quite good esp ms streep's but comparing stage to film is definitely an example of less is more the thickening of the play to satisfy film goers' need for scenic variety and specificity was a poor choice please please please go find a stage production somewhere near you
<START> this film is justly famous as one of the most horrible examples of propaganda ever produced the insistent equation of jews with disease is simply br br pathological and even worse it almost becomes believable for brief seconds br br through its sheer repetition the fact that something this crude works even br br briefly is an object lesson in itself you have to have a strong stomach and a firm grip on yourself to sit through this and i wouldn't recommend trying unless you have a good reason
<START> tv movie about an ancient egyptian curse brought to the us in the 20's during the filming of demille's first version of the 10 commandments and which is reawakened when demille's sets are unearthed in the desert br br one of the worst films i've seen in a long time br br the question is were the filmmakers serious or kidding when they made this film if this is serious its a laughably bad movie and a great film to pick on for its badness if its a comedy its less good but funny for all of the wrong reasons you will laugh long and hard at this film probably more than many other hollywood comedies
<START> this is just a butchering of a wonderful story by edwin torres this movie doesn't follow the storyline in the book and there are so many inconsistencies with the original movie that you have to wonder if the screenwriter had even seen the first movie br br al pacino the original and still the best carlito gets out of prison at the start of the original one here carlito retires with his woman in paradise br br what happened to gail from lorain ohio in this installment she isn't mentioned and carlito retires with and presumably will marry some other girl br br also where is kleinfeld i think he was in the first book br br i also like how mr guzman plays a totally different character in this film he was pachanga back in the pacino days now he is nacho reyes a killer from cuba i remember that nacho reyes had a much bigger role in the book br br it's been a while since i read the book but where did sean comb's character come from also i think this movie really glosses over the racial tensions in harlem that torres was writing about and the mob doesn't get the treatment that they did in the book they are also wiped out in this movie but magically the pleasant avenue bunch is around for the second movie br br the book told a great story this movie could have told a great story this is just a huge disappointment read the book it's a better use of your time
<START> there is nothing cool hip or clever about this film liking it just reveals an ignorance of true art cinema how can you so easily forget that the central fact of this entire film is that these mean ugly people are serial killers if they have to dismember total strangers in order to be a family again then we don't want them to be a family what part of that did you have trouble grasping why applaud this filth br br this silly filth is what you do if you can't do art one's head life must be deeply empty to mistake this shallow viciousness as interesting this is a camera without a brain what really makes an artwork cool is profundity questioning the status quo from a perspective informed by a knowledge of history or in this case a knowledge of anything would be preferable instead this is just randomly piling up the ugliest images available in a world in meltdown thanks to just the sort of empty meanness glorified as cool cause it's so far out man these same violent events actually happen every day they are not just in the film they refer to actual soul less people who would do those same things to you do you want those things done to you a child could have thought this up it required zero imagination it is not surrealism this lazy crap has no content is saying nothing it's just the worst of the evening news it is saying nothing new nothing we don't already know it's the emperor's new clothes the director hoping there are enough uneducated children proud of their streak of inhumanity for this sloppy filth to fly i can see director miike's demented fans now chain smoking teens and twenties drunks covered in tattoos with metal hanging from holes punched in their faces their knowledge base inversely proportional to their intelligence estimate of themselves br br there is no plot to this it is just sheer exploitation of shock value violence there is no hidden meaning anywhere in this poorly made film it is fine to explore a film to see if you can find cinematic devices that are ingeniously artistic but you cannot uncover a hidden meaning if one is not there to do that you need to view review a real piece of cinema there are plenty out there directed by fellini bergman fassbinder herzog altman bunuel kurosawa lynch tarkovsky peter greenaway tarantino guillermo del toro richard linklater eisenstein aronofsky gus van sant soderbergh shyamalan ordet why don't you view a real art film by the likes of these giants this wannabe director miike will never make a film equal to one of the geniuses i just listed because he just doesn't have the talent anyone could slap together some chaotic crap like visitor q teenagers could throw that together in one afternoon there's no message no meaning no plot nothing to it at all there are long lists of art films to learn from but this visitor q is not an art film in any respect it has no content to it it's just one banal horror piled onto another and the point to remember about those hideous crimes is that those things happen every single day somewhere in the world they are not okay because they are just in the film they refer to actual soul less people who would do those same things to you do you want those things done to you to others why because this world is already ugly enough thanks to people who enjoy thinking about horrific events like this br br there are sooooo many art films out there to use your mind to deconstruct but you are wasting your talents with this piece of crap there is no deeper meaning there is nothing to analyze why keep trying i've spent nearly 40 years watching practically every film ever made and keeping up with all the new ones but i've never seen anything as disgustingly pointless as this it's not imaginative or even shocking because these types of events happen daily all over the world to make this film or even to favorably review it has caused over 50 young airheads who don't know any better to think it's cool they may grow up thinking that convincing others some of whom may end up doing these things convicted killers often reveal how they started out just this way by being desensitized to the horror of this gruesome inhumanity trust me on this i know cool and cool this piece of crap ain't visitor q has the feel of a genuine snuff film and i'm still not sure it isn't actually br br your actions have consequences son the world is awful enough already some violence like this could happen to you or to the socially irresponsible director who cranked out this fake art film believe me you won't be thinking it's cool when someone is sawing your skull in half
<START> i absolutely loved this movie it met all expectations and went beyond that i loved the humor and the way the movie wasn't just randomly silly it also had a message jim carrey makes me happy
<START> this is a cgi animated film based upon a french 2d animated series the series ran briefly on cartoon network but its run was so brief that its inclusion as one of the potential oscar nominees for best animated film for this year left most people i know going huh this is the story of lian chu the kind heart muscle and gwizdo the brains of the operation who along with hector their fire farting dragon he's more like a dog travel the world offering up their services as dragon hunters but never getting paid into their lives comes zoe the fairy tale loving niece of a king who is going blind it seems the world is being devoured by a huge monster and all of the knights the king has sent out have never returned or if the do return they come back as ashes in desperation the king hires the dragon hunters to stop the world eater zoe of course tags along br br what can i say other then why is this film hiding under a rock this is a really good little film that is completely off the radar except as unlikely oscar contender its a beautifully designed fantastic looking film the world it takes place has floating lands and crazy creatures that constantly had me going wow at it the english voice cast with forrest whitaker as lian chu one of the best vocal performances i've ever heard and rob paulson as gwizdo think steve bucsemi is first rate equally great is the script which doesn't talk down to its audience using some real expressions not normally heard in animated films not disney nor pixar its all really well done br br is it perfect no some of the bits go on too long but at the same time its is damn entertaining br br if you get the chance see this its one of the better animated films from 2008 and is going on my nice surprise list for 2009
<START> no spoilers br br i love horror movies but this has got to be the poorest attempt to make one ever calling it a movie is also a stretch this random clips of obviously fake and tacky violence and an ugly woman trying to act sexy edited poorly together is not worth watching br br watching this is about as interesting watching as some random family's holiday pictures and it has about the same quality you would expect when you send your ten year old son into the woods with your new vid cam and tell him to make a movie br br terrible
<START> ok so the fx are not high budget but this story is based on actual events not something thrown together to make a couple of rich actors even richer as most movies that are based on books there are somethings that just don't fit only a couple of people have stated that this movie was based on real events not a knock off as most people believe it is this movie is in no way related too twister other than both movies are about tornadoes br br for those of you who have problems with the science of the tornadoes and storms in the movie there are a couple of things you need to remember the actual night of the twisters was june 3 1980 so this movie was released 16 years after the actual events try think how far storm research has advanced in that time it happened in a larger town grand island nebraska is the third largest city in the state even though the movie calls the town something else and says it's a small town for the real story check out http www gitwisters com
<START> while the 3 d animation the highlight of the show did it's job well most other elements fell flat it was as though the filmmakers thought well it's gonna be 3 d so we don't have to work that hard on the plot or character development and the fact that it's a children's movie is absolutely no excuse the public is drawn to three dimensional characters shrek nemo's dad just as much as they are drawn to three dimensional graphics the only dimension any of the main characters showed was two dimensional scooter who twists the plot from time to time with his compulsion to eat everything in sight br br and the absolute kicker buzz aldrin's appearance at the very end after watching a very robotic cartoon version of the same historical figure for an hour and half comes on the screen and ruins everyone's good time by calling the film's main characters contaminants and announcing that the situation put forth on screen was actually an impossibility br br did you just wanna tell the kids the easter bunny and santa claus don't exist while you're at it
<START> four tales of terror regarding the events at a creepy old mansion are recounted to sceptical scotland yard investigator holloway john bennett as he investigates the whereabouts of the latest occupant of the house that dripped blood br br one can only struggle to find the words to describe the true brilliance that is Âthe house that dripped blood' this seventies horror anthology is quite remarkable in the way that such a visually innocent movie is capable of inducing horror in even the most discerning of viewers incredibly the number of depictions of violence on screen can be counted on one hand but the film is still able to portray brutality and succeeds in conjuring up the most horrific images in the viewers own imagination all the while refraining from taking the obvious route of graphic violence in a rare feature of early seventies horror the technicalities of the movie are virtually flawless from the faultless performances of the star studded cast featuring the legendary peter cushing christopher lee and ingrid pitt all the way to the superb direction and story telling courtesy of peter duffell and master of the macabre writer robert bloch the author of the novel Âpsycho' the only real complaints that one may have with Âthe house that dripped blood' are the somewhat asinine plot twists at the end of the first two segments and the predictable ending of the picture but even these minor details fail to detract from the overall viewing enjoyment br br the first segment entitled Âmethod for murder' tells the story of charles hillyer denholm elliott a horror author who rents the creepy house while he works on his latest novel while working on the novel hillyer continues to start seeing the murderous character from his story in and around the house and soon begins to question the difference between fiction and reality elliott's performance in this piece is truly exceptional and his character is given a surprising air of believability the key to this segment as with the others is the mystery surrounding the events that take place the viewer is made to question whether the sight of the murderous character of dominic is merely a hallucination a schizophrenic disorder or whether the character is actually there duffell's direction succeeds in creating an unsettling atmosphere coupled with a slow methodical approach to engendering the tension and suspense required to make the segment greatly enthralling br br the following segment features peter cushing as the new occupant of the sinister house during a trip into town he comes across a wax museum of horrors and decides to venture in while there he discovers a wax model of a beautiful woman that seems all too familiar to him cushing's character philip is then joined by his friend neville joss ackland who also wishes to visit the museum much to the dismay of philip in this segment the viewer is given no more than very subtle clues as to the mystery of the wax woman but in general the viewer is left in the dark there is far less tension to this particular story yet the segment still succeeds in maintaining its air of mystery through a particularly harrowing dream sequence and the general ambiguity of the story duffell's direction is once again exceptional and while this is quite possibly the weakest of the four stories there is no denying that through some creative direction and credible acting Âwaxworks' is still a delightful entry into the film br br Âwaxworks' is followed by what is in my opinion the greatest of the four segments Â Âsweets to the sweet' christopher lee stars as john reid the father to a young girl who to begin with has an inexplicable fear of fire which is soon remedied by caring nanny ann norton nyree dawn porter however john appears to be harbouring a dark secret about the family Âsweets to the sweet' is easily the most sober and intricate of the four stories and that is why the segment is undeniably compelling to the viewer throughout the segment small and subtle clues are released about the truth behind the family but it is not until the immensely horrific final scene that everything slots neatly into place this is the best example of how duffell used dramatic tension and suspense to create the foreboding atmosphere that made the entire film great accompanied by a wonderfully arranged soundtrack Âsweets to the sweet' is an exercise in sustained fear that grabs the viewer by the throat and refuses to let go until the agonising screams that end this piece finally cease personally i believe that this short segment would have made an entertaining and haunting feature length movie and i would give this segment a rare 10 10 br br the film is ended with the story surrounding the missing performer that the investigator was originally interested in jon pertwee and ingrid pitt star as two performers who are currently working on a horror movie pertwee's character is disgusted with the amateurish production and props of the film and so he purchases his own vampire cloak from a strange shop of mysteries however strange things begin to happen when he wears the cloak and soon he begins to fear the worst this segment which places the inspector amongst the events is a nice way to wrap up a wonderful anthology although there is an irrefutable air of camp to the segment this is in a way what makes the story so enjoyable unfortunately there is little in this segment that could be classed as frightening in any sense and the predictable ending could have been executed better but nonetheless the segment has its redeeming features horror buffs should definitely look out for pertwee's brief comment on bela lugosi's and christopher lee's portrayal of dracula this slightly comical and light hearted approach to the final segment is in essence an adequate and almost natural way of ending the picture even if it lets down the film when compared to the earlier examples of suspense driven horror br br to sum up Âthe house that dripped blood' is one of the greatest horror anthologies that features an incredible cast great stories and above par direction there are certainly worse ways to spend one hundred minutes of your life and while blood and guts fans will be highly disappointed fans of more tense horror efforts should enjoy this film immensely my rating for Âthe house that dripped blood' Â 8 10
<START> without doubt the best of the novels of john le carre exquisitely transformed into a classic film performances by peter egan magnus pym the perfect spy rudiger weigang axel real name alexander hampel magnus' czech intelligence controller ray mcanally magnus' con man father and alan howard jack brotherhood magnus' mentor believer and british controller together with the rest of the characters are so perfect and natural the person responsible for casting them should have been given an award even the small parts such as major membury are performed to perfection it says a lot for the power of the performances and the strength of the characters in the novel that despite the duplicity of magnus one cannot help but feel closer to magnus and axel than to jack brotherhood and the slimy grant lederer of u s intelligence i have read the book at least a dozen times and watched the movie almost as many times and continue to be mesmerized by both if i had one book to take on a desert island a perfect spy would be the choice above all others
<START> and this is a great rock'n'roll movie in itself no matter how it evolved at point being a movie about disco it ended up as one of the ultimate movies in which kids want to rock out but the principal stands in their way think back to those rock'n'roll movies of the 50's in which the day is saved when alan freed comes to town with chuck berry to prove that rock roll music is really cool and safe for the kids and tuesday weld gets a new sweater for the dance forward to the 1979 repeat the same plot but throw in da ramones whom no one then realized would become one of the most influential bands of the next quarter century and then for the obligatory dj guest shot the real don steele throw in too all the elements of a roger corman produced comedy exploitation film except for the two day shooting schedule some of the familiar corman repertory players like clint howard mary wournow and dick miller there since bucket of blood and you've got one of the great stoopid movies of the day one of the few films that uses deliberate cheesiness and gets away with it i showed the new dvd to a friend who could only remember seeing parts of it through a stoner induced haze at the drive in and he agreed that this is one of the great movies to be watching drunk not the least for the lovely leading ladies and the great ramones footage
<START> hollywood's misguided obsession with sequels has resulted in more misfires than hits for every godfather ii there are dozens of more american graffiti's stayin' alives and grease 2's while the original grease is not a great film the 1977 adaptation of the long running broadway hit does have songs evocative of the 1960's energetic choreography and an appealing cast when paramount began work on a follow up the producers came up nearly empty on every aspect that made the original a blockbuster br br fortunately for moviegoers michelle pfeiffer survived this experience and evidently learned to read scripts before signing contracts her talent and beauty were already evident herein and pfeiffer does seem to express embarrassment at the humiliating dance routines and tuneless songs that she is forced to perform maxwell caulfield however lacks even the skill to express embarrassment and his emotions run the gamut from numb to catatonic what romantic interest beyond hormones could the cool sassy pfeiffer have in the deadpan caulfield that dull mystery will linger long after the ludicrous luau finale fades into a bad memory only cameos by veterans such as eve arden connie stevens and sid caesar have any wit although lorna luft does rise slightly above the lame material br br reviewers have complained that because grease 2 is always compared to the original the movie comes up lacking however even taken on its own terms the film is a clunker after a frenetic opening number which evidently exhausted the entire cast the energy dissipates with few exceptions the original songs bear little resemblance to the early 1960's and the only nostalgia evoked is for our miss brooks and sid caesar's comedy hour the jokes fall flat and the choreography in a film directed by choreographer patricia birch is clumsy to be polite however worse films have been inflicted on audiences and inept sequels will be made as long as producers seek to milk a quick buck from rehashing blockbusters unfortunately grease 2 is not even unintentionally funny instead the film holds the viewer's attention like a bad train wreck just when all the bodies seem to have been recovered the next scene plunges into even worse carnage
<START> what can i say this movie was so dumb stupid i thought it was a psychotic drag comedy they should rename it bitching pregnant cat fight what a stupid waste of time if you want to see die die i want your baby drag queen jennifer tilly being her freaky self then just rent out one of the chucky movie oh ya the bride of chucky it's more fun watching the two ugly plastic dolls one of them jennifer tilly turned into the ugly female version of chucky having squeaky plastic rubber sex then watching daryl hannah being pregnant dumb stupid jennifer tilly grinding up her husbang in a food processor reminded me of my mother trying to do house work ok it's just bad
<START> the movie itself is not too bad many comments have pointed out the obvious flaws of the script but it is watchable what really gives me the creeps though is that people like justin timberlake even get cast for movies and on top of that for movies like this one i have to admit i had never heard the man's name before watching this but the very instant he appeared i was just plain annoyed the voice is crap the face is a bad rip off of legolas the posture is horrible and he cannot even properly coordinate all three of them said to say i was delighted when he got jumped after leaving the disco because i was hoping from then on it would be morgan freeman and kevin spacey only too bad i was wrong these two and also ll cool j give a very decent performance and they are the main reason i give this a 4 br br i see many upcoming movies with the little timberlake cast and cannot believe it
