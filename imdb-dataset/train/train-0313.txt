<START> i have seen bad movies before but this one takes the worst movie of a lifetime award by far anthony hopkins has to be completely mentally ill to have his name attached to this one anywhere i will never see another movie with him in it directing it etc etc i can't believe the other actors actresses that i liked in this picture that stooped so low to be a part of this disaster there must be some great drugs out there for anyone to not be embarrassed to be a part of such a film is beyond me save your money on this one huge flop from beginning to end shame on you mr hopkins also shame on christian slater i can't believe you put your reputations on the line for this one
<START> wow i forgot how great this movie was until i stumbled upon it while looking through the garage it's a kind of strange combination of a bio of michael jackson a collection of musical vignettes and a story about a super hero fighting to save some little kids the vignettes are good especially speed demon but the best part of this movie is the super hero segment in which michael jackson turns into a car a robot and finally a spaceship and it's just as weird as it sounds joe pesci is hilarious and has enough cool imagery and great music to entertain throughout br br the real gem however is the incredible smooth criminal video which makes the movie worth owning for that part alone
<START> i wasn't sure what to expect but am i glad i went to see this a smart slightly twisted comedy that makes you think i wasn't quite sure how a director can create nothing but leave it to mr natali and the brilliant individuals at c o r e to create another low budget set that looks real as real as nothing can be well worth your time and money if you have the opportunity to see this please go you'll be glad you did
<START> saps at sea br br aspect ratio 1 37 1 br br sound format mono br br black and white br br suffering from 'hornophobia' ollie embarks on a 'restful' boat trip but he and stan get mixed up with an escaped convict rychard cramer chaos ensues br br this feature length comedy an ok entry which nonetheless unspools like a mere imitation of laurel and hardy's best work marked the final collaboration between l h and producer hal roach episodic in structure the movie culminates in a memorable ocean voyage after the boys are taken hostage by villainous cramer who shoots a seagull to prove how tough he is the gags are ok but inspiration is lacking perhaps due to the recruitment of actor turned director gordon douglas previously responsible for ollie's first solo effort in the sound era zenobia produced in 1939 but whose work here lacks a measure of pzazz fair but nothing special l h regulars charlie hall and james finlayson make guest appearances
<START> holes is my all time favorite movie so far i have seen this movie three times in theaters and am looking forward to purchasing it on dvd this upcoming september i read the book after seeing the movie and was amazed at how alike the book and movie were the director of this film did an excellent job of re creating the book into movie form also all of the actors selected to play the roles did wonderful playing their characters especially max kasch as zigzag props to all those involved in making this movie it was a real success 10 out of 10 stars i definitely recommend it for everyone to see
<START> after seeing several movies of villaronga i had a pretty clear opinion about him he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters forgetting about a rhythm of the movie that is why though having good critics his movies never caught the broad audience attention in aro he follows the same line but really improved on the rhythm especially in the end of the movie frankly speaking i slept through the first part cause though the first part gives necessary information it is really slow nevertheless the second part is absolutely marvelous and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by villaronga br br recommended
<START> since rugrats ' falling from the category of good and funny cartoon series to a mediocre and indeed outright horrible fare for two year olds in the past three or four years obviously the tyrants at klasky csupo should be out of ideas after dumbing down all of the characters adding even stupider new ones replacing some voices though i like nancy cartwright she is not chucky finster and having no sense of continuity ex in a kimi episode i watched the other day tommy and chucky each got a new puppy but it subsequent episode the aforementioned dogs never appear you'd think the creators could kill the show for mercy but noooo br br all i will say concerning this special is that it sucks while not as horrible as the kimi episodes everyone is even stupider than they were including grandpa my god he used to be the best character on the show but now he has no real purpose the ending is needlessly fluffy and the only thing different between this and other crappy new episodes '98 '01 is that the kids can interact with adults whoa what fun br br no stars at all for the rugrats all growed up klasky csupo please destroy this show before it gets any worse
<START> these reviews that claim this movie is so bad its good are going way overboard with that one this movie does not have the guilty pleasure badness that leonard part 6 battlefield earth and gigli had those movies were entertaining in their awfulness but this pile of dinosaur dung is so bad its painful i haven't been in this much pain watching a bad movie since i watched baby geniuses and superbabies before i start the review let me tell you the story theodore rex is a 35 million dollar bust the new line cinema refused to put in theaters they cut the losses sending it straight to video making it the most expensive straight to video movie in decades whoopi caved in to be in this disaster after a huge paycheck br br plot a millionaire clones dinosaurs so he can launch missiles at the sun which would kill mankind and start another ice age a female cop named katie coltrane and an idiotic dinosaur named theodore rex reluctantly team up to stop him after the death of a buddy dinosaur br br the plot is given to you in the beginning of the movie which robs the movie of all its mystery then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is actually quite awful whoopi looks agitated and is trying to wing it with her performance but to no avail theodore rex is flat out annoying and his bumbling behavior wears thin after five minutes on screen most of the jokes revolve around him threatening to bite people and hitting people with his tail on accident and on purpose i thought burglar was bad but it takes a backseat to theodore rex the worst movie of whoopi's career br br don't let anybody tell you this monstrosity is bad enough to be enjoyable i didn't see that when i watched this movie all i saw was a train wreck that was written by people that must have had some sick admiration for movie howard the duck the humor is on that level and theodore rex looks like the inbred cousin of barney utterly painful from start to finish
<START> one woman by herself in a house for 45 minutes of screen time doesn't sound like a formula to hold you on the edge of your seat but future shock is truly as thrilling as they come writer star vivian schilling takes on those little fears we all suppress and enlarges them to terrifying proportions so don't watch this film alone
<START> kept my attention from start to finish great performances added to this tremendous film mr pacino once again gives us another brilliant character to enjoy
<START> i watched this film in shire joy br br this is possibly one of the best films of all time it has a timeless value you can get so much out of it it's amazing there are parts that are moving funny and just great br br all aspect are spot on the portrayal of the story is perfect every detail is 100 genuine even small irish subtleties have been covered br br the use of low and high shots gives two great views on cristy look out for that br br daniel day lewis's performance is incredible i've never seen an actor do that ever it really is amazing br br and it's so great to watch it flows so well it's probably the closest thing yo can get to real life experience i love it br br if you haven't seen it you should see it don't have any doubts on it there is something there for all
<START> this whirling movie looks more like a combination of music clips at mtv than as a real movie there is no real story and as the movie goes on you ask yourself what is going to happen but nothing happens the story around eric cloeck the frustrated writer is the only good thing the other persons seem to have nothing in common then why bring them together in a movie with music you can make watchable the worst movie when i open the tap and there comes water out with the music of bach then most people will like to look at it but this is not a movie the director should learn how to write a script for a movie of 100 minutes or more before starting to direct a movie
<START> i love this movie my friend marcus and i were browsing the local hastings because we had an urge to rent something we had never seen before and stumbled across this fine film we had no idea what it was going to be about but it turned out spectacular 2 thumbs up i liked how the film was shot and the actors were very funny if you are are looking for a funny movie that also makes you think i highly suggest you quickly run to your local video store and find this movie i would tell you some of my favorite parts but that might ruin the film for you so i won't this movie is definitely on my top 10 list of good movies do you really think nothing is bouncy
<START> slight spoilers but it doesn't matter anyway br br an exercise in gobblygook of catastrophic proportions not even worthy of the l0 lines i need to put these remarks on the netwaves this is the single worst episode of the masters series to date and the first that qualifies for the defunct mystery science theatre treatment even if it took me a full half hour to realize the intended ironic angle it was still a very lame mess its sole value lies in the perspective that forces one to realize that in addition to gore and ugly masks the genre only succeeds when the classic cinematic notions of photography and lighting dialogue and acting editing and timing are put to use here they are absent and john carpenter is no master period and no trite analysis of the easy social comment herein will change that oddly carpenter never has been anything more than a b director but at least such films as 'fog' and 'the thing' had terrific atmosphere the latter is one of my cult favorites br br abominable acting camera angles stuck in cement tensionless rhythm yet perhaps the single most obnoxious element of the episode is the storyline which of course jc cannot really be blamed for unless the writers were buddies of cody the initial two minute slo mo of a girl running through a forest only to be nearly run over by a would be scully mulder duo is the first and last thing that works in the film but come on a girl hurtling through a deserted woods to nowhere in particular in desperate need of an abortion fortuitously rendez vous with the fender of a pair of 'women's rights' mds whose clinic just happens to be at the end of the road around the corner oh and i won't even nitpick about how the doc whips the accidentee into the car and speeds away at 0 to 60 in six seconds does wonders for possible broken ribs or concussion br br then things fall apart real quick the vacuous dialogue i just want to help you the interminably sluggish back and forth at the gate grandiose battle tactics like cutting the telephone line in the age of cell phones followed by the the shoot out a born again ramboesque clinic director vs ron perlman and the high school bullpen out for a few kicks at easter break another lovely line so what are we going to do from the kid who had just been sitting on a pile of assault rifles in the back of the van er no it isn't yet pheasant season so who needs those teen boys anyway what about the good old tried and true method of the lone lunatic who bashes his way through the gate with his all american suv br br as for the exchange of bullets scenes themselves the cuts here were as stiff as the staccato of a dc comics strip all that was lacking were the wham bam and whiz of the balloon titles and all to the tune of a soundtrack worthy of an old mannix episode br br at one point we learn that daddy isn't really the daddy but at this point we haven't been led to care much any more either this story's single source of drama is the conflict between the pro life father and his pregnant daughter who is only thankful she's not having twins yet there is not a single scene flashback or not where they are actually ever found together they remain mere abstractions to each other throughout br br with the exception of the gatekeeper every single one of the characters is absolutely dislikeable bland hysterical dull headed macho as perfectly flat as human wallpaper can be none of the doctors seem to have anything medical about them and there's that bickering dad who rails at his pregnant daughter as though he himself were the stressed out boyfriend he fortunately got his there are two great mst worthy comic moments the gusher when angelica's plumbing goes out and later the new born lobster with a glued on baby's head also cute was angelica's rugby ball belly before she finally popped the right to life little monster from hell as for that audacious male abortion scene well they should have retained miike's episode and banned this one instead br br in short a 3rd rate rosemary's baby meets alien set on the turf of a m a s h episode this stinker alone appreciable only to today's permissive under 16 generation will assure as someone else said here that this series will not be renewed for a third season a real shame since there have been a number of brilliant productions including such really decent spoofs as dante's 'homecoming' or mckee's deliciously quirky 'sick girl' not to mention the superb imagery of malone's 'fairhaired child' br br sorry john carpenter i believe your directing days are over it's time to run for president
<START> after just watching five across the eyes i gotta be honest i just didn't like it i had read so many good reviews on this movie but i just did'nt get where these reviews have came from br br i have got a lot of time for newcomers into film making and i'm sure the directors will do well for themselves but the budget they had was the main problem there was two cameras used in the entire film which was ok but they seemed like really cheap cameras another problem was the sound you get all these girls screaming and shouting all at the same time all talking on top of each other it's just impossible to hear what they're saying br br it had a good idea going for it in a nutshell they hit a parked car then drive off a short while later they are getting chased by the car they hit driven by a mad woman who wants to kill them and has plenty of chances to do so and on the other hand the girls have plenty of chances to escape but don't br br very frustrating i only just scraped through this one
<START> this film was just painful to watch not in the good dramatic way that makes you cringe with emotions for well developed characters in dramatic situations yeah i pretty much made that last sentence up as i went along but in just an absolute dull way for over two hours now you all may think i'm just some ignorant reviewer who has no respect for shakespeare or artistic film making well you'd be wrong on both counts i love the works of shakespeare especially the tragedies of romeo and juliet julius caesar macbeth and hamlet and i've watched plenty of arthouse films such as the surreal and well made eraserhead and fellini's 8 1 2 but this was just over two hours of lost in translation shakespeare way too much nudity i can understand artistic nudity in some scenes but not in every other shot of a movie it was pointless and served nothing for the story and basically just overzealous film making i had high expectations for this film in that it was said to be very artistic and was an adaptation of shakespeare's the tempest but this was just an extreme letdown i gave this film a three only because of sir john gielgud's acting presence which far surpassed all of the no names in this film and the cinematography set design combination as it made a lot of scenes look like paintings in motion however a lot of this film would've been better off as just a painting with a scroll of text below it a true disappointment maybe if zeffirelli had been given the director's chair this would've been much better but this is one audience member's opinion many others may enjoy this far more than me that being said if you can't find this at any nearby video stores it's currently not on dvd don't try to go too far out of your way to find it it's not really worth it
<START> this is one of my favorite movies of all time it's great and the acting is brilliant in the scene in which michael caine calls the police in tears and then stops the waterworks the second he finishes the call really displays caine's brilliance the twists are a lot of fun the film is top notch
<START> but this is a great martial arts film liu chia liang ranks second to none as a fight choreographer only sammo hung at his best compares this is immediately clear from his proud exhibition of technique rather than flashy camera angles etc during fights the direction is tightly controlled to not only excite the viewer by the speed and movement but to awe her with the precise skill displayed this film benefits also from liu's participation in front of the camera liu's performance at the banquet scene with which the film opens is one of the high points in kung fu movie history liu is supported by the beautiful and talented hui ying hung of my young auntie fame and 'hsiao hou' whose acrobatics are breathtaking and preferable to any amount of wirework as for the plot this film follows the not uncommon theme of revenge but with character and moral development along the way and a most fitting resolution the humour in this is also of the best if you only watch one kung fu film ever this would be a good choice it has it all
<START> if i didn't know any better it almost seems like it was staged but it wasn't it was set up perfectly and how they got all of that footage is amazing the unfortunate events of september 11 2001 are put together well in this documentary and the classic footage that they got made this an unfortunate classic just the history in the footage alone should make it a must see for any american or person touched by the tragedy of september 11
