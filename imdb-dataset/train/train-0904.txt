<START> ok after reading a couple of reviews on atlantis the lost empire i just want to clear up some misunderstanding as to it being a direct rip off from nadia secret of the blue water the only part that was a ripoff from nadia is that the pendant from nadia and the pendant from atlantis bear so much resemblence in terms of how it's used origins and how it's created from the source of life that there's no doubt about it being copied if you want to consider how kida and nadia is dressed alike then you could put that against disney too it was kind of wierd for nadia and kida to wear that bikini style clothing in an adventure sci fi not to mention they both move in a similar style too as an anime fan i have to agree there's some degree of copying but it's only on the minor details and even though not many of the ideas are original like the encryption design on the wall in laputa the ancient mask from princess mononoke the resemblence of the vehicles to the garfish submarine in nadia etc the plot itself i believe it's highly original and it's quite amazing that disney can pull it off without the use of captain nemo the main character in jules verne's 20k leagues under the sea which is also the main character in nadia as for mylo and jean wearing similar style glasses as shown in the novel lord of the flies glasses is a symbol of wisdom and intelligence i think mylo jean the main character from stargate and a dozen of other intelligent characters would look kind of unfit for the role if they went in without glasses as for the submarines and how the submarines fight with those wide blast torpedos which really resembles what nautilius does i want to state that it's a required element for either one if atlantis is involved in the plot after all it's a sunken city beneath the waters as for the crew having some charactistical resemblence with the crew from nautilius in nadia it might be the artwork but i don't sense any copyright infringement there as the character's personalities were perfectly original to me as an anime fan that rated nadia as the 1 best anime i ever watched even now today i do have my doubts about atlantis when i first saw the preview but now that i watched the movie i once again regained my confidence with disney and have high hopes for their future movies after atlantis overall the best disney movie yet without me shivering at the sound of their songs at the middle of the movie and it's a plus that they revised their cheesy scripts to make it even better also it's amazing that they actually portray the bad guys look normal with out making them overly evil in the beginning i was wondering who the bad guys are and only the blonde girl kind of resemble the looks of a bad character in terms of how disney draws it aka make the bad guys look really menacing
<START> first of all the reason i'm giving this film 2 stars instead of 1 is because at least peter falk gave his usual fantastic performance as lieutenant columbo he alone can get 10 stars for trying to save this otherwise utterly worthless attempt at making a movie br br i was initially all fired up at reading one poster's comment that andrew stevens in this movie gave the performance of his career to me it was the abysmal performance by stevens that absolutely ruined this movie and so i was all prepared to hurl all sorts of insults at the person who made the aforementioned comment then i thought to myself what else has stevens done so i checked and you know that person was absolutely right in the 17 years since this columbo movie was made apparently every one of the 33 projects that stevens has been in since then has been utter crap so it is doubtful that anybody has even seen the rest of his career br br if you like columbo see every other of the 69 titles before watching this one do yourself a favor and save the worst for last
<START> i've always been a great fan of woody allen and always will be for most of what he did in the past but only a blind lover could ignore how dull meaningless pretentious and most of all horrendously acted this movie is a vacuous mental masturbation based on inconsistent grounds and what a disastrous idea to artificially recreate a presumed actor allen clone that is putting into will farrell's mouth and gestures what allen would have done in farrell's place had he been 30 years younger the outcome was obviously ludicrous and not to speak of the dialogues what was intended to be philosophical reflections turned into an involuntary mockery of intellectual pondering unaware of its comic effect how sad
<START> i really wanted to like this film but so much of it is stolen borrowed from other work some of the borrowing is painfully blatant the new york times' review pointed out that their singing frog is awfully reminiscent of the one in the famous warner brothers' cartoon 'hello my baby hello my darlin' hello my ragtime gal ' but i challenge anyone to watch the fox blue sky animated feature robots 2005 and not find ridiculous similarities in storyline a young inventor growing up and a single innovative corporation distributes all great inventions br br cityscape extremely similar camera angles capture extremely similar futuristic city environments br br robots the servant robot in the robinson household has a very similar design to those in robots and both films use a sort of retro futuristic look br br all of this seems to be in sharp contradiction to the obnoxious quote from disney at the end implying that the company has been a steady innovator who never looks back which also contradicts their entire catalog of films in the 90s that were pretty much clones of each other with some minor tweaks to storyline and ethnicity br br the filmmakers seem unable to let the story speak on its own and instead constantly send objects and noises flying in our direction as though we don't have the attention span for anything less br br the villain is really well designed and brilliantly animated and he's a pleasure to watch much of the rest of the film seems thrown together some of the landscapes look like cgi from the mid 90s br br the film actually opens with a classic mickey mouse short by the end of this cartoon we are reminded that disney never did have much interest in innovating or good storytelling they seem to think that simply getting something up on the big screen is proof enough of their virtue
<START> this is a long lost horror gem starring sydney lassick carrie and others and barbara bach it is sometimes difficult to locate a copy of this film but it's worth it this film is creepy yet cheesy at the same time it seems that 3 young newswomen karen vicky and jennifer travel to the small city of solvang california to cover a festival when a mix up occurs involving their hotel room and they seek refuge at the home of earnest keller lassick and his strange wife virginia vickie stays behind feeling ill as the other 2 are off to film their story she is soon murdered at the house in a very cheesy way by some unknown force hiding in the ventilation system she is decapitated by the closing cover of the vent as it comes crashing down on her while she is being tugged through and into the basement soon karen returns and she is murdered in an even more brutal fashion by having her face rammed through the vent cover jennifer is fighting with her ex lover in a rather boring sub plot and when she returns home her hosts whom by now we have discovered are brother and sister and that whatever it is that is in the basement is their son devise a plot to try to murder her as well virgina does not totally agree with earnest's plan to murder jennifer but she is tricked into going into the basement where she meets junior here the film turns almost comic as junior portrayed hysterically by stephen furst is a deformed mentally deficient manchild whose actions and motions will cause a few chuckles even though it's supposed to be scary this is where the pace of the film picks up and the ending is well done the actors actresses do a terrific job with the material especially lassick furst and bach and although it's not the most horrifying film ever made it is highly entertaining
<START> i remember liking this more than nausicaa of the valley of the winds at an age when that tone of story was too serious for me laputa whose title seems to have affected its release in the u s to avoid confusion to its wide hispanic audiences has the cartoonish knack of the director's debut production conan in fact pazu has the thick bones and immortal vitality of conan who jumped off a thousand stories carrying his girl in his arms and landed on his feet then started running this makes him the most animated and pleasing character to watch the techie fans of nausica may be disappointed by the flying bugs and the retro technology through out laputa the only exception may be the robot unlike princess mononoke and valley of the winds the theme in laputa is not directly connected to environmentalism if it has a theme at all it's anti warfare the importance of living naturally this is related with the flying castle is dismissably shortly discussed and not really followed through overall i now regard the piece as being at an intersection between feel good and corny
<START> am i wrong or is the 2007 version just a rip off of the original i have to ask because the dvd i just bought is one of the worst films i have ever seen bad acting bad editing etc the only exploitation aspect here is how we were ripped off for our money buying this piece of crap it is nothing more than a light weight porn flick no real gore no scary images just a cheaply done bit of garbage if anyone wants to see an excellent film with no name actors some slimy gore and a decent storyline get baby blood also done on a cheap budget but well made and an actual story too i spit was a waste of money but i'll keep it just for a laugh it is pathetic new comment sept 3 i'll keep this film forever just because it it sooooo bad it's almost good in a really bad way the worst acting ever a real crap movie classic
<START> this movie was different in that it didn't show the typical gay stereotypes that i'm used to seeing but that doesn't change the fact that it totally lacks a storyline i'm sure that there are many gay men who are just happy to see themselves depicted on screen since black gay characters are seldom seen and when they are the characters are usually not fully developed but how hard would it have been for the writer to actually script a story with a beginning middle and end or how about a story that was focused there really doesn't seem to be a point to this film and even though it is a low budget film that is still no excuse for the lack of story or plot
<START> harman and isings 'old mill pond' is a true masterpiece of the art of animation the consummate skill and artistry that characterise this duos work is nowhere more in evidence than in this cartoon it is a shame that so many people can see only offence in what is and was always intended to be a light hearted piece of entertainment that in no way sought to denigrate black people if anything it is a tribute to the infectious humour and musicality of the black race i have not been able to view this confection for many years as the 'race commissars' in england have deemed it too offensive to be shown in multi racial britain if anyone knows where i can obtain a copy i would dearly love to view this masterpiece again i think those who routinely look for messages and intent that were never intended in these cartoons which are after all sixty years old should try to lighten up and remember that the world is a very different place today but that does not mean that anyone has the right to censor what is viewable from the past
<START> the film is not visually stunning in the conventional sense it doesn't present a series of pretty pictures instead it is a visually interesting film it forces the viewer to constantly process or perhaps imagine the context of the various shots this sort of thing is easy to try but hard to succeed at the film refuses to use the crutch of a genre to help the less than fully engaged viewer get what's going on instead the film touches on and moves through a number of different genres the trick to loving the film is being able to enjoy this playfulness i suspect 99 of north american viewers will just not get it if you try to pin down the narrative of this film or the philosophical message or the symbolist structure etc you will waste your time there are none of these the film only feints towards these genres and others at times the only unifying force in the film is claire denis's own sense of what fits together there are so few feature length films that come close to satisfying kant's description of what art is namely the enjoyment of the power of judgment itself instead of simply subsuming experiences under concepts film usually takes the easy way out and opts for the simpler pleasure of understanding what's happening most film is not art most film doesn't come close to art when a film does as this one does and is still enjoyable by a large range of viewers it's something of a miracle my on negative comment is that at times i find the film too simplistically buying in to the various narrative threads that run through it the tahiti father son narrative even though it's not exactly conventional ends up making things a little to clear and simple it dominates too much
<START> i loves this movie because it showed that they were not killing for fun but to save the ones they loved heath ledger and orlando bloom did a great job portraying ned and joe it has a few quick inappropriate scenes but is all right other than that the language is very mild and sometimes don't even know it is there this movie shows that just because they are outlaws does not mean that they are vicious killers i hope that people will watch this movie and learn about important times in history like this one there is one thing that fascinates me about this movie is that they got their inspiration for their armor from a book ned looked at also that that is how people remember them from their armor i hope that people will watch this movie and get interested as i have
<START> i really think that people are taking the wrong approach at this one first of all i find this short film very entertaining and interesting i just take it for what it is i think the suspense and mystery are ingenious in their insinuation upon the watcher one other thing that caught my fancy was that it immediately gets the viewer involved even though there is no clear story just hints and pauses and emotions played out by the characters that kind of give you the impression that there is a story to all that is going on no one else could have done that better than lynch this is the essence of lynchianism at its best sure i will agree with anyone that people that start viewing this with the desire to be entertained without any really imaginative work from the viewer's side will find themselves disappointed and in good right lynch is not about that at least this side of lynch is not the one that helped make lost highway mulholland dr is at full tilt here and people that just expect to be entertained like they would watching anything else will just not get what this is all about my opinion is that darkened room is all about messing with your animal core your instinctual self by giving you the means image sound situation by which you instinctively react it's not about pleasure of any kind it's about getting the desired reaction out of you and that my friend is pure art
<START> faithful adaptation of witty and interesting french novel about a cynical and depressed middle aged software engineer or something relying heavily on first person narration but none the worse for that downbeat in a petit bourgeois sort of way philosophical and blackly humorous the best way i could describe both the film and the novel is that it is something like a more intellectual charles bukowski no disrespect to cb intended mordantly funny but also a bleak analysis of social and sexual relations the film's great achievement is that it reflects real life in such a recognisable way as to make you ask why aren't other films like this one of the rare examples of a good book making an equally good film
<START> the key to the joy and beauty the pain and sadness of life is our ability to accept that life basically is what it is so we don't constantly struggle against that single compelling truth in so doing we find peace elegant in its simplicity but so hard for most of us to grasp br br in this film the director shows us this truth but allows us to discover it in our own way this is a beautiful yet simple story more of a fable which is played very well watching the actors is more like being in a room with real people than it is just watching actors br br i struggled with how to write a review of this fine film so others would be motivated to see it i'm at a loss the story is about men in a bath house sounds like a real turn off right but nothing could be farther from the truth the american title for this film is the shower but that is almost an antithesis to a major thematic element in this film which is the bath i'm still at a loss talking about the story or the characters will not do them justice br br so i'll just tell you how much i enjoyed watching this movie and how touching and moving the experience was i was also quite entertained i cared deeply for the characters and i cared deeply about what happened to them for any story that is the highest form of praise br br if you were moved by movies like the king of masks or not one less then make sure you see the shower netflix has it and the dvd video and sound quality are excellent i watched it in the original lanquage with well done and well placed english subs br br
<START> i think if they made any money make a complete turd bomb like this one the i need to get into the movie industry i wiped my ass on a piece of toilet paper and made a better script once watch when the guy is running through the tunnel they used the same 30 feet of tunnel over and over and over again and never even changed the location of the stupid hanging light br br i think if i get the thrill of meeting the director of this gem of a movie i think i will pick a fight with him and start it by deficating on his loafers br br i think i need to puke now
<START> from the awful death scenes to guns that fire without making sounds to a character called the fiend it's all tiresome slow moving unimaginative drivel it was ok seeing the guy with the cape and the hunchback lurking around visually it was creepy and probably occupied the moviegoer of the time but even in 1936 one would think that there would have been a little more imagination and verisimilitude to even a film like this i just kept waiting for something to happen of any importance as people stood around making speeches and acting like they were posing at an office picnic and then there are those bullets as a previous commentator mentioned perhaps the best clue would have been to search for a water spot on someone's pants pocket
<START> 'one round' jack sander is called that because he's a carnival boxer who fights any man in the audience if they can last one round they win a prize a popular way to draw customers into traveling shows long ago jack is in love with the ticket girl mabel though her head is quickly turned when bob corby enters the ring to try his chances with jack what no one at the fight knows is that bob is the champ so he's able to beat jack though it takes him some work as a result bob asks jack to become his sparring partner and give up the carnival circuit later jack improves so much that he too becomes a legitimate boxer slowly he works his way up the rankings until he's nearly ready to take on the champ br br in the meantime the champ and mabel start running around behind jack's back even though by now mabel has married jack so when the final fight occurs between jack and bob it's very personal and jack is ready to kill him is he good enough will rise justifiable rage against bob help or hinder his performance tune in and see br br this film was directed by alfred hitchcock and while today this sort of film seems strange for a director known for mystery suspense films back in the 1920s hitchcock had no fixed genre which he directed or wrote he did both for this film in fact in many ways this film is more indicative of hitchcock's silent style as a somewhat similar plot came up in one of his next silents the manxman also starring carl brisson as the wronged husband so while this seems a lot like a standard boxing film of the day it was not a radical departure for this great director even with its rather formulaic ending br br overall while a bit predictable and having ian hunter playing a boxing champ seems silly the film works well while far from a perfect silent it's well worth seeing and packs a nice punch
<START> i really truly enjoyed this movie which is why it surprised me that it got such a low rating from so many users at this site i am not saying that it is a cinematic masterpiece but it was a great way to spend a cold snowy saturday night it is funny poignant and a great tales of the ups and downs of female friendships lasting through difficult times and the bad things that female friends tend to do to each others fess up ladies we have all been there bill paterson shines as the reverand gerald marsden and andie mcdowell proves that she can be a fine actress when the role is right and she puts her mind to it and truly there is the best wedding escape that i have ever seen or dreamed up in this film more guts than anyone i have ever known you will laugh and you will cry ignore any marketing campaigns and how this film is being marketing it is a hidden gem that should have done tonnes of box office now i have to look around to purchase a copy
<START> family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about love can hold the members together through out the ordeals and trials and that is what this movie is about one man daddy has the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity the kids grow up one all be it in the hard way to realize that no matter how old they or a parent is the parent still loves their children and are willing to provide them a cushion when they fall all the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances yes i shed a tear along the way knowing i had had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent this true to life is one which every young adult and parent would do well to see although some will not realize it until they too are parents a must see for those who care about their families
<START> although i rated this movie a 2 for showing a complete lack of effort in trying to create a quality horror film it was a 10 on the unintentional funny scale i couldn't figure out what was going on in the movie or who the people were but i didn't care because i knew every scene was going to have something to make me cry with laughter dialogue is a minimum throughout the movie but i believe this is because they started filming without a script the fact that there is no plot line makes the movie extremely versatile it doesn't matter if you sit down and watch the movie from beginning to end or if you watch it in rewind you will be confused with enjoyment i particularly like the scene in which the inmates are taking turns running around outside beating each other with sticks i believe the doctor refers to this as treatment genius
