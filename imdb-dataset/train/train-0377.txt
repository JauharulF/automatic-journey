<START> this is a movie about how men think women think about love no woman describes a one night sexual encounter and declares it a love story br br of the ten monologues i felt only three really had any kind of truth ring through them i kept waiting for the film to get better and it did a bit but never better enough br br this is an interesting concept and i kept wanting it to be good but it never succeeded maybe if they actually were love stories it would have worked
<START> unbelievable br br this film gets a 7 out 0f 10 this has to be one of the worst films i have seen in years not only was the acting incredibly bad the storyline if you can call it that was just as bad offcourse everyone knows what's going to happen within the first 5 minutes which is not a bad thing if you can captivate the audience during leading up to that moment that however is not the case there is no action no suspense not even a spark between the 2 leading actors it was unfortunately a waste of my time and certainly a waste of my money br br and the 2 of merely for trying
<START> kojak meets the mafia telly savales is one of those guys from the past that seems pretty forgettable i never thought that his show was all that great this is his one dimensional characterization of a crime boss with very predictable results if you take the car chases and the general rambling out there isn't much plot development or action i find mafia movies to be dull because i have no respect or interest in common criminals and their actions hollywood and in this case the italian cinema treat these guys as heroes i saw the film and in a few days i won't remember much about it lots of shooting innocent bystanders dying betrayal and that sick loyalty the film is photographed pretty well and the acting is decent but the dubbing is so bad due to voices that just couldn't come out of those bodies that i almost started looking for godzilla approaching the bay
<START> this film was done in really poor taste the script was really bad i feel really sad for the late gregory peck who took on the title role of this b movie adaptation of one of history's greatest generals the movie was politically incorrect and downright insensitive to the others who fought the japanese in world war 2 there was a scene where i almost vomited it showed macarthur in a bunker in corregidor island talking to the troops like a seasoned politician when he comes across a wounded one legged filipino soldier the soldier bleeding and dying manages to sit up straight upon seeing the general and says no papa no mama no uncle sam' and macarthur gives his little pep talk that americans would never abandon' the philippines the scene ends with the soldier being invigorated by macarthur's words and gives him a smart salute i mean if there was a more condescending scene portraying the u s as the great white savior of the world please tell me because this one takes the cake it showed that filipinos are damsels in distress incapable of honor and have to rely on the great americans solely for redemption it blatantly and purposely overshadowed the contributions of the members of the usaffe united states armed forces of the far east these are filipino volunteers that were integrated in the us military during world war 2 who died side by side with the americans fighting the japanese who walked side by side with americans in the death march of bataan and defended corregidor island by launching a guerilla offensive after macarthur left for australia with his famous i shall return' speech my late grandfather a filipino world war 2 veteran and usaffe soldier was one of the many who fought the japanese with honor and love for the home country i think this movie does not give honor to them and to the thousands of others that macarthur relied on for intelligence preparations for his famous return in the leyte gulf landing
<START> munchies starts in deepest darkest peru looks more like a dirt road to me where archaeologist simon watterman harvey korman his son paul charles stratton are on an expedition simon thinks that ancient aztec buildings were in fact spacecraft control centres he is on a mission to gain proof that alien lifeforms have visited earth while in once such structure he discovers a strange small creature which he sticks in his backpack takes back home with him to the small american town of sweetwater in california simon feels that the creature is the proof he has been looking for for some inexplicable reason decides to leave the thing at home while he goes to share his discovery simon ask's paul his wife cindy nadine van der velde to take care of it meanwhile simon's brother fast food businessman cecil watterman harvey korman again steals the creature so his brother won't make any money out of it but his idiotic stepson dude jon stafford has a fight with it chops it up with a knife but the individual parts grow back into separate little creatures that proceed to cause much havoc amongst the townspeople br br directed by bettina hirsch this has to be one of the worst horror comedy's ever if not the worst the script by lance smith is so unfunny it's painful every joke in munchies misses the target by the proverbial mile i doubt the humour in this piece of crap would even appeal to pre teens there just isn't anything even remotely funny or even amusing in munchies as far as i'm concerned the basic story is crap too they just happen to find this creature running around with no explanation of what it is why no ones ever seen it before how it manages to learn english so quickly how it learns to drive etc the whole thing is a big gremlins 1984 rip off with none of the elements that made that film so good the character's are moronic the stupid deputy charlie phillips his dad hardy rawls cecil wearing an embarrassing wig fake moustache his air head wife melvis alix elias more besides they just plain embarrass are ridiculous i defy anyone to find any of this rancid rubbish funny basically munchies fails spectacularly at being either a comedy or horror ends up being yes you've guessed it crap br br director hirsch was obviously working with a low budget here it shows the entire thing takes place in two houses the desert some caves a miniature golf course this is really cheap incompetent film making the special effects on the munchies themselves are really awful their just dolls that have no movement unless someone off camera pulls a string attached to it's arm i cannot stress how bad the effects are these things wouldn't convince my 4 year old nephew as proved by me him yesterday total incompetence all the way this film sucks br br technically the film is terrible bad special effects lame production design rubbish sets well just everything's crap the acting is rotten through through from the cops to korman who has two roles both of which prove he can't act isn't funny br br munchies is a really bad film that fails in everything that it tries to achieve sure watch it if you want i won't stop you but just don't say you weren't warned my advice would be to watch gremlins again instead but the decision is yours
<START> a masterpiece of comedy a masterpiece of horror a masterpiece of romance if there is anything negative to say about a chinese ghost story it might be that the special effects looked dated in comparison to modern technology the film has a simple premise a poor debt collector has to stay in a secluded area while trying to collect a debt of course it happens to be haunted as well br br what i wasn't expecting the first time i saw this film is that it's one of the most touching love stories i've ever seen that is without losing any of the slapstick comedy that will have you in stitches unlike some films of asian cinema a chinese ghost story isn't hard to swallow for those that aren't versed in chinese culture indeed it plays on timeless cultureless themes of the paranormal and romance br br think evil dead 2 if they had thrown a wonderful love story into the mix this film is for real despite being overlooked by many it's absolutely among the best i've ever seen it's ability to combine the best aspects of multiple genres and cross cultural boundaries in order to appeal to humanity everywhere is nothing short of fantastic highly recommended 10 10
<START> this is a really fun breezy light hearted romantic comedy you cannot go wrong with meg ryan's cute perkiness combined with albert einstein's genius normally i'm not a fan of completely fabricated fictional tales about actual people now deceased and not able to defend themselves but i think the late einstein might himself have gotten a chuckle out of this one br br it's the 1950's princeton new jersey in the spring the story revolves around a pretty young scatter brained mathematician catherine meg ryan who is all set to marry a stuffy jerk a behavioral researcher named james merely because he has the brains she's looking for in the father of her future children however it's love at first sight when her car breaks and she meets an auto mechanic named ed tim robbins as she doesn't think ed is intelligent enough her uncle none other than albert einstein plays match maker assisted in his endeavors by three mischievous cronies all theoretical physicists uncle albert must make ed appear suitably smart so concocts a charade portraying him as a physicist naturally with amusing results br br walter matthau is his usual hilarious self and pulls off the character of einstein quite effectively with his three professorial buddies kurt nathan and boris a lot of laughs ensue the real einstein had a genuine human side and this film just takes it one outrageous step further if you suspend all logic you can almost imagine this silly story happening br br it might not be rocket science despite its main character but it is a wonderful sweet refreshing movie one of the best of the comedy romance genre
<START> the men in white movie is definitely one of the funniest if not the funniest comedy movies i ever watched and i watched quite a lot it is about two garbagemen who become men in white and then stop an invasion from space it is also a parody of lots of classic movies such as men in black star wars or dr strangelove anyone who says that this movie is crappy has something wrong with his head there are tons of funny gags and jokes here and you might actually get injury to your mouth from laughing too hard it happened to me if you can watch this movie on tv watch it now you certainly won't regret it
<START> i wanted to see it because of two reasons one it was the remake of high sierra with bogart two the bogart part was played by jack palance whom can play dramatic roles with some subtility as in the big knife br br but now i wonder why they decided to shoot this remake the film follows the same plot as hig sierra only here the actors don't care the director is lost in his thoughts and who knows what the producer was thinking jack palance is getting bored looking at shelley winters and shelley winters is asking herself what she's doing in this film i don't even want to compare her to ida lupino in the same role and of course they had to use the dog story again they surely could have come up with some different ideas perhaps the color makes it nice to see the same location where they shot high sierra but that definitely doesn't add any quality to the film br br it's a waste of time if you've seen high sierra before otherwise why not see a pseudo film noir as for me i'd rather die than see it one more time
<START> if you haven't seen this it's terrible it is pure trash i saw this about 17 years ago and i'm still screwed up from it
<START> not only is this film entertaining with excellent comedic acting but also interesting politically it was made at the end of the soviet union but makes fun of the soviet mentality through and through the story is set during the early days of the soviet union and it questions the rationale behind the revolution both in cultural and practical terms of course by the late 80s and early 90s the bizarre strictures of soviet society are already relaxed but the ideology and mentality is still alive and well and ready for some well deserved deconstruction happily all this deep philosophical commentary is wrapped in a funny and entertaining package br br jur
<START> my friends and i walked out after 15 minutes and we weren't the first afterwards we tried to get our money back movie theater management wouldn't allow this but they did agree to let us see another film the only time that worked for us was to see dickie roberts former child star as you can tell this wasn't a memorable night probably one of my worst movie nights close second has to be when i saw a double header of domestic disturbance and heist in conclusion for the sake of humanity please don't see the order
<START> this is surprisingly above average slasher that's enjoyable and well made with some decent gore all the characters are decent and the story is quite fun plus molly ringwald played the annoying bitch extremely well i bought this at a pawn shop for a 1 and it was surprisingly worth it and the special effects were pretty damn good for the budget plus i loved the mask the killer wore as it was actually somewhat creepy the finale was really cool as i loved how they defeated the killer and the ending while predictable was very amusing as well plus all the characters except for ringwald were surprisingly pretty likable it's decently made and written and i thought it was quite creative and original at times as well plus some of the death scenes were very impressive this killer didn't mess around and i loved it and slasher fans like myself should really enjoy this film plus the opening was really wicked too with them filming the movie this is a surprisingly above average slasher that's enjoyable and well made with some decent gore and i say it's well worth the watch the direction is good kimble rendall does a good job here with solid camera work using a creepy setting good angles and keeping the film at a fast moving pace the acting is solid molly ringwald plays the bitch extremely well and i had troubles feeling sorry for her after all she was supposed to be the heroine she turned out better towards the end but not by much i'm surprised she decided to do this film nonetheless she did an excellent job frank roberts is fantastic as the killer he is menacing creepy and had one hell of a mask and this guy didn't mess around he was fantastic kylie minogue plays a bitch very well in her small role jessica napier is cute and does fine as the other heroine rest of the cast are fine overall well worth the watch out of 5
<START> now look i won't lie to you but i only got this movie for 3 99 from a friend because it had danni filth the lead singer of the ever popular death metal band cradle of filth in it i expected of course violence and gore at its finest as that is what mr filth can be portrayed as amongst a plot line br br but dear god i was oh so wrong this movie seriously bites big time being a low budget film haha wait make that zero budget this obviously lacks the beautiful howard stern orchestra musical scores and the spielberg special effects nope it's all one camera bad angles and bad blood scenes br br take for example when our star and violent fiend mr filth violently kills a mugger a grab at the throat and blood spits out but oh my it looks like there's a juice packet filled with fake blood in the man's shirt br br to you cradle of filth fans you'll hear two songs throughout the movie but with the camera angles and shoddy filming they drag the overall pleasure of the song down br br my final comment steer well away from it it's blood gore breasts and hey even a shoddy story to go with it so if you like appalling violence near no voices yes there's hardly any words in this movie then by all means buy it but if shoddy movies isn't your thing then avoid it don't waste your money
<START> often tagged as a comedy the man in the white suit is laying out far more than a chuckle here and there br br sidney stratton is an eccentric inventor who isn't getting the chances to flourish his inventions on the world because nobody pays him notice he merely is the odd ball odd job man about the place as it were after bluffing his way into birnley's textile mill he uses their laboratory to achieve his goal of inventing a fabric that not only never wears out but also never needs to be cleaned he is at first proclaimed a genius and those who ignored him at first suddenly want a big piece of him but then the doom portents of an industry going bust rears its head and acclaim quickly turns to something far more scary br br yes the film is very funny in fact some scenes are dam hilarious but it's the satirical edge to the film that lifts it way above the ordinary to me the contradictions about the advent of technology is a crucial theme here do we want inventions that save us fortunes whilst closing down industries you only have to see what happened to the coal industry in britain to know what i'm on about the decade the film was made is a crucial point to note the making of nuclear weapons became more than just hearsay science was advancing to frighteningly new proportions you watch this film and see the quick turnaround of events for the main protagonist stanley from hero to enemy in one foul swoop a victim of his own pursuit to better mankind it's so dark the film should of been called the man in the black suit br br i honestly can't find anything wrong in this film the script from roger macdougall john dighton and director alex mackendrick could be filmed today and it wouldn't be out of place such is the sharpness and thought of mind it has the sound and setting is tremendous the direction is seamless with the tonal shift adroitly handled by mackendrick some of the scenes are just wonderful one in particular tugs on the heart strings and brings one to think of a certain scene in david lynch's elephant man some 29 years later and yet after such a downturn of events the film still manages to take a wink as the genius that is alec guinness gets to close out the film to keep the viewers pondering not only the future of stanley but also the rest of us in this rapidly advancing world br br a timeless masterpiece thematically and as a piece of art 10 10
<START> i'm going to review the 2 films as a whole because i feel that is how it should be considered and watched when i talk about 'the film' i am talking about parts 1 2 together when watched one after the other as they should be br br thank you jon anderson steven soderbergh benicio del toro br br this film is a refreshing bold gritty and true film and it hearkens a new style of film making no faux drama no swelling sound track not faux documentary style just clean shots and an attempt to stick to the facts i have been reading jon anderson's che guevara a revolutionary life and recently finished fidel's auto biography and this had helped my ability to soak this film in properly but i have to say that it is jon anderson's exhaustive penultimate and wonderful biography that has given this film the proper historical back bone anderson was consultant on this film or these 2 films what makes this film a true thing is that it is clean no swelling music or slow motion photography to heighten drama and even more importantly no fake documentary shaky camera just square shots and straight forward shooting style the type of camera used makes you feel right there in the jungle benicio del toro should be given full honors for this i never doubted him as che throughout the film not once he did a wonderful job and i will respect him for ever for this some people complain that the film only deals with 2 slices of his life and not the whole but i think this is one of the true beautiful aspects of this film it doesn't try to be everything it doesn't try to 'tell the story' a person's life is too multifaceted to try and tell in 2 4 8 16 or 32 hours this is one of the subtle beauties of this film it resists that temptation and stays focused on the intent of letting us get a feel for che his developing militaristic mind and the forces around him it focuses on 3 slices of time the battle to over throw batista che's u n speech and the gorilla preparations in bolivia motorcycle diaries already told his young man side and i applaud s soderbergh for focusing on other aspects instead i keep referring to jon anderson's book and the film stays true the only weak link for me are the casting not the performance of matt damon in a film so loaded with true to life performances an american matt damon playing a bolivian is a clunky stretch he does well but after so much care in the casting this was an over site small and completely forgiven the reality that the rest of the casting gives you and most notably benicio del toro's amazing job put's this film at the top of my list br br the fact that this film went almost straight to video say's something about how the cold war ethics that would never allow the 'revolutionized cuba' to become what it might have are still at work keeping it's story quiet if not out of clandestine muffling then out of the effects of properly done propaganda that has prejudiced this topic br br this is a must see film and jon anderson's che guevara a revolutionary life is a must read if you want to start to get a grasp of the early effects on the global mind set regarding the expansion of international political financial chess moves of the 40's 50's 60's that placed unfair pressure on our south american neighbors and the effects it fostered
<START> boring minimal plot no character development i went into this movie with high expectations from the book it could have been an awesome movie it could have probably become a cult classic nope it was a giant let down it was poorly cast and had horrible special effects it was difficult to determine who were the bad guys the rebels or the military or the church or all of them i am still left puzzled by certain mini plots from the movie i am left dumbfounded as to certain aspects of this so called prophecy which is never really fully explained i felt like i was watching a corny episode of a mini series on the sci fi channel it seemed very much like a made for tv movie don't go see this movie it is a waste of time and money
<START> whilst it is universally acknowledged that fearful symmetry was heavily influenced by the kolchak episode they have been they are they will be whether this makes it a rip off or a homage is an altogether more controversial point as a huge fan of both series i subscribe to the latter belief although the less charitable may not do james whitmore was brave to take on the task of directing such a difficult episode invisible elephants and gorilla suits sounds like a recipe for disaster but he pulls it off with style the teaser being an absolute gem lance guest does a great job of making a credible character out of kyle lang and jack rader seethes with menace as ed meecham forget fearful symmetry's dubious originality and just enjoy it as a deeply satisfying x file
<START> i read the reviews for this and while not expecting a saving private ryan i was expecting a film of some substance br br the film starts off very lob sided with the usual intro of history and how the unit came into being but immediately it's 1944 and you are not sure where everyone is the accents etc are very poor as this unit is supposed to be hawaiian asian american but everyone speaks in a very poor take on harvard english imitation of a japanese person br br i gave this film 3 out of 10 as after 10 minutes i couldn't watch any more of it the characters were 1 dimensional and even though they were most likely based on real people i had no feeling for them and this left me not caring about them very poor direction of a very average tv movie which will be shown at midnight on some cable channel i'd avoid and look out for better efforts br br this is a good story but it was deserving of a better telling you got a sense the director had seen band of brothers and thought that that was enough to sell his movie my advice avoid and watch band of brothers tuskegee airmen glory or any other movie like when trumpets fade
<START> the movie gets to the guts of the tension between a son and a father br br the brilliant dialog lovely scenery and great acting serve as an excellent way to present the onion that keeps peeling back layers br br the core issues of parenting communication and manhood are explored indirectly br br in fun ways the curtain is pulled back the masks slip off a little and truths are exposed br br all of this happens amidst a road trip format the backdrop is rural new york state in the early fall just as the trees are changing colors wow
