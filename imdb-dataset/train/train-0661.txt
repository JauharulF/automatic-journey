<START> i thought watching employment videos on corporate compliance was tedious this movie went nowhere fast what could have been a somewhat cheesy half hour twilight zone episode turned into a seemingly endless waste of film on people parking their cars a picture of some dude's swimming pool he really needs to answer his phone by the way a dot matrix printer doing its job and heuy and louey sitting in a yellow lighted control room repeating t minus 10 and counting as if something exciting is going to happen it doesn't so don't get your hopes up the best thing about this movie is to see james best and gerald mcc in something other than there famous tv personalities and that is stretching to find anything good and do not get me started on the music which was totally composed of a tympani some large marine mammals and microphone feedback this movie is as close as i have given a one yet but it gets the 2 because i actually was able to finish this insomnia cure and didn't have to leave in the middle avoid at all costs
<START> this was just plain terrible i read this book for school i made as on all of the tests and to see it like this my teacher forced me and 20 other people to watch it and it was worse than leonard part 6 plan 9 from outer space and hudson hawk put together the thing that made this film so terrible was enough reasons to want to kill yourself over first of all it was made on hallmark second the acting was terrible third it was like completely different from the book literally it was so bad i asked myself to be excused basically i would rather watch basic instinct 2 than watch this take my advice don't watch this film no one would want to watch this it was horrible horrible
<START> wow this movie bored the pants off me when i saw it bland pointless and unmoving br br apparently ash and co can travel through time with the help of the spirit of the forest 'princess mononoke' much there they meet a dorky kid named sam and the plot begins br br so tom ash and huck sam get high with nature become hippies and try to free celebi the spirit from some weirdo hunter guy i don't even know what else went on it all went by in a blur ash's friends were hardly in it and all the fight scenes were boring br br after saving the day ash and his infamous friends must return to their time while watching sam float away with celebi that scene was just creepy o o then after returning to their time ash learns that his new friend is actually his rival's grandpa and i think that's it pretty retarded isn't it if you love your children you won't expose them to this 1 out of 10
<START> cash now played by khrystyne haje in for angelina jolie has wandered to a post apocalypse wasteland after her protector has died from old age said protector was played by elias koteas an actual decent actor and now she finds that people wander through the rubble looking for cyborgs to trade for scrap metal and cash she leads a group of burned out cyborgs that includes william katt evan lurie and a human scientist played by zach galligan against bounty hunter richard lynch malcolm mcdowell has two minutes of screen time as lynch's employer cyborg 3 does manage to be better than the other two entries but it still is a largely dull feature the problem this time is that the ideas with potential are never used well the action sequences are routine and the name cast such as mcdowell katt and galligan are given little to do haje is indeed a whiny heroine and lynch is too over the top as usual and the film lacks the inspiration or ambition to be as fun bad as it's hilarious predecessor the one with van damme the second one is just dull also disappointing is the science fiction angle which almost aggressively resists any good idea it has as an action flick this is routine and by the numbers b movie stuff and it is competently made that's the only thing positive i can say about it br br 1 2 out of 4 poor
<START> very low budget police procedural film about homicide detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body turns up in a stolen car in central park and their only clue is a tattoo on her arm although released by rko this has the look of an independent production that was picked up by the studio for distribution the cast and crew with a few exceptions among them a young and uncredited jack lord director edward montagne and cameraman william steiner are comprised of complete unknowns and it shows the performances are universally sub par and wouldn't pass muster in a high school training film the direction is stodgy and choppy and as mentioned previously there's no chemistry whatsoever between the lead actors however despite the film's many shortcomings it does have a few good points the location shooting in new york city and the film's ultra low budget gives it a gritty authenticity much like that of the far superior the naked city a shootout in a dark basement is decently handled and some of the investigating procedures are clever otherwise it's not much to write home about it is worth a look however for a glimpse at the seamier sections of new york city in the early 1950s and old car buffs will be ecstatic to see the legions of '30s and '40s cars in the streets br br
<START> the question of whether or not one likes this film version of the ghost train invariably depends on one thing and one thing alone your reaction to the performance of arthur askey br br he tends to steal almost every scene he's in and not always in a good way sometimes you wish he'd settle down or back off just a little to allow the plot's many characters to feature and develop which they do to some extent but somehow everything keeps pointing back to askey's tommy gander character br br personally i like the film and even like askey to an extent i always seem to plonk it into the vcr at those odd hours of the early morning when i can't sleep and really can't find the energy to watch anything else there is something about watching old b w movies in the quiet dark of pre dawn that i find appealing
<START> rod serling was of course a genius and his wonderful playful creative mind left something of the period in which he lived and examples of television at that state of development there are no such shows now but rather housewife sluts ala eva longoria or terri hatcher or the pitiful stabs at humor and witty banter that litter our high tech screens br br jack elam edged into the episode with such acting precision and with his usual craziness that i can't help but think that rod serling was tailoring that long ago week's show around elam even though he was an ancillary to the flow of the story this episode ends with a twist as usual but shock and humor are mixed with especially serlingesque dexterity br br rex lewis field
<START> very much a film from the times extremely long sequences with no dialogue bad flashbacks and an almost entirely male cast the two women who appear have a total of under 10 lines and exist only as romantic interests for men br br o'toole is riveting whenever he speaks unfortunately he spends much of his time peering through shrubbery alastair sims is always a joy to see but he too is terribly underused br br the film has one additional positive aspect in that it depicts many aspects of british fascism and fascist sympathies such as the casual appearance of the mosley graffiti that many people today are unaware of too many of today's films about wwii paint the allies as all good and the axis as all evil when history tells us people are far more complicated than that br br this would be a good movie for when you're recovering from the flu and are bundled on the couch and not able to absorb anything too complex if you just need something to pass the time while your electrolytes stabilize this is the movie for you
<START> you do not get more dark or tragic than othello and this movie captures the play fairly well with outstanding performances by lawrence fishburne and irene jacob fishburne's expresses to the viewer othello's torment as he falls prey to iago's lies very convincingly even providing a realistic epileptic episode jacob is the loving and loyal wife who becomes either the instrument of iago's revenge against othello or the object of his wrath it is not clear which since no motive for iago's behavior is offered although kenneth brannagh sp displays his usual talent for shakespeare in this movie he is somewhat marginalized the characters of cassio and emilia also wander in and out of scenes even though they like iago seem more crucial to the plot i have not checked the movie against the play to see how many lines were cut out but i know that shakespeare tends to develop his characters even the seemingly unimportant ones very well br br if i had any criticism of the movie it would be that the story unfolds too quickly and that the relationships between some of the characters are not laid out more the director had a great cast and no one offered a bad performance the relationship between cassio and othello and that between emilia and desdemona need to be further developed earlier in the film i have a feeling that they were closer to each other than the movie suggests although you get a sense of this very late into the movie also othello and desdemona need more time together although their anguish is convincing the amount of interaction they have with each other makes it seem like they just met on the other hand maybe the did just meet like romeo and juliet br br in brief good performances too short br br
<START> what was the worst movie of 2003 cat in the hat gigli mais non i propose that it was this atrocious little film from earlier in the year badly written badly edited and if i may be so bold badly acted the order is the black hole of film a movie so dense not even the slightest bit of entertainment could escape from its event horizon of suck it isn't even accidentally funny like for example showgirls br br you know that the producers are assuming that their audience isn't going to be very smart they renamed the movie originally titled the sin eaters because they figured americans were too stupid to understand what a sin eater was even though they go to great lengths to explain what a sin eater is in the movie instead they figure an utterly generic title and a picture of heath ledger looking sullen are more than enough to get you in there br br and hey what do you know they were right my ex girlfriend saw the picture of heath and dragged me in congratulations producers you've met your target market she also liked grease ii so you're in good company br br back on topic heath plays a catholic monk from a specific you guessed it order that is trying to investigate the murder of his mentor he has celibacy issues possibly because nobody in their right mind would believe that he knew the slightest thing about religion much less be a celibate monk the only other member of this order is a funny alcoholic fat guy as much as i've wanted to see the return of the funny alcoholic to the big screen his attempts at humor reminded me of all the dorks in my high school who did imitations of monty python thinking that if they just said the lines like the pythons did they would automatically be funny you know the sort of people i'm talking about br br if i utter any more i would be in danger of generating spoilers frankly the thing that spoiled this movie for me was the fact that it was created
<START> well where to start here straightheads presents me with a bit of a dilemma had this film come out of italy in say 1975 been directed by ruggero deodatto and starred david hess then i'd be lapping it up faster than labrador drinks water on a summer's day because whilst tarantino and rodriguez are busy elsewhere with their homage to grindhouse cinema dan reed has produced a rape revenge grindhouse picture of his very own in england and on seemingly the same budget as it would have taken rodriguez to turn rose mcgowan's leg into a machine gun because if you want to play grindhouse bingo then let me call out the 'numbers' br br 1 rich high flying career woman meets a bit of rough from the wrong side of the tracks in an implausible manner and equally implausibly gets the hots for him check br br 2 gratuitous shots of said high flying career woman in various states of nudity check br br 3 convoluted and highly unlikely plot development that sets up characters that exist solely to do what they do and who cannot be imagined to have any existence outside the scenes they are in check br br 4 unnecessarily graphic rape scene perpetrated by a gang of males with no discernible depth of personality or background other than they are there to rape check br br 5 gritty and bloody scenes of murder and revenge to round it all off bingo br br plotwise straightheads is pretty basic stuff dyer meets anderson and she invites him to a party at a country pile owned by her boss on the way home they upset three locals in a landover who take their revenge by giving dyer a good shoeing and gang raping anderson the couple then set about getting their revenge so far so straw dogs late night trains house on the edge of the park i spit on your grave etc etc so why didn't i think much of this film a number of reasons i suppose first off having the likes of gillian anderson in the cast prima facie lead me to expect better but it's the complete lack of honesty here than rankles most br br because whenever anyone sits down to watch hess and his ilk terrorising women and murdering their menfolk in those period pieces from the 70's then they always know exactly what they are getting low budget quickies designed solely to shock and appeal to the lowest common denominator the baddies terrorise and murder the goodies the goodies turn the tables on the baddies and kill them back and everyone goes home satisfied their desires to see a bit of nasty violence slaked and safe in the knowledge that the world order had been restored br br as writer and director however dan reed clearly believes straightheads has far more to say on the state of the human psyche than that and desperately tries to imbibe his film with a philosophical depth that is simply not there for instance when anderson and dyer are planning revenge on their attackers they learn that one of the rapists has a fourteen year old daughter who is an object of lust for the two men he hangs around with when anderson finally meets him face to face he confesses that he only raped her as a distraction so that his two mates would take their attention away from his daughter the casual and audacious way that reed drops this little revelation into the plot is simply jaw dropping it's almost as if he expects this simple reference to paedophilia to be enough to throw the audience's moral compass into overdrive and make them leave the cinema thinking they've just sat through something of significance to make sure we 'get it' at this point we are shown a run through of the rape sequence for a second time ostensibly from the view of the attacker and his concern for his daughter but reed ensures that we get plenty more shots of anderson rough handled and raped across the bonnet of her car gratuitous does not enter into it br br after being told his reasons for raping her anderson ties him over a table rams the business end of a sniper rifle complete with bulky silencer just in case anyone wasn't clear on the phallic imagery up his jacksie but lacks the courage to pull the trigger telling dyer who has no such moral qualms that 'it's over' dyer argues otherwise and their moral dilemma is presented as something that wittgenstein and russell may have discussed in their rooms back at cambridge over tea and cakes it is almost unwatchable in its ludicrousness br br in fairness ms anderson acts her guts out throughout the film it's obvious she wants to leave scully far behind and bless her she certainly does that one wonders what mulder would have made of his erstwhile partner squatting down to take a leak at the side of the road and then sodomising a man with a gun dyer on the other hand does what he's done in virtually every film he's made to date that is plays a gor blimey guv cockney type chappie with a roguish grin a cheeky line of patter and a face that most people would never get tired of punching this is particularly true at the closing scene where after murdering his assailants in cold blood dyer gazes at the camera in what i'm sure is meant to be a look of existential anguish that invites us to sympathise at the hand fate has dealt him and the moral quandaries he has had to overcome but instead is far more reminiscent of oliver hardy looking exasperatedly at the camera after stan has landed him in yet another fine mess which incidentally sums up this film quite nicely
<START> this review also contains a spoiler of the first movie so if you haven't seen either movie and want to but don't want the spoilers please don't read this review br br while this movie is supposed to be about christian and kathryn meeting for the first time the movie is a poor copy of the first cruel intentions the actors that they had portray ryan phillippe's christian and sarah michelle gellar's kathryn are very poor substitutes indeed neither can pull off the smarmy snooty rich kid attitude that the original actors did it's absolutely appalling that some of the dialog was verbatim not so much between christian and kathryn but if you listen closely enough you'll recognize it there are also inconsistencies in the plot if this were truly the first meeting of christian and kathryn then why is it that christian fell in love with a girl at the end of the movie he supposedly was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original movie with reese witherspoon's character br br also the tie in with the photography you could be a model comment at the end was totally lame and didn't add anything at all overall this movie was a waste of time i can't believe they made a cruel intentions 3
<START> mr harvey lights a candle is anchored by a brilliant performance by timothy spall br br while we can predict that his titular morose up tight teacher will have some sort of break down or catharsis based on some deep down secret from his past how his emotions are unveiled is surprising spall's range of feelings conveyed is quite moving and more than he usually gets to portray as part of the mike leigh repertory br br while an expected boring school bus trip has only been used for comic purposes such as on the simpsons this central situation of a visit to salisbury cathedral in rhidian brook's script is well contained and structured for dramatic purposes and is almost formally divided into acts br br we're introduced to the urban british range of racially and religiously diverse kids with their uniforms i couldn't tell if this is a private or public school as they gather Â the rapping black kids the serious south asians and muslims the white bullies and mean girls Â but conveyed quite naturally and individually the young actors some of whom i recognized from british tv such as shameless were exuberant in representing the usual range of junior high social pressures celia imrie puts more warmth into the supervisor's role than the martinets she usually has to play br br a break in the trip leads to a transformative crisis for some while others remain amusingly oblivious we think like the teacher portrayed by ben miles of coupling that we will be spoon fed a didactic lesson about religious tolerance but it's much more about faith in people as well as god which is why the bbc showed it in england at easter time and bbc america showed it in the u s over christmas br br nathalie press who was also so good in summer of love has a key role in mr harvey's redemption that could have been played for movie of the week preaching but is touching as they reach out to each other in an unexpected way unfortunately i saw their intense scene interrupted by commercials br br while it is a bit heavy handed in several times pointedly calling this road trip a pilgrimage this quiet film was the best evocation of good will towards men than i've seen in most holiday themed tv movies
<START> interesting fast paced and amusing br br i'm not one of those people who watches loads and loads of television i stumbled across this show while home sick with a bad case of the flu one day and was immediately hooked i developed quite a crush on john burke both he and claire did an amazing job of hosting the show together you could really tell that they both loved their jobs br br the super collector segments were excellent i found myself interested in things i had never previously given a single thought to br br what i would really like to know is whatever happened to jack the dog did one of the hosts adopt him
<START> the movie starts something like a less hyper kinetic more pastiche dead or alive strange underground activities are done while bodies are discovered by police officers but when a police officer is killed one tatsuhito gets involved and when he discovers that his brother shihito is also involved things get bloody quite fast br br an earlier work of miike's shinjuku triad society is still filled with his usual in the ol' ultraviolence and sadistic sex acts though it's not one of his more eclectic or flamboyant pieces rather it's a pretty well crafted bit of pulp fiction as tatsuhito digs his way through the underground a maze that leads him to a gay triad leader who sells illegally gained body organs from taiwan and keeps an almost brothel of young boys one in particular the character who kills the cop at the beginning tatsuhito's brother is getting involved with said society so tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty cop and use similarly violent and sadistic tactics to penetrate into this sordid realm br br what's mainly interesting about this little bit of work is the relationship tatsuhito has with his nemesis wang tatsuhito is a japanese born in china later moved back into japan and alienated for it wang is a chinese who felt alienated in china so killed his father and developed a crime wing in japan wang also is a surprisingly shakespearian character which is weird enough as it is much less that you actually begin to feel sorry for him by the time his ultimate showdown with tatsuhito comes to be and tatsuhito himself is a similarly tragic figure when he's forced to contend with his lack of ability to control his brother while it would be rude to state that miike's movies are successful mostly on their shock value it is true that sometimes it's easy to lose track of how well miike can create bitter dis impassioned characters br br polarisdib
<START> i have not yet seen anyone slate this film and i think i may be the first br br it was awful i actually didn't watch the end of it it was like watching a boring soap or a really good one all soaps are crap the actors were poor and storyline was bad the person who rated it 10 10 has no idea what he is on about the script was awful 2 people was in an angry conversation together involving threats and you expect the good guy to say some thing really good and beat the crap out of him but no he says if you do that i will hurt you hahahahaha if comedy is your thing watch away please do not watch this film because it's crap br br summary poor acting bad fights bad script br br don't watch of course this is in my opinion
<START> just the fact that the cover is a drawing like those old b movies should give you a warning about the quality of this movie this is however not a b movie it is a d movie br br there are no known actors and the animals wow it is the worst data animation ever made during the last two decades br br you hardly ever see the scaaary sabretooth shown on the front cover you just hear people scream bleed and die and you occasionally see a teeth or a tiger paw it's so amateur maybee worth seeing just because it's so bad give it to a friend and say this is the best movie i have ever seen and wait for their reaction he he br br the movie is to weak to give it a spoiler alert this is a spoiler
<START> this is what you would get if you allowed a 10 year old manic american to write a story of a moon trip absolute garbage with no redeeming qualities maybe it held some fascination in the 3d dept but as a narrative and entertaining animation it held nothing to make wasting an hour and a half worth while save your time and money and watch bolt instead br br damn not enough lines yet i feel that sums it up well i agree with an above review this is like a cold war propaganda story maybe it would have been more interesting if they had made it about the flies uncovering the hoax of the moon landing or if the flies had died in the first minute btw why were all the main character flies deformed not one had the full compliment of limbs
<START> just watched this early bugs bunny first time he's named here and elmer fudd cartoon on the thadblog as linked from youtube this was chuck jones' first time directing the wascally wabbit and as a result bugs has a different voice provided by mel blanc than the brooklyn bronx one we're more familiar with in fact according to thad he's channeling jimmy stewart his shy boy type personality of that time anyway after elmer buys his pet bugs goes all obnoxious on him by turning the radio real loud pretending to die after his master repeatedly throws him out of his shower and saying turn off those lights whenever elmer catches him in his bed even with the different voice bugs is definitely his mischievous self and i laughed myself blue the whole time according to thad there was an additional scene at the end of elmer just giving the house to bugs after the hell he went through but that was probably considered too sad since he suffers a mental breakdown at that point so it's just as well that cut scene is lost anyway i highly recommend elmer's pet rabbit
<START> many neglect that this isn't just a classic due to the fact that it's the first 3d game or even the first shoot 'em up it's also one of the first stealth games one of the only and definitely the first truly claustrophobic games and just a pretty well rounded gaming experience in general with graphics that are terribly dated today the game thrusts you into the role of b j don't even think i'm going to attempt spelling his last name an american p o w caught in an underground bunker you fight and search your way through tunnels in order to achieve different objectives for the six episodes but let's face it most of them are just an excuse to hand you a weapon surround you with nazis and send you out to waste one of the nazi leaders the graphics are as i mentioned before quite dated and very simple the least detailed of basically any 3d game released by a professional team of creators if you can get over that however and some would suggest that this simplicity only adds to the effect the game has on you then you've got one heck of a good shooter sneaking game the game play consists of searching for keys health and ammo blasting enemies aforementioned nazis and a boss enemy per chapter of varying difficulty which of course grows as you move further in the game unlocking doors and looking for secret rooms there is a bonus count after each level is beaten it goes by how fast you were basically if you beat the 'par time' which is the time it took a tester to go through the same level this can be quite fun to try and beat and with how difficult the levels are to find your way in they are even challenging after many play throughs how much nazi gold treasure you collected and how many bad guys you killed basically if you got 100 of any of aforementioned you get a bonus helping you reach the coveted high score placings the game mostly but not always allows for two contrastingly different methods of playing stealthily or gunning down anything and everything you see you can either run or walk and amongst your weapons is also a knife running is heard instantly the moment you enter the same room as the guard as is gunshots many guards are found standing with their backs turned to you meaning that you can walk up behind them and stab them nearly silently in your inventory you can get no less than four weapons and two keys more about the weapons later the keys unlock certain doors most doors in the game aren't locked only two kinds need keys and these keys are only introduced in later levels you restart in levels resetting weaponry health score and lives in each chapter much of the later game is spent looking for them now as i just alluded to this game like many of the period late 80's early 90's is based on collecting extra lives personally i think it's completely and utterly useless it was mercifully dropped from here on end i think from the next 3d shooter and onwards since you can save anytime you want and 'using a life' resets weaponry health and ammo like starting on a new chapter which is a real pain in later levels where you need heavier artillery now i shall beat around the bush no longer moving on to the guns you start with aforementioned knife which is silent but only effective up close and a pistol nothing special but good for conserving ammo unlike the next two bad boys your third weapon is a german smg a sub machine gun it's faster and automatic and some later enemies use it and the last one is nothing short of a gatling gun oh yeah think t2 think predator think about unloading massive amounts of lead into nazi fiends with such a gun it's every bit as entertaining as it sounds most of the boss enemies use this though so be prepared i won't reveal the identities of these boss enemies however that's for each player to discover for him or her self the sound is excellent very crisp and realistic as you hear the tear of a machine gun firing the deafening metallic clank of a door slamming shut behind you or a nazi yelling surprised or a warning in german you truly feel like you are there trapped in these dark and depressing bunker systems that segues me nicely into the level design as you run through seemingly countless nearly identical hallways towards the next elevator leading you further you are grasped by the claustrophobic mood i almost got motion sickness more than once though that might also have something to do with little sleep lots of humidity and unusual warmth from playing though the level of detail isn't terribly high what there is is great remains of victims guards' quarters and countless nazi symbols the list goes on the game also features quite a bit of gore for it's limited graphics engine john romero and crew certainly put in all the blood and guts that they could for the game what is there left to say the first of its kind and it's no wonder this spawned countless others 3d shooters sure weapon bobbing and different height levels stairs and such didn't come around until the next entry into the genre doom and it was duke nukem 3d that introduced the feature of switching your view so it goes beyond simply left and right adding vertical dimensions to it and jumping didn't come around until a third later title the first quake possibly fellow gamers help me out here but all of those games as well as the rest of the genre owe their existence to this one so load up the luger open the door to enter the bunker and step into b j 's shoes he deserves the recognition even or maybe even especially nearly fifteen years after he first appeared i recommended this to all fans of 3d games 8 10
