<START> just saw this movie on tv and i have to admit i was a bit surprised it was even on there were so many goofs mess ups and bad editing that an old episode of sesame street would have been better to watch the acting was ok but please you can really feel the straight to video feeling the cast crew made this movie a bad melodrama yes there is a message in the movie but just wait until ten minutes before the ending to hear it trust me you wouldn't even tell the difference
<START> frank capra's creativity must have been just about spent by the time he made this film while it has a few charming moments and many wonderful performers capra's outright recycling of not just the script but considerable footage from his first version of this story broadway bill 1934 is downright shoddy it is understandable that he would re use footage from the climactic horse race which is thrilling but he uses entire dialogue scenes with minor actors then brings back those actors and apparently expects us not to notice for example that ward bond is 14 years older unless you want to see one of the last appearances of oliver hardy skip this one and watch broadway bill instead
<START> criminals perry smith and richard dick hickock believe mr clutter of holcomb kansas keeps a large supply of cash on hand in a safe on november 15 1959 at two a m they end up murdering mr and mrs clutter and their teenage son and daughter after a little police investigation the two men are found and sentenced to be hanged in cold blood 1967 is directed by richard brooks now i haven't read the truman capote novel this movie is based on so i can't make any comparisons the movie does a brilliant job telling of those horrific events that actually took place robert blake is excellent as perry of course blake had the murder case of his own a few years back being accused of murdering his wife he's free now but we still don't know the truth what ever that may be he's still a very fine actor scott wilson does remarkable job as hickock john forsythe is terrific as alvin dewey paul stewart is very good as jensen jeff corey is marvelous as mr hickock same thing with charles mcgraw who plays tex smith john mcliam portrays herbert clutter ruth storey is his wife bonnie brenda currin is the daughter nancy and paul hough is the son kenyon great job by each of them there is much to remember from this film let's start from the lighter side it's pretty great when perry wants to go hunting for gold in mexico and says to hickock remember bogart in treasure of the sierra madre and blake himself was in that movie as a boy and it's a fun moment when they giving a ride to that boy and his granddad collect bottles and turn them in for refund money those darker moments are the most haunting ones the flashback sequence where you see the murders happening is extremely terrifying when perry goes to kill the girl nancy last and she says oh please don't the brutality of man it's impossible to explain then the hanging scene first there goes hickock and then perry first talking to the minister in the last image of the movie we see perry hitting the end of the rope sure movies and books may try to sympathize these villains especially perry's character is someone you could feel sorry for he thinks of his mom and dad who he hates but still loves but it doesn't change the fact both of these men these actors portray are brutal murderers who don't feel sorry for anybody they go to this house and murder an entire family in cold blood how could you sympathize these people
<START> i truly enjoyed this film the acting was terrific as was the plot jeff combs has more talent than he is recognized for the only part of this flick i would change was the ending the death of the creature was far too gruesome for the sci fi channel br br there were some interesting religious messages in this film jeff combs obviously played a messiah figure and the creature or shark if you prefer represented the anti chirst there were some particularly frightening scenes that had that 'end of the world feel' i only noticed this after my third viewing of this classic creature feature i know many people won't get the references to christianity but if you watch close you'll get it
<START> i rented this film on netflix after it won all the oscars to see if it was really that good br br the hurt locker is a very realistic portrayal for the most part of a group of soldier's rotation in iraq the film centers around will james a reckless soldier who gets his adrenaline fix from taking risks and defusing bombs br br where this film seems to lack in my opinion is the plot and direction of the movie this film has no clear plot unlike other films such as black hawk down what this film tries to do is focus more on the characters and their different attitudes about the war bigelow does an okay job of focusing on the characters but there are many points in the film where the dialogue seems to drag hurt locker is 131 minutes long yet it feels like a 3 hour movie br br one scene in the movie that was particularly awful and ruined the films perfect credibility was the sniping scene halfway through the movie it was both unrealistic and very long br br overall i thought this film was okay but the reason i gave it a 6 instead of a 7 was because it was a major letdown for winning best picture at the oscars i felt like this film could have been so much better considering saving private ryan lost best picture but was much better than this film another notable mention is black hawk down which only won 2 oscars i honestly do not know how this won best picture br br if you are looking for an action packed war flick rent black hawk down this film will be forgotten in a year or two
<START> after a fairly lengthy partially pixelated nude shower scene we're off to the races for this blair witch project esquire horror film about three girlfriends venturing to a desolate cabin deep in the woods to get away from their hectic lives for a girls' weekend out and smoke pot they meet two guys who seem friendly enough so they drink and tell ghost stories until late in the movie some of them get picked off br br this is a fairly slow movie with needlessly drawn out 'suspense' scenes the bad acting can't carry the myriad of scenes where nothing happens but mindless banter and the movie as a whole is a dud a deathly boring dud at that nothing at all happens until the last half hour and when it did i was to numb to really care br br eye candy ashley totin shows t a evy lutzky gets topless briefly and jennifer hart shows her right tit br br my grade d
<START> it is a great movie if you have ever named your cars or are really into old fast or exotic cars it has a plot and a lot of action the car scenes are great except for the totally fake car jump scene all of the other scenes are great i really enjoyed it and i hope everyone else does as well
<START> believe it or not inspector gadget's last case is what got me hooked on the whole gadget thing br br my name is miriam and i am twelve years old so obviously i wasn't around when inspector gadget was at the top of his career sure i'd heard of him but i didn't really know him br br while reading note that i never saw the original series i would if it came on this is just about the only gadget thing i've ever watched even though i am now obsessed and i will be focusing on what i liked about it since everyone else is so negative for all you pessimists i've got some cons down there too p first off for a childish sense of humor you could deem this movie pretty funny i thought it was so sue me i also thought the animation and character designs were good and i'm also happy there was more gadget in it since he's my favorite character i do not like penny then there was claw his voice was awful though and the madcat i thought they were done fairly good too gadget's idiocy seemed pretty well in place if not a bit exaggerated i e sucking his hat hand thing's thumb would make a good screen shot though p oh and i liked the song that ran in the credits yes i am strange br br and like all movies there are some negatives too br br talking cars what's up with that you can tell this was aimed at younger boys that wouldn't bother me quite so much if there wasn't the fact that the cars basically saved the day i would have much preferred if penny and brain had taken their place and apparently gadget loved his car more than would be called natural a bit weird to say the least br br oh and the chief was downright mean to gadget i mean sheesh yeah he wasn't always the most cheerful of people but he didn't hate gadget from what i've read like the inspector his personality was exaggerated br br well that's pretty much all i have to say about this movie i thought the animation made up for the car centered plot and that it was overall pretty decent more so than the live action gadget films butchered butchered butchered at least maybe i'm just biased because this is what got me into gadget in the first place or maybe my mind is twisted or maybe i'm just odd but i really liked this movie even if i'm the oldest it's recommended for

<START> i think this cartoon is one of the worst cartoons i have ever watched i would recommend this cartoon to people who are under 5 i did used to like this show when i was 4 and 5 i still only watched it when there was nothing on now i am other 5 and i would rather do my homework than watch it the cartoon used to be a bit funny but they were not enough to make me burst out laughing now i am older i am interested in show witch are not rated us i have started to watch doctor who 12a torchwood 15 and sarah jane adventures pg i am interested in things to do with doctor who so i am not interested in 5 year old cartoons this cartoon didn't last very long it only had 6 seasons it got cancelled because of it was low on viewers but some people say it was because the writers ran out of ideas but for most other shows they have at least 8 seasons
<START> this is a movie which attempts a retelling of thai history set in the ancient city of ayutthaya i decided to watch this film because i thought it was along the lines of many thai films i've watched and enjoyed one that has thai actors speaking thai and martial arts craziness well it's none of that this film is shot entirely in english is chock full of anglo actors and has production values so terrible it is laughably bad but not funny who can we blame for this rubbish the acting dialog and most of the sets were quite bad some of the fight scenes looked like they were choreographed by the local high school drama club the special effects were also mostly bad but a few were just cheap animation patched onto the screen that provided an especially cheesy effect it has one large epic style outdoor battle scene where a few thousand extras get to run across a field in costume but when we see the two armies collide in combat ha what a joke the film does feature a couple of beauties what a pity they didn't show a little more skin at least that would have been something for the guys to appreciate don't bother
<START> i'm studying catalan and was delighted to find el mar a movie with mostly catalan dialogue at my art house video store br br hmmm not so delighted to have seen it br br yes as other reviewers have said it's well made and beautifully photographed although the opening sequence of the children is shockingly violent it's well acted and convincing for the most part that is would the mallorquins strip a corpse in preparation for burial right in the middle of the town square in full view of the dead man's 10 year old boy oh well minor detail up to this point it had something of the feel of a non magical pan's labyrinth also set in the spanish civil war br br fast forward and the three children who survived the opening incident have come of age francisca is a nun working at a tuberculosis sanatorium and the two boys manuel and ramallo both are patients i know but hey coincidences happen br br the problem as with so many spanish movies apologies to almodovar fans is that with one exception francisca the characters are just so dang weird their motivations personalities and dialogue are often simply incoherent br br what's more it descends into some horrific wretched excess be prepared for lots of pain and lots of blood the reviewer who called it a potboiler is quite on track if it had been made 40 years ago the poster would've said see forbidden love rape murder mutilation fanaticism animal cruelty betrayal br br the opening sequence is not nearly enough to make the personalities and relationships of the characters believable to work this should have had multiple flashbacks to flesh out the characters as it is it seems a bizarre and depressing cross between brother sun sister moon and pulp fiction if that sounds like something you've got to see by all means enjoy i think i go with something that doesn't make me feel i need to take a shower to wash off the gore and gloom br br as for the catalan it's the mallorqui dialect fairly different than the barcelona dialect though i was surprised by the comment that said that even barcelonans apparently needed catalan subtitles to understand it
<START> what's to like about this movie br br it is in colour br br it has some impressive underwater photography br br it has a rhythmic musical score in the background that works well at times br br so 3 out of 10 br br sometimes the music is speeded up especially when the shark or the baddies are about to move in br br sometimes it is slowed as if to convey to the audience it's about to be time for sympathy br br as another one bites the dust as if in a spagetti western this has much similarity to br br it's not that the italians can't produce quality productions there was a series of tv movies with a heading like octopus numbered about 1 to 7 screened on sbs tv in australia in the 1990s about mafia type conflicts and they were excellent but alas you won't find it here br br i assumed it was made about 1960s sadly it was 20 years out of date as evidenced by a funeral scene near the end br br then there was the razor sharp bite of the speedy shark that makes for a red dust repeatedly emerging in the bluish waters br br amidst it all either in bar room brawl or in observing the latest sea side bloody demolition by the relentlessly hungry shark the mate of the hero looks on through his glasses of little concern as if he too was bored in his relentless role amidst a lack of much evidence of plot or anyone's character development br br at least the hero indicates a fleeting concern belatedly for his ex wife br br but of course even if the music fails to awaken our realisation we have the sinister sound in the baddies' voices as if to nudge us that another dark deed is about to emerge br br and near the end someone thought of a twist just when we thought it was all totally predictable but stay tuned folks for you may find another twist if you are watching closely to more or less warm your heart br br follow the advice of the hero and have a few beers along the way it'll make your viewing of night of the sharks more enjoyable br br then you'll be ready for something like a 007 movie to ease your way back into reality when this is over
<START> br br the main question i pose concerning this film is how do you film a cole porter musical and only use 3 of his 15 songs merman and lahr played the lead roles on broadway here they are replaced by the weaker red skelton and lucille ball plot changes abound and the fun is lost br br skip it
<START> revolution is a terrible movie i don't care if you're a history teacher news writer al pacino fan there's no way this movie can possibly earn a legitimate '10' br br the key point to the plot is tom dobb al trying to get money from a note he got for radical patriots taking his boat everything revolves around that note tom's son joins the army to make up for the note making tom join the army as well they go on an adventure trying to get out of the army years later the war is over and they can finally turn in the note for their boat the end br br it had a few battle scenes and they were pretty mediocre at best transistions between scenes used five months later and magically put the characters in some famous historical battle the love story is a joke and the movie as a whole is just hard to follow so save your notes and watch the patriot instead
<START> this was directed by ruggero deodato a true icon to many horror film fans after he directed the seminal and notorious cannibal holocaust however don't expect to find any such notoriety in the film reviewed here as it proves to be incredibly tame in comparison and plays more like a conan inspired outing for a young audience br br such a description may instantly put off most fans of the whole conan inspired sword sorcery genre but before you turn your nose up at this it has to be said this movie is just so much fun br br it's mostly played for laughs and features two huge and highly likable heroes in the form of david and peter paul aka the barbarian brothers who both seem to be having a ball with their characters br br b movie favourite richard lynch turns up as the main villain in the piece and it's also great to see roles for big george eastman and michael berryman br br added to this the ladies are stunning to behold and suitably scantily attired throughout the films duration a staple and much welcomed ingredient in the genre br br what can i say this simply is a really fun and lighthearted take on the genre and i recommend it wholeheartedly
<START> after life is a miracle i did not expect much it's hard to believe that these films were made by the same man as do you remember dolly bell for instance zavet is two hours of silly antics with no story the wild and unbridled humor of underground seems to have degenerated into pathetic buffoonery here it appears that kusturica has been going steadily downhill since he started making life affirming comedies beginning with black cat white cat which i think was great but already had some disturbing signs of dementia i liked his early films so much and this is why it's especially disappointing to see something like this let's hope his next one will be great
<START> i decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site i would have to say it was worth the effort however you should take heed that this film will go on for 210 minutes if you don't have the staying power get it on tape and watch it over a couple of nights br br now to the film what i say will contain spoilers and if you don't mind here goes br br alexandre is a promiscuous bum a womanizer and a gigolo he lives with an older woman called marie marie owns a retail shop and she provides for alex alex spends his days at cafÃ©s and restaurants the story reveals that alex had previously impregnated gilberte whom he used to live with gilberte dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not love because alex had abused and battered her at this point alex was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else br br by chance alexandre meets a nurse nymph called veronika and they striked up a relationship veronika fell in love with alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past marie and veronika struggles for alex's affection and had a mÃ©nage Ã  trois to boot finally at the end it's revealed veronika is pregnant with alex's child and alex asked her to marry him we assume as aforesaid with gilberte's situation alexandre will even get a job and be the provider for his new found love and family there is hope br br with the title of la maman et la putain i deduce jean eustache was relating to franÃ§oise lebrun's character of veronika she was a whore and then she became the mother hence the mother and whore is the same person anyway what do i know french films are mostly not all very chatty aimlessly political preaching theatrical insipid lamenting and full of quotes lebrun and lÃ©aud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed br br not a bad effort 7 10
<START> icy and lethal ace hit man tony arzenta a divinely smooth and commanding performance by alain delon wants to quit the assassination business but the dangerous mobsters he works for won't let him after his wife and child are killed arzenta declares open season on everyone responsible for their deaths director duccio tessari relates the absorbing story at a constant snappy pace maintains a properly serious and no nonsense tone throughout stages the stirring shoot outs and exciting car chases with considerable rip snorting brio and punctuates the narrative with jolting outbursts of explosive bloody violence delon's suave and charismatic presence adds extra class to the already engrossing proceedings this film further benefits from sterling acting by a bang up cast with praiseworthy contributions by richard conte as wise mafia kingpin nick gusto carla gravini as arzenta's supportive lady friend sandra marc porel as arzenta's loyal pal domenico maggio anton diffring as ruthless calculating capo grunwald and lino troisi as the venomous gangster rocco cutitta silvano ippoliti's glossy cinematography boasts several graceful pans gianni ferrio's funky score hits the get down groovy spot erika blanc and rosalba neri pop up briefly in nifty bit parts better still there's no filler to speak of and we even get a decent dab of tasty gratuitous female nudity the startling conclusion packs a mean and lingering wallop right to the gut a solid and satisfying winner
<START> wow this one sucks i'm gonna sum it up as quickly as possible Â  br br a count invites 4 naive sluts back to his castle a bunch of nothing happens for a long time some lame and un erotic soft core sex scenes happen some girls get their heads cut off off screen the end br br the only things going for this one are the decent looking sets and costumes some bad dubbing which leads to some unintentionally funny dialogue and a few brief nudie shots and believe me those things are not enough to redeem the 90 minutes of tedium that this film is in fact the best part is the tacked on beginning from the distributor that features some slutty goth chicks covered in blood and showing their tits and again this is definitely not worth the price of admission for this garbage as everyone else has noted the title of the film is completely nonsensical as there's absolutely no bloodsucking nor dancing of any sort in the film at all it may as well have been called 'the goat raper leads the circle jerk' and at least then it would have had a better title that also pertains to nothing in the film an accurate title would have been '90 minutes of torture' another alluring title that would have at least been truthful for the viewer honestly the trailer that's on the disc shows all the best parts and i use the term 'best' extremely loosely so i highly suggest watching that instead if you're still curious Â i can't imagine anyone liking this wreck of a film please take my advice and leave this one on the shelf 2 10Â
