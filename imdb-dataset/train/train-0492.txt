<START> this movie was very good if you are one who likes to watch horror movies i recommend it the acting was very good although i thought that the actress playing julie could have had more emotion behind her lines allan was very good and i thought the cinematography was amazing i was on the edge of my seat the entire time while my friends were freaking out and screaming it was a complete success in my opinion and should have made it to the big screen i give it two thumbs up i definitely would say that if you haven't already seen it then go rent it if you have seen it and didn't like it go and watch it again because there are parts that were completely unreal i also liked how a lot of the movie was filmed around and on my school's campus
<START> read my lips tells of a strange symbiosis which develops between a plain socially maladroit female office worker devos and her workplace trainee a crude excon casel as the film fleshes out this unlikely duo down to their ids they become embroiled in a chilling merging of the minds each using the other for their own selfish reasons with an extraordinary outcome good stuff for anyone into character driven films with strong psychodramatic undercurrents in french with easy to read subtitles and good translation b
<START> i was very displeased with this move everything was terrible from the start the comedy was unhumorous the action overdone the songs unmelodious even the storyline was weightless from a writer who has written successful scripts like guru and dhoom i had high expectations the actors worked way too hard and did not help the film at all of course kareena rocked the screen in a bikini but for two seconds i think hindi stunt directors should research how action movies are done they tend to exaggerate way too much in chinese films this style works because that is their signature piece but hindi cinema's signature are the songs a good action movie should last no more than two hours and cannot look unrealistic but in the future i'm sure these action movies will get much sharper also to be noted comedy and action films do not mix unless done properly good luck next time
<START> i always enjoyed watching this when it came on television during prime time every year in the 60's it's a typical hollywood history epic dramatized stylized and full of inaccuracies but so what it's an entertaining movie and a good looking film cecil b demille at the end of his life is the executive producer of this remake of his 1938 film his son in law actor anthony quinn who had the supporting role of beluche in the '38 film is the director in his directorial debut and swan song as he had never directed a film before and never would again demille assembled a crew who had recently worked on his 10 commandments to help quinn pull it off including longtime demille associate producer actor henry wilcoxon overseeing the project also from the 10 commandments are screenwriter jesse lasky cinematographer loyalk griggs assistant director francisco day 2nd unit director arthur rosson art directors walter tyler and hal pereira set directors sam comer and ray moyer costume designers edith head john jensen and ralph lester who as a costume design team received the buccaneer's only oscar nomination a great cast here from team demille headed up by yul brynner as pirate jean lafitte and charleton heston as future president general andrew jackson also in the cast are charles boyer e g marshall lorne greene claire bloom and inger stevens at just over two hours it drags in some spots but makes up for it with some excellent battle scenes i would give it a 7 5 out of 10
<START> gee what a crappy movie this was i cannot understand what people find so scary about the grudge the director plays one trick i'd have to admit a very good one that is brought to life very stylized and then he repeats it for the rest of the movie over and over again as a consequence i startled a few times in the first quarter of the movie but once i knew the drill i practically fell asleep as the grudge grew more and more predictable by the minute to conclude i can say that there are a lot better movies in the genre to begin with that the so called predecessor the ring was way scarier and that buying a ticket for the grudge is a waste of money
<START> i wanted to like this movie but many elements ruined it for me the use of a fisheye lens throughout and choppy editing did not give me a sense of being in the world of the meth head but it did make me think i was watching mtv for a few short moments the movie never did seem to go anywhere and the acting was truly an excellent example of over acting i love movies that give us a glimpse into the seedy underworld but this film couldn't decide if it was a bad horror film or an even worse serious commentary on the horrors of addiction
<START> enjoyed this 1936 film with plenty of veteran classic actors and especially william powell dr lawrence bradford mister roberts who played the role as a doctor and detective dr bradford was once married to jean arthur paula bradford shane and got a divorce and still they managed to live with each other and also fight all the time paula wanted her husband to investigate a homicide and did everything she could to convince him it was very important jean arthur plays a rather nutty type and there is plenty of 1936 comedy and the method of murder is something you will never believe especially with a jockey on a california race track robert armstrong nick martel king kong gave a great supporting role as a bookie along with james gleason a detective who need the help of dr bradford in order to solve this very strange murder mystery if you see this film just remember it was produced and directed in 1936 and the people in the audience in those days thought this was great entertainment and it really was in those days
<START> doghi is a wonderful movie and renuka daftardar is excellent so is uttara baokar who is usually excellent in most of her roles along with kairee its an example of marathi cinema at its best there are certain parts in both movies that tend to the didactic it would have probably enhanced the movie to not have the few scenes where the social message is hammered in these scenes probably emerge from the film maker's political concerns but the movie is realistic and moving enough to not need it but apart from such minor quibbles its a movie that deserves to be seen more and one i strongly recommend sumitra bhave's concern and humanism shines through
<START> this is by far my most favourite movie in the world i enjoyed it when i was 4 and i still enjoy it at 16 its an absolute masterpiece no video collection is complete without it i enjoy every second of it and not only does the film have some great special affects but its sends a great message to the youngsters of the audience which may sound sheesy but in actual fact the movie is done very cooly in actual fact although michael jackson has been in afew movies now people still dont see him as an actor in reality he's the most talented actor i know he's so talented he's incredible moonwalker is a must see
<START> i rented this by mistake i thought after a cursory examination of the box that this was a time travel sci fi story instead it's a christian story and i suppose is fairly typical example if you are sold on the message you probably will overlook the awkwardness of the plot acting etc but i found it rather painful br br i have to admit that i'm bothered by the rewriting of history in this story it paints the 1890's as some sort of paradise of family values and morality a character is aghast that 5 of marriages end in divorce but it overlooks very unsavory sides of this highly moral society rigid racial sexual and social discrimination were widespread for instance and at one point the hero complains to a clothing store owner about things that sound not all that different than the complaints of some iranian leaders about women's clothing styles as reported in a recent wsj br br overall thought i suppose that it's the sort of thing you'll like if you like this sort of thing and it's certainly wholesome
<START> one hour eight minutes and twelve seconds into this flick and i decided it was pretty lame that was right after hopalong chris lybbert drops on his horse from a tree to rejoin the good guy posse i was pretty mystified by the whole hopalong cassidy great bar 20 gimmick which didn't translate into anything at all obviously the name coppola in the credits couldn't do anything to guarantee success here even with more than one listed br br if you make it to the end of the film you'll probably wind up asking yourself the same questions i did what exactly was the hook with the gloves what's up with the rodeo scenario who was the stranger supposed to represent why did they make this film br br i could probably go on but my energy's been drained look there's already a western called the gunfighter from 1950 with a guy named gregory peck as the title character watching it will make you feel as good as watching this one makes you feel bad that one i can recommend
<START> sean bean is great as are the photography locations and costumes however the plot is somewhat muddled and the conclusion flat the plot has been substantially altered from cornwell's novel and not to the better unfortunately this adventure is much better read than watched sharpe was too narrowly drawn here in contrast with his literary alter ego who seems more intelligent and determined despite his apprehension in his new role as an officer promoted from the ranks i really enjoyed the brief scene in which sharpe is tripped by a real officer and after a quick pause and piercing stare pushes the surprised and cowed officer right back it sets the tone for his later trials as a commanding officer br br rating 4 of 10
<START> it's a weekend i've been watched this funny film and i really like it all the kids are cute who remind me of my own childhood with those stupid thinking it's a real entertaining movie for a group of families at weekend night which could make lots of memories and laughters kid's humor always work nice acting as well simple story but cool shooting nice job for directer to find the kid's way when it comes to the kid movie i think of 12 and holding another one this year but differed aspect to the kid's world which is real and cruel awesome work h2efw focuses on the happy side of childhood which every kid and family need p s twitch i think is the voice of nemo from finding nemo
<START> stephane rideau was already a star for his tour de force in wild reeds and he is one of france's biggest indie stars in this film he plays cedric a local boy who meets vacationing mathieu newcomer jamie elkaim in a stunning nuanced ethereal performance at the beach mathieu has a complex relationship with his ill mother demanding aunt and sister with whom he has a competitive relationship soon the two are falling in love br br the film's fractured narrative which is comprised of lengthy flash backs bits and pieces of the present and real time forward movement into the future is a little daunting director sebastien lifshitz doesn't signal which time period we are in and the story line can be difficult to follow but stick it out the film's final 45 minutes are so engrossing that you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen by turns heart breaking and uplifting this film ranks with beautiful thing as must see cinema
<START> this films makes no pretentious efforts to hide its true genre a campy b movie it will flat out tell you in the beginning the definition of campy it should have also given the adjective meaning of cheese but the two come together in this film in ways that make you go hmmmmm that's so stupid and then have you laughing for example there is a scene back in 16th century japan which shows a couple of samurai walking in the foreground of a temple in the background of the temple there are several tourists looking off in the distance in slippers and shorts hmmmm hahahah i could not stop laughing and the acting goes from decent to bearable to oh my lord but that's what makes it funny you'll see some decent actors and then find others really terrible i have to digress somewhat though because i have seen stephanie sanchez in several plays and she is awesome her air time in the film was pretty short though i have also seen bryan yamasaki in several plays in the islands during my visits and he's also better in theatre than in this movie anyhow it's an entertaining film if you've got nothing to do on a weekday evening
<START> i watched this movie also and altho it is very well done i found it a heartbreaker and would not recommend this to women who have small children the terror on this mother's face when she sees her child about to be run over by a train is truly heartbreaking and the sad thing is internally she dies eventually she goes back to the applacian mountains all the money in the world which she makes from making dolls does not conceal the grief she has i remember her desperate face as she pulls money out of her clothes to try to have her child healed i'm surprised this movie takes place in detroit because when i watched it i thought for sure the people had come to cincinnati ohio this also was a route for the poor from the mountains
<START> first off i never considered myself an uwe boll hater since i think i never even saw one of his movies but after seeing this cheap excuse for a movie named seed which is the name of the serial killer this movie is about i am close to joining the hate club this movie makes absolutely no sense at all the plot is a joke and although boll clearly tries to get attention by shocking people 90 of this movie is just plain boredom you can sum up this movie like this br br 1 hooded killer watches clips of animals getting tortured on tv this is real life footage from pelt farms and the movie opens with the ridiculous reason of making a statement about humanity and giving a peta address since this movie has no message at all and is the worst piece of torture porn exploitation you already have a reason to hate the movie from the beginning onward br br 2 death by electrocution with a pretext that gives away what happens later in this movie printed on screen so every retard gets it br br 3 cops watch videos of animals babies and women starved to death and decomposing in seeds basement having stupid nightmares and crying into their whiskey because seed is such an evil bad mofo although the acting is ok the movie takes a dive every time it tries to incorporate any emotions br br 4 cops bust seed in his house act stupid and get slashed in the dark this sequence reminds me of a video game you barely see anything except flashlights seed is a super killer that is everywhere at once and all cops act stupid enough to be killed except for one who busts him br br 5 seed gets the chair and we see his electrocution as lengthy as everything else in this movie he won't die and we are reminded of the opening statement that he must be set free if he survives 3 electric jolts guess what they just bury him alive to solve the problem br br 6 seed comes out of his grave kills everyone off in another slashing part and then seeks the main cop to take revenge on br br 7 a woman gets her head bashed in with a hammer in an endless sequence from one point of view just for the fun and shock value of it br br 8 seed captures the cops family lures him to his house threatens to kill his wife and daughter after killing his wife with a nail gun the cop shoots himself in the head considering thats whats seed wants its hard to get into that guys head since he not just wears his mask even in prison but also never utters a word the movie has barely any dialog anyway so don't mind br br 9 boll goes for a nihilistic shocker end where seed locks the daughter in with her dead dad to rot like the persons we saw on video on sequence 3 br br this is it no message no plot no reason no face behind the mask no background except a stupid story that seed was burnt as a child br br this movie relies purely on few key scenes and their shock value i hardly remember a movie this empty of any emotion or message or entertainment its like watching august underground thats fine with me some people will enjoy this brainless snuff but what is really hard to stand about it is the pseudo message in the beginning and the fact that the movie is well made considering camera work effects and even the acting is too good for this waste of celluloid br br so how does boll get money to make such movies when thousands of talented directors work on shoestring budgets seed is not just the essence of ridiculous its living proof that the free market is flawed lucky uwe that the german taxpayer is paying for a lot of this waste to get deductments
<START> a hard to find film which coasts on the still pervasive mythology of senator joe mccarthy as a political demon king boyle as joe gives a compelling but historically inaccurate portrayal of the wisconsin senator the caricature mccarthy many take as the real one meredith as wily army lawyer joseph welch who outsmarted mccarthy at the army hearings in 1954 is very good as always br br in fact mccarthy and cohn were quite right in worrying about the appalling security situation in the army and the 1954 army hearings became enmeshed in the smokescreen used by the army to deflect the investigation away from their security failings which the committee were investigating by counter charging that mccarthy and cohn were trying to get favours for their staffer david schine whilst in the service br br the film is self satisfied agenda driven polemic based in the pervasive myths which have passed for the truth with many people for decades that the red scare was essentially phony and mccarthy huac etc were always blasting away at the wrong targets being no more than lying career ruining publicity hounds who were trampling over the constitutional rights of startled innocent liberals who were accused of being security risks communists br br people who know little about the matter still feel confident in repeating misinformation on mccarthy and the red scare to this day clooney's murrow hagiography is an example the misinformation is pervasive no wonder people have swallowed it a recent obit of budd schulberg in the serious left wing uk newspaper the guardian headlined that the hollywood writer named names to mccarthy perpetuating the lie that mccarthy investigated hollywood as head of huac the truth being that mccarthy was never even a member of huac and he had little interest in the politics of hollywood types his investigations were confined almost exclusively to arms of the us government br br the mythology about the red scare being baseless is now completely exploded by recently opened soviet and us government documents if anything mccarthy and co underestimated the sheer scale of soviet and fellow traveller infiltration in the us but decades of public misinformation about this period will be hard to correct br br one day maybe some really brave hollywood soul will make a movie telling the truth about how many american men and women clandestinely aided the mass murderer stalin and worked to impose his vicious system of government on the western world giving an accurate account maybe of joe mccarthy's career but i won't hold my breath till then we have this mythical drunken lying scoundrel of popular imagination so familiar in the media tail gunner joe
<START> anita and me seems to be little more than an excuse for meera syal the author of the novel and screenplay to air her prejudices grievances and general antipathy towards the english the general sentiment of indian superiority over the english in this film is foul br br the english people in this film are portrayed as overweight violent foul mouthed promiscuous engaging in child neglect stupid uneducated racist ugly eating poor food and dim witted tellingly only by turning to indian culture can the local priest be redeemed at the end of the film br br by contrast the indian family are beautiful clever educated can speak many languages are caring and loving parents and grammar school fodder the film is so insidiously prejudicial that i am astonished the bbc funded it at all had it been the other way round an english family in an indian community depicted this way the film would have been seen as racist br br there were a few moments where my eyebrow shot so far up my forehead i thought it would lodge in my hairline first the gossip scene between the women at the divali celebration undertext the english are dirty and promiscuous and the men undertext english women are prostitutes second the meal with anita where neema's family lie to her about cutlery undertext the english are so stupid you can make them do anything br br but the underlying contempt towards anything english even english weddings are an object of scorn is evident all the way through the film the character of anita was drawn so appallingly almost the fallen woman trope that i finished the film feeling angry br br this is not a bend it like beckham where the humour is focused on loving exaggerations of a community's behaviour and customs from somebody within that community and is a film about two girls from different backgrounds coming together instead anita and me seems to convey that a form of cultural apartheid is inevitable as the english are almost an version of the indian untouchable caste and this is underscored by a thinly veiled series of attacks upon the film's other community the english br br i felt anita and me is a hate filled grievance based piece of work on that basis the bbc should not have funded its production
<START> wow i can't believe people consider this a 'good' movie now i have seen much worse but there are much more romantic funny comedies with john cusack br br this is a mediocre film at best while the acting wasn't terrible but not great for a romantic comedy there was little passion little romance there were many loose ends that don't show up or are not addressed unfortunately the main characters do come off as complete cowards they don't know themselves well enough to realize that they don't love the people they are engaged to how do we know they aren't in love by the utter lack of remorse both characters have for leaving their finances i can think of few things more romantic than the continual escape from commitment that these two show br br the movie doesn't even end with a wedding scene more than likely both will get cold feet and drop each other like hot potatoes once a commitment is nearing this movie is really about two people who can't commit to anything unlike cusack's previous characters who were more than willing to make a deep commitment loyd in say anything martin in grosse pointe blank etc br br the greatest failure of this movie was the complete lack of any twists turns or anything of interest when the movie ended i felt like they had failed to include a climax to the story which basically fits the whole movie boring no suspense about whether the two will end up together no joy when they do no consequences to their actions br br it is sad that people are so blind to the shoddiness of this movie that they simply rebuke any criticism with 'everyone is too cynical ' criticism of this movie is not cynicism simply unbiased examination there are many other better romantic comedies even ones with grace kelly or eva marie saint br br if you think this movie is great try these movies you hearts will explode the princess bride say anything grosse pointe blank high fidelity keeping the faith charade rear window north by northwest or there's something about mary which is a good examination of idealized romance vs today's society
