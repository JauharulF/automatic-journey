<START> it was disgusting and painful what a waste of a cast i swear the audience 1 2 full laughed twice in 90 minutes this is not a lie do not even rent it br br zeta jones was just too mean to be believable br br cusack was ok just ok i felt sorry for him the actor in case people remember this mess br br roberts was the same as she always is charming and sweet but with no purpose the romance with john was completely unbelievable
<START> yaitate japan is a really fun show and i really like it it was shown in our country just recently in hero tv and abs cbn every 5 30 it is about azuma kazuma who is trying to fulfill his dream to make japanese bread that will represent his country he is working in the southern toyo branch of pantasia and he is also helping his friend tsukino azusagawa along with other bakers like kawachi kyousuke and kanmuri shigeru to beat st pierre and take control of pantasia they fight other skillful bakers from many other countries and not only learn to make different kinds of bread but also learn to cook other food it is a really funny and unique anime because they also mimic characters from other anime like naruto detective conan and one piece and famous people from real life it is one of the best works of takashi haschiguchi and is really a must see for people of different ages
<START> ''the sentinel'' is one of the best horror movies already made in the movie's industry i think it is very scary as very few movies actually are alison parker is a model with some fame she dates a lawyer called michael lerman and has as a best friend another model called jennifer everything was great in her life until she decides to live alone for some time and rents a beautiful and old apartment br br the problem are her neighbors who are very very strange suddenly alison starts to have health problems and faints with frequency she also remembers some painful facts about her past that makes her have nightmares or illusions but everything has a reason and it has to do with the new house she is living br br i personally find ''the sentinel'' a very creepy movie and along with ''the exorcist'' they are two of the scariest movies i already watched when we discover that alison's house is only occupied by the priest and herself my blood froze it's also horrible to see that she needs to become blind in the end of the movie in order to be the new sentinel to keep the monsters away from our world
<START> first of all riget is wonderful good comedy and mystery thriller at the same time nice combination of strange 'dogma' style of telling the story together with good music and great actors but unfortunately there's no 'the end' as for me it's unacceptable i was thinking how it will be possible to continue the story without helmer and drusse and i have some idea i think lars should make riget iii a little bit different i'm sure that 3rd part without helmer wouldn't be the same so here's my suggestion mayble little bit stupid maybe not i know that lars likes to experiment so why not to make small experiment with riget3 i think the only solution here is to create puppet driven animation like for example team america by trey parker or even computer 3d animation i know it's not the same as real actors but in principle i believe it could work only this way it's possible to make actors alive again for riget fans this shouldn't be so big difference if the animation will be done in good way average 'watcher' will consider it normal just after first few shots of the movie the most important thing now is the story it's completely understandable that it's not possible to create riget 3 with the actors nowadays so why not to play with animation and look for the possibilities that it gives to you even marketing one great director finishes his trilogy after 10 years using puppet animation just dreams br br i hope to see riget 3 someday or even to see just the script i'm curious how the story ends and as i expect everybody here do br br greets slaj br br ps i'm not talking about the kingdom hospital by stephen king
<START> this movie is a journey through the mind of a screenwriter caught in his own paradoxical philosophy he examines the ever illusive question of 'who am i' and 'what is i ' it's a courageous and thought provoking enterprise there is a shipload of beautiful images dream inspired escher like paradoxes reminiscent of the hand drawing itself or rather erasing itself more and more we follow the writer in his agony over what to say and what to film we see him phoning with his wife who left for peru leaving him to take care of their baby a task he performs with less and less attention until he's so absorbed in his dilemma's that he hardly looks at the child anymore his wife comes back and makes a scene destroys his notes and helping him go over the last treshold until he erases him self interspersed with eye pleasing and i destructing images the story is mainly philosophical it's about the veils of maya the world of illusion the paradox of the movie however is that it needs a lot of talking and thinking to prove that thinking should stop during the more than two hours of provocative beauty and rapid philosophising the movie made me long for silence or a shorter movie if that was the purpose of the maker he succeeded quite well
<START> i have to totally disagree with the other comment concerning this movie the visual effects complement the supernatural themes of the movie and do not detract from the plot furthermore i loved how this move was unlike crouching tiger because this time the sword action had no strings attached and most of the time you can see the action up close br br i think western audiences will be very confused with 2 scenes one of which involves a monk trying to burn himself alive and the other concerning the villagers chanting that it is the end of the world the mentioned scenes are derived from certain interpretations of mahayana buddhist text mahayana buddhism can be found in china korea and japan and the other scene deals with a quirk in the japanese calendar people back then really thought that the world would come to an end gojoe has the action story and visuals to mesmerize any viewer i strongly believe that with some skillful editing it can be sold in the u s my one complaint is in the last fight scene i can't give anything away sorry
<START> does anyone know where or how i can get a copy of this film i've been searching for way too long someone help back in 1997 my girlfriends and i were extras on this long island based film and we actually never got to see it br br i was hoping i could find a copy somehow so i can finally check it out and share it with the girls is there anyone out there who knows where to get a copy of this so i can stop driving myself crazy also it doesn't matter if its in in vhs format i'm still in the ice age myself if you or anyone you know has a copy of this film please help i would be willing to pay for a good copy of it
<START> the matador is a witty dark humored and suspenseful melodrama that rises way above mediocrity thanks to two very engaging and earnest performances from pierce brosnan who has never ever been better than here and the always reliable greg kinnear who has his best role here since playing jack nicholson's gay neighbor in as good as it gets a big plus goes to the writing as well clever and occasionally very nasty dialog is delivered with gusto by brosnan and the slow building friendship between these two different individuals is completely convincing all the way the story takes a few unexpected turns and keeps the viewer constantly guessing where it's gonna go next br br nice artistic touches from the director such as good use of music clever editing and somewhat unorthodox cinematography at times set a nice tone for the film and for a long period of time you don't quite know how to label the film but that's also thanks to a very well written script which keeps the viewer me anyway on the edge of his seat
<START> this film was not only one of john ford's own personal favorites but also numbered directors sergei m eisenstein and bertrand tavernier among its high profile admirers ironically i've just caught up with it myself via criterion's recent 2 disc set after missing out on a couple of original language screenings of it on italian tv many years ago and again a few times on tv while in hollywood br br the film marked ford's first of nine collaborations with henry fonda and is also a quintessential example of ford's folksy americana vein a beautifully made and pictorially quite poetic piece of work the courtroom sequences and eventual revelation in its second half still pack quite a wallop apart from giving stalwart character actor donald meek a memorably meaty role as the prosecuting attorney br br fonda is of course perfectly cast as a bashful inexperienced but rigorous and humanistic lawyer who was destined to become president fonda would go on to portray other fictitious politicians on film most notably in franklin j schaffner's the best man 1964 and sidney lumet's fail safe 1964 and it's surprising now to learn that he was reluctant at the time about accepting the role of lincoln since in his view that was like playing god br br it is interesting to note here that ford had previously tackled abraham lincoln tangentially in the prisoner of shark island 1936 a superb but perhaps little known gem which has luckily just been released as a special edition dvd by the uk's veritable criterion stand in eureka's masters of cinema label besides i also have two more abraham lincoln films in my dvd collection which i've yet to watch and incidentally both were directed by d w griffith the birth of a nation 1915 and abraham lincoln 1930 and had i not just received a bunch of films i've never watched before just now i would have gladly given them a spin based on my highly satisfying viewing experience with young mr lincoln
<START> this movie is about a fictional soap opera it is very fast and funny to say anything else would ruin the movie there are several plots and sub plots in the movie this movie has ensemble cast with today's hottest stars they all gives over the top performances this movie is favorite of mine from the year 1991 soapdish is perfect for fans of either daytime soap opera or prime time soap opera if you watch soap go check this movie it's hilarious
<START> did anyone else notice whenever they are in the car each time the camera takes a new angle they switch roads like in one scene it is a one lane residential with sidewalks next they are on a multiple lane highway with a divider next a two lane country road with double yellow lanes i can understand a low budget but that was just sloppy film work br br i also read the other reviews and disagree that it was a bad movie i think that if you are a fan of paul reiser and his comedy then you may enjoy this movie if however you find his work not funny then i would recommend staying away from this one
<START> i recently found a copy for 5 at a video store and snapped it up eagerly while the music and obviously graphics aren't up to the standards of my favorite of the series beyond the mind's eye i am still entranced by one segment br br stanley and stella in breaking the ice the music is brilliant and the emotions feel real the clip on odyssey's website doesn't have the story nor the music unfortunately
<START> so angela has grown up and gotten therapy and an operation to turn her into a real life daughter rather than the son that she was born and now holds a job as wait for it a camp counselor how appropriate right i know i love it anyway the first sequel to the sleepaway camp franchise obeys all the rules of horror sequels more blood more imaginative killings which aren't imaginative but still more so than the original more nudity a more elaborate plot and generally worse than the original br br it is entertaining in the same way as the original was in that the characters and wardrobes are so goofy and so authentically 80's that you can't help getting a good laugh at one point a guy asks angela out and she says i'll call you and then quickly walks away the guy says to himself how is she gonna call me i don't have a phone and then he sniffs his armpits wondering what turned her off it's the hair dude br br it is a well known fact that in 80s slasher movies the murdered teenagers were more often than not being punished by their killer for some kind of bad behavior usually for being too promiscuous when i first started getting into horror movies and saw the friday the 13th movies for the first time in the mid 90s i didn't realize this i learned it in a film class a year or two later and was amazed that their was some method to the madness i was pretty impressed not only that the movies were passing on some kind of message albeit a morbid one but that there was actually some thought put into it br br but not in this movie at one point just before angela kills one of her victims she says let this be a lesson to you say no to drugs real subtle screen writing there guys then again the dialogue is the most entertaining thing in the movie angela who by the way went through all that therapy and those operations and all that trouble to clean up her past and reinvent herself as a normal and well developed person and then changed her name from angela to umm angela says at one point i don't like being the wicked witch of the west but i know what happens when things get out of control people start getting killed by me ha br br then later she demands that one of the counselors mare make an apology to which the girl replies i'd rather die sorry mare but you really walked into that one br br two years ago i was a camp counselor at a sleepaway camp similar to the one portrayed in this movie except the camp that i taught at had more than three kids to the 15 or 20 counselors and it also had rules which the one in the movie doesn't this made me notice the myriad of discrepancies in the movie from what camp life is really like br br that's okay though you can hardly make a movie like this with a lot of 9 year olds running around although there were some 10 or 11 year old kids killed in this movie i hadn't seen that kind of thing much before br br definitely bad taste even for a cheesy 80s slasher movie
<START> don't be swayed by the naysayers this is a wonderfully spooky film this was a thesis project for the writer director jt petty he did a great job of having me on the edge of my seat i never really knew what to expect and for a jaded horror movie goer this is nirvana the film concerns an elderly man who lives in a isolated log cabin in the woods one day while searching for his cat in the woods he witnesses the murder of a child or does he he agonizes about this the rest of the film what is most unusual about this film is that here is no dialogue until the last few scenes i found this to be intriguing the writer manages to get hold of your senses and gives them a relentless tug give this film a go you won't be disappointed
<START> br br there is star trek canon lots of it from canon we know the history of the future advances in technology events places first contacts with new beings names dates etc br br enterprise pretty much disregards much of st canon an unfortunate fact for long time serious fans as one i assumed that the producers would at least take a look at the first few episodes of tos and retro back from there but no br br the phase pistols like much of the technology look much more modern than found in tos an old style starfleet laser gun a slow gold speckle transporter effect that's what i expected to see also i did not expect to hear pure beep based sound effects similar to tng but far apart from tos sound effects br br in the earliest view of tos the original pilot the cage we see a starfleet with a more formal military aspect a bit of old earth navy with enterprise we see a shocking disregard for rank there is more military code in the cartoon star blazers than in enterprise br br it is fine that captain archer is unsure about the needs of the universe quite unlike kirk who never lacked confidence in his application of human justice but inside enterprise everyone seems like an equal unprofessional unsure more distant from the feel of formal military service than found in any st series and that says a lot br br the casual country music opening theme song heralds the journeys of a family rather than the adventures of an important large military vessel br br enterprise looks to show us a mostly fun warm fuzzy exploration of human relationships rather than take us on a historic bold gritty high rick exploration of space br br i would have selected adrian paul to play the captain and an older human to be the doctor still i liked the actors for the most part linda park an outstanding ballroom dancer from boston college is sure to develop nicely the characters making up the crew seem to be thoughtfully created br br enterprise begins its run stronger than did the past three star trek series let's hope for a good future
<START> i was totally engrossed in this film from the first to last minute it is brilliantly shot with lots of interesting and original camera angles and techniques employed the plot surrounds a deaf woman who is picked on by friends and colleagues alike she hires an assistant at work with her true intention being to find love he's an ex con and she takes advantage of him to wreak revenge on those who have hurt her in return she must help him with a heist that requires her lip reading skills to pull it off the film transcends into a dark film noir with a couple of truly excellent scenes and an even better finale the real beauty in this film comes from the way the director takes advantage of the leading character's disability the use of sound keeps the tension consistent and the dramatic shifts from silence to noise keeps the blood pumping that's for sure throw in a little black comedy and undertones of erotic sexual repression you've got the makings of a great film it's the sort of film hollywood really wants to make but just can't
<START> this movie was probably the worst movie i have ever seen here are the things that immediately jump out at me 1 the woods were more like hills in los angeles with a couple trees and brush not scary whatsoever news flash if you are filming in the southern california area big bear is only an hour away they actually have trees there br br 2 the writing was absolutely without a doubt the worst dialogue i have ever experienced every possible line in the movie was unoriginal clichÃ© or just plain stupid for instance the name of the camp is camp blood lame the name of the clown is the killer clown lame what is a clown doing in a forest anyway was that the only mask they could find 3 the last but certainly the least was the acting absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled a virtual cornucopia of shitty lines and poor acting worst part by far was when then randomly flash back to this fat foreign girl getting naked for a a photograph it's a really long scene and i guess she was supposed to be sexy but she was not also and this was one of the few enjoyable parts of the movie for me was this tool who is supposed to be athletic for instance when he is bored in the movie he grabs a couple rocks and starts doing curls with them then later on he is supposed to be running for the clown and it is immediately clear with his very girl like run that he is quite far from athletic oh and to the girl who played kat good lord stop singing that song you sang for the credits makes me want to kill myself br br if for some reason you do see this movie i would at least recommend watching the special features the group of jackasses who made this film talk about it as if it is this really original story in fact one of the girls actually says that she let some of her friends read the screenplay and none of them could predict the ending apparently she hangs out with special kids
<START> how do comments like the one that was the headline by high school girls even make it on this site this was the stupidest movie i have ever seen it was ridiculous how can any moron sit there and say that just because a movie makes you jump it is a good movie that might be the most idiotic thing i have ever heard i could sneak up behind you and go boo and it would make you jump but that does not mean i am qualified to write or direct a movie not to mention they tied everything together at the end is not a good reason for a movie to be well received what kind of movie would it be if they didn't tie everything together i guess that would make it half a movie not a whole movie so basically this idiot girl is complimenting them for finishing the movie well i love how the youth of today hold the media and production companies to such a high standard no wonder the political system of this country can get away with whatever they want we have idiots like that coming up in our country what would happen if this girl actually ends up leading something someday that is a scary thought get a life and go watch a real movie sometime try shawshank redemption or on the waterfront or something like that and don't comment that it was boring after you see it just use what little brain god gave you to analyze it a little
<START> this film has a lot of raw potential the script is sharp the dialogue is usually excellent though it could stand to lose the cheezy voice overs the direction and cinematography is surprisingly quite good though some of the experimentation just doesn't work the main problem here is david duchovny once a geek boy always a geek boy and the sad simple fact is that he's incapable of playing anything but fox mulder he postures he tries to be slick he poses he tries to be macho in the end he just tries too hard he overplays his character he overspeaks his lines and he's just outplayed in all ways by timothy hutton and angelina jolie who are each in a class above him in terms of acting skill timothy hutton was as always really good there was a spotty moment or two where he over dramatized his role but you could tell he was having fun with it he looked the part and he became the character both physically and atmospherically angelina jolie was also really good she didn't have much of a role in fact i though she could have used a much stronger one her character wasn't nearly developed enough though she did remarkably well with what she had and the chemistry between her and hutton was apparent gee maybe that's why uma left him all in all it was rough around the edges but a solid effort by a good cast and great supporting roles if david duchovny hadn't ripped his role to pieces it would've been that much better 7 10
<START> this is the worst ripoff of home alone movies that i have ever seen watch part 1 and two but don't let anyone say that this is better than the first two i mean really you don't make a movie then make a sequel with the same characters and actors and then make another sequel with different characters and actors i mean it would have been ok if this wan't a home alone movie but they did make it a home alone movie culkin is too old now so you're suppose to stop making sequels goodness this movie makes me sick buy part 1 and 2
