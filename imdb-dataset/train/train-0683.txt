<START> winchester 73 is the story of a man jimmy stewart obsessed with getting back his prized possession a repeating rifle made by winchester the rifle keeps changing hands and stewart doggedly keeps after it this 1950 b w effort by anthony mann is more a crime film than a traditional western and the cowboys often seem more like modern day gangsters than old fashioned cowboys shelley winters plays a woman of questionable virtue who is headed for a ranch with a man charles drake she may marry she ends up falling for stewart but not before she is passed around a bit winters is the most complex character in a film filled with unusual characters watch for a young dan dureyea as a nutty killer and tony curtis in a very small role a woefully miscast will geer plays wyatt earp
<START> here's my first david mamet directed film fitting since it was his first as well br br the story here is uneven and it moves along like any con movie from the little cons to the big cons to the all encompassing con it's like the grifters but without that film's level of acting in that film john cusack was sort of bland but that was the nature of his character the acting here is very flat i sometimes wondered if the bland acting by crouse was supposed to be some sort of attack on psychoanalysis at least in the beginning it never gets really good but it evolves beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes early in the film some of lindsay crouse's lines the way she reads them sound as if they're inner monologue or narration which they aren't with the arrival of mantegna things pick up br br the dialogue here isn't as fun as it should be i was expecting crackerjack ring a ding ding lines that roll off the tongue but these ones don't it all sounds very read rather than spoken maybe mamet evolved after this film and loosened up but if not then maybe he should let others direct his words he's far too precious with them here and as a result they lose their rhythmic jazzy quality what's more strange is that other than this the film doesn't look or feel like a play the camera is very cinematic my only problem with glengarry glen ross was that it looked too much like filmed theatre but in that film the actors were not only accomplished but relaxed and free everything flowed br br i wouldn't mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines or even play characters speaking play lines but here it sounds like movie or even book characters speaking play lines it's a weird jumble of theatre and film that just doesn't work that doesn't mean the movie is bad it isn't it's often extremely entertaining the best chunk is in the middle br br it's standard con movie stuff the new guy in this case girl margaret ford lindsay crouse gets involved in the seedy con underworld how she gets involved is she's a psychiatrist and one of her patients billy is a compulsive gambler she wants to help him out with his gambling debt so she walks into the house of games a dingy game room where con men work in a back room i'll admit the setup is pretty improbable were they just expecting crouse to come in were they expecting she'd write a cheque was billy in on it one of these questions is definitely answered by the end however br br and from here the cons are start to roll out i found the beginning ones the little learner ones to be the most fun we're getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as crouse is br br we see the ending coming and then we didn't see the second ending coming and then the real ending i didn't see coming but maybe you did the ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second crouse walked into the house of games she found her true calling br br i'm going to forgive the annoying opening the improbable bits and the strange line reading because there are many good things here if the first part of the movie seems stagy stick with it after the half hour mark it does really get a momentum going if you want a fun con movie then here she is if you want mamet go watch glengarry glen ross again james foley did him better br br
<START> i had never read shakespeare's hamlet before watching it but i did have a shakespeare book with me and could follow the dialogue through it my view on the movie may be partially biased since i had never read the play before but i got pulled into this movie's grasp shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers ever to have lived and the story of hamlet is definitely one of his best achievements br br but now on to the movie br br i found that all the actors in the movie had a firm grasp of what they were saying and thus were able to articulate it quite well leonardo in romeo and juliet is nothing compared to kenneth branagh and the king the thing i liked about this was that it worked very well as a movie and not as a play you are studying you don't need to be affluent with shakespeare to relate to all the misery hamlet has to go through i would recommend this movie to a wide audience br br that's my two cents
<START> br br if you like rap or hip hop watch this movie although it's funny if you don't get the references as a straight comedy br br haven't seen much of the much hyped cb4 but what i did see didn't have the heart that this little stormer has br br haven't heard from the people involved since which is a surprise the film is very similar to spinal tap which is no bad thing and i think a lot of the dialogue while priceless in tap is funnier here probably because i'm more into rap than rock theses days so my own judgment does cloud that point br br the rap songs are funny as hell and it's basically spot the reference for most of the film not all of them are in your face which means the physical comedy and the one liners get priority over the take offs br br great fun one to watch twice if there ever was a movie
<START> despite the english title this seems to have little to do with devils and much more to do with a power hungry ruler who seeks the philospher's stone wants gold made from lead virgin's blood jacinto molina plays gilles de lancre and seems to have little issue with having people put to death when he thinks they threaten his position or when he needs virgins for their blood he's basically egged on by his lady love and an alchemist that he's employed and it's more greed and insanity that seems to be his problem than demonic possession unfortunately there are parts that are at least somewhat exciting like jousting and grown men trying to knock each other down with big sticks and the film at least has a good look to it but otherwise there's little about this to recommend little in the way of gore and nothing to be afraid of at all and most unusual for a molina naschy film not really any unintentional humor therefore 4 out of 10
<START> principally it is the story of two men who were part of the portuguese revolution it was easy to understand the contest but usually directors starts from a historical fact to speak about something else or they shows also the period before or after this fact here everything happen during that couple of days when the revolution acts it could also be seen as a kind of documentary the movie focalize to these two people showing as normal they were not like common heroes because the revolution come from people although it was made from military army from the title you can understand that they were just capitaes as the main characters nice colors and lights during the whole movie excellent work for the director being her first movie she doesn't fall to the banal way well shown emotions and passion of people and crowd the character of maia main one is well made and there is also a good interpretation for stefano accorsi able to show maia's limits this not being an hero
<START> while santa claus conquers the martians is usually cited as one of the worse films ever made this mexican made film from 1959 is so bad it makes sccm look like it's a wonderful life you have to wonder what the people who made this film were thinking perhaps they meant it as a third world allegory about capitalist greed and conspicuous consumption nah they just weren't very good the same production company made an even more disturbing version of little red riding hood in which the wolf's obsession with our heroine has unmistakable hints of pedophilia perhaps this was the inspiration for freeway back to santa claus instead of the north pole jolly old saint nicholas resides in a satellite in geosynchronous earth orbit shades of mst3k instead of elves his toys are made by children chosen from around the world and he had sophisticated spy equipment to check just which kids are naughty and nice the result is like an orwellian outer space sweat shop it's enough to turn you off christmas forever this and other low rent mexican children's' films were dubbed in english and widely distributed in the u s in the early 1960s no wonder the sixties became such a turbulent period in american history the baby boomers who were forced to endure these family films as children would be all too eager to turn revolutionary
<START> i was especially delighted that in this movie othello himself was dark skinned and desdemona didn't have fair hair like almost always the cast played very well too and i liked the script following shakespeare's original text so faithfully but i must say some scenes were acted too erotically for such a character as desdemona i have always thought she is very modest and that's why it is not proper at all to show her in bed with cassio although it was happening only in othello's imagination at first i was a little surprised even that a love scene between othello and desdemona was shown so openly but as a whole i liked the film and especially desdemona crying in the dying scene
<START> yeah cheap shot i know but this movie is a great example of how a collection of signifiers of 'deepness' political turmoil love lust can be combined haphazardly to great critical acclaim see also 'american beauty' kaufman's movie plods along with gratuitous sex scenes interspersed with often painful dialog sequences in one scene i counted three different 'generic european' accents affected by the actors and displays of state might run amok yet fails to tie them together into the coherent meditation kundera offered and in its over long three hours it manages almost completely to gloss over franz the missing fourth piece in the love triangle that lies at the heart of the plot and in this manner sacrifices the novel's central mechanism of displaying the spectrum of emotions and of power relations that obtain in love affairs it also fails to even include token screen time for tomas' son used in the novel to exemplify some of the political points kundera was making in the novel combined with the overweening soundtrack these flaws make this movie's three hours unbearably weighty in tone yet light in content
<START> this is a sprawling 4 hours remake of the rider haggard story with the usual added female and an extraneous subplot with russian soldiers seeking a stone of power buried along with the treasure of king solomon it's very well shot giving a vivid sense of the wide open spaces of africa and very well acted patrick swayze is an excellent alan quatermain and allison doody is attractive as elizabeth maitland who hires quatermain to help rescue her father sidede onyulo as umbopa gavin hood as mcnabb and the leader of the russian soldiers not named in imdb's listing are also memorable for all that hollywood can't leave a good story alone when they adapt it this one is well told and except that it's too long i enjoyed it 6 10
<START> a remarkable piece of documentary giving a vivid depiction of a country deeply divided within itself for further evidence check out some of the comments on imdb compares extremely favourably with oliver stone's comandante which is mainly an in depth examination of fidel castro's nostril hairs i don't know whether chavez is everything he presents himself as being or yet another in the long line of populist latin american caudillos nor do i know whether he will be able to make good on the huge expectations he has clearly built up among the poor majority of venezuelans it's hardly reasonable to expect a film like this to be able to answer such questions but i've certainly now got a pretty vivid idea of what's at stake and what it feels like to be caught up in the middle of a coup someone says in the film we're making history and that's exactly what the film feels like it's capturing outstanding stuff
<START> these kind of movies where a psycho of one variety or another tries to damage the reputation and eventually eliminate altogether some naive person in order to take over their life fatal attraction pacific heights the hand that rocks the cradle single white female and a thousand made for tv movies are some examples of this but while a few especially fatal attraction and pacific heights could offer at least some extremely paranoid suspenseful characters or a few plot twists unlawful entry plays everything by the book and were it not for the notoriety of its stars kurt russel ray liota and madeline stowe this movie would sink to mediocrity faster than a danielle steele miniseries br br russel plays michael carr an incessantly naive guy who calls on the help of a pair of officers when someone breaks into his house and tries to attack his wife madeline stowe unfortunately he quietly vents his anger about feeling so helpless in the situation to the wrong cop ray liotta a typically psychopathic villain with no limits for his power at first empathizing with carr probably only pretending to do so the cop befriends the couple but soon enough the cops wants carr out of the way so destroying the guys life nearly any way he can which is pretty easy when you're a cop and when you're the cop who has installed the guy's security system in his house in order to take over and presumably get his wife it seems less ends oriented and more like the cop just wants to prove his power the wife is more like a trophy in other words than an end and the story plays out entirely by the book you can probably predict every occurrence before it happens on the screen if you've seen enough of these movies from the shocking moment our main naive character realizes he is a victim of credit card fraud perpetrated by the psychopathic villain to the turn around he's not really dead finale
<START> most movies i can sit through easily even if i do not particularly like the movie i am the type of person who recognizes great films even if i do not like the genre this is the first movie i could not stand to watch cat in the hat is the worst movie i have ever seen and i've seen a lot of movies the acting is okay myers is good as the cat it's just that he is really annoying the silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous even for the children in the audience the plot drags on and on and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue the witty parental remarks are disgusting not funny i remember some awful comment about a garden hoe being compared to well a type of person people call a ho even though the movie is really short it seemed to last forever do not waste your time i know small kids who hated this movie if children can't stand it i do not know how any adults can i would like to fume more about this film but i do not even feel like wasting anymore time writing this review about it i hated it so in summary do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching this see a good movie br br 1 10 stars the lowest review i have ever given a movie
<START> i watched this film not expecting much and not knowing anything much about it i loved it a very good tight plot an intriguing hook in the form of the ugly fat deaf girl and the ex con and a pace that kept things flowing without being hurried br br a much much better film than the same director's de battre mon coeur s'est arretÃ© which was boring and unbelievable br br the only thing that didn't quite work was that the supposedly ugly fat girl was neither ugly nor fat solid certainly and far from conventionally beautiful but with so much character in her face that she took over the screen whenever she was on it superb i wish she was in more films and better ones than she generally is i've seen a bit of gilles' wife and a bit of the moustache and they both looked like rubbish and i've seen all of de battre mon coeur s'est arretÃ© and that certainly is rubbish she seems to have a few coming up so i'll keep my fingers crossed
<START> i just want to make one thing clear i love michael vartan but this film really lets him down his acting is still superb he's still as charming as ever and he still looks great but the film itself is a load of rubbish natasha henstridge i'm sorry to say it comes over bit manly you're constantly waiting for her to run off with her best friend who's own sub storyline is a little weird myself and my family who sat down and watched the film with me were also put off by the soundtrack to the film at times the music just didn't fit with what was going on in the scenes however even this was not the worst aspect of what i found to be a very disappointing film i could forgive the leading lady's butch ness i could forgive the freakish characters that were thrown in to the mix and i could forgive the poor choice of musical accompaniment but whose choice was it to cut out the whole middle section of the film and skip straight to the end the ending was obviously planned from the beginning but how it gets there is left untold if you're a michael vartan fan skip this film buy yourself a poster instead
<START> this is a fascinating film especially to old movie buffs and historians i am both during the first half of the twentieth century sadly black americans were usually not allowed into white theaters as a result theaters catering to black audiences wanted to show films reflecting the black experience and showing black actors in many cases the films were essentially similar plot wise to standard hollywood fare but with a much much lower budget and usually horrid production values you really can't fault the film makers they just didn't have the money and resources available to the average film company as a result they had to make due with a lot less including an over reliance on stock actors that were seen again and again no money for re shooting scenes and a need to get the films done fast this film tried very hard to be a black version of a gene autry film starring herb jeffries instead jeffries was a light skinned man from mixed ancestry and he starred in several similar cowboy films in each he sings a little fights a little though very poorly and loves a little everything you need in a cowboy believe it or not jeffries is still alive at age 96 br br the general plot was indiscernible from an autry picture complete with anachronistic items such as telephones out west the problem is that despite its similarities the low budget shines through stymie from the li'l rascals flubbed a few lines but they just left it in the fight scenes were totally unchoreographed and were among the worst ever put on film there were some odd plot holes there was no background music leaving the film strangely quiet and the acting was pretty awful br br now this does not mean that the film isn't worth seeing only that it abouts with technical problems that prevent it from being scored higher one reviewer oddly scored this film a 10 how this can be with all the problems is beyond me however i can understand a person liking the film despite its many problems the plot is generally pretty good the characters likable the musical numbers excellent and you know that the people making the film tried so darn hard and it's a very important piece of american history but a 10 br br by the way in an odd bit of casting the very tall lean and almost white skinned jefferies is paired with short dumpy and exceptionally dark mantan moreland as his brother also spencer williams may be familiar to you he played andy on tv's amos 'n andy
<START> first off this is no where near as bad as some of the other trash the sci fi channel has produced that isn't to say that grendel is a good film in fact it is very bad but it definitely had potential to be a lot better the flaws of the film come from character design character absurd additions to the story the visual effects the music and for the most part the acting br br when speaking of character design i of course mean the way our heroes and villains look beowulf and the other danes seem like ridiculous vikings rather than warriors of brute strength that helmet our main protagonist wears is just too silly grendel looks like the hulk but with strange tentacle attachments to his elbows br br the characters are very limited beowulf is same from beginning to end however finn a useless sidekick achieved some two dimensionality due thanks to his romantic subplot and unferth gets some notion as well as he becomes less conceited br br much like finn there are useless additions to this story to make it its own while still holding to the source material the crossbow that is gifted to beowulf is so ridiculous i'm surprised the cast didn't walk off the set besides additions there's omissions such as the underlying themes of christianity and paganism as well as the consequences of lying br br the special effects are mighty terrible grendel and his mother hag are poorly conceived and as such they're portrayal on screen is less than believable br br the music is overbearing especially when a character dies br br all in all this is not sci fi's worst film to date no it is actually one of the better films though trash it still it is it is good trash making it a guilty pleasure at best the only thing that works is the dialogue which is still wooden here and there br br i highly recommend you skip this film and watch robert zemeckis' take on the ancient story of beowulf simply because this film grendel is only half the tale and not the whole thing which garners this movie a three star review
<START> the thirties horror films that are best remembered are always the likes of dracula and frankenstein and there's a very good reason for that but there were a number of smaller but nevertheless excellent productions and the invisible ray is certainly one of them the plot is not particularly original and similar plots have been seen many times before even way back in 1936 but the way that everything is put together is certainly very imaginative and director lambert hillyer has created a very nifty little original horror film the plot focuses on the good hearted dr janos rukh a man who has discovered a way to recreate the history of the earth his discovery leads him to believe that there may be an unknown radioactive element somewhere in africa and so he sets off along with a team of esteemed colleagues to find it however tragedy strikes while on the expedition and the good doctor ends up becoming exposed to the element which makes him glow in the dark and also sends him mad br br the biggest draw of the film is undoubtedly the fact that it stars the two biggest horror stars of its day boris karloff and bela lugosi and both give excellent performances karloff really shows what a good actor he is and his character has plenty of meat for karloff to impress with bela lugosi has a role which is extremely different from what we're used to seeing him in and it's a great performance from him also it's nice to see a bit of versatility from lugosi the film does get off to a rather slow start but things soon start to pick up the second half of the film is the best and that's really when the film gets exciting and karloff gets a chance to shine literally the film does not put its focus on big special effects and largely relies on the actions of the central character to keep things interesting and it does work very well the film remains interesting throughout and boils down to a very decent climax that wraps everything up nicely overall the invisible ray may not be one of the very best horror films of the thirties but it's a very good one and comes recommended
<START> please for the love of god don't watch it now saying that i know what you're thinking it can't be that bad can it if everyone says it as bad as they say i have to watch it don't do it it'll be like looking at a horrible accident involving little babies and a gasoline tanker you'll be scarred for life the image will never leave you i could only watch a half hour of this before becoming violently sick the acting is the worst i've ever seen and i've seen barbwire if you do risk ripping your eyes out and rent this movie don't say i haven't warned you the cover and storyline are a trap zombies satire shaun of the dead was great this movie must be the same right no the writing crap directing garbage acting there was no acting still not convinced then forever your soul will be tormented
<START> i saw most of my bollywood bride today at the iaac film festival in new york and had to leave the theater due to feelings of nausea welling up within me i've seen bollywood movies and i've seen satires of bollywood movies this movie couldn't decide which one it wanted to be so it ended up being a joke on itself br br it seems to have been liberally copied from movies like bride and prejudice and bollywood calling and what a sloppy lazy job at that how can bollywood ever be weaned off of its determination to stick to overused well trodden scripts is there no one who can bring to the screen the millions of real fascinating stories that surely exist and transpire in the land of a billion people the over smart auto driver the cow on the street gratuitous scenes of foreign locations pointless scenes of mumbai streets they're all in there every possible clichÃ© about india has been faithfully included so sickeningly predictable ugh acting performances are weak across the board except for neha dubey who is talented and beautiful one wonders why she would pick a project like this
