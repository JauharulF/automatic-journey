<START> the golden child was eddie murphy's first film since his megahit beverly hills cop and even though it's not as good as cop it's a fun comic adventure murphy stars as a finder of lost children who's assigned a most unusual case his assignment to find the title character a child with mystical powers this movie could have been titled beverly hills cop and the temple of doom since parts of this movie plays like a spielbergian adventure kinda like an indiana jones comedy it's got comedy with laughs and adventure with special effects lots of fun br br out of four
<START> the unborn is a very very different film james karen brooke adams are in the film and they performed quite well this film is builds up solidly and it keeps you going though i think you must be a horror fan to watch this because of the scenes and the plot there is one brief sex scene with no nudity that could have been left out and to some people this scene may disappoint someone like me that's into the film and thinks that stuff ruins a good film but that's it when it comes to that there is a scene where adams' character goes nuts and kills a cat but you can tell its not real the music is very different but very good the unborn in my opinion is a really creepy film that's superbly unpredictable and that's quite strange i recommend all horror fans to this movie
<START> this movie starts presenting a somehow original idea but became a great frustration later on what is the deal of having an original start if the rest of the movie did little to avoid a clichÃ©d plot the movie itself is very unbelievable i would like to know how exactly someone enters a clinic gets a nurse outfit kills a doctor takes out a patient in her bed puts into his chevy pickup and leaves i guess no one could answer this question so they just jumped to the other scene hiding these little details the performances are just plain bad the villain is just another annoying crazy antagonist no deepness totally linear character after 20 minutes of film most scenes are unbelievable seemed like they were put there just for the sake of the 90 minutes since they were totally unneeded a doctor see a woman clearly under strong medication is denied to examine her gets kicked out of the house and simply leaves quiet the ending scene made me burst into laugher only mickey mouse could make it more out of reality i'm giving it 2 out of 10 for the first lets say 10 minutes of movie
<START> canadian filmmaker mary harron is a cultural gadfly whose previous films laid bare some the artistic excess of the sixties and the hollow avaricious eighties with the notorious bettie page she points her unswerving eye at fifties america an era cloaked in the moral righteousness of joe mccarthy while experiencing the beginnings of a sexual awakening that would result in the free love of the next decade harron and her co writer guinevere turner are clearly not interested in the standard biopic of a sex symbol this is a film about the underground icon of an era and how her pure unashamed sexuality revealed both the predatory instincts and impure thoughts of a culture untouched by the beauty of a nude body if the details of bettie's life were all the film was concerned about then why end it before her most tragic period was about to begin clearly harron is more interested in america's attitudes towards sexual imagery then and now together with a fearless lead performance by gretchen mol and the stunningly atmospheric cinematography of w mott hupfel iii she accomplishes this goal admirably holding up a mirror to the past while making the audience examine their own enlightened 21st century attitudes towards so called pornography as america suffocates under a new conservatism this is a film needed more than ever
<START> writer director tony piccirillo adapted his own play about a straight man recently widowed learning in the last three weeks he is hiv positive he tracks down the one homosexual partner he ever had brings him to an apartment and ties him up forcing a blood test on the guy and promising bloody revenge if the results come back positive intriguing idea sounds better on paper than it plays out james marsden's captive is realistically cynical and snotty but the actor's own artificial mannerisms are disconcerting it's like watching a roadshow version of tom cruise scott speedman has to work harder with the more challenging role but his personality turn from shy guy to kidnapper on the edge isn't convincing and neither are the conversations the two men have marsden's gay party boy isn't apathetic of course he's momentarily sympathetic to speedman's plight but he doesn't react or behave the way any homosexual man would in this circumstance the movie isn't a cop out exactly but it is a fraud handicapped further by the bad editing the poorly conceived flashbacks the low budget production and the big finale which smacks of silly pretension and soapy melodrama 1 2 from
<START> this is a brilliant and well made contribution by a group of fans and considering it's made in a back bedroom on a painted green screen it's story lines are complex and twisting and it's characters show realistic depth and dimension the cgi created by the crew is breathtaking while it's first season might be a little shaky it's final few are well thought out and well shot some fans might have thought that the star trek franchise had come to an end with the early cancellation of enterprise but these fans don't take no for an answer i recommend this to fans and newcomers alike 10 10 hidden frontier crew br br make it so
<START> this is a strong movie from a historical and epic perspective while the story is simple it is pure and straightforward in truth it is the standard story of a simple honorable man whose honor comes into conflict with the more educated and wealthier men of the period br br poor vs rich honorable vs dishonorable a classic but well told tale without much of the glitz of hollywood stinking up the screen br br extra points just because you can almost smell the people on the screen
<START> hot millions is a great movie in every way a fun offbeat story with wonderful performances by four of the best professionals ever to work in the business peter ustinov is brilliant as usual and maggie smith definitely one of the greatest actresses of all time is a total delight karl malden and bob newhart round out the cast and are also perfect if you want a movie that has perfect casting this is it what is so impressive is the way these people work off each other in such a natural and effortless way creating lots of laughs and fun moments throughout peter ustinov was a genius with a wonderful sense of humor and this is one of his most memorable performances the direction photography and editing are also first rate and it's a great time capsule of london in the '60s it's definitely on my all time favorites list
<START> this movie blows let's get that straight right now there are a few scene gems nestled inside this pile of crap but none can redeem the limp plot colin farrel looks like brad pitt in 12 monkeys and acts in a similar manner i normally hate colin because he is a fairy in general but he's ok in this movie there were two plot lines in this movie one about a kid who throws rocks through windshields of moving vehicles and the other about a woman with a moustache let's face it this movie has no freaking idea of what it wanted to say or where it wanted to go the characters story lines intertwine on some levels but are in no means worthy of being included in a script the whole thing is weak and pointless and then there is an occasional ok scene but overall don't bother unless you love irish accents so much that you can watch mediocrity and it is rescued by everyone sounding like the lucky charms elf an american fetish that has catapulted some truly crappy movies to success
<START> i don't know how anyone could hate this movie it is so funny it took a unique mind to come up with this storyline it's not your typical alien movie these aliens are so stupid and confused you need to rent it at least once
<START> 1937's stella dallas with barbara stanwyck hasn't exactly aged well how anyone thought a semi updated version of the story would work now is a real puzzler perhaps they thought jaunty cheerfully brash bette midler could make something out of it but this hoary script defeats her plot about a female bartender having a baby out of wedlock and years later giving the young girl over to the child's wealthy father so she'll have a shot at a better life can't escape tatty old fashioned trappings and sentiment midler works best with a movie director who can control her excesses but that fails to happen here stephen collins is stolid as the man who changes her life but trini alvarado is well cast as midler's daughter this is what used to be referred to as a woman's picture a wallow but it doesn't pass muster because it stays too faithful to its 1930's origins 1 2 from
<START> beautiful film pure cassavetes style gena rowland gives a stunning performance of a declining actress dealing with success aging loneliness and alcoholism she tries to escape her own subconscious ghosts embodied by the death spectre of a young girl acceptance of oneself of human condition though its overall difficulties is the real purpose of the film the parallel between the theatrical sequences and the film itself are puzzling it's like if the stage became a way out for the heroin if all american movies could only be that top quality dealing with human relations on an adult level not trying to infantilize and standardize feelings one of the best dramas ever 10 10
<START> this movie has so many wonderful elements to it the debut performance of reese witherspoon is of course marvelous but so too is her chemistry with jason london the score is remarkable breezy and pure james newton howard enhances the quality of any film he composes for tenfold he also seems to have a knack for lost days of youth movies be sure to catch his score for the recent peter pan and the haunting gothic music of the village i first saw this film at about 13 or 14 and now i don't just cry at the ending i shed a tear or two for the nostalgia show this movie to your daughters it will end up becoming a lifetime comfort film
<START> if you delete the first twenty minutes or so of this film you will be left with a fantastic comedy as it is i still found it to be a pretty good movie which is no small feat considering the coma i was put in by the opening scenes to put it mildly this film has a dreary beginning that wasn't even remotely funny or even upbeat once things get sillier however you are left with a comedy that still holds up well after more than three decades definitely worth checking out especially if you're a younger fan of lemmon and matthau who wants to see their earlier work
<START> i saw this film after watching capote and infamous it is just incredible how the homosexual relationships between author and protagonists are sublimated in the movie the reporter is straight the protagonists are more beatniks than gay br br the film starts slowly but on reviewing it a second time we get all sorts of interesting information from similes that the writer director brooks creates br br notice the incredible cutting at the beginning where killers and to be killed are linked cutter on the phone is matched cut to perry on the phone cutter washing his face is matched cut to perry washing his face only perry's looking in the mirror and seeing his eroticized male body sets off a fantasy of his playing a guitar in las vegas to empty chairs this failure fantasy matches the failure fantasy that perry tells us about his father who built a beautiful motel in alaska only to find it perpetually empty br br dick talks about shooting pheasants and the fact that the pheasants don't know that that they're going to die we cut to the clutters br br perry talks his dream about a yellow bird taller than jesus who attacks the nuns who have persecuted them the nuns begged for mercy he tells us but the bird slaughtered them anyway the bird lifted perry to paradise strangely perry says that he has an aversion to nuns god and religion this echoes later in his last words when he wants to apologize but does not know to whom br br the director puts in all sorts of what ifs and only ifs br br nancy cutter gets an offer to sleep at a friends house she is holding a horse perry will comment on a picture of her and the house later on nancy can't sleep over at her friends' house because her boyfriend is coming over for dinner the decision seals her fate br br perry talks of bogart in treasure of sierra madre but it is another bogart picture beat the devil which truman capote co wrote where a fictional treasure hunt is the mcguffin but dick knows that the protagonists of that film ended up with nothing dick wants the hard cash the 10 000 he thinks is in the clutter's safe which ironically turns out to be as much as a fantasy as perry's mexican treasure br br cut to herb clutter signing a 40 000 life insurance policy he's thinking about mortality at the moment ironically his mortality is about to end in a few hours the insurance agent on behalf of the company wishes him a long life again ironic when we know what will happen in a few hours br br dick has said that they wanted no witnesses so nobody would remember them later in fact it is because they eliminated all the witnesses that they were remembered br br there was one witness the detective keeps telling dick later but was that witness the jail house friend dick perry truman capote or god the viewer becomes the witness after watching the movie br br fascinating film
<START> allison dean's performance is what stands out in my mind watching this film she balances out the melancholy tone of the film with an iridescent energy i would like to see more of her
<START> i have never read the bradbury novel that this movie is based on but from what i've gathered it will be interesting when i finally do read it and i will my comments will be based purely on the film as soon as i saw the trailer i knew i had to see it and was so excited but when i finally did i was so disappointed it hurt this is because the movie itself felt so amateurish the actors were not well cast though robards and pryce are both good actors just not here the kid actors it seemed were merely asked to show up get in the characters' clothes say the lines and make the faces the set and props were cheap and unrealistic the direction was surprisingly bad i was so surprised at the awfulness of it that i had to go online and check who directed it just to see the kind of work he had done the editing was cut and paste and the plot screenplay was just that as well even though the author had been involved himself irony the building up of the tension fear and suspense was so mild it was ineffective when the climax finally came br br i've read some of the comments on this movie and find it hard to believe people actually like it what hurts the most is that the content is interesting and fun and intriguing it had so much potential unfortunately the film was so technically bad it takes away from the brilliance of the story
<START> when reading a review from another user saying that it's a terrible game i could not stand idle and do nothing br br well this game is great from the news clips with two real persons full of humour sense and credibility to the story i find it very good i only complain about the enemies start blinking when they die until they disappear and some frustrating situations on the leila vr missions when riding the bike here and there br br except that it's a great game with a great story good graphics excellent characters great soundtrack i recommend it surely it can be a bit old but still enjoyable at least on the dreamcast but the ps2 version shall be the same
<START> i was glad to watch this movie free of charge as i am working in the hotel industry and this movie came lately to our movie library nothing against low budget movies but this movie has horrible acting and directing how can a movie as this one ever be made the director should be blacklisted and for all the poor actors it is for sure not a jumping board into a career please make sure that you'll not watch this movie the acting is lame the camera and directing awful there are just a few more movies out there which deserve to be called the low 10 another example would be dracula 3000 people who make money with this movie should give it to charity so at least it serves for a good reason br br in this case i would watch it even another 10 or at least one more time
<START> i thought the movie was fairly well done for a made for tv movie and it contained both a lot of action and humor i found the entertainment value worth watching and would watch it again or a similar show again i'm disappointed that sean was not credited here on imdb br br i can see a possibility for an action series based on this concept or a sequel with sean once again playing for even higher cash stakes since his life would be on the line again anyway br br i felt that sean played the role very well and reminds me of an actor by the name of matthew ashford who plays jack deveraux on days of our lives the soap opera
