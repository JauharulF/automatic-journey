<START> can i be as simple and primitive in my evaluations as to simply say i liked it it's reasonably funny by bits it got great stars and it's gorgeous to look at the songs there are about two which are then repeated are forgettable but they get a healthy ironic treatment such as the terribly handsome mr fairbanks exploding into frenzied wagnerian version of the tender ballad miss grable has just rendered there isn't much dancing with all the 1861 crinolines draped around miss grable and the comedy might be a bit heavy handed but the result still is very uplifting the photography including real outdoor shots which are a thrill is amazing playing around with different shades of lush heavy gold miss grable is a bit past her prime and on the plumpish side but still fresh and comfortable in this continental olde worlde comedy it's pretty much along the line of down to earth with rita hayworth and that one tends to be rather disliked by many so i suppose several people would deem that lady in ermine to be outdated and stuffy but it's a fairy tale and these tend to move along at a certain paste anyhow my suggestion is just enjoy the artwork the costumes the witty script and everything else this film has to offer and stop complaining the film has been released on dvd in germany with both german and english soundtrack
<START> 1st watched 12 24 2009 Â 4 out of 10 dir robert ellis miller emotional christmas fluff that doesn't really get specific enough to explain how the real story happened in this factual based incident of a man who is wrongly put in jail trying to get a job for his family to make christmas happen for them the three kids in the family then run away from home on a trek to washington d c to enlist the then president of the united states herbert hoover this trek provides some side stories like their positive encounters with a hobo and a puppeteer which makes the story kind of like a disney animals on the run movie and doesn't quite fit here at the ending there isn't any details given as to how the president helped the family and this is another downpoint to the movie in my opinion the movie does eventually bring tears but it takes too long to get to this the movie isn't supposed to have been an original tv movie according to imdb but it has the obvious fade outs that make it look this way Â so i'm not sure their information is accurate all in all this is a simple movie that could have been more complex with a happy christmas like story but blandly played and without a lot of substance
<START> sex wish was actually released minus ten minutes of more ahem 'extreme' footage here in the uk back in the early days of the video boom and caused a tabloid storm in a teacup when it allegedly inspired a copycat murder case strangely enough the papers brushed this ultra disturbing flick under the carpet in their headlong rush to get the comparatively innocuous likes of frozen scream and night of the demon canned and the film has been all but forgotten as a result i jumped at the chance to watch it on a dvd rw and spent most of the film's duration with my jaw on the floor it's not so much politically incorrect as utterly demented a triple x take on michael winner's death wish did the title kind of give the game away as far as inspiration was concerned with hardcore sex and some truly nasty violence thrown into an already bubbling brew of seventies sleaze if you don't consider yourself to be squeamish this may force you to think again by the time sex wish is over you'll want to scrub your eyeballs clean with disinfectant and take a long hot shower to purge yourself if any film truly deserves the it's only a movie only a movie only a movie tag line it's this one br br highlights or lowlights a rapist using a vibrator on a victim as he masturbates over her harry reems's scene stealing moustache the helpless young black couple who are forced to screw in front the sword cane killer they'd have won oscars for their entirely credible performances if the academy had gone mad before the man is castrated for his troubles and some jarringly slick direction that threatens to lift the proceedings above their obvious grind house origins don't say i didn't warn you if you thought the world was a more innocent place thirty years ago sex wish will prove you very very wrong
<START> there have been several films about zorro some even made in europe e g alain delon this role has also been played by outstanding actors such as tyrone power and anthony hopkins but to me the best of all times has always been reed hadley this serial gives you the opportunity to see an interesting western where you will only discover the real villain don del oro at its end the serial also has good performance of various actors of movies b like ed cobb ex tarzan jim pierce c montague shaw eternal villains like john merton and charles king and a very good performance of hadley as zorro he was quick smart used well his whip and sword and his voice was the best for any zorro
<START> this production has absolutely no storyline the acting is embarrassing the promising dutch television sophie hilbrand star should not add this movie to her cv her acting is far from flawless and personally i think she has crossed boundary of professional decency relating to the way she exposes herself in this movie this movie contains too much unnecessary nudity vulgar sexual scenes and rude language it also shows a wrong image of the netherlands as most movies do do not bother to watch this movie a waste of time a waste of money and an embarrassing record for hilbrand who has proved to be better with her close on on the screen
<START> i just saw hot millions on tcm and i had completely forgotten this gem ustinov creates a clever and divisive plot that has him cleverly going from two bit con man to ingenious well you'll see maggie smith is perfect as the bumbling secretary neighbor who has a tough time holding a job but has a warm and vibrant personality that beams through in this picture she creates a fine portrayal of a warm witty and real person who in the long run well br br molden and newhart as top executives take on the challenge of making what could be banal roles and make them come out into a comic life of their own br br robert morley and ceasar romero are just a pleasure to see and i know at least in romero's case ustinov is extending a helping hand of work br br this film is meant to be a shot back at the rising computer age and it's problems for the average con man or man for that matter but in fact the characters are so involving and so much fun to watch that the computer sub plot is almost lost i say almost br br let down your usual expectations of modern comedy and look for the great performances and friendly forgiving and deeply involving plot in this picture
<START> laurence fishburne is a fine actor and deserves respect for trying this but he is not in a class with the great shakespeareans like olivier and welles and he further suffers from kenneth branagh this irishman always brilliant cleanly steals the show away olivier recognized that potential in his production and cast iago with someone he knew he could upstage i didn't nearly realize the possibilities of iago shakespeare's most evil character but branagh shows us the depths nice to see the views of venice too
<START> hayden christianson and jessica alba two of my least favourite actors of this century team up in what is quite possibly the flattest attempt at remake the already dire the butterfly effect awake is so dull and so utterly uninteresting that you'd be better off asleep terrance howard still recovering from the diabolical august rush puts up a decent fight as the sadistic doctor who seems hell bent on killing christianson and after viewing his performance i would gladly assists br br alba still recovering after fantastic four rise of the silver surfer is naturally disastrous and equally unwatchable as she always was only once has she ever been rather brilliant at that was in the safe hands of master director robert rodriguez in sin city could it possibly be that jessica alba isn't as poor of an actress as most give her credit for and is is possibly that her acting abilities are being weight down by a poor script if so then that would explain awake what with a script that would shame that of plan 9 from outer space br br jessica alba hayden christenson and terrence howard star in first time director screenwriter joby harold's nerve jangling psychological thriller about a man who experiences the frighteningly common surgical phenomenon known as aesthetic awareness in which those laid out on the operating table remain acutely aware of what is going on around them despite remaining completely paralyzed and unable to cry out for help when a successful young young man christenson goes under the knife and realizes that the anaesthesia hasn't quite done its job the horror quickly sets in as his worried wife alba waits anxiously and a terrifying drama unfolds in the operating room br br hoping to do for operating tables what final destination did for planes this first effort from director joby harold pivots on a blood frosting conceit the pre credits sequence tells us one in 700 people suffers from a phenomenon known as 'anaesthetic awareness' where the patient remains conscious but paralysed during surgery one such unfortunate individual is clayton beresford jr hayden christensen who finds himself wide awake during a heart transplant and he can feel every single slice br br intermittently inventive as it probes away at his tortured psyche awake fails to inject true terror into its novel premise spiralling from chilling simplicity into absurd conspiracy it's hindered by stilted turns from christensen and jessica alba you'll wish you'd popped a sedative before watchingÂ br br verdict awake is at very best extremely undemanding a pull no punches film that undoubtedly looked better on paper as a film though its awfully generic and extremely derived awake fails to inject terror into its novel premise the end result is really quite lousy alba and christian are the very least of your worries as the films main flaw lies in its inability to scare its audience awake is a film you'll most likely sleep through
<START> yes there are worse movies out there most of them made for fun on a shoe string budget or as a t v movie of the week but even if this was the 'movie of the week' it would rate no more than two stars it is a poor movie about a serious subject featuring an abused woman who flees the king of the slime people in to the protective arms of the king of the wussy people if this is an attempt to show that she doesn't need a man to protect her than wuss man is superfluouse to the film and ought not to be in it at all it has no suspense no character development and an heroine that could be outsmarted by a rotton onion i think she flushes her wedding ring on a boat with a self contained tank rather than just dropping it overboard in the ocean where her body should be anyway and after the husband finds her demonstrating that she is a moron she still makes childish assumptions that lead to almost getting her killed i am always amazed when i see the sort of generally high rating a movie like this gets and it makes me realize that dr seuss still has a huge untapped market of people who would be challenged by his work after i get done laughting at humanity i weep
<START> many people judge it as a fan service film because a lot of super star starring in this movie gackt hyde and wang lee hom is very famous singer in japan but don't judge it before you watch is what i say gackt and staff are very serious when made this film and they worked so hard it's a good film with a touchy story inside several scenes can be so fun and some others are so sad they made it so good until i can't stop watching this all over again br br the story has written pretty well but i admit that their act are little disappointing this is especially for hyde because his skill of acting is under from the other and it is weird to hear the way when he speaks with other language except his native language japan but it's comprehensibility because this is their first time to act in the movie br br i think gackt trying to show us about how someone can be so weak when they lose the most important person in their life when toshi was killed when sho asked kei to turn yi che to being vampire like him because he won't let her die when sho's brother died kei shoot son die and the best and beautiful scene is when sho pass away even i told that hyde's skill is still weird but i give him two thumps up at that scene br br there's a time where the plot goes too fast like they didn't tell the reason why son can join the local mafia and being sho's enemy because they are a good friend at the past and also son is sho's brother in law br br whatever i love this movie very much br br this is an action movie with a touching beautiful story
<START> a gentleman's game uses the game of golf in a country club setting to illustrate an adolescent's discovery about honesty prejudice and other life lessons several times i thought i knew where this film was heading only to be proved wrong unfortunately i'm not so sure that the filmmakers ever knew where it was heading either the defining moment in this movie is probably the scene in which gary sinise mocks the karate kid and debunks any notions that he's going to become a mentor to the adolescent golfer it's refreshing in a way that this movie refuses to follow most of the simplistic and over worked movie formulas however too much of it still comes off as contrived at the drop of a hat people drop all pretenses of civility or fail to stick up for the things in which they believe or are exposed for something far less respectable than their place in society assumes unfortunately there is often no resolution to these moments and except for the fact that the club serves as backdrop for them there is no real continuity or linking of them it's a shame that the writers and director could not salvage a better film especially given some of the talented actors and potential in the setup
<START> the only scenes wich made me laugh where the ones with christopher walken in it the crazy filmdirector the rest of the movie was just boring in the first hour or so nothing really happens jokes which supposed to be funny aren't and zeta jones douglas is really overacting julia roberts does a routine job of the former ugly duck yeah right into the girl next door where did i see this before who gets the guy for short i really didn't care what would happen with the main characters if cusack really fell of the building in a suicide attempt the movie could have been more interresting to watch
<START> my mother keeps a cassette of this film as a general threat to any film loving person who annoys her everything about it stinks br br as such it is a true classic br br who gave it 10 10 were you inadvertently watching a good film and accidentally voted for this one br br everyone involved in the movie making process should be forced to watch at least a small section of this film it should be an indelible stain on the minds on all that hold film sacred and be revered as the tide mark of the cinematically dire
<START> strained comedy a sketch like revue which was initially a vehicle to showcase one time radio star jack pearl but is now best remembered as america's introduction to the three stooges actually larry curly and moe are billed alongside comic ted healy as ted healy and his three stooges although the supporting cast features jimmy durante who is completely wasted on dim material and zasu pitts the only audience for the film these days are stooges addicts and even they won't find much to applaud here incredibly loud and overbearing it shows how far hollywood had to go to reach a certain level of slapstick sophistication 1 2 from
<START> i've joined imdb so people know what a great film this is it's not often you come across a film that's moving and visually cinematic yet humble you've read the plot so all i want to say is don't watch it because you want to see a clash of cultural religious identity babble because that's the typical misconception people read in to instead just appreciate and realise it's about a father and son on a voyage growing to know each other through their struggles buy it and pass it on before film4 get round to it this was one of the very few films to be nominated for a bafta being independent and foreign the beauty of it is that it manages to appeal to anyone even if you never watch anything subtitled or just used to the hollywood formula just a great story that will keep you engaged the only thing i wish is for it to be longer and see what happens
<START> a truly disturbed cannibalistic psychopath john gary kent under the pseudonym michael brody who lives in a cave stalks campers who make the unfortunate mistake of backpacking in his wilderness steve dean russell and his buddy charlie john batis get into a playful argument with their wives sharon tomi barrett the late real life wife of gary kent teddi ann wilkinson over surviving in the woods camping by themselves to prove a point the gals decide to head for the wilderness out of los angeles for a camping trip disturbing their partners to the point that they soon follow afterward falling prey to john teddi is soon killed as sharon runs for her life as the men arrive late to the wilderness due to their truck's overheating afraid tired and paranoid sharon receives some very unusual assistance john's ghost children that's right john's children remain in the wilderness ghostly apparitions which spy on those who exist in the woods taking a special liking to sharon helping guide her to safety and her friends meanwhile steve and charlie soon find shelter from a down pour and the darkness of night in the very cave where john lives cooking over a burning fire the meat simmering is actually from charlie's wife teddi unknowingly charlie eats from the meat when offered by john who finds the outsiders inside his dwelling place anyway soon worried about their wives steve and charlie set out to find them as morning breaks meanwhile john goes a hunting with charlie steve and sharon in a fight for survival when steve suffers a compound fracture stumbling between two massive rocks over a flowing river he will be handicapped only increasing such an already nightmare scenario with sharon following her ghostly young friends to potential safety they even at one point plead with their father to not kill her charlie unfortunately doesn't have such friends br br director donald jones who also wrote it and went broke funding the film smartly shoots the film in such a breathtaking gorgeous location in the sequoia national park in california where those gargantuan trees tower to great heights and i basically watch backwoods slashers for this very purpose for some strange reason i didn't particularly find jones' direction of the setting very atmospheric the dread was missing although there are some rather disturbing attacks by john using his knife shot in a clever way jones' camera suggests more than what is actually on screen yet somehow still achieves that gasp at what john is doing to victims within such a picturesque landscape to see innocents preyed upon by a maniac that kind of increases the terror city folk attempting to spend a nice few days in a different place to smell the clean fresh air enjoy the sights of a lovely view only to find themselves stalked by a creepy predator with a very intimidating knife providing the back story to why john is the monster he is jones allows us to witness his memory flashback in discovering his wife's adultery and reacting accordingly she is also a ghost in the wilderness looking for her children wishing to punish them for being naughty killing both her and the lover in bed a refrigerator repairman the children sad and depressed committed suicide and now haunt the wilderness still interacting with their pa or whoever they so choose i realize such a novelty as ghost children in a backwoods slasher is unique and appreciated by some but i found the idea rather hokey and too silly to take serious they do help our heroine escape a few potentially dangerous situations but it was awfully hard for me to keep from giggling uncontrollably the music i found hideously 80's and the performances aren't mind blowing i mean i could react to the situation they were in because it is indeed quite terrifying to find yourselves in an unfamiliar and hostile territory being hunted by someone who knows the area so well i think the film is similar in many ways to don't go into the woods alone except that the forest has the aforementioned ghost children their voices echo when talking to sharon their father or each other gary kent looks like a filthy george lucas with tattered clothes and humanity lost as i mentioned above the violence isn't as grisly as what is suggested because director jones is able to effectively cut away from a great deal of knife penetration yet the way he stages the set pieces leave you rather unsettled such as teddi's murder the violence mostly silhouetted on the surface of a nearby huge stone formation her pleas for john to stop and once stabbed several times attempts to crawl away from her predator only to be finished off a hanging corpse john is skinning i've seen better and worse of this type of slasher film it's rather mediocre at best with some effectively shot scenery i don't really think it's particularly memorable for the exception of the ghost children
<START> now i flicked onto this just out of curiosity and had to keep watching in the same way that you watch a car crash br br i appreciate the fact it's a spoof but that should not stop me from criticising the god awful directing acting and dialogue seriously this rated as one of the poorest movies i have seen it looked more like an episode of tales from the cryptkeeper and a poor one at that br br okay a few criticisms 1 when the doctor had his heart attack in front of the monster we never see the monster attack him so we assume its a heart attack the army then launch shells rockets bullets at the monster which was feet from the doctor yet the doctor is not touched by any missile and is still alive 2 the army attack from about 100 yards away and we see a flame thrower being used geez those things have a range of no more than 30 metres 3 when the monster tries to take the professor the soldiers run into the classroom and fire into the ceiling the monster drops the kid and the soldiers don't try to shoot the monster come on 4 the monster looks like it something out of power rangers 5 there is one scene where the five good guys the priest the girl the doctor the reporter and the kid all look shocked and we get reactions along the lines of hand to mouth one after the other so natural 6 the general just runs away time after time 7 the general refuses to try electricity and wouldn't listen 8 the acting is awful 9 did i mention the rubber suit monster 10 that god awful music non stop
<START> from the beginning of the movie i had a feeling like its a movie about another jason's from friday the 13th and it is dispute that the movie starts interesting but as the times goes by its just a pointless movie about muted supernatural silent serial killer i mean he goes under the guy's bed without making any sound not seen by anyone he was supposed to be blind after failed execution but he walks and kills people like he used to i'm tired of it for me it's all over the same thing br br in another words unreal too many mistakes and confusing information br br well scene with tide up woman looked impressive but just at first time for that and for intriguing intro 2 stars
<START> the acting itself wasn't even that bad since it did't come to mind in the movie but whatever had this director in mind the intended climb towards some climax completely missed the mark br br almost all scenes involve acting that stand so far from our own intentions and way of reacting on things that you don't really attach to any actor in the movie br br empty silences in this case see through cheap method of boasting your way into potential metaphorical brilliance which just wasn't here at all br br i guess i'm bitching but shit 2 hours of my time
<START> in the fifties the age restrictions for films in brazil were the following no restriction 10 years old 14 years old and 18 years old usually the westerns were allowed for ten years old when they had a bit more of violence they would go to 14 but it was rare to see a western restricted for younger than 18 winchester 73 was one of those and i think this explains very well how this film was considered different from average the hero james stewart was fighting against his own brother who had killed their father he was looking for revenge and seemed quite traumatized far from the average good guy anthony mann tried variations on this type of character in the next films he did with stewart shelley winters the leading lady was far from virtuous she kept following the man who stayed with the rifle dan duryea as waco johnnie dean is one of those great villains that will always be remembered the story of the film which always follows the man who stays with the rifle is one of the best suited for a western it was to be made into a fritz lang film which did not come through when it was offered to mann he made a point of starting from zero again and not taking anything that was prepared for lang with winchester mann created a different conception of western but still maintaining all its traditions winchester still is a great film to see again and again but nothing will be comparable to the impression it made in those who saw it when it was originally released
