<START> 99 999 pure crap and the other 001 was a brief moment where i thought the blond chick was going to disrobe nope br br the dialogue was legendarily bad the action sucked and there was no sex the afore mentioned blond chick is modestly dressed alas the whole movie the cgi had the dubious honor of being the worst i've ever seen on film and the anachronisms were numerous and glaring acting was mediocre even from ben cross and marina sirtis the only 'names' in this movie and marina sirtis looked really really bad br br i've seen high school plays more capably produced this is the kind of movie that mst3k thrived on heads should roll at sci fi for allowing this steaming pile on the air
<START> mark pirro's deathrow gameshow of 1987 is a black comedy that is extremely cheesy in many parts but occasionally very funny nevertheless this movie could certainly have been a lot better the acting is terrible and some extremely cheesy scenes make it hard to watch at times but the concept is funny and it has some hilarious moments br br in the near future the year 1991 game shows have changed chuck todean john mc cafferty hosts a game show called live or die in which convicted death row inmates have the chance to play for their lives and for money candidates who fail get executed on the air using many different methods such as guillotines electric chairs and other more bizarre devices of execution followed by applause from the cheering studio audience the show is of course more than controversial and chuck has made lots of enemies br br deathrow gameshow is incredibly cheesy and crappy in many aspects and the acting is terrible but it is without doubt fun in many parts especially if you're a fan of dark humor you haven't missed anything if you haven't seen it but it is definitely funny and a good time waster 4 10
<START> this movie was bizarre completely inexplicable and hysterical to watch with friends while drinking in a big empty house i really love the opening stuff with lisa wandering about lost in a gorgeous city i want to be a beautiful stranger lost in some exotic european locale though maybe not in a low budget horror flick definitely get the ending where there are the strangely non sexual sex scenes that were cut out in my dvd copy anyway don't attempt to understand it just go along and watch out for the weird bits which is everything don't watch this if you actually want plot or characterization or anything at all to make sense pretty beautiful though you may just give up on this and decide to watch an actual horror movie like say dead alive
<START> there is one detail which is not very common for jackie chan movies but which is present here it has some very tough and serious atmosphere about it while the funny elements are present too jackie is menacing and psychotic here he is not a hero who is attacked and only then fights back in a usual laid back pattern but he is the one who can go and start the tumult his manner of hitting that evil guy in the glasses is amazing every time it goes crack i also especially enjoy the scene when jackie goes to the pub and thrashes the villains who had fronted on his girlfriend it's one of the best blitzkriegs put on screen besides the whole scene is shot with the background of some action character painted on the wall it also looks like a poster of rabochiy from our soviet era and some lines in russian on the left i noticed that quite accidentally that looks terrific and nostalgic for russian people i also like when the windows are being smashed in the movies here there's a lot of this stuff it's quite amazing watching the characters falling jumping running driving through all manner of panes br br all three movies are great i had been preparing myself to see the down slide of the quality but i saw a perfect trilogy with sense and incredible stunts and not only jackie chan's character appears in all three movies that's also excellent and keeps continuity up br br i would like to describe each movie just in a few words no 1 great in all aspects it is one gripping story from the very beginning to the very end and funny many scenes are ridiculous no 2 raging jackie is really beep off here and painful jackie gets tortured no 3 unbelievable the woman that fights alongside with jackie is incredible and bombastic should i mention a lot of guns and explosions br br as to the rest much has been mentioned by the others br br it's a trilogy that can be watched over and over again at least by me its place is in top 10 among action comedy jewels finally it's been released in russia on dvd the 2nd film has the best options the chinese russian soundtracks and english russian subtitles br br solid 10 out of 10 thank you for attention
<START> seldom seen since theatrical release in 1970 myra breckinridge has become a byword for cinematic debacles of legendary proportions now at last on dvd in an unexpectedly handsome package it is as unlikely to win wide audiences today as it was when first released br br gore vidal's 1968 bestseller was a darkly satirical statement most filmmakers felt that the novel's story structure and overall tone would not translate to film and industry insiders were surprised when 20th century fox not only acquired the rights but also hired vidal to adapt his novel to the screen but studio executives soon had cold feet vidal's adaptations were repeatedly rejected and novice writer director michael sarne was brought in to bring the film to the screen br br studio executives hoped that sarne would tap into the youth market they saw as a target for the film but sarne proved even more out of synch with the material than the executives themselves rewrite upon rewrite followed the cast sensing disaster became increasingly combative in her dvd commentary star raquel welch says that she seldom had any idea of what myra's motives were from scene to scene or even within any single scene itself and that each person involved seemed to be making an entirely different film in the accompanying back story documentary rex reed says that myra breckinridge was a film made by a bunch of people who hid in their dressing rooms while waiting for their lawyers to return their calls br br the accuracy of these comments are demonstrated by the film itself the basics of vidal's story are there but not only has the story been shorn of all broader implications it seems to have no point in and of itself everything runs off in multiple directions nothing connects and numerous scenes undercut whatever logic previous scenes might have had and while director sarne repeatedly states in his commentary that he wanted to make the film as pure farce the only laughs generated are accidental br br chief among these accidents is mae west it is true that west is unexpectedly well preserved in appearance and that she had lost none of her way with a one liner but there is no getting around the fact that she is in her seventies and her conviction that she is the still the sexiest trick in shoe leather is extremely unsettling to say the least but worse really is the fact that west is outside her era her efforts to translate herself into a hip and happening persona results in one of the most embarrassing self caricatures ever seen on film br br the remaining cast is largely wasted raquel welch a significantly underestimated actress plays the title role of myra very much like a barbie doll on steroids non actor rex reed is unexpectedly effective in the role of myron but the entire role is essentially without point only john huston and cameo players john carradine jim backus william hopper and andy devine emerge relatively unscathed yes it really is the debacle everyone involved in the film feared it would be fast when it should be slow slow when it should be fast relentlessly unfunny from start to finish it is true that director sarne does have the occasional inspired idea as in his use of film clips of everyone from shirley temple to judy garland to create counterpoint to the action but by and large whenever sarne was presented with a choice of how to do something he seems to have made the wrong one br br the how and why of that is made clear in sarne's audio commentary sarne did not like the novel or for that matter the subject matter in general he did not want to write the screenplay but he needed the money he emphatically did not want to direct the film but he need the money he makes it very clear that he disliked author gore vidal and rex reed at one point he flatly states that reed is not a nice person and to this day he considers that vidal and reed worked in tandem to sabotage the film because he refused to play into their 'homosexual agenda' which when you come right down to it seems to have been their desire that sarne actually film vidal's novel rather than his own weirdly imagined take off on it br br although he spends a fair amount of commentary time stating that the film is widely liked by the gay community sarne never quite seems to understand that the appeal of the film for a gay audience arises from his ridiculously inaccurate depiction of homosexual people when taken in tandem with the film itself sarne emerges as more than a little homophobic and quite frankly the single worst choice of writers and directors that could have been made for this project br br in addition to the sarne and welch commentaries and the making of documentary the dvd release includes several trailers and two versions of the film a theatrical release version and a restored version the only difference between the two is that the final scene in the restored version has been printed to black and white the edits made before the film went into general release have not been restored but the documentary details what they were the widescreen transfers of both are remarkably good and the sound is quite fine but to end where i began this is indeed a film that will most interest film historians movie buffs and cult movie fans i give it three out of five stars for their sake alone but everyone else should pass it by br br gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
<START> i would like to say that unlike many of the people who disliked this film and found it impossible to understand i was fully able to understand it for what it is a very incoherent attempt at a plot line br br i don't like to toss this word around but in this case it fits very well the director firstly presents the material in an extremely arrogant way and worse extremely incoherently it is incoherent in that it presents the material in a messy dislodged order making us think that the director was too drunk to remember which scenes come first and arrogant in that at 2 hours long they expect us the viewer to care by the end of it br br i respect surrealist cinema for what it is creating a story around a more than real world that does not tie to real life but there is nothing surreal about having a story placed in ordinary modern times and a modern day earth setting that is most importantly not able to engage the audience but furthermore simply a dislodged series of events that barely tie together the most accurate way to describe the experience of viewing this film is like viewing a story perhaps even a very good story as it was based on a book but being frustrated by the fact that the camera doesn't seem to capture the necessary moments and tie together any means of coherence br br let's compare stylistic cinema compare gaspar noe's seul contre tous to this he gave us a coherent extremely engaging and intellectually deep story this movie offers no intellectual study and while it is very stylistic in it's fragmented presentation the director has ultimately abandoned the essential art of good storytelling and all we are left with is a mess of events that barely tie in together br br yes indeed it is possible to make sense of things to a point but as i said earlier the viewer will reach a stage where they simply say who cares it plays out like watching a drab mundane story of a man going to a supermarket and buying groceries in uncronological order even with murders it is completely uninteresting and unengaging too many people these days will give high marks to something they are unable to understand or make sense of simply for fear of looking foolish and in every way this film tries to make the viewer look foolish br br if you have too much time on your hands then please watch this film taking into account what i have said of it it is a story based on a book that could have been presented in a much more effective way and that is my bottom line reasoning
<START> the first of the official ghibli films laputa is most similar to its predecessor nausicaa but whereas nausicaa was a sf epic this is more of an action comedy adventure with a fairly weak sf premise br br for the first half hour of the movie i thought i was going to love it once again you find yourself in awe of miyazaki's attention to detail and his ability to conjure up an imaginary world in meticulous beautiful perfection the animation though still not in the league of the later ghibli films is a little better than in nausicaa br br i mentioned in my review of nausicaa that one character is drawn in a more 'lupinesque' anime style here there are a whole bunch of them the pirates they provide the comic element in the film though quite why it needs a comic element i'm not sure there was nothing funny about nausicaa and i think it was better off for it still having said that dola the pirate leader is easily the most memorable character in the film even if she's basically a female long john silver don't be surprised if you're reminded of 'treasure planet' at times and is well voiced by cloris leachman in the american dub br br the english voice cast acquit themselves well for the most part actually however something started going pear shaped for me about this movie by about the halfway mark i think the best way that i could describe it is that the characters get swallowed up by the vast scope of the story i'll come back to that later br br there is so much to admire about laputa and so many people obviously love it that i almost feel mean for only giving it 8 out of 10 but for me the operative word here is 'admire' it was more impressive than personally affecting and at over two hours it just started to drag br br the crucial thing for me was this i really found that i didn't care much about any of the characters disney would have taken the care to develop the characters make you really fall for them rather than leave them as relatively two dimensional pieces to be moved around while you gawked at the amazing vistas in the movie even that would have been tolerable if there was some hard sf in the story to make up for it but it was basically a lot of gobledegook about princesses and magic crystals that's where laputa falls down as far as i'm concerned and that's what holds it back from being a potential 10 out of 10 movie having said that it must be admitted that miyazaki was leagues ahead of disney in general in 1986 when you consider that their movie of the same year was the pretty dire 'great mouse detective' br br laputa is a good film in some ways an amazing film and you should definitely see it but i do feel it's over rated i definitely prefer the earlier 'nausicaa of the valley of the wind' br br btw if you manage to watch them in chronological order watch for the fox squirrel from nausicaa popping up briefly in laputa
<START> i thought this was one of the best movies i've seen in a very long time it was a great story line and showed that people are so intricate in all kinds of different ways have recommended it to all my friends i always enjoy a good story line and this movie had one of the best i've seen in a long time i could see myself having a daughter and doing the same things that natalie did to find out more about her life and loves it showed how we not only have lives with our families but also have parts of our lives that we don't share with them as it may not be in their best interest to know all the details of things we don't do that we are so proud of br br i look forward to another such movie and will keep my eye out
<START> set in a post apocalyptic environment cyborgs led by warlord job rein over the human population they basically keep them as livestock as they need fresh human blood to live off nea and her brother managed to survive one of their attacks when she was a kid and years have past when she came face to face with the cyborgs again but this time she's saved by the cyborg gabriel who was created to destroy all cyborgs job and his men are on their way to capture a largely populated city while nea with revenge on mind pleads gabriel to train her in the way of killing cyborgs and she'll get him to gabriel br br cheap low rent cyborg post apocalyptic foray by writer director albert pyun who made cyborg prior to it and the blistering nemsis the same year is reasonably a misguided hunk of junk with some interesting novelties very little structure makes its way into the threadbare story as the turgid script is weak corny and overstated the leaden banter tries to be witty but it pretty much stinks and comes across being comical in the unintentional moments most of the occurring actions are pretty senseless and routine the material could've used another polish up as it was an inspired idea swallowed up by lazy inclusions lack of a narrative and an almost jokey tone the open ended cliffhanger conclusion is just too abrupt especially since a sequel has yet to be made makes it feel like that that run out of money and said time to pack up let's finish it off another day or maybe in another decade there's no rush however it did find it rather diverting thanks largely to its quick pace some well executed combat and george mooradian's gliding cinematography that beautifully captured the visually arresting backdrop performances are fair kris kristofferson's dry and steely persona works perfectly as gabriel and a self assured psychically capable kathy long pulls off the stunts expertly and with aggression however her acting is too wooden a mugging lance henriksen gives a mouth watering performance of pure ham as the villainous cyborg leader job who constantly having a saliva meltdown scott paulin also drums up plenty of gleefulness as one of the cyborgs and gary daniels pouts about as one too pyun strikes up few exciting martial art set pieces involving some flashy vigour and gratuitous slow motion seeping into the background is a scorching but mechanical sounding music score the special effects and make up fx stand up fine enough watchable but not quite a success and it's minimal limitations can be a cause of that
<START> joan fontaine here is entirely convincing as an amoral beauty who is entirely incapable of feeling love for anyone but herself her husband richard ney has lost all his money through a combination of his foolhardiness and her extravagance and they are reduced to living in a tiny room with little or no prospects they continue to put on the most amazing clothes and go out and socialize as if nothing were wrong he is a charming feckless but wholly amiable fellow however fontaine decides he has to go as he has outlived his usefulness so she resolves to poison him when she realizes he does not want to divorce her so that she can move on she has meanwhile had a lover patric knowles whom she decides to drop because he is not rich either she meets the aging herbert marshall who has a yacht with all the trimmings and more money than even fontaine could figure out how to spend she targets him and decides he will do nicely he is all too eager to be eaten up by the young beauty he certainly isn't very exciting and has about as much sex appeal as yesterday's omelette but fontaine is one of those gals who has eyes only for money and the man standing between her and it is transparent so that she doesn't even notice or care what he looks like she looks through him and sees what she really wants and goes for it she proceeds to poison her husband and dispatches him very neatly and satisfactorily so that everything is going well but as always happens in the movies and sometimes even in life some unexpected things begin to go wrong and the tension rises appreciably so that fontaine begins to sweat fontaine is particularly good at looking wicked and terrified and as the net begins to close in on her her rising sense of desperation is palpable and has us on the edges of our seats hysteria and fear take over from cool calculation and cunning but she finds a fall guy for her crime in the person of her cast off lover who is an innocent victim of her scheme to set him up he is condemned to death for murder because the husband's death by poison came to light unexpectedly but sir cedric hardwicke playing a grimly determined scotland yard inspector thinks there may be something amiss and begins to doubt the story and suspect fontaine he closes in on her and some of the scenes as this happens are inspired portrayals of the wildest panic but will the innocent man's life be saved before he is executed will fontaine worm her way out of this one will herbert marshall protect her to safeguard his infatuation this film is expertly directed by sam wood and the film is a really superb suspense thriller which i suppose qualifies very well for the description of a superior film noir
<START> this is an evocative and idealized portrait of the early life of lincoln born 1809 hodgensville kentucky and died in washington 1865 ford's excellent movie takes abraham lincoln fonda from his youth he studied laws common law and began practice as lawyer in 1837 this hollywood biography follows lincoln from his log cabin days initial relationship to mary todd weaver following the couple from their first ball and his departure for congress candidate but focuses mainly on a brothers richard cromwell eddie quillan accused for murder the posterior trial with amusing court debate scenes and the protection for their mum alice brady the lincoln fonda as defender advocate and donald meek prosecutor are nothing short of brilliant br br excellent performance from henry fonda as idealistic traveller springfield solicitor he was to star regularly for ford from this movie as Â¨grapes of wrath my darling clementine and fort apacheÂ¨ besides sterling acting by alice brady as grieved mother she was a great actress from the silent cinema but this one results to be her last movie because she early died from cancer the lincoln's deeds developing make for skilfully appealing entertaining his portrayal shows a nostalgic longing for things past and old values and describes his goodness uprightness and willful lincoln like john ford was a straightforward man who never varied the ideals of his youth this american masterpiece is correct on both counts as splendid biography and as magnificent drama br br another biographies about abraham lincoln are the following 1 Â¨abraham lincolnÂ¨ 1930 by d w griffith with walter huston una merkel talking from his birth until his assassination 2 Â¨abe lincoln in illinoisÂ¨ 1940 by john cromwell with raymond massey ruth gordon concerning similar events to ford's film through his career as lawyer 3 tv version titled Â¨gore vidal's lincolnÂ¨ with sam waterston and mary tyler moore as mary todd
<START> the one thing that occurred to me after watching this drivel was i would never get the time i used to watch this back again if you want to see stacey keach and michael dorn try and earn what must have been then the down payments on a holiday home then stay tuned wooden acting poor special effects the only comedic highlight was whilst our alien hero was in female form and this is over as soon as she has done her obligatory b movie nude sex scene within 30 mins into the movie the opportunity to have made what could have been a decent movie disappears the moment nicole eggbert clocks the alien in a bar within 30 seconds whilst the police military and joe public don't cotton on that the woman drinking coffee dosn't use the cup handle and wears four jumpers at once she must obviously be from another planet just where i wish i was when this movie was on
<START> bela lugosi is not typecast in this fantastic twelve part adventure serial playing the lead as frank chandler chandu the magician enjoying his role as a representative of the forces of white magic pushed against those of black while displaying vigourous fighting skill successfully wooing a young egyptian princess and cutting a lean and dashing figure in yachting gear complete with nautical cap the somewhat lumpy plot engages chandler chandu in an ongoing series of escapades pointed at achieving the rescue of his fiancee princess nadji maria alba and others from the clutches of the idol worshipping sect of ubasti which covets nadji's blood in order to revivify an ancient mummified princess entombed upon the mysterious island of lemuria director ray taylor an old hand at such entertainments keeps events moving briskly but repeated scenes and footage a good deal of which is to be found in the previous year's skull island setting from king kong and the port locale from son of kong reduces original action to less than 60 minutes from the serial's running length of over two and one half hours and if viewed at one sitting becomes lacking in effect to most viewers unless insomniac
<START> as many reviewers here have noted the film version differs quite a bit from the stage version of the story i have never seen the stage version of the story and therefore i have a more favorable review of the film than many other reviewers perhaps richard attenborough was not the best choice for director of the film but the film is still an entertaining account of several dancers trying to make the big time in choreographer michael douglas' show the film does right by not selecting any famous actors or performers to wind up in the final try out group this way our attention is focused on the dancers' movements and individual stories and struggles as they unfold during a marathon day of try outs douglas is also probably not the best choice for the part apparently some songs were cut out in favor of a new one and the backstage clichÃ© ridden story of a romantic liaison between a dancer and the choreographer was added i have to say in all fairness this was the weakest part of the film the repeated intrusions cassie made during try outs appear to mirror the almost desperate pleas one often has to make when engaging in the artistic professions in the absence of talent and or luck however this aspect of the film has been done to death in the past and it's curious to see this tired old shoe kicking its heel up once again the revelations of the dancers themselves began promisingly enough with the i can do that number but then it plodded a little at various points while the dancers were telling their stories frankly their stories differed little from real life folks who never get a chance like this of 4 stars
<START> i just have to say this is one of my favorite movies of all time i cannot even count the number of times i've seen it i was already in love with john travolta but the first time the camera pans up his body after he's all clean shaven looking beautiful for his first trip to gilley's i was in awe debra winger as always delivers a perfect performance as the young naive wife of bud but with the necessary attitude to be married to a stubborn and hard working cowboy if you're not a country music person which i wasn't this is 1 soundtrack that'll have you singing right along with every word if you get a chance please see this movie it won't disappoint
<START> mother night is one of my favorite novels and going to see this i was expecting a huge disappointment instead i got a film that perfectly portrays the irony humor elequence and above all else the crushing sadness of vonnegut's novel br br this is certainly nolte's best preformance to date he captures the defeat and selfloathing of howard cambell jr consistently from the subtle intonations of his speech to the held back tears behind his eyes br br alan arkin is absolutly hilarious as george kraft sherryl lee is haunting in her detachment from reality as cambell's young lover john goodman is understated and more than effective as cambell's blue fairy godmother br br this pinnocioesque story of cambell trying to be his own ideal hero and unwittingly becoming his ideal tragic villian is a mature and vivid look into what we are as people and aside from that it is one of the most deeply romantic films i have ever come across cambell is the incarnation of both foolish and wise love and at the films sastifyingly painful conclusion he finally learns what it means to be a real boy as his blue fairy godmother grants him his wish and he realizes that well watch the movie and you'll see br br mother night is without a doubt in my mind one of the best films ever made it is a beautiful poetic story that digs deep within our emotions and is completely faithful to its original author
<START> since siskel's death and ebert's absence the show has been left in the incapable hands of richard roeper roeper is not a film critic he just criticizes anything he doesn't like personally i e films with country music get panned because i don't like country music and children's movies get a standard don't see it now wait until it comes out on dvd and rent it for your kids roeper may well be an idiot savant but in some other field the weekly guests 'sitting in' for ebert fare better but who wants to pick a daisy in the midst of a cow pat all that said it is the only show in town and that alone makes it worth watching as for roger ebert if stephen hawking can talk so can you it's your mind and thoughts we long for do whatever is necessary to get that usurper off his self declared throne
<START> it's hard to believe after waiting 14 years we wind up with this piece of cinematic garbage the original was a high impact dark thriller that achieved cult status demonstrating the fine art of cinema as directed by paul verhoeven this film adds nothing delivers nothing and ultimately winds up in the big box of failed sequels br br the opening sequence could have triggered an intriguing set of plot developments using a considerably talented and able cast unfortunately we are treated to a 90 minute dissertation in the self indulgent life of catherine tramell or is it sharon stone possibly a copulation of both br br if the desire is too see a continuation of the sensually provocative stying of sex as in b s 1 forget it you wind up with soft porn boredom which ultimately upholds the old adage that a woman can be more alluring in clothes than out of them it's interesting to note that the wonderful charlotte rampling was romping around in her skivvies via the 1966 georgy girl when ms stone was only 8 years old a very talented actress and quite adept at holding her own even here br br if you're a true cinema fan then you must see this film and judge it using your own rating system if not you might as well wait for the dvd release in the rated version unrated version collectors edition or ultimate version and perhaps in another 14 years we will be saturated with news of basic instinct 3 at which point ms stone will be 62 years old and nobody will really care
<START> where do i start per the title of this film i expected some degree of authenticity in the end i was severally let down this is not the story of lale andersen or the song lili marlene rather it is a hollywood or pick your film making hub story loosely based on some real life characters i should have had a clue when i heard a heavy english accent giving the intro to the movie in german the blood red text title artists should have been the 2nd clue the story line is contrived lale was not tricked out of switzerland rolf liebermann's parents there is no info that liebermann helped smuggle jews from germany the original song had been recorded outside of the control of the ns regime not while under control the record played at the station was picked up in vienna while a lt was there on leave etc etc the costumes are poor and incorrect for the time frames ss black uniforms used every where from border guards to staff positions these went away from daily use once the war started etc the characters are stereo types sa bullies in a club once they were essentially out of power don't waste your time
<START> it's unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera work and busy but scratchy background score that accompanies this 1933 release although sound came into general use in 1928 there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman unhappily married who deserts her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods br br the most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town proceeding to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife's lover in a frenzy of jealousy he drives at top speed toward a railroad crossing but changes his mind at the last moment losing his nerve it's probably the most tension filled scene in the otherwise decidedly slow moving and obviously contrived story br br hedy lamarr is given the sort of close up treatment lavished on marlene dietrich by her discoverer but her beauty had not yet been refined by the cosmeticians as they were when she was transported to hollywood her performance consists mostly of looking sad and morose while mourning the loss of her marriage with only brief glimpses of a smile when she finds her true love aribert mog the handsome young stud who retrieves her clothes after a nude swim br br the swimming scene is very brief discreetly photographed and not worth all the heat it apparently generated the love making scene later on is also artfully photographed with the sort of lyrical photography evident throughout most of the film artfully so more is left to the imagination with the use of symbolism and this is the sort of thing that has others proclaiming the film is some kind of lyrical masterpiece br br not so it's disappointing primitively crude in its sound portions including the laborious symphonic music in the background and certainly miss lamarr is fortunate that louis b mayer saw the film and on the basis of it gave her a career in hollywood he must have seen something in her work that i didn't br br it's apparent that this was conceived as a silent film with the camera doing all the work the jarring workers scene at the conclusion goes on for too long and is a jarring intrusion where none is needed it fails to end the film on the proper note
