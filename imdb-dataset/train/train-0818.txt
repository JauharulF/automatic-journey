<START> i tend to like character driven films i also think hope davis turns in consistently good work so i had high hopes for this movie those hopes were soon dashed br br the main flaw with this movie is the direction there are a lot of scenes that are daydream sequences the movie makes frequent use of the denis leary character as the alter ego of the campbell scott character it doesn't work for me at all this would have worked better as a play than a movie br br there are problems with the plot as well it is important that the characters in a movie take a journey and end up in a place different from where they started i didn't feel that the characters grew in the experiences portrayed in the movie br br finally the editing wasn't well done either there was a very big sag in the middle of the movie that was exceptionally boring br br except for acting which i felt was consistently strong this movie failed in almost every aspect of cinema
<START> when i saw this movie i heard all the hype and i heard how people said that denzel deserved the oscar alongside his golden globe and i believed he must have done an outstanding job considering kevin spacey was excellent i was wrong i realize that people say this not to anger the african american community if they are not african americans themselves i always hear complaints on how african americans are never nominated and how they should have won sometimes this is true not as much nowadays because whoppi goldberg should have won best actress for the color purple and the movie should have won best picture the only reason this movie was so blown up the way it was is because people see a movie about the semi spoiler hardships of an african american during a very racist time period and they automatically label it as a masterpiece br br denzel washington is an outstanding actor but his role in this movie did not affect me whatsoever i was bored with him in the movie and his acting here was quite similar to his role in malcolm x but not as good the audience is supposed to leave believing this man rubin carter is a saint people left the movies worshipping this man this hero and they went out and bought his book making this hero of a man rich br br spoilers this movie tells the tale of a man who spent the majority of his life in prison mainly for crimes he did not commit of course the crimes he did commit stealing mostly was only to survive nothing more people felt sorry for him even though the drug dealers and thieves probably amounted to as much for the same reasons but are looked down upon in society everything in this movie tries to portray this man as a saint except for the obvious infidelity he had towards his wife and the aggression he showed the other man when he met his wife but why wouldn't it after all it is his point of view i do not like movies especially hollywood interpretations that are based on true stories because they usually distort the true parts into something else something not so true this was his point of view and a hollywood construction yet everyone believed it was the truth unquestionably well i researched his past a bit before making any assumptions and he was a very violent man not only that there is still a possibility that he did murder those people if you do not believe me search for him on the internet and read the articles some people have of him the boxing match he claimed to have won so easily was actually won by his opponent joey giardello and there are tapes to prove it besides that there are many twisted and purposely left out facts in this movie the supporting cast were the nicest people i have ever seen on the face of the earth and their nice and perfect persona looked difficult to keep up br br this movie was a hollywood version of yet another unfortunate true story that is still left to be told truthfully denzel's acting is stale and the supporting cast's mickey mouse attitudes are annoying the movie also begins very slow paced and is boring
<START> mario van peebles pops up for less than a five second cameo glenn plummer shows up a little longer but its a ladies show all the way stacey dash and lisa raye have been in better projects bobby brown leers and mugs through his little time on screen this is how it was pitched five tough women shootin' and lovin' in the wild wild west four black and one asian oh and lil' kim is a tough talking' heartbreaker and marie matiko can bring in the pacific rim market we can shoot it for less than 15 million straight to video and we'll double but more likely triple our dollars br br greenlight that puppy br br you got it boss
<START> i rented this movie yesterday and can hardly express my disappointment in little laura ingalls for getting involved in something so poorly produced i am not sure if it was horrible writing or bad directing or both but it leaves a viewer very disappointed in having wasted the time to watch this swill it consisted of a weak naive story line very poor lines and relied solely on pretty scenery and pretty people to sell it unfortunately this was not enough you would be better off to rent a tape full of static than to waste your time on this crap lindsey wagner also played a pretty pathetic part as a ranch owner who apparently works very hard doing nothing anybody who has ever been near a ranch knows that this was obviously written by a young person from los angeles and not someone with much knowledge of the world
<START> a wonderful surprise of the spanish cinema i never thought jordi molla could be such a great director after all i really don't care much for his choice in movies however this film was absolutely fantastic and not predictable at all something i always enjoy it hasn't enjoyed much good press and i really don't think it'll ever be released in the us market we'll have to content ourselves with the dvd or vhs if even that i don't want to say much about the story because i don't want to spoil it for you but basically the movie is about a homeless drunk who becomes the new messiah just for kicks and to get some money out of it like sooooooooooo many before he knows it he is immerse in a life he was not counting on
<START> rko had a reputation for making folksy homespun pieces of americana br br anne shirley as dawn o'day had been in films since she was a toddler by 1933 she was in limbo having played ann dvorak as a child in three on a match 1932 and a flower girl in both this side of heaven and the key both in 1934 george nicholls jnr remembered anne's work from a previous film and that's how she got this part she also adopted anne shirley as her stage name the memorable stories are there lady of shallot in a leaky boat the stolen brooch the red hair incident anne was so right for the role of the chatty heartwarming orphan she was heartbreaking in her intensity her eagerness to please and also her fiery temper o p heggie was wonderful as the understanding matthew cuthbert and helen westley was fine as the firm marilla tom brown was an excellent gilbert blythe gertrude messinger who had also been in films as a small child was fine as diana barry sara haden proved she could play someone other than aunt millie in the andy hardy series was mrs barry
<START> why is this film so bad well if being so stupidly annoying and unfunny is a reason then this film is it the character of corky romano is unlikable at best and downright infuriating at worst the gags are predictable but that isn't what makes it bad they are the lame sort of predictable jokes that your unfunny friend would say br br corky romano is about a mild mannered vet that tries to do right but is so clumsy his quiet life is thrown for a loop when the family that once spurned him now needs him to infiltrate the fbi to destroy any trace of the family's crime history however it isn't that easy for corky because the fbi believes him to be a super agent and pegs him with the duty of spying on his very own family mishaps and mayhem ensue but it really doesn't feel like any comic hijixn are there corky ends up in love with his beautiful fbi partner and has to set the record straight with both the fbi and his family if he is to settle down to the quiet life again br br i think what makes this film irritating is both the lead actor and the supposed jokes chris kattan reveals his alarming limitations as and actor here as his one note slapstick routine falls flat about 10 minutes into the film it is okay to have a full movie based solely off of dumb slap stick humor will ferrel kattan's snl partner seems to have made a full career out of it the only difference between kattan and ferrel is that ferrel knows when to tone it down and rely on other ways of telling a joke there is absolutely no diversity in kattan's routine it's hard to hear the same joke twice but for a whole movie that is just pure torture br br the other problem with the movie was the lack of truly original and funny jokes the gay mafia brother the awkward guy sch tick and plenty of other forgettable jokes appear none as funny as the first time you barely laughed at it it seems as if the screenwriters had more of a fun time writing this than any one had watching it even with a cast that has some comedic talent chris penn peter falk the jokes that commence are tired there is no chemistry too this film was obviously one for the pocketbooks for the actors no body seemed to care about it or even try sad thing is no body told chris kattan that
<START> i just saw this delightful japanese feature film at the 5th annual roger ebert overlooked film festival in the historic virginia theatre in champaign illinois br br although this film subtitled in english has ballroom dancing as its heart the film actually shows the world outside of japan how the rigid structures of family employment salaryman and recreation still exist in modern day japan br br writer director suo masauki i follow japanese custom of presenting the family name last name first and the given name last uses the not so very popular theme of ballroom dancing to show the societal structure of japan br br also i shall not use the movie character names when world readers may not be familiar with japanese formal names which may confuse i will refer to the br br actors by their professional acting name as listed in the internet data movie base br br he enlists the aid of his real life wife professional ballet dancer kusakari tamiyo in her first and so far only motion picture she is a dance teacher at her father's dance studio yet her real ambition is to compete once more in an international dance competition which she was disqualified from in the past no i won't say why see the movie br br salaryman yakusyo koji is the main star of the film a veteran of about 25 films since 1979 he gives a sterling performance of a 40's something companyman br br who has a lovely wife teenage daughter and just purchased the house of his br br longing br br and yet something is missing from his own inner happiness see this film to learn how he becomes involved with ballroom dancing and secretly goes to br br lessons most of the dancing characters are liberated from the traditional br br japanese hierarchy of social structure they are friendly and warm and inviting of course this is in sharp contrast to how japanese society is structured with it's place for everyone and everyone in its place philosophy br br the movie has so many funny moments the almost 1 500 theater goers broke br br into spontaneous laughter during many of the comedic moments this proves br br that comedy has no foreign language br br veteran actor takenaka naoto is funny and brilliant as well as watanabe eriko they are two funny character actors br br one could purchase and read a college text book regarding the structure of life in japan or you could watch this fine film and begin to understand how the br br people of japan grow up in a fairly rigid societal structure watching the movie shall we dansu is a quick immersion into further study and viewing other br br japanese films br br i recommend this film to all it's funny it's charming it will make you cry a little and it will warm your heart br br
<START> i think the weighted average for this film is too low i give it a 7 very entertaining although over the top in a few places my wife says it passes the danielle steele test superb performances throughout particularly by andie macdowell
<START> this is a copy of the 1948 doris day classic romance on the high seas br br the story line is more or less same but is contemporary govinda plays a sharp witted fellow who replaces the husband on the trip while rani plays the college friend of the wife who does her the same favour they ostensibly try to catch each other out while the actual husband and wife tries to trip each other in bombay br br on the trip govinda mistakes another girl for sanjiv's wife and spies on her while falling in love with the ravishing rani br br lever plays a dual role of father and son both lawyers specialising in divorce proceedings they are pitted against each other for the warring couple br br it is a poor attempt at copying the original classics and the songs are quite appalling the comedy is slap stick and will not make one laugh too much
<START> yet again madhur bhandarkar takes you on a ride to the wild side and a remarkable one it is literally and figuratively br br mumbai hi society stars and starlets glam dolls and witch doctors business tycoons and broker types yep the whole stinking lot are in sharp focus here in typical tabloid fashion their worlds unfold with every colorful story a clever sub plot in itself br br a struggling starlet dumped by the producer after getting her pregnant the stewardess and her high profile husband the pedophile businessman and his neurotic wife the reporters and the police captain all shades on display and countless hues in between br br bhandarkar does a swell job of digging up the dirt on the drama kings the dancing queens and the living dead atul kulkarni packs a punch as does boman irani and sandhya mrudul konkona sen sharma is effective as the ex crime beat reporter but she could have been dolled up a little in keeping with the job change and the party circuit br br highly focused running time 140 min and refreshingly different film well worth the money
<START> watching the fox and the child was an intoxicating experience the lush visuals integrity of point of view and utter beauty of the setting and characters left me in a swoon of pleasure br br the plot is uncomplicated deceptively simple within the container of that simplicity a world unfolds that draws you in and leaves you breathless br br i laughed i wept i learned br br this is a movie you can trust yourself to give yourself over to dare i say it is an act of love intended for any innocent heart it reaches to the heart of the viewer of any age and reveals the world through new eyes as if seen from the heart br br adi da samraj once said that true art draws the viewer beyond point of view into ecstatic participation in reality i feel i have been privileged to watch no to participate in this film a work of true art
<START> this film is just plain horrible john ritter doing pratt falls 75 of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards poor editing horrible sound mixing dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise and a plot that really goes nowhere i didn't think i'd ever say this but dorothy stratten is not the worst actress in this film there are at least 3 others that suck more patti hansen delivers her lines with the passion of ben stein i started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside even bogdanovich's kids are awful the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card this movie is seriously horrible there's a reason bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later please don't watch it if you see it in your television listings cancel your cable if a friend suggests it to you reconsider your friendship if your spouse wants to watch it you're better off finding another soulmate i'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again if i could sum this film up in one word that word would be suckotrocity
<START> example of how a world war 2 documentary should be made using first hand accounts from actual troops and civilians whom participated in this awful conflict and archived footage gathered from around the time i caught this on a re run on the history channel about a year and a half back with no knowledge really of the second world war at the time but it enveloped me and now i consider myself a world war 2 buff watching and reading any and all that i can find about it but nothing comes close to this landmark documentary definitely worth buying the boxed set of br br this is quite simply documentary making of the very highest standard
<START> i rented this movie because it falls under the genres of romance and western with some grand canyon scenery thrown in but if you're expecting a typical wholesome romantic western forget it this movie is pure trash the romance is between a young girl who has not even gone through puberty and a middle aged man the child is also lusted after by other leering men it's sickening br br peter fonda is portrayed as being virtuous by trying to resist his attraction to brooke shields and her character is mostly the one that pursues the relationship he tries to shoo her off at first but eventually he gives in and they drive off as a happy loving couple it's revolting br br i don't see how this movie could appeal to anyone except pedophiles
<START> i'm not sure i understand where all these enthusiastically anti grudge people are talking about here perhaps it's just that some people like to rant about things br br the movie was certainly imperfect uneven acting some may have had difficulties with the time changes actors all too willing to go places i'd really rather not go etc but imho there were some things that more than made up for the imperfections br br first and foremost i loved the 'breaking of the rules' bit normally when you leave the haunted house the baddies leave you alone giving you time to regroup get friends and find the token mysterious paranormal type normally semi spoiler alert when you're hiding under the covers they can only get you through that little opening you peek through normally at the end the ghosts somehow have become less creepy because you've found out they're just misunderstood or they've been freed or whatever br br secondly the production was exceptional while the movie was hardly special effects laden the supernatural bits while brief were extremely well done br br probably not the best sort of movie for those who think freddy and jason are the ultimate sort of horror nothing against 'em they've got their place but great for those who've begun to take the conventions for granted and who don't have trouble with the time distortions
<START> a yawn inducing snail paced disappointment inside man tells the story of a detective denzel washington who is under investigation due to his possible involvement in a case of missing money when a bank is robbed and hostages are held against their will by a mastermind thief clive owen and his team the detective is assigned to coerce the thief to surrender Â his one shot at proving he is innocent and worthy of his position enter a powerful woman jodie foster with secrets and intents of her own sent to recover an item from the bank owner's safety deposit box that is stored within the bank and you have quite the three way dilemma unfortunately all you get it set up in the film and nothing pays off in the end denzel washington is at his most uninteresting in an ineffective and distastefully egocentric performance the only saving grace for the film is its competent co stars jodie foster and clive owen who are much better than the film itself in fact jodie foster delivers the most surprising and high caliber performance playing against type as a ruthless cutthroat villain of sorts clive owen isn't given much to do besides brood and pose but the depth of his presence and his achieved acting ability more than make up for his underdeveloped role it's strange that so much talent is wasted on this film of little impact or interest you have to wonder what director spike lee was thinking while he was creating this film the most perplexing aspect of inside man however is how much unwarranted praise it has received for a film that seemed to have all the makings of a pre summer blockbuster this one falls horribly flat
<START> like the first touch of pleasure and guilt like a spontaneous youthful flirt of fascination and fear like a climax of contrary emotions said one of the movie buffs after viewing love at the top the misinterpreted title version of stylish director michel deville's le mouton enrage br br vincent canby in new york times however just after the 1974 premiere of the movie stated love at the top which opened yesterday at the 68th street playhouse is a 1973 french comedy that dimly recalls a number of nineteen fifties english comedies about the rise and rise of cynical young men possessingÂand possessed byÂambition yet the significant difference that he mentioned was the fact that love at the top is not concerned with the english class system january 27 1975 br br having left the evaluations up to single individuals of course the test of time has done its just job what may be said with certainty after more than 30 years is that we can hardly find such movies like le mouton enrage where decadence appears innocent where liaisons appear youthfully enthusiastic where feelings occur so manipulative br br for romy schneider's fans it seems useless to point out that this film is a must see not only because she gives a unique performance as she did in all of her roles at the heyday of her career 9 years before her sudden death but because she is particularly attractive here it is not trio infernal where the so to say 'forced escape' from and the mockery of romy's sweet image haunted for years by saccharine sissi meets its most discouraging manifestation but a film where the brilliant actress is given a fair role she plays roberte a woman who becomes the object of lust for the story's lead playboy nicolas mallet jean louis trintignant it is him who takes financial profits from lustful liaisons this movie can boast truly memorable and unique shots of romy and she is given some of her very best scenes romy's sex appeal is unforgettable here br br another strong point of the film is its execution of the content with a development of individual perception immoral as it may seem the director makes a perfect use of contrast conventions vs pleasures innocence vs decadence genuine lust vs instrumental affair nicola owns most of the features that viewers may like or detest may find attractive or disgusting yet his are the features the viewers must treat seriously more to say they are the ones we all must accept that is why one is led to a peculiar gently wild erotically unique world of the main character although he sleeps with lots of women there are two women that represent a sort of contrary worlds for nicola roberte groult romy schneider and marie paul jane birkin he manipulates them makes love to them cannot refrain from both desire for their bodies and desire for money yet he perceives them differently yet despite all of this 'adult maturity ' he is emotionally like a little boy who plays with a toy car on the table a sort of 'detailed insight into male mind ' in a comedy like way of course br br finally there are very good performances which makes le mouton enrage slightly underrated not only the aforementioned romy schneider does a brilliant job supplying the viewers with an extraordinary insight into her role but young jane birkin appears to be convincing in the role of young inexperienced streetwalker marie paul jean louis trintignant makes it possible to see nicola in the right way this artistic merit lying in performances goes with terrific music by camille saint saÃ«ns the tune that will ring in your ears for long therefore apart from some flaws of the movie like dated colors slow action sometimes possible clichÃ©s noticed by some viewers the merits should be found significant br br le mouton enrage in sum is a clear manifestation of contrary manipulative tools in life it is worth seeing as a moment in romy's career a prelude to strong eroticism a chain of contrary emotions of love and hatred appreciation and disgust compared to the first orgasm and the first angasm but aren't we humans 'viewers ' movie buffs built upon such contrasts
<START> i had the distinct displeasure of seeing this movie at the 2006 vancouver international film festival i have been attending this festival for over 5 years and i have certainly seen some poor movies on occasion however 'first bite' has reached a brand new low in film in spite of being shot in beautiful locations with the occasional exquisite close up of fabulous food the movie contorts an excessive number of plot twists and stilted characters until i was practically begging for it to end br br the lead actor david la haye completely failed to show any character development throughout the movie portraying a pompous chef from beginning to end additional sub plots such as eating disorders were developed so poorly and completely did not fit within any context that the movie had shown up to that point br br a theme of mysticism was used as a poor attempt to conceal a movie that achieves nothing goes nowhere and completely disappoints
<START> it's difficult to put into words the almost seething hatred i have of this film but i'll try br br every other word was an expletive the sex scenes were uncomfortable drugs were rampant and stereotyping was beyond the norm if not offensive to italian americans br br i'm not saying the acting was terrible because leguizamo sorvino brody espisito et al performed well but almost every character in the film i despised not since the bonfire of the vanities have i disliked every character on screen
