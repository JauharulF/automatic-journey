<START> well i like to be honest with all the audiences that i bought it because of kira's sex scenes but unfortunately i did not see much of them all sex scenes were short and done in haphazard manner along with all the weird and corny background music just like all other b movies it just doesn't look much like two people having sex there is a tiny bit of plot toward the end kira's new lover is a killer whoa how shocking why don't we nominate this movie for oscar award i can't imagine how bad the movie would look like if it were r rated mine is imported from uk rated 18 conclusion put it down and walk away so yon won't end up with being a moron like me br br score 2 10
<START> given the low budget and production limitations this movie is very good it is plausible realistic and shows how the csikos hungarian horsemen who lived on the plains puszta risked their lives to save a downed american pilot from the ruthless and savage nazis we are drawn into strong feelings for the young impressionable yet highly courageous boy who admires the american pilot if you're looking for special effects superman heroes and magical endings this movie is not for you if you want to feel what it must have been like to dodge the persistent amoral nazis and their lack of compassion then you will be enthralled by this movie i truly enjoyed it and for those who love horses dogs and humble helpful people who value freedom and those who aspire to that end this movie will be one you'll remember for a long time
<START> just watched it on sky tv missed the first half an hour i did wonder if it was a true story so watched it to the end there was no brief at the end to say what happened to everyone it did remind me of speed but at the end of the day i don't suppose it was released at the cinema as we did see the following error the goof that we saw was that they remove the bonnet hood and then later on there are two shots of the car with the police car in front trying to slow it down when the bonnet is back on it did have me on the edge of my seat especially when i thought the baby was going to hit the bridge and of course when the bridge wasn't going to be lowered and then it was i'm afraid i did burst into tears so it wasn't that bad
<START> sort of like a very primitive episode of general hospital set in a natal ward and one for tough cases at that this fast moving programmer has a satisfying emotional impact mainly because eric linden as the distraught young husband in the main plot is so palpably a wreck and with such good reason his expectant wife loretta young is brought to the ward at the beginning of a 20 year prison sentence for offing a lecher who probably had it coming to him ms young as always doesn't do anything to disinvite audience sympathy and she's a little too good to be true though sympathetic and lovely to look at of course her difficult pregnancy and relationships with the other girls of the ward form the heart of the movie and the outcome not an entirely happy one feels right aline macmahon one of the cinema's few perfect actresses in the apt words of film historian david thomson exudes warmth and authority as the head nurse and glenda farrell as a none too willing new mom of twins gets to croon frankie and johnny as a drunken lullaby frank mchugh figures in another subplot and he gets to show more range than warners usually permitted him it's scaled and paced modestly and linden's expectant dad panic stays with you for days this sort of part was often played for laughs but he's a terrified young kid in trouble and very persuasive
<START> i remember when this piece of trash came out all the newspapers were squawking about how it had taken barbra streisand years to get the film made well it couldn't have taken that many years the play only opened in 1975 eight years previously it made a broadway star of the great actress tovah feldshuh who probably should have been cast in the film but nooooo the great star barbra had to do it her way and with music no less this film is a total disaster from start to finish for one thing barbra was forty years old when she made it and she looked every minute of it there was no way anyone could possibly swallow her as a young girl yearning to study torah and then when she dresses up as a boy it gets campy i get the impression that streisand could not bear to be unattractive so she played around with the make up she is prettier as a boy than she is as a girl and as if that is not bad enough she gets involved with both her schoolmate avigdor mandy patinkin whose best moment is the shot of his naked rear end and his fiancÃ©e amy irving who does her usual sleepwalker routine a bit of schtick the poor woman always resorts to when the director ignores her and she does not know what she is doing yentl even goes so far as to marry the girl i won't even bother to mention the wedding night scene br br then there is the music nine totally forgettable songs all sung by streisand via voice over presumably as a look inside her mind and each one as intrusive and irritating as fingernails on a blackboard br br i won't say that streisand does not show a glimmer of promise as a director here some of the visuals are lovely patinkin's backside especially and she has a good eye for balance the problem with this movie is that she won't get out of her own way i did not believe her for one second in the title role she should never have added the songs and on top of that the whole mess goes on for two hours and fifteen minutes i was sick of the whole sorry mess after forty five minutes br br awful awful awful
<START> oh this is such a glorious musical there's a bit of miscasting frank sinatra is sorely miscast as the jewish nathan detroit though it only becomes evident on sue me which is a distinctly jewish song sadly the filmmakers decided to cut out one of the best songs from the show marry the man today and replaced it with an inferior sinatra showpiece with these two flaws in mind the movie is otherwise magnificent jean simmons shines as sarah brown marlon brando can't sing worth beans but pulls it off anyway stubby kaye wonderfully reprises his broadway role it was written for him damon runyon's language and pacing and humor come through quite well this is on my see it every chance i get list
<START> a nightmare on elm street the dream child the fifth installment in the nightmare on elm street series and the worst sequel ever in the series even worse than a nightmare on elm street 2 i was lucky enough to get the nightmare on elm street dvd box set for my birthday and i watched all the sequels the dream child was the worst without a doubt i was surprised too since they were doing so well with the last two sequels but i guess they just lost the charm the story was just ridicules and i wasn't happy with where it went alice just became more annoying she's not nancy or kirsten so her carrying this film on her own didn't work for me freddy is also loosing his scare this was just getting a bit silly br br alice is back and she's carrying a child she couldn't be happier with her life but freddy is also back and he's not going to be too light on her since she defeated him so easily in the fourth movie but anyways he wants her child and to be born into the world again did you ever wonder if freddy had parents too well that's what a nightmare on elm street the dream child investigates and alice soon finds out what freddy's childhood was like and that maybe that's the one thing that can defeat him br br a nightmare on elm street the dream child is just all in all a bad movie and an insult to the series i don't think anyone could be happy with this sequel just the story was really silly i mean it could have possibly worked but once again it was just executed the wrong way i know that if you're looking to see the sequels for the nightmare on elm street series you should watch it but i really wouldn't recommend it it's not worth it at least in my opinion br br 3 10
<START> this film was not nearly as much of a chore as i expected it to be there are a few seconds of brilliance in this somewhat idiotic hardcore ufo conspiracy paranoia fest most of the acting is mediocre but fairly typical for 1970s style stuff replete with pregnant pauses a photographer and a model witness some strange goings on in the woods and soon fall victim to these same goings on flying saucers are spotted more people disappear but is it the aliens or our own government's ultra secret group of cover up guys soon enough a reporter and a ufologist apparently modeled on the character of the writer director are drawn into this unraveling fiasco and become the target of the ultra secret agents who are as menacing as they are improbable and witless then the fun really begins br br the movie predictably makes about as much sense as the average ufo conspiracy theory but should be commended for taking itself so seriously the camera work is ok for a low budget film the pacing is pretty good the script is silly and absurd and there are continuity issues which are fun to look out for what are the few seconds of brilliance i mentioned honestly i can't say much you without writing a spoiler suffice to say that the end of the film is at least worth fast forwarding to if you can't take the middle
<START> i saw the movie last night here at home but i thought it was too long first of all second the things i saw in the movie were way too out of text to even have in this what i thought was going to be a comedy type movie like the rest before the things isn't funny in the movie fiancÃ© hitting his girlfriend beatings the movie was way too long talk about wanting to go to sleep and wondering when it will end when you wake up and still have it playing some of the things at the reunion were too much to capture like the lady singing i felt like i was almost watching a spiritual song show here come on perry you can do better then this
<START> i think micheal ironsides acting career must be over if he has to star in this sort of low budge crap surely he could do better than waste his time in this rubbish br br this movie could be far better if it had a good budget but it shows repeatedly through out the movie there is one scene at a outpost which looks like its outside the front of a railway station and i bet it was br br there is one scene which made give this movie a 3 and it shows the space craft landing and taking off over a lake surrounded by forests this was well done but the rest of the movie forget it br br there is another scene which looks like a engineering plant which i bet it and does not look like a space outpost as the character say it is br br this movie is stupid has a serious low budget makes no sense and god help micheal ironsides
<START> somewhere buried very deep inside this film is a half way decent movie trying to get out the only traces are a few early scenes in los angeles in a bar and a graveyard and thereafter a couple of pieces of production design like i say buried very deep one of the biggest challenges faced by movies involving the supernatural is how to have characters react believably in unbelievable situations annie mcenroe's reaction to being told that her sister presumably dee wallace from the first movie is was a werewolf is if i recall along the lines of oh really not one of the better responses to said challenge the non sequitirs continue as the story moves to trannsylvania in search of stirba the apparently self appointed queen of the werewolves as stirba sybil danning is the two best things in the movie yes even better than the werewolf group sex scene reb brown's acting and the oddly simian looking werewolf suits the end credits have assumed minor legend status and are available in all their glory at least until the censor finds them on youtube check them out to see why and remember the whole film makes about the same amount of sense if you happen to catch this on us television the credits have been re edited to replace the endlessly repeated shot of danning ripping off her top with another endlessly repeated shot of her ripping open a cloak only this time she has some kind of top on underneath it's a sort of absurdity cherry on top moment which defies satire
<START> interesting hardly the 'scientific evidence' the movie provides for its point which is basicly that jews are a cancer is so stupid and lame it's almost laughable if we didn't know what happened in that era br br important nah i can't imagine germans even at that horrid time would like or believe this movie compare it to riefenstahl's triumf des willens now that was i movie i was impressed with this is just silly garbage br br 'best' part is a scene from m one of my all time favorites where the jew as the announcer so eloquently keeps reminding us lorre plays a child molester and murderer in the eyes of these film makers only a depraved mind can do so uh huh didn't know m was hitler's favorite movie right br br no it's just plain stupid even for it's nazi propaganda genre 2 10
<START> this movie grabbed me with the incredible opening sequence which tricked me into a complete reversal of perspective so i was hooked by the time the title came on the theme of this movie is that everyone is acting trying to re invent themselves but not in a tricky way like identity or the usual suspects but in the way we all try to make whatever banal life we find ourselves in a little more interesting the scenes in the chicken warehouses are spectacular at one point jorgen who owns the chicken farm attends a seminar in laughing where he's the worst student his discomfort at this lets you see the depth of his yearning to change himself the movie made me wonder about the hidden mysteries that lie behind the surface of the most commonplace people i see every day there's not a lot of plot here guessing the old man's secret is pretty easy but the fascination lies in trying to guess what all the other characters will do when they figure it out this movie appealed to me in the same way that sideways did although the characters couldn't be more dissimilar
<START> this movie is awful at the end of it you will realize that several hours have been stolen from your life that you can't get back the twist ending is very contrived the character development leading up to this ending is not consistent with their final actions at the conclusion ninety minutes of preparation with the premise that the rob lowe character will die on christmas eve is explained away in literally ninety seconds of no we were just tricking you then the rob lowe character is not even upset about it i will forgive you if you can forgive me is as upset as he gets if someone took weeks to convince me i was about to die and then said no sorry just fooling you i would raise some serious hell i don't feel bad about giving away the spoiler because i might be able to save some of you out there from watching please save yourself and don't watch this movie
<START> disney goes to the well one too many times as anybody who has seen the original little mermaid will feel blatantly ripped off celebrating the birth of their daughter melody ariel and eric plan on introducing her to king triton the celebration is quickly crashed by ursula 's sister morgana who plans to use melody as a defense tool to get the king 's trident stopping the attack ariel and eric build a wall around the ocean while melody grows up wondering why she cannot go in there br br awful and terrible is what describes this direct to video sequel little mermaid 2 gives you that feeling everything you watch seemed to have come straight other disney movies i guess disney can only plagiarize itself do not tell me that the penguin and walrus does not remind you of another duo from the lion king br br other disappointing moments include the rematch between sebastien and louie the royal chef they terribly under played it the climax between morgana and everyone seemed to be another disappointment br br i will not give anything away but in 75 minutes everything seemed incredibly cramped and too much to handle an embarrassment to disney little mermaid 2 is better left to rent and laugh at then you can prepare for the rest of the other sequels disney is going to drown you in later on
<START> this was the worst movie i've ever seen in theaters it was just a compilation of recycled material people getting hit in the head is not funny people getting kicked is not funny after the third time a guy got kicked in the balls not even the youngest audience member was laughing anymore it just got tired fast br br i went with my younger sister she actually laughs out loud at king of the hill but this cinematic masterpiece bored her i'm not surprised the story is pretty lame a midget thief steals a big diamond in what was definitely the easiest heist in hollywood history then he hides out with a family pretending to be a baby i know it sounds exciting but that's the whole story say those two lines over and over for 1 5 hours and you'll get the picture there were predictable jokes galore i really felt ripped off after seeing this i wasn't expecting much and i was still disappointed i wish keenan would just hire some decent writers to write jokes and or his next script this was even worse than white chicks if that is possible i've seen high school plays that were better and cheaper br br there wasn't anything positive about this movie i don't like my entertainment to be dumbed down
<START> this incredibly formulaic flick from the walker texas ranger squad contains some of the most unbelievable scenes ever witnessed within a tv movie in addition one can pretty much predict the outcome from the get go however it's a fun little movie that gets the job done it entertains that's all it was meant to do and it does so the stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot isn't half bad the acting is also decent which isn't much of a surprise because everyone knows that chuck norris is no steven seagal if you're a fan of the genre and of walker texas ranger you will definitely love this if not then don't waste your time 8 10
<START> things to come is an early sci fi film that shows an imagined world or everytown through 100 years you can break it up into about 4 different scenes or parts the film spans from 1940 to 2036 and is mainly about how this ruler or the boss wanted to get the capability to fly in airplanes again after everytown was bombed and war broke out br br this film only has about 3 faults it's audio is muddy and video had some quirks the characters aren't deep at all and the overall plot isn't altogether solid the plot is lacking something that i can't put my finger on it just seems a little fluffy but if you love sci fi and are interested in what h g wells though might happened in the next hundred years this is a must see it's worth seeing just to learn of what everyone was fearing a long drawn out war because they were just about to go to war with germany and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything br br things to come is a pretty good movie that most people need to see once
<START> 'the fox and the child' is the new film by french director luc jacquet who brought us the oscar winning documentary 'march of the penguins ' it focuses around a young girl wonderfully played by bertille noÃ«l bruneau and her blooming friendship with a fox br br there are some truly mesmerizing moments here badgers mucking about a lynx chasing the fox through a snow littered forest one scene in particular when the fox is being tormented by a pack of wolves is quite intense and even frightening at times however there's simply not quite enough of them br br beautifully shot the cinematography is dazzling the bubbly kind of look of the film is wonderful it's undeniably a very lush production br br the english version is narrated by kate winslet but what little dialogue there already is has been very poorly dubbed the score is also far too fluffy or at least it is for my liking and the screenplay while subtle seemingly jumps from one scenario to another ultimately leaving me almost baffled br br while there's a nice moral at the heart of the film and the rather quiet performance from noÃ«l bruneau is quite lovely the real star is the fox those captivating moments focusing solely around our furry little friend are tremendous however again there's simply not nearly enough of them br br to keep up to date with all the latest in film including reviews news discussions and more be sure to visit www mybluray com au
<START> i have no idea what on earth or beyond could have possibly made sam mraovich believe that this would have been a worthy project to undertake ben arthur is one of the worst movies ever made in fact i see no reason why it should not be at 1 on the bottom 100 for although i have not seen for example superbabies baby geniuses 2 5 at the time of this publication i would venture to guess that that film is considerably better than this oozing wound because even in its vapid dismalness at least baby geniuses 2 was professionally made by contrast everything and i do mean everything in this film is completely unprofessional br br the movie is intended to be an attack on the christian right's supposed bigotry and hatred toward gays and i do emphasize intended not only does it completely and utterly fail at its purpose it also leaves an ugly scar instead of creating a compelling and realistic portrait of a gay couple's struggle against a society that largely opposes them it creates tired crass stereotypes of each party involved ben and arthur the namesake couple are portrayed as two crude sex starved and hopelessly romantic cardboard cutouts who marry when the laws change to allow them to do so this meets with the opposition of ben's brother victor a christian minister who like all christians as this movie would have us believe is loud prying stupid and violent he tries to kill ben and arthur after his associations with them get him kicked out of the ministry just like in real life and if you think that's dreadful it is you haven't seen it all br br the actors here manage to completely destroy any vestige of credibility in this movie by saying their lines as if they were narrating a youtube home comedy video but not even daniel day lewis and marlon brando as the title characters could have saved this clunker for there would still be the matter of the completely inane and laugh inducing dialogue that fills every minute of the movie every scene has at least one awkward or misplaced quote for example in one scene victor tries to complain about not being able to have nieces or nephews because of his brother's homosexuality but instead of portraying this idea clearly he spits out the stupid utterly confusing whiny sounding line you know what i'm never going to have any nieces or nephews okay because you're so f ed up br br even more glaring is the complete lack of production values yes i know this ain't the dark knight but even amateur film makers should know some basics about special effects and editing for example six dots of red cake dye do not suffice for realistic bullet wounds people do not teleport across a room between takes and objects do not fall forward when shot br br do not waste your money on ben arthur i don't care if you're 7 17 or 107 i don't care if you're gay straight bi or undecided i don't care if you're just curious i don't care what pathetic reason you may have to be tempted to buy this dung heap stay away far away this movie's only redeeming quality is its ability to be used as a frisbee
