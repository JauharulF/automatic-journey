<START> yet another insult and slap in the face to gay men everywhere this lame attempt at a comedy has nothing to recommend it once again we have an attractive 'straight' hero who supposedly can't get any woman to be interested in him yeah right and we're also presented with the 'sympathetic attractive' gay friend who is actually a fat balding ugly old man whom the lead is supposed to find attractive even i didn't find him appealing and i'm a fat ugly old gay man but thankfully not balding whatever acting talent there may be here has been thrown away on a bad script and truly awful direction mr sneedeker should be banned from filmdom but then he's no different than the countless other hacks working in hollyweed
<START> lillian hellman one of america's most famous women playwrights was a woman with a mission her leftist views were not well regarded at the time in the country in her memoir she recounts her trip to the then soviet union as she was intrigued with the so called successes achieved by that system watch on the rhine must have come as a result of those years the left wing in america as all over the world had an issue with the rise of fascism not only in europe but in japan as well br br watch on the rhine was a play produced on broadway eight months before the pearl harbor attack by the japanese in it ms hellman was heralding america's entrance in world war ii the adaptation is credited to ms hellman and dashiell hammett her long time companion as directed for the screen by herman shumlin the film was well received when it premiered in 1943 br br we are introduced to the muller family when the film opens they are crossing the border to the united states from mexico they are to continue toward mrs muller's home in washington d c where her mother fanny farrelly is a minor celebrity hostess the mullers we realize are fleeing europe because of the persecution there against the opponents of the advancing totalitarian regime in germany in fact we thought in a way the mullers could have been better justified if they were jewish fleeing from a sure extermination br br we find out that mr muller has had a terrible time in his native land as well as in other places because his outspokenness in denouncing fascim little does he know that he is coming to his mother in law's house that is housing one of the worst exponents of that philosophy br br the film offers excellent acting all around it is a curiosity piece because of bette davis' supporting role paul lukas repeating his broadway role is quite convincing as kurt muller the upright man that wants to make a better world for himself and his family mr lukas does a great job portraying kurt muller repeating the role that made him a stage luminary on broadway br br the other best performance is by lucile watson who plays fanny farrelly the matriarch of this family geraldine fitzgerald is seen as marthe de brancovis a guest of the farrellys married to the contemptible teck de brancovis a nazi sympathizer played by george coulouris beulah bondi donald woods and the rest of the supporting cast give good performances guided by mr shumlin br br the film should serve as a reminder about the evils of totalitarian rule no matter where
<START> the secret fury in many ways a run of the mill romantic suspense drama directed by mel ferrer boasts top notch principals in colbert and ryan it stays puzzling if not quite gripping until towards the end when implausibility conquers suspension of disbelief as so often it does in this genre but for some viewers the film's highlight will be the portrayal of blowsy leah by vivian vance the immortal ethel mertz on i love lucy oddly vance had very few film roles her true home was broadway where among other gigs she understudied for ethel merman here she contributes a winning turn as a chambermaid suborned to play a minor part in a nefarious scheme watch her half heartedly trying to wave away the smoke when she's puffing a furtive cigarette in the hotel's linen storage room a transgression for which she ultimately pays the supreme penalty
<START> absolutely dreadful mexican film supposedly based on a short story by edgar allan poe about a newsman wanting to go into the confines of an asylum hidden in the woods to write a story about how it works etc when our hero gaston is given the grand show by dr maillard head of the asylum we see all kinds of things which are suppose to be horrific such as men hanging around long in a dungeon and comedic such as our hero being joked upon by soldiers as he climbs down a ladder hanging over the side of a building then there is one sight which might have been meant to be both a human man dressed as a chicken yes that's right a chicken that pecks around the ground for chicken feed the scene was to be a comedic highlight of the film but at least for me it was the film's low point and really most revolting when you considered that grown men and women thought this might even be remotely entertaining ah that is indeed the real horror that is dr tarr and his legion of name changes and that brings me to this salient fact about the film which is most films that undergo multiple title changes usually have some kind of serious problem yes this is obvious but some have distribution problems and others of which this is one have numerous title changes so that someone might unsuspectingly buy the same garbage more than once this is definitely garbage it has very little going for it the only performer worth having a look at is claudio brook as the head of the asylum he is one huge slab of ham as he laughs maniacally bellows orders sashays with sword in hand and praises the chicken i got so tired of hearing him talk about the soothing system as his means to cure the mentally sick what a bunch of ludicrosity hey a film like this with a script like this deserves this kind of word it won't take you long to figure out what is going on in the asylum nor will it be any more interesting cinematic chicken scratch
<START> i went to see this movie at our college theater thirty years ago because i liked bruce dern in silent running and family plot to this day sorry jack nicholson it is still the dullest movie i've ever seen it just went on and on with no discernible point and then it just ended the lights came up and i watched everyone looking around in confusion had the projectionist missed a reel i've never had the urge to find out all i remember about the movie is that it was a non drama about some annoying college basketball players and their coach the most enjoyable part of the movie was watching the totally mystified audience afterwords fortunately this was just an exception for jack bruce and karen black
<START> this movie is not very good in fact it is the worst elvis movie i have seen it has very little plot mostly partying beer drinking and fighting burgess meredith and thomas gomez are wasted i don't know why they did this movie you could say elvis was wasted as well he is much much better in follow that dream
<START> firstly i have heard great things about this film not least among the retro vintage scene and the stockings lovers who absolutely love bettie page and it did not disappoint shot in very clean black and white with colour added for key scenes the film gives a documentary feel to the early life and career of bettie page br br there are many things i did not know about page firstly there was the gang rape later on there is her early attempts at developing an acting career and then glamour pictures firstly with a camera club peopled with men who can't get enough of her and later with the klaws paula and irving who despite their taking of bondage and fetish photos come across as extremely pleasant and friendly people if only modern pornography producers were like that perhaps better porn would be a consequence for the most part the film is neither a diatribe against the evils of pornography but an attempt to show the kind of environment that existed in the 1950s for those producing fetish and nude pictures of women this environment was extremely repressive perhaps in a good way because it meant that there was none of the 'saturation' effect that we have today when it comes to pornography it also appeared to be much less harsh page comes across as someone who enjoys her work and doesn't appear to be degraded by it in many of her photos she is seen tied up and gagged and trying to hold a conversation brandishing a whip with a flourish thus exciting the photographers taking her pictures and seen in 'initiation style' girlie bondage movies which look quite tame compared with the hardcore stuff we have now br br page never became an actress and instead deserted pinup when she was in her thirties for 'jesus christ' her belief in god and jesus never goes away even when bound and gagged she still insists that she has been given a 'gift' by god to do 'this thing' seeing this film i am more knowledgeable about page and in awe at her modesty beliefs and demeanour she is one of a kind compared with the identi kit clone blondes we have today and someone who can actually say 'there is life after porn'
<START> there's something wonderful about the fact that a movie made in 1934 can be head and shoulders above every tarzan movie that followed it including the bloated and boring 1980s piece greystoke once the viewer gets past the first three scenes which are admittedly dull tarzan and his mate takes off like a shot offering non stop action humor and romance maureen o'sullivan is charming and beautiful as jane and walks off with the movie weismuller is solid as well highly recommended
<START> any movie that has nude scenes of karen allen and i'm still so bored i walk out that is a stinker br br karen gets stuck in paris and befriends a sissily handsome french man with whom she is having sex soon of course he's married but cheri why should that be a problem what could be an interesting clash of cultures is believe it or not just dull i walked out br br maybe the movie got a lot better after i left but it would have had to have gotten a lot better to make up for a rotten beginning br br my advice if you find yourself in this run do not walk for the exit save your time and your energy most assuredly save your money it's a shame the production company didn't save its money
<START> it was interesting to see how accurate the writing was on the geek buzz words yet very naive on the corporate world the justice department would catch more of the big corp giants if they did such naive things to win the real corporate world is much more subtle and interesting yet every bit as sinister i seriously doubt any corp would actually kill someone directly even the mod is more indirect these days in the real world they do kill people with nicotine pollution additives poisons etc this movie must have been developed by some garage geeks i think and the studios didn't know the difference they just wanted something to capitalize on the microsoft antitrust case in the news
<START> i was babysitting a family of three small children for a night and their mother gave me this to show for them having just grabbed it at wal mart earlier in the week all three children actually got physically ill while watching it i'm pretty sure it was the pizza they ate or something they all had picked up from school but really it could have been this film absolutely disgusting how any one can produce this caliber of trash is beyond me fortunately i turned off the film when i noticed the children were not responding and acting strangely for any parents out there i strongly advise you to refrain from letting young children view this movie
<START> early film directed by d w griffith it features a gloriously happy king arthur v johnson and his queen marion leonard but wait when the king leaves the scene his queen makes music with the palace's minstrel henry b walthall when the king discovers the lovers he decides to enact a horrific edgar allen poe type revenge it's difficult to believe the lovers can't hear those plotting against them although the actors are trying to look alternately noisy the lovers and quiet the cement mixers the sets make the sealed room look very staged the performances are okay and the story is easy to follow br br the sealed room 9 2 09 d w griffith arthur v johnson henry b walthall marion leonard
<START> this movie is not good the first one almost sucked but had that unreal ending to make it worth watching this one has nothing there's zero scare zero tension or suspense this isn't really a horror movie most of the kills don't show anything there's no gore to speak of this could almost be a tv except for a bit of nudity and a bit of violence the acting is not very good either and don't get me started on the dialogue as for the surprise ending surprise there isn't one i suppose it could have been worse although i don't see how but then again it is less than 80 minutes long so i guess that's a good thing although it felt a lot longer apparently this is the cut version of the film i found it for a very cheap price but it still not worth it if you want the uncut more graphic version check out the anchor bay edition anyway this version of sleepaway camp ii unhappy campers gets a big fat 1 10 from me p s if you watch this movie you will probably be a bored and unhappy camper if you are a real fan you might want to pick up anchor bay's sleepaway camp with survival kit three disc collection containing the first three movies uncut and with special features
<START> ha without a doubt tommy's the evil one here i don't know why but for some reason little kids in horror movies tend to come across as little butt munches and since they're kids they won't die because they're annoying well except for asylum of terror but those are few and far between br br anyway onto the movie can't find this movie on dvd sure you can all you have to do is buy the chilling classics dvd pack not only do you get metamorphosis on dvd for 15 but you also get 49 other movies what a bargain pff ok i'm done advertising for these cheesy movies let's just say this movie ain't worth the 15 bucks on its own br br so we have a chemist scientist yeah cause all chemist scientists look as handsome as this guy playing peter he's trying to come up with a serum to stop deterioration of the body the college he works at wants to pull the plug on his project so he tries it on himself but because this is a horror movie he sucks it up and starts and incredibly long transformation sequence that takes nearly 3 4 of the movie br br to pad out the movie he gets into a relationship with some woman who has a son and she was never married scandalous but of course tommy is one of the most irritating characters no i take it back he is the most irritating character far worse than the old crippled guy who wants to take over peter's work and gloats over him while he's in the hospital that's right even as an old cripple you can still be the villain br br so we see peter start to randomly kill some people in visions he has until he realizes he's the one doing it and just decides to kill everyone in his path to get back to normal however at the end he ends up de evolving into a lizard yeah i know don't ask the ending really doesn't make any sense and if you're hoping for any really good payoff you're not going to get it br br this isn't a horrible movie it's just frustrating because of the lack of a good payoff if you already own the 50 movie pack and this is next on your list you're not in for a snoozer but you're also not in for a great movie just sit back relax and eat a lot of snack food because this movie isn't going to be making you jump out of your skin anytime soon br br metamorphosis gets 4 plastic lizard heads out of 10
<START> such energy and vitality you just can't go wrong with busby berkley films and this certainly must be his best of course the choreography is wonderful but also the banter between cagney and blondell is so colorful and such a delight don't miss this one
<START> one of the lamer wedding movies you'll see smacks too too much of its time period so it was out of date before it hit the theaters the ethnic stereotypes are like a henny youngman joke except they just aint in the least bit funny here molly ringwald well what else needs to be said give you a clue to the silliness she destroys a 10 000 wedding dress because it just won't be me makes it into this rag with straps and puts on a top hat and everyone smiles cutely at her moxy rather than ringwalding her neck its a helluva a cast too check out how heavy ally sheedy is wheeeew
<START> an american in paris is a showcase of gene kelly watch as gene sings acts and dances his way through paris in any number of situations some purely majestic others pure corn one can imagine just what kelly was made of as he made this film only a year before singin' in the rain he is definately one of the all time greats it is interesting to look at the parallels between the two films especially in kelly's characters the only main difference being that one is based in paris the other in l a br br some have said that leslie caron's acting was less than pure perhaps cyd charisse who was originally intended for the role could have done better however caron is quite believable in the role and has chemistry with kelly oscar levant's short role in this film gave it just what it needed someone who doesn't look like gene kelly filling the role as the everyman isn't an easy task yet levant did it with as much class as any other lead br br the song and dance routines are all perfection even the overlong ballet at the end of the film makes it a better film with it than without seeing that there really wasn't much screen time to make such a loving relationship believable minnelli used this sequence to make it seem as if you'd spent four hours with them ingenious br br i would have to rate this film up with singin' since it is very similar in story and song singin' would barely get the nod because of debbie reynolds uplifting performance br br full recommendation br br 8 10 stars
<START> there is an old saying that relates to the rousing new film by joe johnston that goes something like this the man who thinks he can and the man who thinks he can't are both right that is a highly presumptuous statement referring to self motivating and belief in an individual which in this movie stand true even after road blocks and family trouble stand in the way br br october sky is about a young man who believes in himself named homer hickam growing up in a strict traditional family in the 1950's homer loves in a small coal mining town where nearly every man grows up to be a miner all of his friends quentin roy and o'dell all think that their life after high school will be like everyone else's homer is not exited about that future br br one night while everyone stares at the sky a russian space craft called sputnik passes overhead this is something new for homer and he finds it spectacular and overwhelming from this point on his look at life will never be the same br br first he tells everyone that he wants to work in the rocket scientist area for an occupation flabbergasted at what he says his family passes that idea over their heads and continues with life as usual his friends however think that this idea may have some potential after all quentin is a very smart individual when it comes to this kind of thing br br when the four friends start to test model rockets and blow a white picket fence to smithereens then what seems to be a forest fire is scared by them they're forced to end their progresses br br the performances in this movie are absolutely riveting from start to finish all of the actors give performances as if this is the real mumbo jumbo here standing out in all of the glory laura dern as miss riley this very well may be academy award material if the judges can remember back to the beginning of the year when this film is released br br the characters are also extremely well developed not only to the filmmakers give clear apparent reason why homer is interested in the subject but they also explain to the audience how they are succeeding in their studding of rocketry we clearly understand all of the characters' motives and beliefs especially the father who is bent over on everlasting tradition br br the film unfortunately loses some of its momentum at mid point because of a silly recycled romantic sub plot involving homer's love interest and how his brother stole her from him this type of this is becoming so awfully common in high school movies not that this film is aimed at high schoolers the actors stare at each other mindlessly like the are in a trance i put up with it without complaining in 1997's inventing the abbots but i have had just about enough this br br but that is just a minor complaint with an authentic looking time period cinematography worth an oscar and clips of the real life homer and friends at the end whom all hit it big with their dreams especially homer this is the first great film of 1999 br br
<START> this is a typical low budget 1970's mess it's supposed to be a docudrama about a crew hunting bigfoot through the pacific northwest every character is a stereotype from the native american to the cynical cowboy the acting and narration are a complete joke if you're hoping to see a lot of bigfoot footage keep hoping there won't be much and what there is you could do in your backyard with a cheap costume and a camcorder it would look better than this movie br br it's not that i don't like 1970's low budge fare i do it's that this is such a mess of bad acting bad characters lousy story and no thrills that you just can't enjoy it it does not fit into the so bad it's good category nor can you get a laugh out of how bad it is without the help of illicit substances it's mostly a lot of boring footage of the people camping hiking riding horses and watching wild life there is a bigfoot attack which is completely stupid supposedly our friend sasquatch is throwing rocks down on the campers from above while they fire their rifles back at him by that point you are rooting heavily for bigfoot to drops some rocks on the filmmaker's heads and stop the whole thing
<START> i'm feeling a little protective of this film because it was my introduction to the u n c l e verse the year was 1972 and i t v ran all eight features in one bumper run followed by re runs of 'the persuaders' starring tony curtis and roger moore on saturday evenings 'the karate killers' was chosen to open the season it commenced with a cool action sequence as solo and kuryakin's sports car got attacked by a squadron of thrush mini copters i was a fan for life from that moment on br br after the main credits nice to see a special title sequence here instead of the usual practice of slowing down action footage we go to the laboratory of dr simon true jim boles inventor of a new formula to extract gold from seawater true's wife amanda joan crawford has been having an affair with thrush agent randolph herbert lom a ruthless fellow indeed he kills both the doctor and his wife before hunting for the formula true has prepared for the event he has divided it into five segments each written on a photograph of himself and sent it to his five daughters all of whom are scattered throughout the world br br solo and kuryakin set out to get the formula first leading to a string of episodes in different locations and cameos from the likes of telly savalas as a tight fisted italian count terry thomas and curt jurgens one of dr true's daughters sandy kim darby accompanies the u n c l e boys on their global quest br br having assembled the formula thrush turns up and makes them hand it over before whisking them off to their secret base at the north pole br br of all the u n c l e feature films this is the one i feel should have been produced specially for the cinema it hurts by being a television product albeit even one more slightly expensive than usual no location filming was done and the various segments come across as repetitive usually culminating in a scrap between u n c l e and thrush of the cast joan crawford is memorably hammy in her small role and curt jurgens badly miscast as a sugar daddy as a london bobby terry thomas is as delightful as ever and herbert lom good as the chief villain kim darby grates though as 'sandy' she should have been told to stay at home br br what is surprising about this is that it manages to be more amusing and entertaining than many official cinema releases of the time including 'in like flint' 'casino royale' and 'the ambushers' i'd love to know how solo and company escaped from thrush h q after randolph's death though
