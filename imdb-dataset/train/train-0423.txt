<START> i've just returned from a showing of my left foot at our public library what an emotional experience i feel drained and uplifted br br it's the story of christy brown irish writer and painter and based on the author's autobiographical my left foot christy was born with a form of cerebral palsy such that the only limb he had good control of was his left foot doctors advised his parents he was hopelessly mentally retarded but his mother didn't give up on him and somewhat as annie sullivan had done with helen keller helped him achieve a breakthrough in which he learned the alphabet and then to read write and paint br br this film won academy awards for daniel day lewis best actor as well as best supporting actress for the actress playing his mother it also received oscar nominations for best picture best director and best adapted screenplay br br as a retired clinical psychologist and family therapist while many films may entertain me many also often leave me having to overlook gross fictions or improbabilities in realistic psychological reactions br br not this film it was absolutely spot on in portraying typical irish parental roles behaviors see e g see typical irish families in mcgoldrick's ethnicity family therapy as well christy brown's uneven emotional maturation some immature personality reactions that were even further amplified by his picking up traits of his father br br the film presents the greater truth while changing certain sequences in his development painting writing and condensing several important people into one person for the sake of telling a coherent believable story not burdened by small distracting less important actualities see christy brown in wikipedia for more accuracy the dvd version we were shown had some english subtitles that were a great help in understanding christy's speech some of the irish speech the initial release of the film may have lacked this if you see this on dvd enable that option br br the performance by daniel day lewis is one of the greatest believable acting jobs i've ever seen truly magnificent outstanding superlative br br my left foot bears more than some similarity to a more recent film the diving bell the butterfly in that each portrays the life of a real person successfully surmounting the imprisonment and isolation of an extremely severe physical handicap br br and in doing so it resonates with william ernest henley's invictus which begins out of the night that covers me black as the pit from pole to pole i thank whatever gods may be for my unconquerable soul
<START> i recently may 2008 discovered that this childhood favorite was available as a dvd although i've seen a great deal of high quality movies since then late 70's i was 10 in 1978 this three episode low budget thing still stands strong br br what's fun is that i now watched it with my 10 year old daughter and she experiences just the same as i remember from back then the creepy music she had to hold my hand even though she's been raised with watching lotr and resident evil the ever changing theories of who the culprit actually is and also complaining about the theatrical voices from an era before norway discovered the difference between stage acting and movie acting br br this is the one and only good science fiction movie or series ever made in norway and it's still worth watching
<START> i agree totally with another of the reviewers here who was pleased for the birds won the oscar in 2002 for best animated short not this sick material which is pretentious at best and appealing to anyone of course who has no belief in heaven or hell br br the animation was good but so are a lot of animated shorts and by the way i love dark humor but this just was unappealing from the start br br as for the story here a guy walking around and surrounded by nothing but grey symbolism here is told by a tv set which appears every few hundred yards away that he is in either heaven hell or purgatory each time he puts a gun to his head and shoots himself after hearing the news i guess that would be funny in two of the three instances
<START> the penultimate episode of star trek's third season is excellent and a highlight of the much maligned final season essentially spock mccoy and kirk beam down to sarpeidon to find the planet's population completely missing except for the presence of a giant library and mr atoz the librarian all 3 trek characters soon accidentally walk into a time travel machine into different periods of sarpeidon's past spock gives a convincing performance as an ice age vulcan who falls in love for zarabeth while kirk reprises his unhappy experience with time travel see the 'city on the edge of forever' when he is accused of witchcraft and jailed before escaping and finding the doorway back in time to sarpeidon's present in the end all 3 trek characters are saved mere minutes before the beta niobe star around sarpeidon goes supernova the enterprise warps away just as the star explodes br br ironically as william shatner notes in his book star trek memories this show was the source of some dispute since leonard nimoy noticed that no reason was given in lisette's script for the reason why spock was behaving in such an emotional way nimoy relayed his misgivings here directly to the show's executive producer fred freiberger that vulcans weren't supposed to fall in love p 272 however freiberger reasoned the ice age setting allowed spock to experience emotions since this was a time when vulcans still had not evolved into their completely logical present state this was a great example of improvisation on freiberger's part to save a script which was far above average for this particular episode while shatner notes that the decline in script quality for the third season hurt spock artistically since his character was forced to bray like a donkey in plato's stepchildren play music with hippies in the way to eden or sometimes display emotion the script here was more believable spock's acting here was excellent as freiberger candidly admitted to shatner p 272 the only obvious plot hole is the fact that since both spock and mccoy travelled thousands of years back in time mccoy too should have reverted to a more primitive human state not just spock but this is a forgivable error considering the poor quality of many other season 3 shows the brilliant spock mccoy performance and the originality of this script who could have imagined that the present inhabitants of sarpeidon would escape their doomed planet's fate by travelling into their past this is certainly what we came to expect from the best of 'classic trek' a genuinely inspired story br br shatner in 'memories' named some of his best unusual and high quality shows of season 3 as the enterprise incident day of the dove is there in truth no beauty the tholian web and the children shall lead and the paradise syndrome p 273 while my personal opinion is that 'and the children shall lead' is a very poor episode while 'is there in truth no beauty' is problematic all our yesterdays certainly belongs on the list of top season three star trek tos films i give a 9 out of 10 for 'all our yesterdays '
<START> my name is domino harvery edit dizzying chop my my my name is domino harvey cut chop my name is domino harvey edit cut playback br br never have i seen a director take so much flack for his style before by now it is evident that most people do not appreciate tony scott's choppy flashy dizzying editing technique if i have to choose between loving it and hating it i'd say i love it it was borderline distracting at times but the end result was pretty good and it's nice to see a director with a creative edge to his style and some originality even if it borrows heavily from mtv videos br br this stylistic edge manifests itself as keira knightley plays the role of cocky badass bounty hunter domino harvey and even her dialogue seems strangely choppy otherwise she plays her poorly because i pretty much hated her character and did not sympathize one bit with her no matter how much she suffered we follow domino through her life as she joins up with fellow bounty hunters mickey rourke rizwan abbasi and edgar ramirez the crew become tangled up in the fbi and suddenly has a reality show contract under christopher walken's tv production company what is christopher walken doing in every film by the way i guess that is a clever film technique because now tony scott is free to use as much flashy mtv reality show editing footage as he likes it becomes a pastiche of mtv culture at this point br br it followes then that the story is told at an amazingly rapid fire pace with lots of raunchy strong language and gun violence there are some funny jokes it's all very modern and surreal at the same time it's a mess but it's a rather enjoyable mess it is ultimately flawed in so many ways the actors try too hard to make their characters cool for one but it works i give it a weak 7 10 which may seem generous when compared to the general consensus of movie goers who graded this film Â but i feel it had some good ideas and executed them well br br 7 out of 10
<START> that is no criticism of the film but rather a comment on how blind we are to our own past br br i recently watched winter soldier and the ground truth was like watching a remake or sequel except it was about iraq rather than vietnam similar to winter soldier because of it's one sided message both films illustrate how gleefully we rush to engage in conflicts based on false pretenses and allow our young and brave and often naive to bear the brunt of this greedy war profiteering both films effectively show that the mentality forced into the minds of the young and willing make them efficient killing machines but the training falls woefully short of teaching the diplomatic and policing skills necessary to effectively win the hearts and minds of the people they're supposedly fighting for this is ultimately what lost the war in vietnam and will likely lose the war in iraq as well br br my only negative comment is that the film is so one sided it could be easily passed off as left wing propaganda not by me mind you but by those aiming to discredit the film and message a more balanced point of view would speak to a larger audience
<START> a wonderful film filled with great understated performance and sharp intelligent dialogue what really distinguishes the film however is that undercurrent of sadness throughout the story is underscored by affairs loneliness suicide disappointment the fear of losing ones job in a world where that had disastrous consequences most of all it was set in a world that no longer existed having been ripped apart by the beginning of world war ii in fact the film is barely a comedy at all if you compare the percentage of serious scenes to the comic scenes yet funny it is listen to margaret sullivan's harsh dismissal of jimmy stewart and watch his pained expression as he replies that her comments were a remarkable blend of poetry and meanness it's funny pointed and sad all at once a remarkable achievement and one of the ten greatest screen comedies ever made
<START> i rented this film because of my interest in american history and especially the somewhat weird story of the mormons this movie attempts to make some sense out of how joseph smith could turn his vision into a major world religion it first focuses on the troubles the mormons had in their settlement at navuoo illinois it portrays the trial of joseph smith within the course of that trial brigham young stands up to tell of his conversion to mormonism and of his belief in the spiritual message of smith then smith is assassinated and young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the mormons to a new land despite his grave doubts he perseveres and finally has a vision that utah is the place for his colony that gives him confidence in the rightness of his leadership later as crops are destroyed by crickets he again doubts that he has truly been chosen however a miracle occurs which cements his place in history br br i found the performances to be moving and the story to be convincing and interesting i would love to know whether mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal polygamy is a part of the story but the reasons why this is central to lds are not raised the issue is not emphasized br br i'm sure people stay away from this movie because of its religious subject matter but it has a great cast and will hold your interest throughout
<START> jeremy northam's characterization of the stuttering mild mannered bookish morgan sullivan and watching him let loose bits and pieces of his real identity under the influence of single malt scotches and under the spell of lucy liu's presence is brilliantly crafted and a joy to watch his offering her a cigarette at the bar is an old habit done without thinking or even asking and he becomes lost in her face neck and lips no matter the brainwashing love has a way of persevering love also cannot be brainwashed in with either of his two fake wives in gradual stages he begins to dispense with his glasses to walk and talk differently and even his face looks different as the movie progresses the music is fantastic hypnotic sexy and appropriately driving at times the extensive use of black and white and grey tones makes this almost a sci fi film noir in the tradition of many classic thrillers i would have liked to have seen more vulnerability in lucy liu's portrayal whenever she sees him in his various frazzled states the man she loves and for whom she is performing a mission based on blind faith some restrained vulnerability and flashes of genuine sympathy and concern would have made it a less one dimensional performance on her part she is just no match for northam's talents but all in all i thoroughly enjoyed this film and would enjoying knowing about other screenplays written by the same author
<START> at first i didn't like the movie cause of it being a nazi swastika drama but after buying it and seeing it it wasn't that bad i heard so many complaints about the numbers being short and ilse werner not singing now i understand the radio show was a super propaganda radio program ilse johanne and zara plus rudy shruki and band like kurt widman and his orchestra and fud cantics ex cetera never appeared in the radio show cause the singers and the bands were of the pop jazz and swing categories the club foot had that regulated that for touring occupied areas for the soldiers to short wave radios for the soldiers also night clubs and hotels in berlin and hamburg and record sales only this is why ilse wasn't allowed to sing in this picture this would be made up by medium budget musical were making music 1942 in which she would demonstrate her whistling but this is an excellent example propaganda inge and her aunt eichhorn played by ida wust goes to the 1936 olympics the aunt forgets her tickets so inge has to wait till her aunt comes back with the tickets she meets carle radditz who plays herbert who has an extra ticket she goes with him and it's love at first sight they plan to marry but the spanish war get in the way so he has to go on an assignment against the right side carl raddatz as so many people complained about him was really handsome and not plain when he did opfergang and they put a mustache on him plus his own suntan that made him plain looking you see the nazi soldiers acting normal like a scene in which a ex butcher and his troops are in france and they steal pigs from a farm and they are about to make lunch until their leader suggest to save the pigs this reflect adolphs animal rights extremism the character was a butcher now soldier this was a subtle put down against meat eating late on in world war 11 herbert is flying in a german airplane we shoot one of the pilots so herbert takes over we shoot his plane they crash unfortunately for us they survive another seen the nazis soldiers go in a bomb catholic church now it's putting the catholics down and hubert's best friend helmet played by joachim brennecke starts to play the organ beethtoven more bombs come in from us the church is bomb more the soldier continues to stay and play the organ he's being told to leave we end up injuring him propaganda message the catholic church organ cause him to become addicted to it it injured him see by this time inge is with her either mother or grandma played hedwig bleibteu the same german grandame actress who played maria holst's aunt in weiner blut well later it comes to the short view of the radio show this was not intended to be a musical revue such as kora terry released that same year were as well as rosen in tirol the music as well as their side of the war was so supposed to be only the back drop it was mainly a war romantic movie it's easy to take a pot shot at those soldier in the movie but in real life many of those soldiers were being forced to fight the nazi cause cause of the job and the monthly pay that they would receive after the war many of them who survive would regret it this is a good swastika classic the only problem is that today you have neo nazi and nazi skin heads who watched the same movies to reflect their hitler worship and their they have disturbing websites who exploit these film classics to raise money for their insanity be careful most of the time it's the direct hate only classics if their scenario looks like they are glorifying it then its a nazi website skip it go to ihf or german wartime films dot com amazon dot dee or german video dot net they are legitimate 01 23 10 mada a mistake it wasn't herbert's friend that got killed at the church it was malte yager's character's friend schartzscop
<START> the trivia page on imdb claims the filmmakers protested because this film was re cut by the studio to simplify the plot if so that effort was a total failure as this is one of the most incoherent narratives i've ever seen in a film i'd hate to have seen it before the plot was simplified br br it's sad to see warren with so little character to go on that even he can't do anything with the inept material it's interesting to see caron in '70s mode instead of her hollywood era glamour garb and persona but it's sad to see her haplessly wander through this doing a favor to her producer husband dreck she would actually later hook up with and marry the director instead who you'll note never directed anything again but did strictly 1st or 2nd a d work in tv from here on out that oughta tell you enough right there br br i call this interesting because i have an automatic fondness for american films of this period and this role does add perspective to oates' otherwise fantastic 1971 output two lane blacktop the hired hand but the 1940s detective as fish out of water in 1970s l a theme which is the only thing the movie really has to say is sold in way too heavy handed a manner a similar theme would be far more effectively handled two years later in altman's the long goodbye and as far as oates playing a hard bitten guy on a doomed errand three years on he would give his definitive performance in bring me the head of alfredo garcia if you haven't seen those don't waste your time with this
<START> yes i have a copy of it on vhs uncut in great condition that i transfered to dvd and if anyone one wants to bring back the memories of a christmas classic please emil me at dmd2222 verizon net i searched everywhere and i found nothing on this and i thought that i cant be the only one on this planet that has this classic on tape there has to be other people and if they do i fit in with them being that very very few that has this classic so i consider myself lucky and i have all of the muppets christmas except one that john denver did with the muppets again i thinks its called a smokey mountain holiday im not to sure but its close
<START> michigan edgar allen poe a toaster and a frying pan if you don't mind the psycho thriller or horror film genre and you have a special place in your heart for the twisted this is the movie for you an amazingly well developed first film hatred of a minute has all the draw of mainstream hits like silence of the lambs and of cult classics like army of darkness the editing and effects are well done better than many films in the genre kallio weaves an intricate tale of torment drawing on both the bible and poe's writings at a time when big budget big name films lack much in the way of substance the independent film has resurrected this dying trait if you love michigan a good story or a decent thriller go check out hatred of a minute
<START> br br i recently viewed this atrocity in my film program and i thought it was awful as i said in my tagline it was pretentious trite petty and phenomenally self important br br i consider myself a fan of film and all the things that film has to offer if i want to watch a documentary on the cannes festival i will watch a e and they would probably be alot more objective about it br br i dont recommend it period br br
<START> bell book and candle was released in december 1958 and features james stewart kim novak jack lemmon and ernie kovaks this film had james stewart and kim novak in their second on screen pairing after the alfred hitchcock classic vertigo released earlier the same year this was stewart's last film as a romantic lead as he was deemed too old at age 50 to play that sort of part anymore the movie is about a witch played by kim novak who is attracted to a mortal played by james stewart she puts a spell on him and he falls head over heels in love with her i enjoyed the movie and its cast this movie at the time was a moderate success which was nominated for a golden globe for best movie comedy gimmeclassics
<START> no one would argue that this 1945 war film was a masterpiece how could any 1945 war film be a masterpiece and yet this is an extremely effective telling of a true story that of al schmidt blinded on guadalcanal as played by john garfield who spent days wearing a blindfold to capture the nuances of a blind person's actions robert leckie in helmet for my pillow denigrates schmidt's popularity in favor of his foxhole mate who was killed writing that the country must have needed live heroes br br well i suppose the country did and they had one here there is a single combat scene in the movie bound to the studio lot lasting only ten minutes or so and occurring less than halfway through the film instead of being saved for the climax but it is the scariest and most realistic depiction of men under fire that i can remember having seen on screen including those in saving private ryan men yell with fear scream at each other and at the enemy and bleed and die without the aid of color stereophonic sound squibs or gore br br simply from a technological point of view the film is outstanding it isn't just that we learn how complicated a mechanism a 30 caliber water cooled browning machine gun is or that it must be fired in bursts of only a few rounds or that it isn't waved around like a fire hose as in so many other war movies the technical precision adds to the scene's riveting quality the need to stick to short bursts is horrifying when dozens of shrieking enemies are pouring across a creek fifty feet away with the sole aim of exterminating you and your two isolated comrades confined to a small gun emplacement br br the performances are solid if not bravura including those of the ubiquitous 1940s support john ridgeley and a radiant youthful eleanor parker the framing love story is spare but it works and ultimately is quite moving a striking dream sequence is included it's not bunuel but for a routine 1945 film it stands out as original and effective br br albert maltz may have overwritten the script or it may have been altered by someone else it could have used the kind of pruning that might have introduced some much needed ambiguity still there are odd verbal punctuations that have a surprising impact on the viewer why don't god strike me dead and in the eyes lee get 'em in the eyes depths of anguish in a few corny words and a surprising amount of bitterness expressed by wounded veterans in a 1945 war film br br notes that might seem false to a contemporary viewer but perhaps shouldn't the dated vernacular which it's difficult to believe many of today's kids could think was actually ever spoken private gab dope drip gee you dumb coot dame a swell guy and feeling sorry for yourself let us consider the historical context and be kind in our judgments at the time some of this goofy lingo was at the cutting edge br br real weak points the wounded veterans get together and argue with each other about how much of a collective future they have and the argument is oversimply resolved with a conclusion along the lines of just because you have a silver plate in your head doesn't mean people will think you're a bad person there are sometimes voice overs and silent prayers that are both unnecessary and downright unimaginative please god let him return to me and that sort of thing br br well the film makers were operating within the constraints of their times maybe that's why the final fade is on a shot of independence hall and the inspiring strains of america the beautiful swell in the back br br none of this can undo the film's virtues which are considerable particularly the impact of that horrifying combat scene it's not on television that often if you have a chance by all means catch it
<START> the film is side spliting from the outset eddie just seems to bring that uniqueness to the stage and makes the most basic thing funny from having an ice cream as a child to the long old tradition of the family get together the film is very rare in this country but unsure of availability in other countries i have searched through a lot of web sites and still no luck phoned companies that search for rare videos and there are year waiting lists for it so hints are very welcome if any one likes eddie murphy as a comedian and see's the video get it it is worth the money and can't go far wrong
<START> this documentary is at its best when it is simply showing the ayurvedic healers' offices and treatment preparation there is no denying the grinding poverty in india and desperation of even their wealthier clients however as an argument for ayurvedic medicine in general this film fails miserably although indian clients mention having seen aleopathic doctors those doctors are not interviewed and we have to take the vague statements of their patients at face value the doctor said there was no cure the doctor said it was cancer etc well no cure doesn't mean no treatment and what type of cancer exactly does the patient have the film is at its most feeble when showing ayurvedic practice in america there it is reduced apparently to the stunning suggestion that having a high powered wall street job can make your stomach hurt
<START> this charles outing is decent but this is a pretty low key performance marlon brando stands out there's a subplot with mira sorvino and donald sutherland that forgets to develop and it hurts the film a little i'm still trying to figure out why charlie want to change his name every movie with charles has been pretty bad
<START> now i love bela lugosi don't get me wrong he is one of the most interesting people to ever make a movie but he certainly did his share of clunkers this is just another one of those br br lugosi plays dr lorenz a doctor who has had his medical license pulled for unexplained reasons he is however doing experiments to keep his wife young and beautiful it's revealed that she is 70 80 years old yet lugosi looks to be in his mid 50's so why he is married to this old woman is never really explained br br anyway these treatments or experiments involved giving brides who are at the altar being married some sort of sweet smelling substance whereby they pass out but are thought to be dead then lugosi and some of his assistants steal the body on its way to the morgue and take it back to his lab where it's kept in some sort of suspended animation or catatonic state then the stolen brides have a needle rammed somewhere in their bodies maybe the neck and then the needle is rammed into the body of lugosi's wife to bring her back to youth and beauty we never really see where lugosi sticks the needle or what it is that he draws out of the brides but it somehow restores his wife apparently old age makes you scream with pain because lugosi's wife does a lot of screaming until she gets back to her younger state helping lugosi in his lab is the only good thing about this movie a weird old hag and her two deformed sons one son is a big lumpy looking slow acting fellow who likes to fondle the snoozing brides and the other son is a mean little dwarf little person to be politically correct in today's world at night these three just sort of pile up and sleep in lugosi's dreary downstairs lab who these 3 are and how they came to be lugosi's scared assistants is like a lot of stuff in this film never explained br br so anyway a female reporter is given the assignment by her gruff editor to find out where all the stolen brides are going to she quickly figures out that the one common thing among all the stolen brides is a rare orchid that is found on them so she asks around and is told that there is a world renowned orchid expert living nearby who just happens to be the one who developed this particular orchid this expert turns out to be creepy dr lorenz she quickly tracks him down and upsets his little house of horrors i'm not sure where the police were during all this but they came in to mop up after the reporter had done all the dirty work br br it seems that lugosi's movies always had some sort of unnecessary silly plot line that just made the whole thing stink to high heavens i mean a world famous orchid expert kidnaps brides by sending them a doped up orchid he himself is known to have developed d'oh br br and then later it's revealed that the young ladies don't even have to be brides for the procedure to work so why would lugosi keep kidnapping brides from heavily guarded churches for his experiments and create all the attention and newspaper headlines why not just grab a prostitute off the street like a normal weirdo pervert would do this clunker reminded me a lot of another lugosi stinker the devil bat same silly plot lines and bad acting and same silly 'reporter gets bad guy' deal br br but lugosi is always good he is creepy and sinister enough to keep you interested at least enough to keep watching him the woman playing the reporter was just a terrible actor she had no emotion whatsoever she just delivered her lines like a machine gun spewing them out as quickly as she could everyone else pretty much blew too when it came to being good actors br br but this thing is watchable if only for bela lugosi fans lugosi was always so intense even when the picture was a dog he must have known he was doing terrible pictures but maybe he also knew that if he gave it everything he had a little of that intensity might shine through past all the bad plots and bad acting which surrounded him br br and he was right we horror fans will always have a love for bela lugosi he gave it his all every time he was in front of the camera we do give two f ks for you bela
