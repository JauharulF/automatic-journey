<START> a great concept a great cast and what a pity there wasn't more time to flesh out the story i loved it and wanted more dench dukakis and laine now there are some real women still dench and her character alone had enough substance to carry the script over some of its lesser moments i have it on tape and will continue to watch it hoping that there is a clue at the end that suggests there will be a sequel br br top drawer no question no argument br br
<START> unfortunately the realism is boring this movie i thought it would never end would have been better if all the characters would have been nuked in the first five minutes where's blade when you need him while as dismal as combat shock requiem for a dream and as nightmarish as boise moi dead creatures isn't nearly as entertaining as any of the aforementioned bleak movies while the gratuitous cannibalism might make the wannabe jeffery dalmers hearts race a little faster it wasn't nearly as interesting as ravenous really i found it about as interesting as late night infomercials and as exciting as a trip to the dentist if you have strong masochistic qualities you might be able to endure this otherwise for no one i was really surprised that this one wasn't made by the people at brain damage as that was the quality of dead creatures
<START> how can they from joe don baker as bufford pusser in the first sequel to bo svenson as bufford pusser in the second sequel why did they do that for just because bo svenon look more a like to bufford pusser they still should'nt of changed it because the first sequel it was joe don baker as bufford pusser and that one of the thing i wanted to see in the second sequel br br i would've given this movie a 7 out of 10 and i would've given it a 1 out of 10 if the story did'nt have anything to do with bufford pusser's life but it did and that why i had given this movie a 3 out 10 br br i strongly suggest that anyone who is planning on watching this cheese i suggest don't and watch the first sequel instead
<START> being the only movie i was able to see at this year's nordische filmtage at lÃ¼beck this year's festival will be remembered as a all time low for me br br this movie which was announced as an erotic thriller is nothing more than a sick piece of crap excuse the language but there aren't any decent words to describe it br br first of all the actors are not the best but even better actors would not have rescued the movie e g the plot after the first 15 minutes it was quite clear that john was sick the neighbour girls were not real and that he killed his first girlfriend the so called sex scene was nothing else but disgusting hitting each other until blood flows for me hasn't anything to do with sexuality but unfortunately that were not the only disgusting images to be shown everything else was copied by other directors like e g lynch but of course without their geniality br br so to summarize the whole film and to save other viewers time and money guy loses girlfriend girlfriend turns back home guy kills girlfriend and becomes mad afterwards guy imagines hot but crazy neighbour girls guy has very disgusting sex with one of them or so he thinks in the end he realizes he is crazy and his girlfriend and her new lover lay in his apartment all the time bad story bad actors pictures that make you want to vomit br br 1 out of 10 1 point for the fact that you realize how good you can understand norwegian if you learned swedish at least one benefit of the evening and you can't choose 0 points here
<START> i don't know what this movie is about really it's like a student's art school project they never say why the world is dark but it is always darkness except for seconds a day there are long interrupting shots of insects of all sorts for no reason what little dialogue there is in the movie is as inane and nonsensical as the images a black woman enters the main character's apartment somehow she becomes pregnant overnight then gets shot in the head the main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon after which a white naked woman emerges i have never been so blown away by how bad and pointless a movie can be honestly i would like someone to watch it so they can tell me what they think it's about but i wouldn't wish this level of hell on anybody else
<START> in the title i write that the story is ludicrous below i'll elaborate and tell you why it in my humble opinion ruins this movie br br gere and danes are doing their jobs and while it's not their best work it's quite ok the rest of the cast though is doing a really poor job mind you this is not entirely the actors fault the problem is that gere and danes are the only ones that have characters that have even the slightest room in the movie to really give any depth all other characters have either too little room in the movie to create any depth or the character is such a clichÃ© that it doesn't matter how hard the actors try br br the director has a bit of a se7en complex but looking merely at the direction i think he does an ok job br br but the story this is the kind of script that is bad in two ways first of all it's a bad movie script the characters are shallow except for gere's and danes' characters the villains are clichÃ©s and the actions of the characters is totally unbelievable besides this the writers must have an agenda where they want to bring back our views and ethics a hundred years it's the kind of movie that are saying that some criminals are still criminals regardless of the fact that they have paid the price the society has given them it's also the kind of movie that says albeit only between the lines that every form of sexual deviance should be punished without trial judge or jury and of course according to the movie everything that is not sex in the missionary position by a married couple is a sexual deviance br br so if you're going to film school and need an example of a bad script or if you're writing scripts yourself and want an ego boost see it for everyone else i recommend another movie
<START> almost every review of this movie i'd seen was pretty bad it's not pretty bad it's actually pretty good though not great the judy garland character could have gotten annoying but she didn't allow it to somewhere along the line i've become a fan of brooding overbearing overacting van heflin at least in the early 40's judy's singing is great but the film missed a great chance by not showing more of their relationship i gave it a 7
<START> this film reminds me of 42nd street starring bebe daniels and ruby keeler when i watch this film a lot of it reminded me of 42nd street especially the character eloise who's a temperamental star and she ends up falling and breaks her ankle like bebe daniels did in 42nd street and another performer gets the part and become a star this film like most race films keeps people watching because of the great entertainment race films always showed black entertainment as it truly was that was popular in that time era the dancing styles the music dressing styles you'll love it this movie could of been big if it was made in hollywood it would of had better scenery better filming and more money which would make any movie better but its worth watching because it is good and micheaux does good with the little he has i have to say out of all micheaux's films swing is the best the movie features singers dancers actresses and actors who were popular but forgotten today doli armena a awesome female trumpet player who can blow the horn so good that you think gabriel is blowing a horn in the sky the sexy hot female dancer consuela harris would put ann miller and gyspy rose lee to shame br br adding further info popular blues singer of the 20's and 30's cora green is the focus of the film she's mandy a good hard working woman with a no good man who takes her money and spend it on other women a nosy neighbor played by amanda randolph tells mandy what she seen and heard and mandy goes down to the club and catches her man with an attractive curvy woman by the name of eloise played hazel diaz a hot cha entertainer in the 30's and a fight breaks out then mandy goes to harlem where she reunites with a somewhat guardian angel lena played by one of the most beautiful women in movies dorothy van engle lena provides mandy with a home a job and helps her become a star when temperamental cora smith played by hazel i guess she's playing two parts or maybe she changed her stage name tries to ruin the show with her bad behavior when cora gets drunk and breaks her leg lena convinces everyone that mandy is right for the job and lena is right and a star is born in mandy tall long lanky but handsome carman newsome is the cool aspiring producer who lena looks out for as well pretty boy larry seymour plays the no good man but after lena threatens him he might shape up there are a few highlights but the one that sticks out to me is the part where cora smith hazel diaz struts in late for rehearsal and goes off on everyone and then her man comes in and punches her in the jaw but that's not enough she almost gets into a fight with mandy again in between there's great entertainment by chorus girls tap dancers shake dancers swing music and blues singing there's even white people watching the entertainment i wonder where micheaux found them there's even a scene where there's blacks and whites sitting together at the club micheaux frequently integrated blacks and whites in his films he should be commended for such a bold move br br this movie was the first race film i really enjoyed and it helped introduced me to oscar micheaux this movie is one of the best of the race film genre its a behind the scenes story about the ups and downs of show business br br no these early race films may not be the best can't be compared with hallelujah green pastures stormy weather cabin in the sky carmen jones or any other hollywood films but their great to watch because their early signs of black film making and plus these films provide a glimpse into black life and black entertainment through a black person's eyes these films gave blacks a chance to play people from all walks of life be beautiful classy and elegant and not just be stereotypes or how whites felt blacks should be portrayed like in hollywood most of the actors and actresses of these race films weren't the best but they were the only ones that could be afforded at the time micheaux and spencer williams couldn't afford nina mae mckinney josephine baker ethel waters fredi washington paul robeson rex ingram and more of the bigger stars so micheaux and other black and white race film makers would use nightclub performers in their movies some were good some weren't great actors and actresses but i think micheaux and others knew most weren't good actors and actresses but they were used more as apart of an experiment than for true talent they just wanted their stories told and in return many black performers got to perform their true talents in the films for some true actors actresses race films were the only type of films they could get work especially if they didn't want to play hollywood stereotypes so i think you'll be able to spot the true actors actresses from the nightclub performers these race films are very historic they could have been lost forever many are lost maybe race films aren't the greatest example of cinema but even hollywood films didn't start out great in the beginning i think if the race film genre continued it would have better if your looking for great acting most race films aren't the ones but if your looking for a real example of black entertainment and how blacks should have been portrayed in films than watch race films there are some entertaining race films with a good acting cast moon over harlem body and soul paradise in harlem keep punching sunday sinners dark manhattan broken strings boy what a girl mystery in swing miracle in harlem and sepia cinderella that not only has good entertainment but good acting
<START> the first time i came upon delirious i only heard it i listened to the entire comedic performance and never have i laughed so much in my life eddie's ability to paint hilarious pictures in our minds and do great imitation is captivating when i finally got to see him perform this act i had to have it eddie murphy's performance on delirious shows his genius with it being the new millennium his acts in 1983 is just as funny today as it was then my parents loved it as teenagers and i age eighteen love it as well from that point on i had to view murphy's other movies such as coming to america and harlem nights there will be no other comedian like eddie
<START> paul naschy made a great number of horror films in terms of quality they tend to range from fairly good to unwatchable trash and unfortunately horror rises from the tomb is closer to the latter the plot is just your average story of a witch wizard or as is the case here warlock who is put to death but not before swearing vengeance on those who did it etc etc we then get a sÃ©ance and one thing leads to another and pretty soon the executed warlock is up to no good again the plot is slow painfully boring and the film constantly feels pointless the characters string out reams of diatribe and it never serves the film in any way whatsoever paul naschy wrote the script and if you ask me he should stick to acting because the dialogue is trite in the extreme and only serves to make the film even more boring than it already is carlos aured who also directed naschy in blue eyes of the broken doll and curse of the devil provides dull direction here which likes the dialogue does nothing to help the film sometimes crap films like this have a certain charm about them but horror rises from the tomb doesn't even have that this is a painfully boring film that has little or nothing in the way of interest
<START> the great talents of michael powell and emeric pressberger are noticeable in their wonderful a matter of life and death it was part of the recent tribute to mr powell that played at the walter reade in new york this film in particular shows us one of the best british films from that or any other era br br a matter of life and death has a brilliant cinematography by jack cardiff a man who knew how to work wonders with a camera particularly impressive is the contrast from the monochromatic tones given to the scenes played in heaven and the colored ones when the action comes back to earth this was quite a coup and well ahead of its times the black and white sequence that involves the long staircase where peter and the conductor are chatting has to be one of the most amazing things on any film br br much has been said in this forum about the film so our comment will be about the great acting powell and pressberger got out of the large distinguished cast who responded magnificently to the directors' guidance br br david niven is peter whose aircraft is hit and his best friend dies as a result of it this film marked one of the highlights in mr niven's career he was an excellent film actor as he shows us in this movie kim hunter is surprisingly good as june the woman who talked to peter as his plane was falling from the skies as fate would have it peter and june fall in love at first sight br br some of the best british film actors grace this film with their presence robert coote is bob the man who is admitted to heaven but he is surprised his friend peter never made the trip with him an excellent star turn by marius goring who as the conductor 71 steals the film mr goring who had worked with the directors is one of the best things in the movie also roger livesey as dr frank reeves does one of the best appearances of his career as well as raymond massey who is seen as abraham farlan br br a matter of life and death is a timeless film that will always be seen with gratitude toward its creators
<START> more than twenty years before peter jackson's visionary adaptation of the lord of the rings there was this 1978 animated effort from director ralph bakshi an ambitious and reasonably faithful version of the story this has sadly been rather over shadowed by the jackson trilogy indeed many reviewers here on the imdb mainly those who saw the newer version first seem to be fiercely unkind to this version but if one applies a little common sense and takes into consideration the time when it was made and the technical possibilities that existed at that time then they will realise that this is a pretty good film indeed it was shortly after seeing this animated movie back in the early '80s that i sought out tolkien's book and immediately became a lifelong fan of these richly detailed middle earth adventures so in some respects i owe this film a degree of acknowledgement as the film which shaped my literary tastes forever br br sauron the dark lord of middle earth forges an all powerful ring that gives him incredible power following a great battle during which sauron is defeated the ring falls into possession of a king named isildurÂ but instead of destroying it he foolishly chooses to keep it for centuries the ring passes from hand to hand eventually coming into the possession of a hobbit named frodo baggins who lives in a peace loving community known as the shire frodo learns from a wizard named gandalf that his ring is in fact the one ring the very same that was forged by sauron all those centuries ago and that its master is once again searching for it in order to restore his dark power over the entire land frodo embarks on a perilous journey to protect the ring with three other hobbit companions but every step of the way they are hunted by sauron's ring wraiths the black riders there follow many adventures during which a company of nine adventurers is formed to guide the ring to the only place where it can be unmade Â mount doom in the land of mordor the film concludes with frodo and his best friend sam on the borders of mordor closing ever nearer to their horrifying destination meanwhile gandalf and the other members of the company fight off a huge army of orcs at the legendary fortress of helm's deep br br this version covers just over half of the original book a second instalment was planned to bring the story to an end but was sadly never completed while the ending feels abrupt it does at least end at a sensible point in the story one has to feel a little frustration and regret that no sequel exists in which we might follow these animated heroes to their eventual goal the animation is passable with a nice variety of locales and characters presented in interesting detail the music by leonard rosenman is suitably stirring and fits in appropriately with the epic narrative the voice overs are decent too especially john hurt as aragorn and peter woodthorpe as gollum on the other hand michael scholes who provides the voice for sam is rather campy and goofy which is not well suited to the character the lord of the rings is a commendable attempt to visualise the staggering book on which it is based
<START> the premise was intriguing but sadly this film just doesn't do any justice to it the casting was quite good and it was shot beautifully but stylistically much of the direction was inconsistent overstylized fast editing been there done that to no effect i was waiting for steven bochco to run in the credits followed by a commercial characters were identified exclusively by on screen coke usage and pretty much everything else left to boogie nights for character development and no personable characters to draw the viewer into the story a very forgettable film
<START> this movie is traditional bollywood fare as far as the star power sentimentality and love triangle of emotions what really bothered me about this movie was the makers' absurd notion of surrogate mother a whore who conceives a child with someone after have sex with the man of the family desiring a child is not a surrogate mother neither is she a good candidate for a surrogate mother i have seen indian movies and television shows that made 10 to 15 years ago that dealt with this issue more intelligently the whole concept of the movie is ridiculous and absolutely implausible i realize that most bollywood movies aren't meant to be plausible but they don't pretend to be either this movie wants us to emote along with the characters but this can't done with such a ridiculous contrived conflict i would have expected better from abbas and mustan
<START> i do not recommend this movie because it's inaccurate and misleading this story was supposed to be in algerian berber territory this one was shot in the southern tunisian desert completetly different culture i know i am from both tunisia and algeria the other shocking element was the character of her companion aunt speaks in the movie with a very eloquent french university level academic french while the character she plays was supposed to be of a disturbed never left her mountain kind of personage so living as a bedouin with that kind of education i that context is impossible the most disgraceful scene and disrespectful especially for the people of the region is the femme repudiee segment which is s pure invention from the writer director things like that will never happen in a algerian society ever
<START> a remake of the superb 1972 movie of the stage play nicely casting caine as the nemesis of his character from the first movie but doing nothing else nicely at all br br a under parr performance from the actors law and caine diluted further by weak self indulgent direction br br the warmth of the setting in the original is forsaken for a super modern homesetting the subtle interplay between oliver and caine which made the first movie so watchable is replaced with a horrid brash arrogance that instantly breeds disdain in the viewer but this is not the clever to ing and froing of liking one then the other character the original fostered so well this is an obvious ott character assassination of both character from the word go br br this version of sleuth is not really worth seeing watch the original film and be dazzled from the opening act
<START> bette midler showcases her talents and beauty in diva las vegas i am thrilled that i taped it and i am able to view whenever i want to she possesses what it takes to keep an audience in captivity her voice is as beautiful as ever and will truly impress you the highlight of the show was her singing stay with me from her 1979 movie the rose you can feel the emotion in the song and will end up having goose bumps the show will leave you with the urge to go out and either rent a bette midler movie or go to the nearest music store and purchase one of bette midler's albums
<START> till hbo began rerunning it this month i remember laughing out loud in the theater back in 1991 and now again in my living room if i see that it's on i have to watch it there's just no question this is so much more entertaining to me than other more popular spoofs like airplane which i really like btw cathy moriarty steals the show in my opinion quotes like sudden speech the last symptoms of brain fever she could blow at any moment put me over the edge and whoopie goldberg hasn't been this funny since 'jumpin' jack flash' kevin klein sally field robert downey jr all turn in superb performances as expected i started out giving this 9 out of 10 stars but then i realized that for the type of film it's supposed to be there isn't one thing i'd change or improve upon so 10 it is i have to get this on dvd that's just all there is to it
<START> fox's the true story of jesse james 1957 is a remarkably poor widescreen remake of their prestigious 1939 tyrone power henry fonda classic jesse james i'm not sure where the fault lies but the casting in this version of the two central characters the uneven direction of nicholas ray and the ham fisted screenplay must surely have something to do with it br br in the late thirties and forties tyrone power was fox's top leading man but in the fifties his star began to wane and studio head darryl zanuck started to groom newcomer robert wagner to take his place this was a major error on zanuck's part as wagner proved to be a less than a suitable replacement with the possible exceptions of broken lance 1954 and between heaven hell 1956 it is hard to think of wagner distinguishing himself in anything also jeffrey hunter was nothing more than a fox contract player before being assigned to play frank james to wagner's jesse in the true story of jesse james borrowed from the studio the previous year this actor's one distinguishing mark was his excellent and revealing performance in john ford's classic the searchers but his playing here along with wagner as the second half of the james brothers is nothing short of boring neither player bring any personality or colour to their respective roles they totally miss the mark lacking the charisma and appeal so vividly displayed by power and fonda in the original the movie is also marred by too many flashbacks and with the all over the place screenplay wagner as the robin hood of the american west comes across as a charmless introverted twit that you can feel no empathy for whatsoever the supporting cast are hardly worth mentioning but it is a shame to see such a great actress as agnes moorhead barely getting a look in as ma james br br the best aspects of this uninvolving so so western is the wonderful cinemascope colour cinematography by the great joe mcdonald and the excellent music score by the underrated and little known composer leigh harline
<START> i am not one of those people that will walk out of a movie that was based on source material and automatically say the book was better i know better than to demote the value of a movie just because it wasn't a faithful adaptation there is a lengthy process and lots of decisions that go into making a movie that are sometimes out of the director's editor's cinematographer's producer's control and certainly out of the original author's control therefore it is unreasonable to expect a movie to be exactly the same word for word as a book or play or video game or disneyland ride or whatever a movie should be judged on its own standard and how it fits in society moreover a successful movie should be made because the material is relevant to the society which it belongs and if it is based on source material its relevance needs to be reexamined and enhanced by the filmmakers br br films like there will be blood follow this paradigm because while it was based on a novel written at the turn of the century oil it feels relevant because of things like the iraq war and energy concerns that the film's country of origin the us was and is experiencing even king kong based on the original film benefits from using new technology and concerns of animal rights that people have br br with that said i just don't understand why they even bothered to make this movie besides the great performances guaranteed oscar nods and shanley's director writers fee and royalties he will get this movie seems to come from nowhere it should have simply stayed as a play the movie which is essentially the same as the play says nothing new about the reprehensible sexual atrocities committed and in many cases covered up by the catholic church here and abroad it says nothing new or different than the original play i can't help but compare this movie to another movie that came out at around the same time frost nixon which was also based on a play frost nixon while about nixon's regrets seems relevant because it seems to have come at a time when president bush was about to leave office the regrets that nixon had as depicted in the play movie about the war and his presidency could just as easily reflected on bush and his presidency in that respect frost nixon seemed more relevant and actually benefited from a wider distribution via film because it got people talking and reflecting about the political status quo in the country at the time in contrast doubt felt like it was yesterday's news and didn't seem to offer anything that the play didn't offer br br of course the movie is good the performances are outstanding and the screenplay adaptation is apt but so what why didn't it just stay as a play why besides marketing and financial reasons make it into a movie it gave audiences nothing new to discus about the awful subject
