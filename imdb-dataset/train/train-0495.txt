<START> this is one of those movies that you wish you hadn't seen before so you could see it again for the first time van dine's books still bring pleasure but are termed excessively flowery by many this movie is by far the best film adaptation of his works william powell is william powell say no more the plot is intricate the story moves all too quickly because you want it to last enjoy
<START> okay sorry but i loved this movie i just love the whole 80's genre of these kind of movies because you don't see many like this one anymore i want to ask all of you people who say this movie is just a rip off or a cheesy imitation what is it imitating i've never seen another movie like this one well not horror anyway br br basically its about the popular group in school who like to make everyones lives living hell so they decided to pick on this nerdy boy named marty it turns fatal when he really gets hurt from one of their little pranks br br so its like 10 years later and the group of friends who hurt marty start getting high school reunion letters but they are the only ones receiving them so they return back to the old school and one by one get knocked off by yeah you probably know what happens br br the only part that disappointed me was the very end it could have been left off or thought out better br br i think you should give it a try and try not to be to critical br br cupidgrl
<START> really enjoyed this little movie it's a moving film about struggle sacrifice and especially the bonds of friendship between different peoples the child actor who plays miki is especially good there's so many large scale impersonal films set around ww2 that this convincingly told little story is a real break from the norm and an original one at that i'll also add that this film is far from boring very far of course the horses are wonderful and the scenery breathtaking to anyone who really treats their animal as part of the family i do you'll find this film especially rewarding recommended to movie fans who look for something a little different
<START> i actually like the original and this film has its ups and downs here's just a few br br ups most of the original voice cast returned br br downs i didn't like the voice of timon's ma i know she did a voice in the simpsons but that show is just plain stupid br br ups we get to see simba as a teenager br br downs they wasted it with a slug slurping contest between timon and simba br br ups it was rafiki who told timon about hakuna matata br br downs how did pumbaa find out about it br br ups songs again some of the original songs were there but they were just background music br br downs but stupid songs a k a timon's solo br br overall this is a pretty good movie i'd recommend it for fans of the original but if you don't like the original chances are you won't like this one br br my score 7 10
<START> the unborn is a pretty good low budget horror movie exploiting the fears associated with pregnancy it's very well acted by the always good brooke adams and b movie stalwart james karen although the supporting cast is pretty average for a b grader the music by gary numan of all people is good too henry dominic's script is quite intelligent for this sort of thing although there is a hint of misogyny about it rodman fender's direction is merely adequate and there are some unnecessary cheap scares if you're a fan of adams whose movie career is nowhere near as illustrious as it should be check it out she's great as always
<START> i have to say i quite enjoyed soldier russell was very good as this trained psychopath rediscovering his humanity very watchable and nowhere near as bad as i'd been led to believe yes it has problems but provides its share of entertainment
<START> this is an interesting series that takes real life people jesse james john wesley hardin etc and dramatizes part of their real story with a continuing series character taking part in that story railroad detective matt clark takes a role in tracking down famous outlaws from the old west in stories that are at least partly based on the true accounts in that sense it's almost an anthology series and as someone else pointed out this odd structure poses some timeline conflicts with the real events but it's a fun series with plenty of action to satisfy a western hungry 1950's audience and it still holds up pretty well 55 years later clark cuts a powerful figure in his western gear as he goes up against some of history's baddest baddies and his girl sidekick frankie is quite a dish if you're a western fan be sure to check it out if you have a chance
<START> play mystery theater 3000 at home with your friends rent this movie for the laughs the acting is poor the sounds is terrible and the fights are ridiculously unbelievable i thought the movie was a joke until i looked it up on imbd i can't wait to rent the sequel china o'brien ii
<START> good luck finding this film to even watch it's not yet released on tape or dvd i saw on release in the early '70's was lucky enough to catch it via american cinematheque's preservation efforts and it still has some tangible moments that stayed with me for thirty years br br no reason to repeat rwint's accurate comments here as a come out director soon after the soaring success of five easy pieces jack n has been said to have managed the low budget effort as best as possible and it certainly shows in the wandering and meandering that could have used some re cutting but it's also a memorable icon for it's time the all very intense clashes of late 60's college sports student movements sexual revolution and more br br why see this film it was probably a ground breaker in some scenes the frisky male bonding in the after game showers karen black's scene with tepper in the car will catch you a little off guard but it's the first use of a word i hadn't witnessed in film before and the casual and unexpected use of nudity overall there are probably others i'm omitting br br look for a nice surprise of a young cindy williams in one of her first films a thin david ogend stiers mike warren fresh out of his powder blue ucla uniform and readying for a dark blue tv uniform robert towne actor and a whole lot of folks simply playing themselves br br now any connection between harry gittes last name robert towne and a certain character in chinatown and the two jakes br br it gets a 7 based on karen black you'll see why
<START> this is one of those little christmas movies for everyone our scrooge is ben affleck who decides money is not enough so he rents the family who lives where he thought his family did ok this is a great little high school soap pg 13 but the small sex references are comedy so if your kid can't handle them they can't live in the real world either br br now affleck is a hunk and as usual walks through this fun omg remember when we did ensemble piece as if he were at the end stages of some neuroinfectious disease but that's ok because even this old oracle keeps hoping that if ben's that well proportioned all over well there's hope for us ladies yet luckily the rest of the ensemble catharine o'hara james gandolfini christina applegate udo kier and josh zuckerman fill in and keep this shadow side ozzie and harriet christmas alternately hilarious comfortable and warm br br this movie is the kind you can jump up and get popcorn and when you get back everyone wants to back it up to show you what you missed br br this is a happy film after all and it leaves you feeling good about life love family christmas and chanel there really is something for everyone
<START> the second attempt by a new york intellectual in less than 10 years to make a swedish film the first being susan sontag's brother carl which was made in sweden with swedish actors no less the results oscar wilde said it best in reference to dickens' the old curiosity shop one would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at the death of little nell pretty much the same thing here interiors is chock full of solemnly intoned howlers i'm afraid of my anger looking into the middle distance i don't like who i'm becoming the directorial quotations to use a polite term from bergman are close to parody the incredibly self involved family keep reminding us of how brilliant and talented they are to the point of strangulation i read a poem of yours the other day it was in i don't know the new yorker oh that was an old poem i reworked it far from not caring about these people however i found them quite hilarious much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from allen's earlier films only he's directed his actors to play the lines straight having not cast himself in the movie he has poor mary beth hurt copy all of his thespian tics intonations and neurotic habits turning her into an embarrassing surrogate much like kenneth branagh in celebrity br br the basic plot dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother seems to be lifted more or less from bergman's winter light the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst it all comes through in the shopworn visual aural tricks the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper the towering surf that dwarfs the people walking on the beach etc etc br br allen's later serious films are less embarrassing but also far less entertaining i'll take interiors woody's rarely made a funnier movie
<START> steven seagal how could you be a part of such an awful film i rented this movie because your movies usually have been pretty clean i have lost a lot of respect for you being in an awful movie such as this one very very poor taste i am embarrassed that i even rented this movie steven if you keep acting in movies like this one i believe that your career is over my husband and i have enjoyed watching many of your movies because you always can get the bad guy with a few hand maneuvers and make it clean and also the language is pretty clean in your movies but this one is something else i will think twice before i rent another movie of yours
<START> esther williams gets her first post mgm starring role and gets off br br to a good start this film is a well acted entertaining suspense br br with a mature theme that would be repeated a million times more br br in the future innocent girl stalked creepy woman hater esther br br looks great and if she wanted to probably could have gone on to br br do more and better films but according to her autobiography br br pretty much gave up working for marriage either way she is so br br likable and engaging that its fun to see her in a totally different role br br outside of the 'swimming musical' universal was fabulous for br br making films with former mgm stars after that studio began br br dropping its biggest names as it began to slide down hill stars br br like lana turner june allyson and others got to make quality first br br rate films at universal as they obviously still had drawing power at br br the box office i wish esther had made more but since she didnt it br br makes this one all the more special
<START> ok i admit i watched this movie on mystery science theater 3000 which i am a huge fan of but i am not one of those people who automatically gives an mst3k movie a 1 10 rating although i hate many of the movies they play and some are among of the worst movies i've ever seen i have actually been able to enjoy some mst3k movies that being said this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen it is no wonder in fact that the mst3k writers themselves commented that this one was one of the worst don't believe me check out their site br br to me this movie is a good example of what not to do in filmmaking the dialogue is very bad the acting is worse the cinematography is pathetic the direction while perhaps being the best thing in this movie is bad br br the pacing is the worst part in this movie a few times in this movie the viewer had to wait literally minutes for something to happen while minutes may not sound like a very long amount of time it can be in a movie particularly in this one i'm sure it was meant to create a mood but i was just very bored it truly felt like ten minutes br br if suspension of disbelief means almost falling asleep during a movie then this has plenty of that but the screaming skull is just so horrible there is no way i could have possibly even gotten interested in anything that was actually going on in the film and thus the suspension of disbelief was indeed non existant br br one of the worst and probably the most boring movie i've ever seen br br 1 10
<START> pretty crazy whodunit featuring an all black cast trying to figure out who murdered the philandering trumpet player who was just about to go to hollywood to make it big was it his wife his girlfriend his would be girlfriend her father his butler the newspaper guy who knows and who cares the result of this is just a little underwhelming and the actors here don't really get me in a mood to care one way or another finding out why snake venom as a weapon who knows who cares the music in this is alright but there's little of it and most of it is pretty let's get this over with this isn't worthy of your time there are better all black casted movies out there
<START> the bank 1915 chaplin the bank was one of charlie's 1915 essanay films while these group of films are more watchable than their 1914 counterparts this one seems a bit below average the gag with the janitorial double combo locked vault and the tough luck ending that has charlie waking up from a dream in which he is stroking the lead lady's hair only to be stroking the head of a mop he had used as a quasi pillow are both classic chaplin moments they are both ironically the beginning and the end the middle is filled in with fighting with the rival co worker janitor and busting up a bank robbery to win the girl the mop is probably the greatest physical prop of this movie and charlie uses it to expert comedic effect whether while it is the intention of his character or not the mop seems to be charlie's alter ego doing things he wishes he could do but wouldn't with his own two hands interesting stuff but there's better
<START> gayniggers from outer space is a short foreign film about black gay aliens who explore the galaxy until they stumble upon earth being gay their goal is to have a male only universe in which all people are gay hence when they discover women or female creatures live on earth they are at first terrified eventually they decide to eliminate all women on the planet and liberate the male population br br an offensive title with a racist homophobic and sexist storyline albeit probably intended as a satire give this film some shock value however there's little substance underneath as another reviewer pointed out there are few jokes besides the characters' names eg arminass i think i laughed once at one small gay joke i think i got the point of the film quickly a satire of bad science fiction but after that i had had enough i kept wanting the film to end already and it is a short film not brilliant or particularly well written
<START> if you liked blair with you'll like this one it has the same lousy camera work and soundtrack and it has the same non existent plot and suspenseful moments br br it also has tom savini so if you like romero's dawn of the dead or tarantino and rodriguez' from dusk till dawn you're in for a treat he is an icon and a very good actor as well br br no seriously this movie is definitely the lousiest movie i've seen in a long time and i've seen quite a few movies bad ones as well i can tell you that i find most horror movies entertaining in some respect but this was just a pure waste of time br br the only reason why i gave this movie 2 instead of 1 was the naked chicks and the hot action with all the sharp looking plastic teeth no i'm just kidding i must have missed before i hit submit on the vote form br br stay away even though it has sexy girls with teeth on the cover
<START> sandler is amazing again i have already become a sandler fan this movie is the saddest sandler story its expression is fantastic i cried more watching click but there are some similar points to consider the value of the family before losing it and to be able to say 'i love you' are a few of the most impressive truths in life it is tough it is real and actually there is a real owner of this success binder i don't think another director could give these emotions in such a way br br cheadle and burrows are also amazing cheadle is one of my favorites since crash don't expect laughing or much positive atmosphere if you are ready to face the realities of life don't miss this movie
<START> definitely a very good idea screenplay was just ok could have been better the positives are that it doesn't bore you if you're an adventure lover a new idea about the lost world of atlantis negatives are that i personally feel that this idea had so much more potential than this they should've ended up with a better adventure than this it wasn't bad at all but it would have been much better with some more runtime enjoyed it a lot though cant say that it was boring or wasn't good a good one for the people who like adventure animations like sindbad like the road to el dorado this movie is also recommended for people looking for a nice little adventure with a very nice happy ending
