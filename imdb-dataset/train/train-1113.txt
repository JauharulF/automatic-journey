<START> the fight scenes were great loved the old and newer cylons and how they painted the ones on their side it was the ending that i hated i was disappointed that it was earth but 150k years back but to travel all that way just to start over are you kidding me 38k people that fought for their very existence and once they get to paradise they abandon technology no way sure they were eating paper and rationing food but that is over they can live like humans again they only have one good doctor what are they going to do when someone has a tooth ache never mind giving birth yea right no one would have made that choice
<START> it might have been a good movie if it had explored something more interesting rather than just the surface of a lesbian relationship if this was the meaning of the movie it is quite predictable not mentioning that the two girls resemble the russian group t a t u coincidence i don't think so there is nothing original in this movie to support it so they had to use something which is already famous you know the recipe the other actors well i just don't know what their role is supposed to be most of them are well known people in romania and i must mention some of them are not even actors e g mihaela radulescu so to summarize it girl band tatty desperate publicity needing actors a non existing plot the occasion to use bad language in order to shock love sick too bad the idea was good though and i am seriously holding myself from commenting the title
<START> this is an astounding film as well as showing actual footage of key events in the failed coup to oust chavez we are given the background picture which describes a class divided society many of the rich it appears have a choice with the people's democratic choice and are willing to use the military for regime change 'be careful what you say in front of your servants' is a revealing comment the head of the country's biggest oil company appoints himself as the new president with us backing and these young irish film makers have it all on camera a great film to educate young people about democracy we see transparent documentation of how media can be manipulated and force used in the interests of big business against the interests of the democratic wishes of the people riveting stuff
<START> i thought that this film was very enjoyable i watched this film with my wife before i had my first child therefore i was not watching it as simply family entertainment and i still thoroughly enjoyed it it seems as though many of the reviews are pointing out that this movie is not earth shattering there were no unexpected plot changes and that the movie was predictable and boring if these people were watching this movie expecting to have a religious experience doing so then they were obviously going to be disappointed this is simply an animated movie nothing more if you want to see this movie simply to sit back and let yourself be entertained you will not be disappointed in closing this is definitely not the best movie disney has made but it is entertaining and i do not understand the bad reputation it has received
<START> worst movie ever made please see the real movie reviews from the pros on this movie check rotten tomatoes on the web for some good independent reviews on this film the comments made on this site are apparently from folks with some financial interest in this film i find the positive comments very misleading i find it amazing how the negative comments are so bad against this movie and the positive comments sound like an academy awards speech don't waste your hard earned money this film is retarded i can't believe a film like this would ever be made why would hollywood waste their time on such junk this film is an attempt at nothing i ask myself what looser would actually sink their money producing such trash i went to blockbuster and the attendant even told us not to waste our time or money i didn't listen and i did waste my time and cash please don't make the same mistake it really is the worst movie ever made
<START> in the words of charles dance's character in this film bollocks no plot no character development and utterly unbelievable br br full of stuff that just doesn't happen in the real world since when were british police inspectors armed with handguns in shoulder holsters full of mistakes bulgarian trains in london full of dull and artificial dialogue and the directing editing is awful wobbly hand held camera shots that add nothing to the film except a vague feeling of seasickness confusing jump cuts no structure br br wesley snipes' character is totally unsympathetic why should we care what happens to him direct to video direct to the dustbin
<START> it's not just the plot alone that makes this movie an instant turn off for bored audiences it's the terrible direction with a horrible script and mistakes left and right that makes this too agonizing to watch i'm sorry but i do not see the 'fun' in this just the thrill of pointing the many mistakes and stupid one liners well i'm wondering how dumb the directors think of their producing company when this movie was first introduced probably as dumb as that sheriff who dove into the pickup truck full of antifreeze with a gaping bloody wound oops did i forget to mention this sheriff's not only a poor actor but also can shrug off an impalement with a load of antifreeze drenching the exposed flesh i guess he kind of forgot when he won a not so thrilling victory over the snowman
<START> peter fonda is so intentionally enervated as an actor that his lachrymose line readings cancel out any irony or humor in the dialogue he trades sassy barbs and non witty repartee with brooke shields as if he were a wooden block with receding hair even his smaller touches like fingering a non existent mustache on his grizzled face don't reveal a character so much as an unsure actor being directed by himself an unsure filmmaker in the southwest circa 1950 a poor gambler not above a little cheating wins an orphaned would be teen lolita in a botched poker game after getting hold of a treasure map promising gold in the grand canyon the bickering twosome become prospectors some lovely vistas and an odd but interesting cameo by henry fonda as a grizzled canyon man are the sole compensations in fatigued comedy drama with the two leads being trailed by cartoonish killers who will stop at nothing until they get their hands on that map shields is very pretty but although the camera loves her pouty glossy beauty she has no screen presence and her tinny voice has no range whatsoever every time she opens her mouth one is inclined to either cringe or duck 1 2 from
<START> i contend that whoever is ultimately responsible for creating approving the trailer for this movie has completely blundered no one i know wanted to see this movie based on the previews and everyone who actually saw it that i know absolutely loved it the advertising campaign is disgrace disaster blunder br br opened at 4 behind br br 1 rush hour which i have not seen average imdb score of 7 4 br br 2 the bourn ultimatum which i have seen awesome movie but 3rd week out average imdb score of 8 7 deserving i would say br br 3 the simpsons movie which i have seen okay movie but 4th week out average imdb score of 8 1 a bit high in my opinion br br 4 stardust average imdb score of 8 4 lower then bourn but that's been our for 3 weeks br br whether it was poor scheduling or poor advertising i think that the powers that be behind this movie screwed up big time this should have been advertised as an amazing movie that happens to be a fantasy fairytale and not advertised as just another fairytaleÂ too bad anyway now that i have very pointlessly ranted on and on awesome movie go see it
<START> this movie had good intentions and a good story to work with the director and screenwriter of this movie failed miserably and created a dull boring filmstrip that made me feel like i was back in mr hartford's 8th grade social studies class way back in 67 br br what a waste will somebody please take this story and make a real movie out of it the story deserves it br br every time a scene had potential all we were left with were a few clichÃ©s combined with black and white footage that they probably got from the history channel to show the action shameful br br ossie davis was the only bright light in this dull fest the other acting was incredibly dull it fit in with the movie well and whomever played the captain set a new low standard for line delivery br br however if you are willing to accept all the numerous flaws in this movie and aren't concerned with being awed or entertained but want to learn about the uss mason it is worth a watch
<START> a fine western following the fate of those who possess the prize winning gun a winchester '73 it has a great cast who give superb cliche characterisations with help from the usual effective story telling direction from mann
<START> i don't know where to begin tara reid needs to be stopped before she's put in another movie stephen dorff looks like he got his character's motivation from val kilmer in top gun slater sleepwalks through this dreck the direction editing sound do we really need a heavy metal video in the middle of a gunfight costumes bulletproof vests with muscles on them and hey there's no discernible plot either it amazes me that no one attached to the project stopped and said hey guys this just doesn't make any sense let's start over hopefully slater's career can rebound from this disaster br br hands down the worst film i've ever seen
<START> i had no idea that mr izzard was so damn funny it really boggles the mind that he is not more well known his command over the crowd and his timing is perfect the monologue about star wars will kill ya too if only all the stand up performers had his wit
<START> ghost town starts as kate barrett catherine hickland drives along an isolated desert road her car suddenly breaks down she hears horses hoofs approaching deputy sheriff langley frank luz of riverton county is called in to investigate kate's disappearance after her father reports her missing he finds her broken down car drives off looking for her unfortunately his car breaks down too he has to walk langley ends up at at a deserted rundown ghost town much to his shock langley soon discovers that it is quite literally a ghost town as it's populated by the ghosts of it's former residents is run by the evil devlin jimmie f skaggs who has kidnapped kate for reasons never explained it's up to langley to rescue her end the towns curse br br the one only directorial effort of richard governor this odd film didn't really do much for me i didn't like it all that much the script by duke sandefur tries to mix the horror western genres which it doesn't do to any great effect have you ever wondered why there aren't more horror western hybrid films out there well neither have i but if i were to ask myself such a question i would find all the answers in ghost town because it's not very good the two genres just don't mix that well there are plenty of clichÃ©s on the western side of things there's the innocent townsfolk who are to scared to stand up to a gang of thugs who are terrorising them the shoot outs in the main street saloon bars with swing doors prostitutes upstairs horror wise there's plenty of cobwebs some ghosts an ancient curse talking corpses a few violent kills i was just very underwhelmed by it i suppose there's nothing terribly wrong with it other than it's just dull the two genres don't sit together that well there are a few holes in the plot too why did devlin kidnap kate i know she resembled his previous girlfriend but how did he know that what was he going to do with her anyway we never know why this ghost town is full of ghosts either i mean what's keeping them there what caused them to come back as ghosts then there's the bit at the end where devlin after being shot says he can't be killed only for langley to kill him a few seconds later i mean why didn't the bullets work in the first place br br director governor does alright there's a nice horror film atmosphere with some well lit cobweb strewn sets the standard hollywood western town is represented here with a central street with wooden buildings lining either side of it i wouldn't say it's scary because it isn't there's not much tension either the film drags in places despite being only just over 80 odd minutes in length forget about any gore there a few bloody gunshot wounds an after the fact shot of two people with their throats slit someone is impaled with a metal pole that's it br br i'd have imagined the budget was pretty small here it's reasonably well made is competent if nothing else credit where credit's due the period costumes sets are pretty good actually the acting is alright but no ones going to win any awards br br ghost town is a strange film i'm not really sure who it's meant to appeal to it certainly didn't appeal to me anyone looking for a western will be annoyed with the dumb horror elements while anyone looking for a horror film will be bored by the western elements it's something a bit different but that doesn't mean it's any good worth a watch if your desperate but don't bust a gut to see it
<START> maybe it's just because i have an intense fear of hospitals and medical stuff but this one got under my skin pardon the pun this piece is brave not afraid to go over the top and as satisfying as they come in terms of revenge movies not only did i find myself feeling lots of hatred for the screwer and lots of sympathy towards the screwee i felt myself cringe and feel pangs of disgust at certain junctures which is really a rare and delightful thing for a somewhat jaded horror viewer like myself some parts are very reminiscant of hellraiser but come off as tribute rather than imitation it's a heavy handed piece that does not offer the viewer much to consider but i enjoy being assaulted by a film once and awhile this piece brings it and doesn't appologize i liked this one a lot do not watch whilst eating pudding
<START> i love the newer episodes with cj and grandad i also liked the storyline with kate falling for the principal i want to find out what happens to rory and kerry and bridget and the family next i think cj is very funny and i love his scenes with grandad i have always loved james garner in everything he does and it is a credit to his acting that i never think of him as james garner or rockford in this series and totally believe in him as kate's dad this family is so real and funny it was terribly sad when john ritter paul hennessey died but as in real life these things happen and the way it was written into the series and dealt with was both funny and sad and always extremely sensitively and lovingly dealt with but generally a very funny show with lots of laughs and fun
<START> you'll probably never see it but the uncut version is about 50 better than the one you can buy put it another way once you've seen it in its original form the current version is only half as good br br it's still wildly creative and sick a total success on so many levels br br
<START> a noble effort i guess but ultimately a poor one before seeing this film i felt bartleby the scrivener was unfilmable after seeing it i still do unfortunately i think only those who have read the story will understand what is going on and they will be upset at the film's needless revisions updating from 1850 to 1970 moving from new york to london even the superb talents of paul scofield can't salvage what looks to me like a well meaning but misguided effort to film melville's metaphysical classic
<START> we bought this film from a shop called poundland we were looking for more inspiration as we have previously bought the film no big deal an remade it br br we expected this film to be badly inspirational so that we might remake it and put it on the tube however this was shocking boring is the main word that comes to mind the bad effects and script aren't enough to make you watch it the main woman's body seems to be whipped out at opportune moments in a pathetic attempt to keep the viewer interested however it just makes you wonder did they blow the budget getting her to take her clothes off if so i'd have asked for a refund it looks like a homemade film the shots don't even correspond with each other and the camera work is so amateur it makes our remakes of bad movies look professional i cannot believe that this is being sold as a marketable product br br it is just boring and ugly to watch the actors are bad and there is no degree of professionalism about it there are no words to describe how terrible it is
<START> this film is self indulgent rubbish watch this film if you merely want to hear spoken gaelic or enjoy the pleasant soundtrack watch for any other reason and you will be disappointed it should be charming but isn't it's just irritating the characters are difficult to care about and the acting is poor the stories within the film are also charmless and sinister i was expecting a heartwarming family film but this also held no appeal to my fourteen year old daughter it is rarely that i cannot see a film through to its conclusion but this one got the better of both of us br br although the film is set in current times it has the look and feel of a cheap east european film made during the cold war there isn't even enough in the way of beautiful scottish scenery and cinematography to redeem it a real shame because as a film this is an embarrassment to scotland
