<START> i saw this movie as a kid on creature feature when i lived in new york it was a pretty creepy movie though not as good as horror hotel i just bought this movie on dvd and it is different from what i remember because in the dvd that i bought there are several scenes where the actors speak in french and or italian and no subtitles are provided then the other actors respond in english to what was being said kind of weird also on the dvd box the names of some of the actors are spelled differently than on imdb br br aside from that this movie is different in that the character of elsie takes her clothes off and provides a nude shot in one scene and in another scene julia tries to force elizabeth barbara steele to make out with her by pushing her down on the bed and kissing her while steele resists that scene existed in the tv version but it was very edited i wonder if there is any extra footage that could be incorporated into a remastered ultra edition it seems sad that some of these old low budget classics have been spliced to bits and sold in all kinds of edited versions where are the master tapes and all the unused footage br br aside from the first boring twenty minutes before allen is delivered to the castle the rest of the movie is pretty good there aren't too many special effects but herbert's face after julia clubs him is a good one the creepy atmosphere and the strange exotic and seductive look of barbara steele make the movie a lot better than it should be i can honestly say that if barbara steele had not been in this film it would be a big zero she makes the movie a ten
<START> this is a typical example of technically highly skilled directors of video clips commercials trying to do their first full feature length movie on one hand the imagery camera lighting cgi and even the sound are highly polished and have a truly expensive look and feel even the actors show a certain amount of potential unto the point where even the best acting could not hide a bad plot br br in this case it is not a bad plot but hardly a plot at all br br so 50 of the dialog consists of what the hell was that what was that and what the hell was that in none of the cases any of the characters nor the audience is provided with the slightest hint of an answer though in most of the other dialogues one gets the feeling that there never was any form of dialogue book and the actors had to freely improvise to a plot that wasn't ever explained to them br br the only reason why skye bennet's performance could be so good is that her character as an autistic girl didn't allow giving her these tragically horrible dialogue lines the other actors had to deal with that way she was able to just show her acting talent which the rest of the cast couldn't even get close to i mean there's not one actor in the world that could make up for a dialogue like this br br ben is this real huh emily stop it ben a mass psychosis huh jon somebody has to take control of this situation ben this situation can't be controlled not by you not by anybody emily not by you either ben no br br got me goosebumps but not for horror more for the horrible attempt in some moments i felt ashamed for the actors to have added this to their vita br br 2 stars for the excellent technical work
<START> the romance of the movie which is also its main theme is good and nicely presented however the surrounding of the love story is too lyric graphical and unrealistic even worse the psychology of the main character is weird and incomprehensible exactly like the end of the movie don't hesitate to watch this movie if it attracted your interest but don't expect too much of it either
<START> one of my favorite shows back in the '70s as i recall it went to air on friday or possibly saturday night on the nine network here in australia darren mcgavin and simon oakland were great together br br each episode usually reached a climax with kolchack having to engage in hand to hand combat with some sort of supernatural opponent to their credit the writers made a concerted effort to get away from the usual round of vampires and ghosts as much as possible br br i remember one episode in which the adversary was the spirit of an ancient indian chief which who 'came back' as a massive electrical current which started to kill people in a city hospital the final showdown saw kolchack trying to short circuit the 'power beast' amidst an explosion of sparks and billowing flames oh well you had to be there at the time but it was an interesting idea br br mcgavin always packed a lot of energy and enthusiasm into his roles and this was one of his best br br definitely deserves a place in tv's hall of fame to quote tony vincenzo 'kolchack you are on it ' or in the case of the hall of fame 'in it'
<START> the 1930' were a golden age of los angeles with its film industry and great potential of various other possibilities to become rich and famous and happy people were arriving there hoping to fulfill their dreams expecting open arms and welcoming offers there were only a few who managed to succeed and find their way to stardom majority then condemned to live starving disillusioned and unwanted searching for a bit of respect in dirty bars and nasty hotel rooms br br young italian american writer arturo bandini arrives to la on a similar quest to spread his charms around to get one of those beautiful wealthy women and to write an excellent novel that would set him on a career path having so far written a single short story published in an obscure anthology wishing to create a romantic masterpiece he seems to be unable to produce anything without experiencing it himself though occasionally he sends pieces of magazine stories to a local editor that helps him survive he is proud to present himself as an italian but deep in his heart he truly feels his italian origin as a burden the little money and the courage to conquer the world he once had are all long gone and watching his dream turning into a hangover he holds a last single nickel to spend br br the coffee she brought him was cold and sour and spitting a curse on her triggers a never ending relationship of insults unspoken excuses and a love concealed beneath camilla being an uneducated girl trying to receive us citizenship through a marriage also carries her heavy cross of a non perspective racial heritage though she is much of a stronger and life experienced person her situation as a beautiful mexican woman is much harder to deal with than arturo is able to realize br br is it obvious that arturo eventually finds his inspiration to work on the novel is it possible that their love finally finds its place in the sun is it likely that their romance takes an unlucky turn br br it is very surprising to find out that the chemistry between the two main characters performed by salma hayek and colin farrell does not work the relationship lacks the raw and authentic feelings hayek though livelier a character compared to farrell's forgot to arm camilla with the passion and strength of her once brilliant character frida also it is hard to have faith in a character which being intelligent but uneducated and illiterate uses quite difficult vocabulary and complicated sentences a tougher character of a phil marlowe sort would definitely suit farrell better though he looks stunning in a period costume he seems very lost trying to find the fragile world of a twenty year old dreamer balancing between a hidden love and desire to be true to himself br br feeling embarrassed watching the two on the screen is not right their relationship might have been wild but it is more likely what a thunder and a lightning are without a storm far from real passion feelings just described not felt inside it is very sad that such a potential of an interesting script and good actors was wasted turned into a grey average of soon to be forgotten
<START> i think i laughed twice the line where the main character says something about being from the streets and then i forget the other time i laughed it was probably in the beginning br br this has to be one of the thinnest movies ever doesn't hollywood realize that this kind of humor is degrading and sad really you can only insult yourself so many times br br 2 10
<START> okay the film festival crowd probably loved it but your average popcorn munching movie goer who has scraped to gether the ten or fifteen bucks it costs to see a movie these days will probably wonder why he or she made this choice if it's stamped copolla it's automatically great stuff right wrong it's a neat spoof of filmdom's pretensions but it's terribly in i worry when film makers are more concerned about entertaining themselves rather than the public it's interesting as a cinematic curio and it does have a chuckle or two in it but once it's run its course in the movies and on tv the dust will grow thick on the film cans and tape boxes holding it hardly either epochal or an epic
<START> this is an excellent show i had a us history teacher in high school that was much like this there are many facts in history that are not quite true and mr wuhl points them out very well in a way that is unforgettable br br mr wuhl is teaching a class of film students but history students and even the general public will appreciate the witty way that he uncovers some very well known fallacies in the history of the world and strive to impress them upon that brains of his students use of live actors performing skits is also very entertaining br br i highly recommend this series to anyone interested in having the history they learned as a child turned upside down
<START> i found the characters mediocre and the story uninteresting i never had to read this book thankfully or it would have been a painful experience i got the tickets to the preview for free but it still wasn't worth my time or my friend's i think this story is not worth telling it's like saying that old people have a past before they got old no kidding the lives of the main characters were painful to watch one generation no better than the next at avoiding stupid mistakes however i think the actors did the best they could with a lame story i've always been a big fan of ellen burstyn i'm writing this review to counteract the positive reviews given which unfortunately convinced me to give this movie a try
<START> a bugs life is a great film that is not just for kids but for adults too the story is set around a colony of ants and their struggle against the evil grasshoppers who come back every year and steal their food a mirror of the magnifiscent seven there is some wonderfull computer animation and the voices are great too you will love it 8 out of 10
<START> this miserable film is a remake of a 1927 film they should have let it remain that way br br what a colossal bomb douglas fairbanks displays absolutely no charisma here cesar romero is subjected to a role as a real jerk and bette grable sings with a chorus what i'll do to that hungarian br br the ridiculous plot deals with a picture of a woman in a castle in 1561 rome that saved the day by killing a conqueror fairbanks now let's fast forward to 300 years later where grable just married to the count romero faces a similar situation when on her wedding night there is an invasion by hungarian soldiers br br romero acts cowardly and flees before the army arrives he disguises himself as a gypsy and is made to remain at the castle when his violin playing pleases fairbanks the ending is worse than the entire wretched film when grable meets fairbanks to tell him the good news an enraged romero has annulled the marriage br br this poor imitation of a movie was made in 1948 as harry davenport a veteran supporting player who is in it died in 1949 this must have been his last film what a bomb to go out with after such a distinguished career br br walter abel co stars but he can do little with such poor writing the costumes look more like those that would come out of the stone age i can't fathom what fairbanks was wearing
<START> okay like most steven seagal fans i know i not going expect a masterpiece every time he makes a film but i do expect the film to at least have some sorter budget the main problem with the copy i watched was the terrible over dubbing i know that in some films this has to be done and i accept that but when they overdub with a totally different actors voice and keep doing this thru out the film it does take the magic of overdubbing away also the sets seem to be built with no care as in one scene the sliding glass top in a top secret lab has a massive crack going thru it i was truly disappointed with this film and only hope stevens next project will be more finished off before sending the film out for buying renting the story of this film had me wondering if i was watching a sci fi film or not some parts seemed alien like but they never fully explained what was going on i found it very confusing
<START> i can't believe that so many are comparing this movie to argento's his work is far more imaginative and vicious and a lot more fun br br the director simply lacks the ability to build real tension the murder scenes and let's face it that's what this genre is all about aren't interesting it was not hard to guess who the murderer was and i really didn't care when it was revealed the cinematography isn't memorable and the much praised 19th century gothic atmosphere just didn't draw me in several of the actors are quite good especially the headmistress and the sadistic girl who lords it over the younger students but they're given very little to do br br yes there are undertones of incest sadomasochism and lesbianism but amazingly they add very little spice or suspense br br if you're looking for a good horror movie look elsewhere
<START> liked stanley iris very much acting was very good story had a unique and interesting arrangement the absence of violence and sex was refreshing characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings very enjoyable movie
<START> i really liked this movie even though it wasn't anything like any of the books it still the that classic nancy drew style i had been seeing a lot of advertisements for this movie and since i was really into the nancy drew books i had really high expectations for this movie and they most definitely met those expectations pretty much all of the characters were exactly how i pictured them from reading the books i am really happy that i saw this movie all of the actors and actresses really acted like they acted like in the book series ever since i saw this movie i have wanted to read every single nancy drew book there is out there all of the actors and actresses really got into their characters and it definitely showed when the aired this movie on the big screen it definitely seemed like all of the actors and actresses were really in the positions that the characters were in i most definitely give this movie a 10 out of 10
<START> i really enjoyed this documentary about kenny and spencer's attempt to pitch the dawn was a great look at how outsiders try to get to the inside to make it big br br the story was put together well and organized in an interesting manner that made the film flow well certainly worth a watch my only complaint is that their appeared to be no closure perhaps that is part of the point we expect it but in reality that is not what happened or usually happens br br the film is also a great way to see the personality of kenny and spencer outside of their canadian television show you can see a bit of what is yet to come br br i look forward to a chance to see the papal chase
<START> this cowardly and offensive film had me intrigued to begin with the characters are the familiar dispossessed young males frequently to be seen hanging around bored in a sea side town robert is an outsider but he has his music which could have been his soul instead clay makes robert into a freak who embarks on a journey into cannabis and ecstasy and getting in with the wrong crowd clay seems to believe in reefer madness and robert ends the film as a homicidal rapist one wonders how much experience of real life this young director has no one can save poor robert clay leaves us with the message that young british men are out of control a very unsubtle link is made to the iraqi insurgents during the needlessly graphic rape we are subjected to explosions and images of war the film shows male peer group extremism pushed to it's limits the young bombers in london draw a parallel with clay's hateful depiction of modern male clay implies that men simply cannot help themselves from inflicting terrible acts of violence it is a wonder the british film industry allows money to be invested in films which advocate such divisive propaganda when in london we are still reeling from the recent attacks this is clay's first film i would be delighted if it is his last
<START> while channel surfing we found this movie with its promising synopsis we were dismayed at the flat acting and formulaic storyline we found amusing the exploding car scenes unbelievable shoot outs and sets that crash down with the weight of tyro foam and cardboard what was even more hilarious was seeing all the recycled scenes from dante's peak where the church front falls on the school bus the store fronts break away from the main street the overpass collapsing and the red truck speeding down the alley way as the bricks fall down on it it was a good laugh although unintended and leaves the viewer wondering if it was not originally intended as a low budget spoof of disaster films
<START> as far as parody films go there are few that are worth time and energy but with a recent resurgence of horrid parodies such as date movie and the comebacks it is a breath of fresh air to come back and rediscover a truly funny farce like johnny dangerously br br after his mother has no end of medical problems little johnny goes to work for the mob what fallows is a series of gags most of which work there are however the occasional flops but a foreign gangster who can't master the american language profanity wise at least a rival gangster with a penchant for shooting his mouth off once a younger brother with the d a who is out to get johhny dangerously and a hot young starlet hot for his affections have johnny busy br br and the viewer will be busy laughing for the most part as every gangster movie clichÃ© is skewered by a talented cast and decent writing br br not perfect by a long shot but definitely good for a smile on a bad day
<START> rating 10 10 master piece br br some years ago i heard spielberg comment that he would redo the movie here and there if he had a chance well mr spielberg i guess nothing is perfect but this movie together with schindler's list is your best even oprah acts well in this one br br what got me most is the realism of the story and drama stuff like this happened and is still happening in the world
