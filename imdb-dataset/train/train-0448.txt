<START> first of all br br what the hell why in the world are they trying to sell a low budget piece of crap on late night tv with the promise of disturbing offensive sick garbage that any normal real human being with a soul couldn't watch br br what the crap is funny about a dog being injured a grandma getting her head knocked off a guy getting his hand blown to pieces and two girls going to the bathroom what in the hell has this world come to that people find comedy in some thing so completely sick anyone who thinks this kind of material is funny should not even be allowed to walk the earth br br but from what i hear its not even offensive so they promise comedy through demented piles of sick garbage and they cant even pull that off
<START> i went to see this a few days ago and it's hard to forget that film for the wrong reasons this film is supposed to be funny it's not not a single laugh in the theatre perhaps for josÃ© garcia and gÃ©rard depardieu and it's boring boring boring it was even hard sometimes to understand what they were saying they just talk to fast and don't open their enough for us to understand i was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times i caught myself saying after a line that was supposed to be funny what what did he say and i'm french i hate to say that given the fact that i think good films are made here but i apologise in advance for all foreigners who will go see the film if ever shown outside of france br br we're deeply sorry for that cr p 2 10
<START> i'd like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and it takes a lot for me to dislike a movie but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest crappiest movie i've ever seen br br i have no idea what's wrong with the people who gave it such a good rating here imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to ratings the only thing i can imagine is that people must've voted during one or more conditions br br 1 while being shitfaced stoned out of their minds 2 they've received hard cash for the votes 3 under gunpoint br br i can't believe i wasted a good 1 h 45 min of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie
<START> ok i'm biased i live near shrewsbury in england where this wonderful movie was filmed it still looks the same now i remember them filming here quite vividly and the fake snow on the streets for days on end often when i'm walking through shrewsbury i see a street or a house and it will remind me of this film br br george c scott's scrooge is a more realistic character than many of the other screen versions his physical appearance isn't the typical miser scott's is big and imposing a man who finds those smaller than himself to be inferior br br we all know the story and the quotes the book is one of the most cherished works in the english language and i don't believe there are many cynics who would say that people aren't capable of change and redemption this film version portrays all of that quite beautifully george c scott may be american but he plays the part of the english miser with wonderful skill br br i love this movie if you haven't seen this version i would strongly urge that you do it's usually available for a very small amount of money or are you too mean
<START> if you were to judge based on the movie alone the committee that gave the stage musical a chorus line a pulitzer prize and broadway audiences that kept the war horse running for 15 years were all on heavy narcotics because one singular sensation this film certainly is not br br what possessed anyone to think that richard attenborough was the right fit for this material utterly mystifies me but he makes a musical that is almost entirely about movement just sit on the screen like a lump of clay br br not content with the original score the way it was originally written someone decided that what the film really needed was a brand new song to give the movie some zip thus we are assaulted with the oscar nominated surprise surprise well surprise surprise the song stinks and so does the movie br br grade d
<START> this episode is a bit confusing some people say that you have to start from the very beginning but i have to say i was a bit confused from the beginning br br clark gets a blow to the head and wakes up on the floor of fairview mental institution and is made fun of for believing that he's a superhero clark is told that the life that he knew was all in his head delusional he also find some things that are unusual martha's married to lionel lex is bound to a wheelchair with his limbs cut off after his accident on the bridge and lana is devoted to clark but he finds one familiarity someone else who's devoted to clark chloe he also finds that a mental patient is also from the known world of smallville and the doctor is an escapee from the phantom zone br br this episode reminds me right back to a buffy episode called normal again where buffy begins to have vivid daydreams about a mental asylum the doctor tried to convince her that all that she knew was a figment of her imagination and that she was in fact crazy her parents were still married they still lived in la her friends didn't exist angel was never her boyfriend and she didn't have a sister called dawn demons and vampires also didn't exist both episodes are a bit sad because doctors aren't just telling the characters that it's all a figment of her imagination but it tells us what it really is fiction and it brings us back to reality it's nice though to have a sense of reality every once in a while but we watch these shows to escape from reality it's again nice because the characters have to overcome new challenges
<START> this is definitely not one of lucio fulci's better flicks by any stretch of the imagination the plot is pretty bad a millionaire is murdered and his spirt calls upon his daughter to find out who did it but the biggest problem i have with this besides knowing who killed him within 10 minutes of watching the movie was wondering why anyone should even care the father comes off as being a really big jerk to everyone he came across including the daughter who he asks to help him which made it quite hard for anyone to care who killed him but no one really watches a fulci flick for a good storyline to do so would be like watching a porn for incredible script writing and acting typically his movies try to compensate for this by adding excessive scenes of gore but even that is lacking in this movie if you're looking for a good fulci flick check out the beyond
<START> while i am not a big fan of musicals i have loved the films of fred astaire and ginger rogers because they are just so much fun sure they can be a bit formulaic but even though you know what is going to happen they still are very pleasing to watch however despite this i was a bit disappointed in this outing part of it was because this film doesn't have the wonderful supporting cast like you saw in top hat or shall we dance without edward everett horton or eric blore the film seems to be a bit lacking especially in the fun department the silly antics of these supporting actors gave the other films charm that you just don't get with follow the fleet in addition unlike the usual character played by astaire this one is more of a jerk as his fat head gets rogers into trouble again and again and as a result it's a lot harder to like him or want to see them get together in the end of the film plus although the music is by irving berlin the songs just don't seem as memorable in fact none of the songs were all that special and i can't recall any of them even though i just saw the movie while this is still a cute and worthwhile film it just lacks the sparkle and magic of some of their other films good but far from great
<START> i just saw ifÂ i can remember the advertisements for the movie from 1968 so i was interested in finally seeing it it may be the perspective of an american who never went to a british public school and misses some of the social references but i thought the movie was awful for one thing as others have pointed out it takes almost the entire movie for the much ballyhooed at the time revolt to break out for another whether the last scene is real or imagined what occurs isn't a revolt but a shooting rampage there's quite a difference br br i know it may be bad form to judge a movie on subsequent events but one cannot avoid doing it here one person wrote a message board posting asking us not to compare the end of movie to the incidents at columbine high school and virginia tech but if there's a scintilla of difference between klebold harris and cho on the one hand and travis malcom mcdowell on the other i simply can't see it all four of them were under the delusion that their gunfire is going to purify a f ed up world that they arrogantly take no responsibility for br br which brings me to why the hell are travis and his chums even in a school they so despise they are adults or close to it they're not in a military prison like the inmates in the hill a much better british film from about the same time no one is forcing them to go to college and take beatings from the the whips except maybe ambitious parents in need of a wake up about the nature of their sons i had the opportunity in college to join a frat except i couldn't stand to be given silly cruel orders by delinquents claiming to be my prospective brothers i took the consequences of not having the in with the establishment that frats provide and i can't say i regretted it br br if travis fancies himself the second coming of lenin whose unbearded picture hangs prominently in his room he's free to go out and organize a fitter's union or work for michael foot in the next election if he wants to be jack kerouac then get on the road and start writing what possible benefit is he giving the world in joyriding a motorcycle and getting drunk in his room br br sometimes reviewers have to be like the person who responded to the scene in last tango in paris where brando mopes about having had to go on a date with cow manure on his shoes in the real world the person said a listener would say why didn't you scrape it off change your shoes don't allow fictional characters to lay a self pity trip on you because you don't dare point out an common sense alternative course of action for them so it is here
<START> as a fan of eric rohmer's studies of the contemporary war between the sexes i was very eager to see the lady and the duke l'anglaise et le duc for how he would treat men and women during a real war the french revolution br br the film looks beautiful with each scene designed as a period painting like a tableaux vivant and i expected much talking as that's rohmer's style but maybe rohmer was restrained by basing the screenplay on a real woman's writings is why this mostly felt like a docudrama version of the scarlet pimpernel br br as awful as the excesses of robespierre et al how about some recognition that the french aristocrats were spoiled brats i kept humming to myself marat we're poor and the poor stay poor you could also pick a tune from les miz br br i wasn't all that sympathetic as the central figure has to go back and forth between her city home and country manor to stay ahead of the revolution at one point her maid claims the pantry is bare but sure manages to lay out a fine repast i simply didn't understand her an english sympathizer who alternately rejects and defends her former lover and patron as he and the revolution keep shifting political focus i think i was supposed to sympathize with her consistency more than their political machinations like a character out of the scarlet pimpernel hey the only reason she didn't go back home was her disgrace after an affair and child with the prince of wales or somebody br br usually in a revolutionary period there's some groundswell of change going on in relations between men and women but i saw none here i once went to a herbert marcuse lecture that concluded with a lengthy q a the last question from an audience member far older than the rest of us acolytes heck she had gray hair was why are revolutionaries so grim she was hooted at and marcuse didn't deign to respond to it seriously but it's the only thing of substance i remember from the whole evening rohmer demonstrates that counter revolutionaries are also grim and didactic br br originally written 8 11 2002
<START> i remember this show from swedish television i was only 7 years of age and it scared me beyond belief br br i would love to revisit this series and see if it was just as excellent as remember though i suspect my taste and demands have changed br br although this was released before alien and a plethora of other space thrillers i suspect that it has its root in scary movies from the 50 s and the political climate of the 70 s when i think of it this was a real sci fi a movie trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are the term sci fi has since then become bleak and come to be the term for any movie that has space ships in them
<START> of all the film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s this has to rank as one of the strangest and most fun to watch i say that because of the four main actors orson welles rita hayworth everett sloane and glenn anders br br the first two names are familiar to everyone but it was the last two that made this movie so entertaining to me especially anders his character george grisby is one of the strangest people i've ever seen on film his voice and some of the things he said have to be heard to be believed slaone isn't far behind in the strange category hayworth is not as glamorous with short blonde hair but still is hayworth which means a lot to ogle if you are a guy welles' is as fascinating as always one tip if you have the dvd turn on the english subtitles his character in this movie is an irishman and you need the subtitles to understand everything he says br br welles also directed the film which means you have great camera angles and wonderful facial closeups you also have a unique ending visually with a shootout in a house of mirrors great stuff as bizarre as this film is i still thought the buffoon like carnival atmosphere at the trial near the end was too much and took away from the seriousness of the scene other than that no complaints br br this is great entertainment which is the name of the game
<START> a group of us watched this film are were really disgusted we were willing to forgive the fact that our favorite character jo wasn't on it's not like the writers producers could do anything about that the writing was poor the script was sub par what really annoyed us 1 when the two guys realized they were both dating natalie they didn't just leave they put up with that stupid and ultimately degrading contest but only because they were macho competing guys not because they really wanted natalie 2 despite being unable to choose between the two guys before the reunion natalie suddenly decides that she really loves one of the guys and is now ready to marry him and there was no foreshadowing that he was really a better guy it's as if the writers flipped a coin and then just had her spit it out at some convenient point in the film 3 blair makes a point of talking about how she does not want children and then all of a sudden when her husband says he wants to have children she blissfully agrees with him
<START> every now and again you hear radio djs inviting listeners to nominate movies that the listener can't stand or never watched all the way through this is the movie that i think of days later br br it's got something to do with a play by shakespeare not sure but i think i bailed on this movie some 20 odd minutes into it think i realised that my toenails wouldn't clip themselves and they were looking at me imploringly to get cut br br this movie just seemed boring and pretentious to me br br even though this is the first movie i've given such a low score to which i've actually attempted to watch i wouldn't want to put you off other movies by it's english director peter greenaway i remember thinking that his the cook the thief his wife and her lover was a truly great british film even though its content was at times stomach churning a brilliant movie but i can understand why people would balk at seeing it br br another good film by greenaway was a zed and two noughts again it had some content that pushed the boundaries of good taste but was intriguing nonetheless br br the other film that i usually think of too late for such radio show topics is brazil never managed to watch that all the way through either kept falling asleep br br unless you have a taste for self important movies which are off puttingly highly stylised laboriously paced and difficult to follow then steer clear of prosero's books
<START> i'm gettin' sick of movies that sound entertaining in a one line synopsis then end up being equal to what you'd find in the bottom center of a compost heap br br who knows witchery may have sounded interesting in a pitch to the studios even with a big name cast like blair and hasselhoff wink wink nudge nudge and the effervescent likes of hildegard knef i dunno some woman br br but on film it just falls apart faster than a papier mache sculpture in a rainstorm seems these unfortunate folks are trapped in an island mansion off the eastern seaboard and one of them a woman i'd guess is being targeted by a satanic cult to bear the child of hell while the others are offed in grotesque tortuous ways br br okay right there you have a cross section of plots from the exorcist the omen ten little indians and a few other lesser movies in the satanic worshippers run amok line none of it is very entertaining and for the most part you'll cringe your way from scene to scene until it's over br br no not even linda blair and david hasselhoff help matters much they're just in it to pick up a paycheck and don't seem very intent on giving it their all br br from the looks of it hasselhoff probably wishes he were back on the beack with pam anderson and who can blame him and linda well who knows a celebrity peta benefit or pro am golf tour or whatever it is she's in to nowadays br br and the torture scenes ecchhhh you'll see people get their mouths sewn shut dangled up inside roaring fireplaces strung up in trees during a violent storm vessels bursting out of their necks etc etc sheesh and i thought mark of the devil was the most sadistic movie i'd seen br br don't bother it's not worth your time i can't believe i told you as much as i did if you do watch it just see if you can count the cliches and yes blair gets possessed as if you didn't see that coming down main street followed by a marching band br br no stars witchery these witches will give you itches
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed this flick i am of the firm belief that matt stone and trey parker are comic geniuses of our time they have the uncanny ability to add this level of absurdity to pop culture and make it rediculous but in a realistic way if that makes any sense this is mainly what makes south park soooo funny once you get past the fact that it is probably the most vulgar and indiscreet cartoon ever you see in every episode the message that is being conveyed that is apparent in baseketball although it is directed by david zucker and is utterly rediculous it has a sincere message about corporate america and the disgrace that is major league sports i am also a fan of sports so i find this movie hilarious at times because it is so true in that bizarre way that people hate to love the opening prologue is brilliant tears from laughter form everytime i see those football players begin riverdance some may not like this movie because it's just not everyone's cup of tea but just like south park once you look past the absurdity it has a really genuine message that is conveyed through literal comic genius i gave this movie 8 out of 10 stars
<START> casomai is a masterful tale depicting the story of a young couple who wade through the murky waters of marriage the story is very believable in telling the strange see saw between oblivion and continuous interference by others which is fairly typical in italy one may wonder whether such happenings are different elsewhere though pavignano and d'alatri were very good at writing and that is one of the strong points of the movie acting by stefania rocca and fabio volo is sober and gripping and the figure of the sympathetic priest is funny and well rounded all in all a truly deserving movie probably one of the best italian movies of the year
<START> there are numerous films relating to ww2 but mother night is quite distinctive among them in this film we are introduced to howard campbell nolte an american living in berlin and married to a german helga noth lee who decides to accept the role of a spy more specifically a cia agent major wirtanen goodman recruits campbell who becomes a nazi propagandist in order to enter the highest echelons of the hitler regime however the deal is that the us government will never acknowledge campbell's role in the war for national security reasons and so campbell becomes a hated figure across the us after the war he tries to conceal his identity but the past comes back and haunts him his only friend is wirtanen but even he cannot do much for the avalanche of events that fall upon poor campbell br br the story is deeply touching as we watch the tragedy of campbell who although a great patriot is treated by disdain by everybody who surrounds him not only that but he also gradually realizes that even the persons who are most close to him have many secrets of their own vonnegut provides us with a moving atmosphere with campbell's despair building up and almost choking the viewer br br nolte plays the role of his life in my opinion he is even better than in affliction although in both roles he plays tragic figures who are destined to self destruction sheryl lee is also excellent and the same can be said for the whole cast in general br br i haven't read the book so i cannot appraise how the film compares to it in any case this is something of no importance here my critique is upon the film per se and the film wholeheartedly deserves a 9 10
<START> i just wanna say that amongst all the so called classic hiphop films ive seen like wild style krushgroove breakin' style wars etc imo beat street is the best amongst the others whenever i ask other people about which is their fave then it seems that beat street pops out the most but still its the lowest ranked of all 4 3 is just a punch under the belt if say 5 points is the belt i love the music performances the breakdancing makes me wanna spin ramo makes me wanna throw a piece c'mon its a classic
