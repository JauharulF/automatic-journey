<START> is miike like chabrol alternating art with dreck sometimes confusing the two does he match the fifty fifty rate some claim for chabrol do we see here too much or too little miike i don't know i don't know i don't know but i could easily fill ten lines just citing chakushin ari's one missed call's steals allusions and clichÃ©s others here will hit on most of them though not perhaps ochiai's saimin hypnosis for the sleazy telecast taunting things supernatural only once when yumi takes the zombie like mother in her arms did one missed call startle me a little br br one other point of interest renji ishibashi looks like christopher walken as the detective ishibashi in audition's abusive back story and as dead or alive's boss aoki of the vat of excrement drowning and more may be the most convincingly evil character actor i've ever seen so here he's a cop
<START> a group of human looking aliens going to earth to eat crash land on a planet of prehistoric beasts instead where they all eat physcedelic mushrooms and act retarded padded with footage from planet of the dinosuars and horrible jokes this is definitely one to miss the acting is atrocious as well and while this isn't as bad as chickboxer what movie can be this is still pretty awful repugnant stuff it's 90 minute running time feels like an eternity and you will likely be cursing life so do yourself a huge favor and just move on skip this crappy film there's nothing to see here br br the film makers try to resell this turd as a mst3k style making fun of the movie they made a decade before and it works to an extent it's still nothing that watchable though ariauna albright is hot but lilith stabs has a pretty unattractive speaking voice br br my grade d br br dvd extras joke commentary 17 behind the scenes featurette 7 minute into the black featurette jessica mills reporting stills gallery and original trailer
<START> there should be more movies about our native americans i especially think that using actual real native americans would be the the right thing i know that this archie belaney who was played by pierce brosnan he did an excellent job in portraying that character since he was an englishman but my suggestion to hollywood is to put more american indians into the roles and never use anyone else the sioux nation has been put on the back burner far too long their poverty is a disgrace to our country it is my firm belief that our country should return the black hills to the sioux we ask israel to return their lands to the arabs but we do not make any effort to do the same we should be ashamed of ourselves we must practice what we preach
<START> unashamedly ambitious sci fi from kerry conran for whom this is clearly a labour of love unfortunately it's just not that good it all starts well enough with an epic but restrained score a mixture of lucas and hitchcock style editing and the glossy cinematography of a spielberg the movie also references many pulp sci fi novels serials and films as diverse as the day the earth stood still superman metropolis planet of the apes the iron giant star wars and the spy who loved me the film however fails to be as good as any one of those for several reasons the main being that it's such a labour of love so concerned with throwing everything at the screen and creating a brave new world conran actually forgets about making a movie there is little to no tension atmosphere or magic on offer here despite aerial battles dinosaurs and race against time set pieces even the noir elements fall flat this is a broad way of looking at things though those elements mainly fail because nothing feels at all real and is so obviously fake the green screen just looks like a video game half the time and it's obvious the actors have been pasted on afterwards the actors don't get to do much either jude law is wooden gwyneth paltrow is annoying and stupid angelina jolie is wasted and it's all because of an awful script the sort that has to explain nearly everything it is a decent experience and some might get a nostalgia feel but ultimately this is a pointless step into the world of yesterday nice ending though
<START> this movie stinks you will want back the two plus hours it takes to get through it sliding doors w gwyenth paltrow and directed by peter howit did what melinda melinda tries to do much much much better that movie was clever witty and well acted i cared about what happened to both gwyenths or rather the characters she played and the performances by supporting cast were fantastic br br where as melinda melinda is tiresome the dialogue is contrived and i could have cared less about any of these people least of all melinda one melinda is so dysfunctional her first glass of wine is at 10 a m and so melodramatic she is laughable and not in the comedic sense the 2nd melinda is fine but forgettable br br woody allen's previous ensemble movies worked because i'm guessing he spent time on the screenplay and the actors were talented one piece of trivia for this movie is that he wrote this screenplay in two months you can tell and while chloe sevigny is talented those around her are not not enough to be a whole presence the movie ends up being chloe sevigny and a bunch of other people you know you've seen in other movies but can't quite remember which ones br br sad very sad
<START> maybe one of the most entertaining ninja movies ever made a hard hitting action movie with lots of gore and slow motion eehaaa made in Â´83 and still the greatest swedish action movie made so far and we can hardly wait to see the upcoming sequel ninja mission 2000 the legacy of markov
<START> eleven great filmmakers eleven pieces of garbage eleven minutes each of sheer tedium sophistry condescension self indulgence treats for people of all nations yussef chahine of egypt giving a hip hip hooray for terorism in his amateurish segment across the green line we have amos gitai of israel using his eleven minutes to show a terrorist act and focus on a jerky newscaster alejandro gonzÃ¡lez iÃ±Ã¡rritu of mexico concentrated on the twin towers but seemed to forget to turn on his camera sean penn not knowing that there were no buildings within the shadow of the trade center on 9 11 shohei imamura of japan ignoring the whole thing claude lelouch focussing on a trivial and cliched love affair ken loach of the uk focussing on chile etc etc
<START> since the 70s writer producer director charles band has been responsible for literally hundreds of science fiction fantasy and horror b movies some of them are wonderful examples of how to use a tiny budget to maximum effect many of them are pretty bad trancers 1985 was one of those rare gems br br a terminator style tale of time travel and action trancers saw tim thomerson playing jack deth a future cop given the task of tracking down bad guy whistler who travels into the past by inhabiting the body of an ancestor whistler is capable of controlling other humans with his psychic powers converting them into obedient zombies the 'trancers' of the title and attempts to alter the course of history by killing off the ancestors of the leaders of the future jack follows him to 1985 determined to stop him br br in this 1991 sequel jack is still living in 1985 having destroyed whistler he has settled down and married leena helen hunt the young woman who helped him succeed in the first movie but for jack things don't stay calm for long and trouble appears in the form of whistler's brother e d wardo who is trying to build a trancer army br br trancers ii lacks the charm and simplicity of the original and is a huge disappointment considering how good the original was the story is difficult to pick up if you haven't seen the first film or at least not for a long while and there is loads of unimpressive action and a few poor special effects gone is the inventiveness and wit that made trancers so much fun instead we get some cheesy one liners and a script that feels like it was written on the fly br br about the only reason i can give for recommending this film to fans of the genre is the cast which boasts many names that will be familiar to followers of sci fi and horror movies jeffrey combs barbara crampton richard lynch martine beswicke unfortunately most of them seemed to be having an 'off day' whilst filming trancers ii and performances are mediocre at best br br the trancers series obviously has its fans four further sequels have since been churned out unless the quality has taken up massive upward swing i can't imagine them being any good
<START> i have this film out of the library right now and i haven't finished watching it it is so bad i am in disbelief audrey hepburn had totally lost her talent by then although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'robin and marian ' this is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film it's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the dorothy stratten appearance just prior to her homicide br br there is nothing but idiocy between gazzara and his cronies little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest palest shadow br br who could believe that there are even some of the same manhattan environs that hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'breakfast at tiffany's' twenty years earlier the soundtrack of old sinatra songs and the gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you br br 'reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down i guess in this case audrey hepburn's chic european lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star here she has even lost her talent as a star if someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period like ann margret had played the role there would have been some life in it even given the unbelievably bad material and mongoloid level situations br br hepburn was a great person of course greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors after this dreadful performance she went on to make an atrocious tv movie with robert wagner called 'love among thieves ' in 'they all laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like lana turner were infinitely more effective than is hepburn turner took acting seriously even when she was bad hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all couldn't be bothered with it even her hair and clothes look tacky her last really good work was in 'two for the road ' perhaps her most perfect if possibly not her best in many ways br br and that girl who plays the country singer is just sickening john ritter is horrible there is simply nothing to recommend this film except to see dorothy stratten who was truly pretty otherwise critic david thomson's oft used phrase 'losing his her talent' never has made more sense br br ben gazarra had lost all sex appeal by then and so we have 2 films with gazarra and hepburn who could ask for anything less sandra dee's last pitiful film 'lost ' from 2 years later a low budget nothing had more to it than this at least ms dee spoke in her own voice by 1981 audrey hepburn's accent just sounded silly she'd go on to do the pbs 'gardens of the world with audrey hepburn' and there her somewhat irritating accent works as she walks through english gardens with aristocrats or waxes effusively about 'what i like most is when flowers go back to nature ' as in naturalized daffodils but in an actual fictional movie she just sounds ridiculous br br to think that 'breakfast at tiffany's' was such a profound sort of light poetic thing with audrey hepburn one of the most beautiful women in the world she was surely one of the most beautiful screen presences in 'my fair lady' matching garbo in several things and delphine seyrig in 'last year at marienbad ' and then this and her final brief role as the angel 'hap' in the spielberg film 'always' was just more of the lady stuff corny witless and stifling br br i went to her memorial service at the fifth avenue presbyterian church a beautiful service which included a boys' choir singing the shaker hymn 'simple gifts ' the only thing not listed in the program was the sudden playing of hepburn's singing 'moon river' on the fire escape in 'breakfast at tiffany's ' and this brought much emotion and some real tears out in the congregation br br a great lady who was once a fine actress as in 'the nun's story' and one of the greatest and most beautiful of film stars in many movies of the 50's and 60's who became a truly bad one that's not all that common and perhaps it is only a great human being who in making such things as film performances trivial nevertheless has the largeness of mind to want to have the flaws pointed out mercilessly which all of her late film work contained in abundance most of the talk about hepburn's miscasting is about 'my fair lady ' but the one that should have had the original actress in it was 'wait until dark ' which had starred lee remick on broadway never as celebrated as hepburn she was a better actress in many ways hepburn was completely incapable of playing anything really sordid although hepburn was at least adequate enough in that part after that all of her acting went downhill
<START> the cure is an amazing film so suspenseful and just so real i was lucky enough to catch a screening of 'the cure' at it's nyc premiere and it completely blew me away i also heard it won an award from that particular festival and it definitely deserved it the first thing that struck out at me was the cinematography eric giovon did an amazing job the shooting style of the love scene halfway into the film was amazing a love scene was necessary in this film and jafri got the point across but also kept the scene tasteful giovon and jafri make an excellent creative team and they should definitely work together on future projects judy maier's narration was so surreal but simultaneously heart wrenching it made me feel what the main character felt i'm a very tough critic but i must say the cure is one of my favorite films just love it if you haven't seen it yet check it out
<START> hollywood the home of hype glamor and the search for profits is scarcely ruled by spiritual values and so it comes as no surprise that its attempts at investigations of the spiritual life are thin and often silly better to go farther afield to the films of bresson dreyer rossellini and bergman for probing depictions of the spirituality strange cargo is no exception this odd hybrid of adventure film love story and religious parable trivializes the very insights it tries to communicate that a figure of providence and salvation would work to match verne clark gable at his most cockily mannered and self regarding and julie joan crawford snarling and spitting out every other word in an attempt to be the queen of tough dames seems ludicrous at best is this the patron saint of the star system at work matching warring egos before sending them off to further penal servitude on the m g m lot but there are good supporting performances here and visually arresting moments the shadowy prison barracks the escaping boat by moonlight or against a painterly cloudscape julie walking along the seafront as the wind whips up julie and monsieur pig peter lorre bargaining for verne's freedom as the storm builds an unusually ennobling gay prison romance between two convicts above all there is paul lukas's dignified and detached performance as hessler a murderer who can appreciate cambreau's virtues yet turns his back on him in the film's most arresting moment hessler having left cambreau stands outside the cabin we hear the wind through the jungle see the shadows on his face which conveys a moment of fear and self doubt then he exits into the night in this moment hessler achieves an ambiguity depth and existential strength that none of the other characters manage to achieve is the film's secret that its deepest sympathies are allied with hessler
<START> the acronymic f p 1 stands for floating platform 1 the film portends the building of an f p 1 in the middle of the atlantic ocean to be used as an air station for transatlantic plane flights based a contemporary curt siodmark novel it was filmed in german as f p 1 antwortet nicht 1932 in french as i f 1 ne rÃ©pond plus 1933 and in english as f p 1 1933 soon technology made non stop oceanic travel much more preferable br br stars conrad veidt as ellissen jill esmond as droste and leslie fenton as claire find love and sabotage on and off the atlantic platform karl hartl directed mr veidt is most fun to watch but he is not convincing in the love triangle with ms esmond and mr fenton the younger co stars were the spouses of laurence olivier and ann dvorak respectively both the concept and film have not aged well br br f p 1 4 3 33 karl hartl conrad veidt jill esmond leslie fenton
<START> not that he'd care but i'm not one of simon pegg's friends if i was there's a good chance we'd fallout if he continued to make dross like this the trouble is he found a successful formula as the bumbling ordinary guy next door type in shawn of the dead run fat boy run etc but it's starting to wear thin here his character has no discernible qualities he's rude and obnoxious and thinks he's funny when he frankly isn't when transferred to new york from london and i presume this link is meant to appeal to viewers on both sides of the atlantic he proves equally out of place with his new colleagues still is it any wonder when amongst his jolly japes he hires a transvestite stripper to appear at an editorial meeting an act of revenge for his boss yet somehow kirsten dunst starts to warm to him even though he's done nothing nice oh and because he's a superficial male he falls for megan fox at first sight possibly because her character is as shallow as his it all makes for a predictable film conclusion although i can't see any viewer expressing how this mirrored their life the shame is that on paper this is a cast supposedly worth watching pegg though plays himself kirsten dunst seems to just go though the motions creating no on screen chemistry and megan fox isn't stretched at all the one huge plus is miriam margolyes as pegg's new york landlady now if she had been on screen longer
<START> soon americans would swarm over a darkened damaged england preparing to invade europe but in 1937 the picture of hip americans in the sunny slightly ridiculous english countryside was an appealing idyllic diversion american dancing star heartthrob jerry halliday astaire on a european tour weary of the screaming female crowds generated by the lurid propaganda of his manager burns is unwittingly caught up in the marriage prospects of frustrated heiress lady alice marshmorton fontaine the tale is complicated by a betting pool among the marshmorton servants that is run by and rigged for head butler keggs gardiner who's betting on lady alice's cousin reggie noble the favorite of alice's stuffy domineering aunt collier the story would have been much better as a half hour tv episode the usual wodehouse plot devices of mistaken identity and jumps to wrong conclusions wear thin in a full length film both alice jerry appear impossibly and annoyingly clueless by the second half of the film the amusement park interlude the climax in the castle are too long begin to drag fontaine is too beautiful too dignified too quiet to be a ditzy blonde no matter how aristocratic while young footman albert watson is painfully awful but while damsel is a pretty diminutive vehicle for so much talent the talent doesn't let us down astaire's romantic comedy skill is no less enjoyable here than in any of his films with ginger rogers and his dance scenes both solo with burns allen are up to par though his one dance with novice hoofer joan is necessarily tame gracie nearly steals the whole show as george's bubbly secretary who is at once airheaded conniving coolly self confident her scene with solid character actor gardiner as the devious snob keggs is a one of a kind classic this astaire's priceless scene with the madrigal singers give damsel a delightful color of naive but noble spirited americans mixing with noble but dull spirited englishmen gershwin is at the top of his game with nice work if you can get it stiff upper lip which carry the film through its weak points and is there another film where madrigals get a gershwin swing treatment damsel is more than a piece of trivia for those who might want to see astaire without rogers or fontaine before she was a real star it's a fine diversion as entertaining as any of the vaudevillian musical comedies that ruled the 1930s but will never be made again
<START> saw this movie recently and had higher hopes not so much based upon the director who hadn't made a cinematographic release before but more based upon its cast harvey keitel scott glenn and craig wasson lead role in body double a brian de palma masterpiece have all starred in great movies not together though and this fact hasn't exactly changed because of this one br br the film is unbelievable very predictable and clichÃ© the only thing that might make it slightly appealing is the selection of locations on which it's been shot in my humble opinion don't waste your time on this one
<START> this was one of the worst wrestlemania's i've seen it just didn't stand out at all really card wise i thought it was going to be pretty good but every match just seemed to fall short br br chris benoit vs mvp one of the better matches benoit carried it i just didn't think mvp was that great but benoit saved this match br br kane vs khali wow these two guys don't mix or maybe it's khali and any other person alive don't mix awful match br br melina vs ashley i'm not a fan of female wrestling br br ecw originals vs new breed i was excited about this match until i saw it really really disappointing br br edge vs cm punk vs king booker vs jeff hardy vs matt hardy vs mr kennedy vs finlay vs randy orton absolutely the worst mitb match so far just a major let down to many people in the ring at the same time it just didn't live up br br bobby lashley vs umaga o k not extremely impressive but not the worst of the night br br batista vs undertaker this was maybe the best match of the night very very very nice to see something good for a change br br john cena vs shawn michaels i really feel like this match deserved to be last people make a case for batista vs undertaker but this match was just as good i am starting to get sick of seeing cena win every match though it's getting a little old now i have to say i feel this match is the best of the night but i'm a huge shawn michaels fan so i'm a little biased batista vs 'taker may have been better but i'm biased so sorry the last two were undoubtedly the best matches of the night and most everything else really came up short
<START> the best film on the battle of san antonio texas in march 1836 was john wayne's 1960 epic the alamo in a one shot job as director producer that temporarily financially strapped him wayne demonstrated that he was talented in movie making outside of his icon like acting ability personifying the west br br i have commented on that film in a review the other night and i pointed out that wayne and james edward grant the screenwriter tackled some points that were barely mentioned in earlier films about the battle they did bring in the issue of slavery they also finally discussed the contribution of local mexican land owner juan seguin as an important leader in the war for independence on par with crockett bowie travis austin and houston br br but there was one weakness though well hidden in the film wayne worked hard to cast it properly thinking of many people for lead roles in it but he did not properly handle the leader of the enemy forces general antonio de santa anna the role was played by an obscure actor ruben padilla on this board his thread shows only three credits listed padilla did not have any spoken dialog even in spanish and while he does have one of the last shots in the film he just is shown as a silent tyrant observing the burning of the bodies of the americans and their allies br br despite several poor choices in the casting of this television movie the alamo thirteen days to clory it is the best film in showing the man who was from 1836 to 1854 a leading bogeyman to american policy makers raul julia was a wonderful stage actor i was fortunate to see him in a production in the late 1980s of arms and the man in manhattan as sergius he was never boring and usually first rate in his acting br br here we see the egotistical monster at his worst nothing is acceptable that does not fit santa anna's wishes or activities it can be the failure of an orderly in the army to bring some item he requested fast enough or it can be the temerity of these foreign brigands as he saw the americans in not knuckling down to himself the napoleon of the west br br santa anna was president of mexico five or six times between 1830 and 1855 he claimed that he first got involved in overthrowing a president because that president did not live up to the country's constitution but it was the power that kept him going year after year it is a sad commentary that he was the leading mexican historical figure in those two decades no political figure or military figure would rise to override him until benito juarez did in the late 1850s initially he claimed great liberal ideals but he once admitted that the people of mexico were children who needed guidance for one hundred years before they could rule themselves and thus he sounds like gilbert roland in crisis talking about the people he has helped lead against jose ferrer the amazing thing about him was he managed to keep coming back his policies were disasters while we know about his attack on texas to put down a revolt there he also tried to expand into guatamala and probably saw himself controlling much of central america he did win at the alamo but at great cost of lives his massacre of col fannin's men at goliad was inexcusable one might make a case for the destruction of the defenders of the alamo who were fighting to the last but fannin had surrendered then came the disaster of san jacinto where his army was wiped out he failed to take adequate precautions to watch for the american troops he was captured and humiliated and forced to sign a surrender of texas houston was kind to him the troops wanted to string him up br br except for losing a leg in a battle against the french in 1838 he managed not to get wounded in most of his wars he repudiated the forced surrender of texas but could not militarily undue it instead he would lead mexico into defeat in the war of 1846 48 against the americans leading to the mexican session the u s was decent enough to pay mexico 15 000 000 for the southwest but mexico lost half of it's territory he would be president for the last time in 1853 in time to give franklin pierce's horrendously bad administration it's one moment of glory santa anna sold the border of arizona and new mexico the gadsden purchase to the u s no other mexican president not even porfirio diaz ever cost his country so much diaz did sell out to foreign business interests but he built up mexico's economic muscles doing so he was exiled in 1855 and settled in staten island there he managed to do his most creative work he introduced chicle to the u s and it became chewing gum some achievement br br julia's santa anna is younger than the practiced cynic and schemer who became america's best land purchase agent he is not going to stand for opposition and he jumps into furious tantrums at a moment's notice most of the time his chief aide col black david ogden stiers here a british born officer holds his tongue he does not wish to be in front of a firing squad as he could be but stiers is secretly less than enchanted by his boss at the end when alone with the newly widowed wives of the dead alamo defenders stiers suggests that they tell the world what santa anna is really like and they did
<START> some possible spoilers br br i'm not too sure what dreamworks was thinking when they decided to plunk 80 million down on this extremely tired and lame animated flick they probably thought the spectacular animation would be more than enough to bring audiences mostly families to see it in droves well it seemed to work for the opening weekend it made 26 mil roughly and has made 38 1 mil total an estimation for this weekend but i think audiences that came during the weekend saw pretty much the same thing i did when i saw and they spread the word this is one majorly lame movie apart from the animation everything else mostly the script seem to be done by a three year old br br the movie is only about 80 mins long but it feels like a three hour epic a few sticking points for me are well the irritating narration is one of them and it's so obviously written at one point he escapes from some captors and even though you can see the horse is obviously scared up pops the narrator the voice of the talented matt damon to clear up any misconceptions which would only happen in the simplest of mindsets br br another one is the constant pop up of bryan adams songs now i'm a fan of his music i think he's good but come on did dreamworks really think audiences would be able to handle 8 9 of his songs throughout such a short movie i certainly couldn't finally and here's a spoiler a horse gets shot at point blank range by a member of the calvary no less she the horse then falls into a raging river spirit the focus of the movie tries to save her but they both go over a waterfall that must have at least a 50 foot drop well later in the movie near the end we see that this horse is alive and well now i know this is a kids movie but even that little amount of realism is unacceptable br br to sum up this is a really lame movie i'm not saying kids won't enjoy it but anyone else will be checking their watches just waiting for this tripe to end definitely on my top 10 worst list of this year out of 4 stars br br
<START> in the beginning and throughout the movie it was great it was suspenseful and thrilling yet in the end it gave no answer to what had happened they mysteriously turned into zombies by a raven or crow it did not answer the questions that we all had and therefore was not as good a movie as i thought that it was going to be
