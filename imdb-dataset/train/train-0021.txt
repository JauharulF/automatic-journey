<START> i'm not a big fan of rom coms at the best of times a few have been quite good check of dream for an insomniac but this one is just more of the same but less br br with a running time of 100min i expect more than 1 laugh every 30mins the only real belly laugh are when male strangers and friends instinctively help out lee's character br br all i can say is avoid i guarantee there is at least 10 other movies on the shelf that deserve you br br 3 of out 10 and only cos i'm a big lee fan
<START> funny sexy hot there is no real plot but you needn't anyone br br so the naked or almost naked girls and the typical fights between college cliques need no development br br all in all the whole seems to be known from simply every film in this category but the reissuer reached the goal that this film can be recognized out of thousand others br br last thing i've got to say unbelievable funny br br you've got to see it br br and if you are young and you want know more about the female body you've got to see it twice
<START> having first achieved fame with drunken master jackie chan was thrust into the spotlight once more with 1983's project a a hugely enjoyable pirate flick which re established him as a major star by the time police story was released two years later the extraordinary hype surrounding jackie was reaching its zenith and crowds flocked to see this frenetic blend of awesome stunts brutal fight scenes and questionable comedy it broke numerous box office records and inspired a 50 rise in police recruits but viewed 20 years on is it any good br br as an action movie police story unquestionably stands up there are several terrific fight scenes some stuntwork that recalls the very best of chan's hero buster keaton and a compelling if over violent climactic tussle jackie's performance is also very strong and whilst the frequent forays into laboured comedy dull the film's impact just a little his charisma carries it through furthermore in presenting our hero as a borderline psychopath whose recklessness puts others in danger jackie took a momentous gamble though in the event nobody seems to have noticed by praising police story as a simple 'good vs evil' battle critics belittled the film's ambiguity of tone and whilst it's hardly the brothers karamazov in depicting such uncertainty the film nevertheless represented a notable and praiseworthy shift from conventional ideas br br in short this remains a quality popcorn movie though you may empty your stomach as numerous villains are thrust against or deposited into glass showcases in the film's final scene a potent boisterously entertaining action movie that ranks with the best of its period
<START> some saying about 'the play is the most important thing' or something like that is attributed to that old bard of avon himself william shakewspeare if it wasn't old will it may well have been our own super veteran film director mr raoul walsh there are a large number of his films that would support this hypothesis none are more appropriate than gentleman jim warner brothers 1942 br br the film also racks up another award being named as errol flynn's favourite of his own starring vehicles it clearly gives on screen evidence that would easily lead viewers sitting in the darkened theatre or viewing it on their home tv or dvd to conclude same br br to be sure the story is a semi serious biopic which takes a portion of factual material and blends it with a liberal dose of the old imagination to bring us a very satisfying albeit somewhat fictionalized what biopic isn't occurrences br br the casting is excellent as it makes good use of the natural athleticism of our lead mr errol flynn though not a swashbuckler a western or a war picture this gentleman jim is perhaps the starring role that was the best fit for the rugged australian br br errol was a member of the australian olympic boxing team in either 1928 or 1932 his training and skills in the 'sweet science'are clearly in evidence throughout the film and especially in the big fight for the world's heavyweight boxing championship with the great john l sullivan himself played in expert fashion by ward bond the cast reads like a duty roster of warner brothers' resident supporting players it features alan hale as jim corbet's father a livery wagon operator his two brothers are harry and george pat flaherty and james flavin the two 'blue collar' men of the family their occupations being stated as being 'longshormen' br br the great jack carson does his usual masterful serio comic performance in support as jim corbett's friend and fellow bank teller the rest of those we can both recognize and remember are john loder william frawley madeleine lebeau minor watson rhys williams arthur shields dorothy vaughn to name but a few br br director walsh also used a number of pro wrestlers in roles of various boxers hence we have ed strangler lewis and an unknown grappler are featured as the 2 waterfront pugs in the opening scenes others were sammy stein mike mazurki ever hear of him and wee willie davis these guys had a powerful yet unpolished look about them that the old pier 9 brawlers would have possessed br br we haven't forgotten leading lady alexis smith she is powerful in her characterization of an independent woman yet maintains enough true ability as a comic player in many of the scenes she displays quite a range in her part as poor little rich girl victoria lodge br br with all these ingredients at hand the trick is how to mix the elements in proper proportions to give it the 'just right' blend well director walsh does so with a reckless abandon because he is looking for above all a great film his treatment shows all of the skills he had honed to a fine tuning starting with his days as a player with d w griffith mr walsh seems to have a special fondness for that period the 1890's mr walsh's direction moves through the script at a fairly fast clip breaking up the exposition scenes with a humorous punch line the corbetts are at it again hence he is able to maintain a light even humorous touch to a story which could become too drab and serious br br furthermore in an almost unnoticed element brother walsh gives us an authentic look of a san francisco of the 1890's and as a further example of his fondness for that period he creates wide dynamic images of the historic prize fights there is a vibrant joyful mood conveyed in those boxing scenes as a crowning glory to this great perhaps underrated film director walsh gave the image a look as if it were an illustration from the police gazette which covered such events in those old days br br but there's just one thing to remember before viewing if it is for the first time or if your seeing it once more br br the corbets are at it again br br in my humble opinion as a historian of both film and pro wrestling it looks like tor johnson who years later was a favourite of director ed wood's br br a 'livery' is a somewhat archaic term for a vehicle for hire for local city transportation br br it's true mr raoul walsh was a griffith veteran player he was the actor to portray john wilkes booth in the birth of a nation 1915 br br being born in 1887 raoul walsh was old enough to have his own memories of the 1890's and of the sullivan corbett championship bout and what it meant to the sporting life in the america of those days
<START> there is some spectacular heart stoppingly beautiful photography here of a range of scenery and animals from arctic to tropical and everything in between the camera techniques are varied and spot on from close ups to aerial work editing is tremendous and the commentary is spot on too with just the right tone and some dramatic and telling facts about our world where the film falls down a bit is in trying to cover and integrate four themes seasonal patterns climate change individual animal stories and hunter hunted interactions across multiple environments eventually it all gets a bit bitty and disjointed overall well worth seeing especially given the issues covered but don't expect oscar material
<START> this is the worst movie ever made the acting the script the location everything i would have given it a little chance if there were attractive women in the movie but even they were bad you would think that a movie with the word beach in it's title would have good looking women in it wouldn't you
<START> a cheesy compellingly awful and not in a fun way c grade movie everything shouts 'amateur' from the crumby script bizarre premises limited coherence and predictable endings the turgid lighting sound and hand held wobbly camera angles the coy and passe sexual inneundo and references the patchy and unbelievable dialgoue to the z rate acting i saw it on dvd and kept hoping edward wood would pop out all is forgiven your worst films are works of art and more coherent than this twaddle br br but still preferable to the warbling 'every night in my dreams i hear you' are you sure the titanic crew weren't involved in this on the side
<START> 'holes' was a great movie disney made the right choice every person who i have talked to about it said they loved it everyone casted was fit for the part they had and shia labeouf really has a future with acting sigourney weaver was perfect for the warden she was exactly how i imagined her everyone who hasn't seen it i recommend it and i guarantee you will 'dig it'
<START> like i said its a hidden surprise it well written well acted and well cast i liked everything in this movie look its hollywood all right but the brighter side angelina jolie is great in this and i'm totally watching every movie with her in that i can get my hands on well worth a look
<START> i hated the way ms perez portrayed puerto ricans we are not all ghetto and we do speak spanish not puerto rican i can not speak for the uneducated persons you have run into but our language is intact our island is our pride puerto rico is better off economically than any other caribbean island i'm glad we are not like cuba dominican republic or haiti free from american influence free in true poverty not the u s standard of poverty we are not victims we are resilient humble honest and intelligent people our ancestry does include strong african roots but not black roots i have nothing in common with black americans 9do the research br br the analogy between pedro albizu che guevarra and martin l king could not be more off the mark br br mlk was a great hero a true revolutionary an honest man who saw a day when we would all be free br br che guevarra helped castro create the cuba that is today is that why boat fulls of cubans risk their lives to come to america because che made such a better place for them you had a great awesome bright idea but you politicized it too much we have so many things to be proud of as a people don't bring shame to our people by victimizing us i am not a nuyorican and perhaps that is why i can't share your views i am puerto rican i speak spanish i am not a victim and i have been able to accomplish many of my goals in america if there is a part 2 in the future less politics more history more stories of triumph there are many br br damaris maldonado
<START> the storyplot was okay by itself but the film felt very bubbly and fake it also had the worst ending they were probably going for a surprise ending but all it did was leave me the question of what the whole point of the story was all other teen movies are better than this one
<START> i rented this movie about 3 years ago and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made i don't think i ever finished it it is worse than a home video made by a high school student i remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt oakley sunglasses and a newer suv like a toyota rav 4 or something i don't remember i don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s he might have had a cell phone too i cant remember it was just horrible i returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if i could get the hour of my life back to this day it is the worst movie i have ever seen and i have seen some pretty bad ones
<START> i saw this dvd in my friends house and thought that this was a turkish action movie with some hollywood not very big names in it interested enough i decide to give it a shot later it was a tough to bear experience believe me then after finally seeing the credits roll i tought 'we turks really suck at hollywood style film making this is an insult to the heist hostage movie genre ' but then wait i checked some names and no they were not turkish names and no this was not a turkish movie on the contrary it was literally shot in america with an american director crew that made me thinking again how on earth can you persuade names like micheal madsen edward furlong or even arnold vosloo to take part in such a project with money probably that kept me thinking further how can you raise such amount of money to offer them and a supposedly international cast then all my meditation paid off and i came to find the answer by hiring the cheapest equipment and crew that you can find and if you still have to difficulty in adjustin your budget then by writing and directing the movie you are trying to produce or vice versa i don't have any information on that so bottom line this is not a bad movie as everybody are so anxious to present as it makes you think in my case even meditate and there are a lot of movies outthere that doesn't give even that affect this one at least makes you think it makes you wonder it leaves you with disbelief and then it makes you wonder again
<START> touching and sad movie portrays the trials and tribulations of a writer trying to come to terms with paralysis caused by a cycling accident the film centers on his relationship with his married lover whom he is often very hostile towards and his interactions with other accident victims particularly a black down and out and a white supremacist biker the film is often humorous often sad and always believable get out the box of kleenex and watch this on a cosy sunday afternoon with your partner
<START> after waking up at 3 30 in the morning and not being able to go to sleep i decided that i may as well be entertained while i suffered from sleep deprivation this movie was on hbo and i decided to watch it what a mistake br br here is the plot potential spoilers if you even care a neurotic man with an addiction to candy josh kornbluth works as a temp for some ridiculous company suddenly he is offered the chance to go perm which seems to be the favorite catch phrase of this movie but with a secure job and a secure income within his grasp josh decides for whatever stupid reason that he doesn't want to do it he hopelessly bungles several minor tasks and his laziness and lack of ambition fill me with contempt his inability to send several very important letters within a given amount of time is supposed to be hilarious but is merely stupid josh meets and deceives a lawyer woman and they wind up in bed together obviously a fantasy of josh's in real life as such a thing would never happen a bunch of other stuff happens but it's too trite and inane to go into now br br despite the fact that this movie is billed as a comedy i only laughed twice during it the first time was the opening shot of josh kornbluth my initial reaction was one of stifling fear and the second was when he was in bed with the attractive woman yeah right josh kornbluth is perhaps the most terrifying looking person i have ever seen in my life he is an unattractive overweight balding jewish man who i am supposed to believe has sex with beautiful women i do not at all sympathize with josh's character he is lazy and unmotivated and i just don't appreciate the failed attempts at humor skip it even if your life depends upon it
<START> certainly not horrible but definitely not good br br cry the beloved country 1995 was directed by darrell roodt and written for the screen by ronald harwood adapted from the 1946 novel by alan paton starring james earl jones and richard harris br br the film is about pre apartheid south africa and the stories of a black man and a white man intertwining the pious but naive preacher stephen kumalo james earl jones receives a letter from johannesburg saying that he must come immediately he later finds that his son has killed a man the rich farmer landowner james jarvis richard harris finds that his son a fighter for black rights was the one killed by kumalo's son in this they connect br br i cannot compare it to the 1951 film of the same name for i have not seen it or the 1974 musical titled lost in the stars for i have also not seen it both look better than this one but cry freedom on the other hand i have seen it has a much more urgent air to it like it actually is trying to say something where the film cry the beloved country seems to have no idea where it is going very wishy washy i refuse to compare the film to the novel except that i did enjoy the novel more than i enjoyed the film because novels and films are two extremely different media and there is no point in trying to transfer directly one to the other or compare them via the same means br br frankly this movie blew well i guess it wasn't that bad five out of ten but it wasn't that good either both of the leads both very capable actors pull some of the most wooden performances i have seen with some of the most awkward dialogue in film history but that can be blamed on he screenwriter ronald harwood who is also oddly off is game with this film having also written the sublime the pianist and being julia among other things the point and themes of the novel are lost almost entirely in its transition to film for the third time there is little if any tension with any moment of the film racially or suspensefully the music doesn't help the painfully misplaced and boringly pastoral orchestra tracks really help with this dulling down of the film one upside is the cinematography with many rather good or great shots but unfortunately this does not help the film too much br br the last striking words of alan paton's novel are displayed in the last moments of the film it is too bad that they seem to be so disconnected from the film that was just shown i don't know what nelson mandela might have seen in this film br br thanks for your time
<START> another small piece of the vast picture puzzle of the holocaust is turned face up in this docudrama about the rosenstrasse protest in berlin an event i had not known of that began in late february 1943 the details are given in an addendum that follows this review br br the film narrative sets the story of this protest within another contemporary story that begins in new york city in the present here a well off non observant jewish woman whose husband has just died shocks her children and others by insisting on an extremely orthodox mourning ritual she goes even further demanding that her daughter's non jewish fiancÃ© leave the house br br the distressed daughter hannah maria schrader then learns for the first time from an older cousin that during wwii in berlin her mother then 8 years old had been taken in and protected by an aryan woman hannah drops everything goes to berlin and finds this woman lena fischer now 90 hannah easily persuades the woman to tell her story it all seems rather too pat br br the film thereafter improves focusing through long flashbacks primarily on the events of 1943 that surrounded the protest in which the fictitious central character is the same mrs fischer at 33 played magnificently by katja riemann a baroness and accomplished pianist who is married to fabian martin feifel a jewish concert violinist one of the men detained at the rosenstrasse site br br the narrative does briefly weave back to the present from time to time and also ends in new york city once again while scenes in the present are color saturated the 1943 scenes are washed out strong on blue gray tones br br the quality of acting is generally quite good what we might expect given the deep reservoir of talent in germany and the direction of margarethe von trotta new german cinema's most prominent female filmmaker herself a former actress br br the story of the protest is told simply only one feature is lacking that would have helped still text notes at the end indicating the eventual outcome for those people taken into custody at rosenstrasse an outcome that was as the addendum below makes clear incredibly positive br br rosenstrasse has not fared well in the opinions of most film critics overly long needlessly layered purveyor of gender stereotypes manipulative with music so go the usual raps it is too long but i found in this film an austere powerful spontaneous and entirely convincing voice of protest from the women who kept the vigil outside the place on rosenstrasse where their jewish relatives and others were detained i found nothing flashy contemporary or manipulative in this depiction br br the very absence of extreme violence no one is shot or otherwise physically brutalized intensified my tension which increased incrementally as the film progressed you keep waiting for some vicious attack to begin any minute the somberness of the film stayed with me afterward i awoke often later in the night i saw the film my mind filled with bleak melancholic chaotic images and feelings conjured by the film for me that happens rarely in german and english my rating 8 10 b seen on 05 31 05 if you'd like to read more of my reviews send me a message for directions to my websites br br add the rosenstrasse protest swept up from their forced labor jobs in what was meant to be the final roundup in the national capital 1700 to 2000 jews mostly men married to non jewish women were herded into rosenstrasse 2 4 a welfare office for the jewish community in central berlin br br because these jews had german relatives many of them highly connected adolf eichmann hoped that segregating them from other prisoners would convince family members that their loved ones were being sent to labor camps rather than to more ominous destinations in occupied poland br br normally those arrested remained in custody for only two days before being loaded onto trains bound for the east but before deportation of prisoners could occur in this case wives and other relatives got wind of what was happening and appeared at the rosenstrasse address first in ones and twos and then in ever growing numbers br br perhaps as many as six thousand participated in the protest although not all at the same time women demanded back their husbands day after day for a week unarmed unorganized and leaderless they faced down the most brutal forces at the disposal of the third reich br br joseph goebbels the gauleiter governor or district leader of berlin anxious to have that city racially cleansed was also in charge of the nation's public morale on both counts he was worried about the possible repercussions of the women's actions rather than inviting more open dissent by shooting the women down in the streets and fearful of jeopardizing the secrecy of the final solution goebbels with hitler's concurrence released the rosenstrasse prisoners and even ordered the return of twenty five of them who already had been sent to auschwitz br br to both hitler and goebbels the decision was a mere postponement of the inevitable but they were mistaken almost all of those released from rosenstrasse survived the war the women won an astonishing victory over the forces of destruction adapted from an article posted at the university of south florida website a teacher's guide to the holocaust
<START> one of if not the worst film to come out of britain in the 80s br br this tawdry tale of a middle aged lecher who 'seduces' two teenage scrubbers who babysit for him and his faux posh wife has nothing to redeem it br br in turns gratuitous puerile uncouth and unrealistic this film plumbs the depths as it fails miserably in its attempts to be funny provocative intellectual and controversial br br perhaps the worst thing about this film is the way the strong cast of george costigan michelle holmes and siobhan finneran are completely stitched by such a lame script it's no surprise that this was the late andrea dunbar's only work to make it onto the screen complete and utter rubbish on every level
<START> miss decarlo's starring debut has everything the writers could come up with from the franco prussian war to the us civil war the great american west san francisco in its heyday ballet opera vaudeville stage coach bandits and a chinese junk just when you thought the plot couldn't get any screwier it does it's magnificent taken tongue in cheek decarlo's character here called anna marie not salome that's the role she dances is loosely based on the career of the notorious lola montez who was the mistress of the king of prussia and caused a revolution when he gave her the crown jewels she did escape to the american west there is a town in arizona called salome where she danced based on the historical fact that lola montez did dance the role of salome there stagecoach cleve and the russian nobleman who fall under her charms are not historically accurate nor i assume is the chinese wise man with the scottish accent but it is one of my favorite all time camp classics and decarlo is breathtakingly beautiful throughout
<START> my mother and i were on our way home from a trip up to the north east mainly massachusetts when we decided to take a little detour a attend a film festival in boston now i don't know much about film so i thought this might be a bit educational the first movie we saw was this one the romeo division now i don't know about you but i thought this was great i'm from texas and where i come from we don't see too many motion pictures so this was a pleasant surprise my mother insisted that it was too violent but said that i didn't know much about what she was saying but this was a great picture i was shocked by the fight sequences they were great also i am a big fan when the good guys win so i was thrilled when romeo ladies killed all of the bad guys this was true brilliance i'm not sure when it's getting released on video but if you get the chance you should check it out i think you'll be pleasantly surprised a word to the wise though it is rather violent and there many cuss words so you may not want to let your children watch it's more for adults
