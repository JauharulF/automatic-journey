<START> wwf survivor series 2001 br br this was among the worst events of 2001 perhaps its biggest flaw was the fact that it didn't follow suit to most of the previous survivor series' there was only one survivor series match and that survivor series match went on for 45 minutes what's more anyone with a working brain would know that it would end with the rock versus austin and the rock prevailing for his team and don't get me started on the preview before the event no matter who won it was obvious that no one was going to f ing die there was no need for all of that pointless hype whatever the storyline it was just a wrestling event br br and as for the rest of the matches the first match was christian defending his european title against al snow it was a good fast paced match and its good to see a heel winning a match fairly william regal versus tajiri was boring and we've seen it 2 or 3 times before edge versus test was good but nothing great the tag titles steel cage match was the best match of the evening the battle royal went on for 10 minutes and no one really cared who'd win in the first place the women's title match wasn't great no not in the slightest the main event must have been the most hypocritical match in history the alliance lost but guess what after 5 months every single alliance superstar returned the match itself was poor the rock eliminated 3 of them and jericho eliminated 2 the rock was too caught up with his acting to be there when the invasion began jericho was the one that jeopardised the whole match if i wanted any 2 to be eliminated in the early going it would be them everyone knew that kane big show and undertaker were just fall guys 7 matches isn't enough for a survivor series if there's ever a survivor series as bad as this again i'll
<START> the great caruso displays the unique talents of mario lanza he shows great acting capacity and is in top form as a lyrical singer paired with dorothy kirsten soprano of the metropolitan opera indeed i dare to say that he performs some songs better than caruso check a'vuchella from tosti and la danza from rossini the mgm art and music departments also did a good job this movie could be perfect were it not for the awkward presence of ann blyth we see that she is trying her best dressed in the fifties style in scenes just before 1920 unforgivable lanza deserved a better leading lady and blyth should stick to less demanding productions also notice that ms kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with lanza giving the wrong notion that caruso had a kind of permanent leading soprano
<START> i don't hand out ones often but if there was ever a film that deserved this sort of attention it's gas this is self indulgent crap that reaches for some of the ambiance of m a s h and falls completely flat on its face in the attempt br br i see what corman was going for malcolm marmorstein and elliott gould tried to reproduce gould's deathless role in the original movie version of m a s h with a similar plot in the movie whiffs look it up here in imdb http www imdb com title tt0073891 for more information br br marmorstein and gould got closer to the brass ring with whiffs than corman did with gas but didn't quite get there neither one of those films even got close to the success of m a s h br br what's wrong with gas what isn't no one comes close to really acting at a level above junior high school theatrics the production values stink someone else here mentioned the magically regenerating headlights on a getaway car and there's more of that lack of attention to detail nothing works the way it's supposed to in this film and nobody cares br br gas actually put me to sleep it's not a sure cure for insomnia but really close on the cinematic sleep induction scale gas falls somewhere between last year at marienbad and george clooney's remake of solaris which itself was remarkable for being more boring than the mosfilm original despite that studio's seeming unfamiliarity with the idea of keeping the audience's attention by judicious editing br br judicious editing would have decimated gas to about twenty minutes the result would be pointless but no more so than the original film br br certain films are so bad that they have a compelling quality that makes them worth watching anyway this isn't one of them don't waste your time it's not even amusingly bad
<START> page 3 is most definitely a very enthralling and captivating eye opener that very cleverly exposes the hypocrite lifestyles of mumbai's elite from the fake kisses to the plastered smiles page 3 leaves no stone unturned in revealing the shocking lives of the rich and the famous backstabbing gossip corruption and scandal lurk in every dark corner in the world of glitz and glam humanity and generosity are analogous to an oasis in the desert in this world where social darwinism is the prevailing mentality everyone is constantly craving for more money more fame and a higher reputation driving them to do the most shameful things imaginable ranging from signing film contracts at a funeral to child molestation anything is possible in this metropolis where there is a such a wide gap between the social classes the audience sees the ugliness of both of these classes through the eyes of the protagonist she observes the suffocating atmosphere and the mind boggling frenzy that the socialites live in bollywood business tycoons politicians and the underworld are all intertwined in a completely convoluted mess kitne ajeeb hai is a nice track as is the peppy kuan main doob jaongi terrific film with excellent character development
<START> my wife and i like to rent really stupid horror sci fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh we saw this one on fullmoondirect com and decided to add it to our netflix list now when i say this movie is awful i mean it in a good way everything about it the acting camera work story costumes is just so cheezy and low budget but thats what makes it so good i think in one scene the actors looked like they were actually walking in place i really hope that whoever made this film wasn't serious when they made it because if they were then that would just be sad if you like to watch really stupid horror movies just to make fun of them then i recommend this one
<START> chris rock stars in this remake of warren beatty's heaven can wait itself a remake of the 1941 film here comes mr jordan a comedy about a man who dies before his time before he can realize his dreams and his adventures in his new albeit temporary body in the beatty version the protagonist was a backup quarterback for the then los angeles rams in rock's hipper version our lead character is a struggling young and decidedly low talent standup comedian br br it's very funny to see the razor sharp rock playing a bad comedian it's kind of like seeing tom hanks play a bad actor lance barton's dream is to play the legendary apollo theater on a non amateur night but every time he tries out his material he's booed off the stage lustily so much so that his nickname becomes booie his jokes are lame his delivery painful in short lance is everything that the real chris rock isn't br br lance is also a bike messenger and he's riding the streets on his way to try out even more material when bam he's hit by a truck ok so maybe he was taken from his body a tenth of a second early by a slightly incompetent angel eugene levy but hey he was going to get hit anyway no dice it appears lance isn't due in heaven until 2044 so what to do mr king chazz palminteri the manager of heaven reluctantly agrees to find a new body for the not quite dead mr barton trouble is the body they find is of a greedy old white man turns out this fella a mr wellington owns all kinds of things he's the 15th richest man in the country what luck you can imagine how lance will turn things around br br but of course while in the body of the affluent mr wellington lance falls for a gorgeous hospital worker regina king we males know how tough it is to find a female given our own body but try winning one over while you're an dumpy old white guy and it's even worse when she's not impressed by your money br br this is rock's first shot at a lead role and in my opinion he performs admirably there's still a lot of the standup comedian in him and of course if he ever wants to get diverse roles he might have to stop incorporating standup routines into the script but this isn't really a bad thing rock's personality his drive his delivery his demeanor and his passion are what fuel this film he's clearly having a lot of fun in the role and he seems bent on making sure you have fun watching him
<START> may contain spoilers br br a dude in a dopey looking kong suit the same one used in king kong vs godzilla in 1962 provides much of the laffs in this much mocked monster flick kong is resurrected on mondo island and helps out the lunkhead hero and other good guys this time around the vampire like villain is named dr whoÂ funny he doesn't look like peter cushing kong finally dukes it out with who's pride and joy a giant robot ape that looks like a bad metal sculpture of magilla gorilla like many of honda's flicks this may have had some merit before american audiences diddled around with it and added new footage the rankin bass animation company had a hand in this mess they should have stuck to superior children's programs like the little drummer boy
<START> a friend of mine bought this very cheaply and decided to give it to me as a birthday present i thought i'd never watch it 'cause i knew it was a joke and the cover of the dvd looked pathetic but then my friends and i got really bored and watched it from start till finish i know quite an accomplishment but it really is a masterpiece it's hard to describe you should see it it's a real lesson on what people are capable of when they believe they're creative and smart and really aren't the acting is sous terrain you can actually see the leading lady laugh on some occasions she's definitely the worst the story is to stupid to be summed up and really everything in this film sucked please pay special attention to the sheriff the guy is an adult and therefor has absolutely no excuse to be involved in this he's extremely bad as well whatever it did have some hilarious moments check it out haha
<START> this is the best movie i've come across in a long while not only is this the best movie of its kind school shooting the way ben coccio the director decided to film it was magnificent he filmed it using teenage actors who were still attending high school he filmed it in the actors own rooms and used the actors real parents as their parents in the film also the actors were filming too using camcorders making it seem much more like a video diary it is almost artful if that is indeed a word there are a few slip ups however for example when cal calls brads land rover a range rover or vice versa it's been awhile since i've seen it
<START> from the writer of what ever happened to baby jane and hush hush sweet charlotte this tail end of the sixties horror cycle has some eerie and campy fun micheÃ¡l macliammÃ³ir does a victor buono type bit but too often the movie totters dangerously close to a bad musical there's a particularly awful children's recital about halfway through debbie taps tangos and tricks up a lÃ¡ harlow while winters' religious fanatic has a lesbian edge to her agnes moorehead checks in as an evangelist weaver has nothing to do and even has to pay a gigolo to dance with debbie
<START> 24 has got to be the best spy adventure series tv had ever aired the whole idea of telling a story in a 24 hour real time period is dazzling the style of filming and pacing is what hooks us to watch it and jack bauer is one of the greatest protagonists in a tv series in a long time i rate this along with the simpsons and the x files my three most favorite tv series br br this first episode begins with the conspiracy to assassinate us senator david palmer who is also running for president bauer is called to his office in order to discover who is behind all this and at the same time figure his daughter's path to the unkwown after fleeing from her bedroom thus begins an adventure on the best political style and what's best of it is that it always takes place in real time which makes this tv series a real work of originality in a time where almost every program on tv seems to be showing us the same things over and over and over
<START> i don't understand not being a critic i am not evaluating the quality of the acting which i find believable a good thing my confusion lies with the content is no one else sensitive to the fact that these two unfaithful women were justifying their infidelity to men who were fighting and bleeding to guarantee the continued freedom of their families and their country should there not have been a prologue informing us if the men made it home and if so what effect their cheating wives' infidelity had on them while these women were bedding their paramours out of a sense loneliness did they think that their husbands were enjoying being shot at while facing death or dismemberment daily they didn't think of their husbands at all only of themselves pardon me except when they wished their husbands dead
<START> this ranks as one of the worst movies i've seen in years besides cuba and angie the acting is actually embarrassing wasn't archer once a decent actress what happened to her the action is decent but completely implausible the make up is so bad it's worth mentioning i mean who ever even thinks about the makeup in a contemporary feature film someone should tell the make up artist and the dop that you're not supposed to actually see it the ending is a massive disappointment along the lines of and then they realized it was all a dream br br don't waste your time or your money you're better off just staring into space for 2 hours
<START> kenneth branagh attempts to turn william shakspeare's obscure rarely produced comedy into a 1930s era musical with the result being both bad shakespeare and bad musical comedy as the actors are rarely adept at one or the other of the two styles and in some cases flounder badly in both particularly painful is nathan lane who seems to be under the impression that he is absolutely hysterical as costard but is badly mistaken and alicia silverstone who handles the shakespearean language with all the authority of a teenaged valley girl who is reading the script aloud in her middle school english class br br the musical numbers are staged with the expertise of a high school production of dames at sea leaving the cast looking awkward and amateurish while singing and dancing with the lone exception being adrian lester who proves himself a splendid song and dance man the only other saving grace of the film are natascha mcelhone and emily mortimer's contribution as eye candy but they have given far better performances than in this film and you'd be wise to check out some of the other titles in their filmographies and gives this witless mess a pass
<START> the original cube is a fantastic b movie rich with paranoia meaty characterization and fine over the top performances it's creepy cryptic and cool and it stands perfectly well on its own without a stupid sequel like cube zero br br this third film in the cube series is part retread most of the booby traps are sadly recycled part aberration it takes the bold step of explaining what the cube is something that was never revealed in the first movie but since said explanation is bland i'd rather it was kept a secret there are some potentially interesting references to the society that exists outside of the cube but they never develop beyond hints about some kind of political religious totalitarian state so what little social commentary there is feels flat and unfocused br br what works basically nothing the acting is purely amateur hour the pacing is slow how much of this movie consists of two nerds watching a screen and the gore effects while revolting fail to convince in short cube zero reminded me of a cube fan fic a sloppy and sophomoric clone of a good movie that definitely did not need a sequel
<START> double exposure was a tremendous surprise it contains outstanding acting particularly from the underrated callan fine cinematography and a compelling storyline in other words it's one of the finest horror efforts to emerge from the 1980s br br callan plays a fashion photographer who experiences dreams of murdering his models at a time when he is reunited with his psychologically volatile brother who happens to be missing an arm and a leg when the models callan dreams about killing actually turn up dead the photographer begins to doubt his own sanity but there is more to the picture than he is seeing br br this film never received the praise it deserves most critics and filmgoers lump it in with the horde of slasher films released at the same time but it stands high above the bulk of that sorry lot it's clever and unique which isn't something one can comfortably say about most films of this genre but it's also passionately crafted and performed double exposure is a gem of its kind
<START> i want to state first that i am a christian and that i do work in the film and tv industry so i understand what it is like to work on a feature length film so props to the filmmakers in that regard i'm all for positive uplifting messages if they are true to the nature of life that this is a fallen world and that things don't always work out even for followers of christ i'm glad that others are having such overwhelmingly positive reactions to the overt christian message for me it was just that the execution is where the film fell on its face a movie lives and dies on its story and here you have one dimensional stereotypes exposition aplenty and spontaneous changes in character behavior that are inexplicably to say the least i believe that a film does not have to club you over the head with its message to get the point across i'm sure the kendrick bros will improve with time and that their storytelling methods will as well maybe they could direct someone else's screenplay as their next project br br sports films are not exactly my first love but a good one hoosiers field of dreams etc can inspire in a multitude of ways if you would be interested in a pg rated film that inspires give steven soderbergh's 'king of the hill' a look all truth is god's truth
<START> first of all let me say the first 20 minutes are great the monster looks superb and the cgi is reasonably done it's a shame then that the rest of the movie is such a disappointment br br spoilers below br br from the opening scene we can see this movie is anti american normally this sort of stereotyping wouldn't bother me we brits get enough from hollywood but here it's not subtle about making the americans brain dead morons it goes past the point of realism and your left wondering if a yank has raped the directors mother br br the grieving scene was really poor and the part of the movie where it starts going downhill br br here we are introduced to the olympic medallist auntie and drunk uncle who walk into the memorial and start blaming the father for his daughters death then hitting him before they all start rolling around on the floor crying hardly realistic bonding at a time of crisis br br the whole virus sideline is ridiculous if the americans know there isn't a virus why are they wasting time money and resources investigating the us government agent orders the brain drilling of an innocent korean for nothing making the americans look evil or stupid it wasn't helped by the fact this guy was cross eyed for comical effect br br the movie is about hunting the monster us and korean special forces are assigned to finding the creature although through out the movie they are invisible the only people hunting the monster in the whole of korea is the main family and some random tramp who appears at the end to save the day naturally a few us korean agents try to stop them along the way br br the sister was only included in the movie so she could make the vital shot at the end it was clichÃ©d you knew it was going to happen but to make it worse she does bugger all until that part and my final annoyance how the hell did that kid survive at the end the monster had been swimming with it's head underwater for about 5 minutes why didn't the monster eat the kids in the first place
<START> oh this is so bad it is funny the only way one could explain something like this is a porn party with drugs that resulted in the resolution to make a movie just for fun i mean you get to see porn actresses topless having sex then killed by human mutants there is plenty of gore including the classic something is wrong with her oh no it's half the person she used to be and the accidental murder caused by panic but you can also find funny stuff like intestines pulled through someone's ass and a guy running in the woods then finding himself decapitated by a wire tied between two trees that makes a metallic doiiing sound afterward like in cartoons somehow there is a market for people going beyond porn they really need to know what's inside an actress mere genitals are not enough therefore you get to see plenty of summary autopsies on slain bimbos there is no dialog jenna and chasey have really small parts and i really wonder what richard grieco wanted when accepting a role here i think this is a film one must watch with the button on fast forward and watch only the juicy stuff just to be reminded of the old school c class horror movies
<START> john travolta the biggest honkeytonk in the world and a mechanical bull what more can you ask for yeah you're probably not going to get many surprises or deep meaning in this one yet i have always found it fairly enjoyable to watch this redneck romance bud travolta and sissy debra winger meet at gilley's and fall in love they have all the difficulties you might expect a hardcore redneck couple to have the honkeytonk scenes are fun with dancing mechanical bull riding and of course the required brawls it has a good 1980 country soundtrack featuring looking for love in all the wrong places the devil went down to georgia and hello texas by my favorite jimmy buffett break out your cowboy boots and have a boot scootin' boogie br br out of 4
