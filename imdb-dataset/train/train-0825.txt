<START> i wasn't expecting the highest calibre of film making with joel schumacher directing this one so i was surprised that tigerland wasn't a complete waste of time br br in technique it's often derivative of saving private ryan with the shaky camera work grainy shots the film occasionally running like it's skipping a sprocket all those techniques speilberg used to make his film seem more realistic but in the end was more distracting than anything else br br but unlike saving private ryan the emotional component wasn't as weak as the characters in this film seemed more like real people and the story less contrived not so wrapped up in the american flag speilberg gets an 'f' in subtlety br br next to the first section of kubrick's full metal jacket this is the most realistic portrayal of boot camp that i have seen in a film and for that i think it's worth watching br br it's not a great film but neither is it a bad film
<START> this is the least scary film i have ever seen how the blob manages to eat anyone is the biggest mystery of the film the blob moves so slowly that an o a p in a zimmerframe could escape it the blob has a large slice of luck coming across a typical horror film woman who instead of running away stands still for half an hour so that she can be eaten if you havent seen this film i recommend you do its far too funny to be taken seriously
<START> this is one of those topics i can relate to a little more than most people as i hate noise have no idea how those in big cities new york especially how people get any sleep at all it astounds me that people can stand all the noise out there these days the basic plot of the film is that it makes for an interesting topic it's too bad that's about it tim robbbins is decent although except for a couple of scenes especially with the absolute supermodel looking margarita leiveva he didn't seem to really be altogether there my biggest hope for this film is that casting agents will see the absolutely stunning talented actress to boot margarita levieva she doesn't have a lot to do but she is supermodel beautiful even when they are trying to make her look at more girl next door it makes me sad that there can be people such as paris hilton kim kardashian in the world w no redeemable skills or talent to have more fame and success than this talented beauty i didn't care for much of this film because the script isn't very good but am glad i got to see some new talent i hope that producers directors think about margarita when they need a beautiful new actress to be in there big budget film if they can make megan fox a star c'mon she isn't that hot her acting talent is worse than made for disney channel tv shows from 1 film it should happen easily for her as she is gorgeous has talent i'd recommend her changing her last name so we can pronounce it and make it more marketable here's hoping this makes her career if there is any justice she can pop up on some big summer movie or two in the next couple years
<START> i wanted to like this film i really did it's got some good actors but ultimately it falls flat it tries too hard to be funny in some places the daughters over zealous cooking attempts over reaches in others the scene where they clean up someone's yard so he agrees to join the team and has some scenes that while mildly interesting are really just filler all the work scene's and i didn't find the villians intimidating or worth hating so much as i found them to be childishly annoying br br i've met people like those in the film while playing church ball and i will say the referee's are spot on still in the end i really didn't care all that much about the characters or their quest for church ball glory maybe because they were all so one dimensional which i might not have minded so much if the film were funnier or seemed to flow a little more smoothly overall br br kurt hale and halestorm entertainment has made some good films but this is not one of them
<START> this movie probably would only get a 7 or 8 from me to tell the truth if i had seen trailers or had any kind of knowledge of what the film is all about since it was virtually all a surprise it was almost a perfect piece of edgy entertainment that gets a strong 9 from me br br i read through some of the comments briefly and saw that someone else had almost the same experience as me and he advised to just watch it it was good advice read the rest at your own risk of spoiling br br eva mendez plays a head strong success starved network tv programmer that took a joke made by a co worker while brain storming tv program ideas about russian roulette seriously the story follows her in a documentary style on her pursuit to make this happen
<START> this film is a portrait of the half spastic teenage boy benjamin who has to visit a boarding school because of his lousy marks in math he didn't make the best experiences in life before and got serious self esteem issues after a rough start at his new school he starts making friends falls in love with a girl and does some american pieish teenage stuff br br beside some comedy elements the film is told in a very serious way focussing on benjamin and his problems br br if you already don't like this story outline save your time and watch something else if you do please be aware of the following br br 1 benjamin is a total loser whatever he does he does it terribly wrong and then he goes for self pity all the time for me he wasn't that kind of charming loser who you can feel sympathy for and laugh with instead he and his behavior really annoyed me and with my own teenage years not so far behind i could barely stand watching br br 2 the film hardly tries to be realistic and the story seems to be but from my experience the characters just aren't except for janosch maybe and yes i know this film is based on an auto biography written by a 17 year old but having some experiences with german schools and german youth myself i don't believe him br br 3 showing the sexual awakening really is an important thing for a film with this subject but i doubt that teenage boys do an ejaculate on the cookie contest where everyone has to hit a cookie with his sperm during mass masturbation in the woods and the loser has to eat the sperm wet cookie afterwards although it kinda amused me in a contemptible way it's nor funny neither underlining the serious attempts of this film br br 4 there's a sub plot about benjamin's family and his father betraying his wife still i don't know why it's there and where to put it it just bored me br br well i personally hated this film for having the character of benjamin being without a message concept scheme whatever and it's failing attempts to be dramatic and serious however i can image that some people may find it sensible and touching if you liked the other sister you'll probably like this one too i hated both br br 17 year old boys shouldn't write an autobiography and if they do it doesn't seem to be the best idea to make a film out of it br br 2 out of 10
<START> everyone has already commented on the cinematography good to great the personalities larger than life the structure chronological with many references to surf culture through time what is missed is a bigger question of sociological importance chucking mainstream american culture for something more fulfilling and rewarding br br i was a surfer in the 1970s we used to watch 16mm films at the local high schools in socal i remember the great feeling of surfing all day until my skin radiated heat putting on a hawaiian shirt and shorts and going to watch the latest surf film at night often the narrator was the filmmaker himself reading a script off sheets of paper sometimes a surf band or proto punk band would add music i was never happier except for the hooting and hollering seeing 'riding giants' took me back in time br br it also reinforced a feeling that living life on the edge not worrying about the money and the climbing the social and corporate ladder not keeping up with the joneses pushing yourself physically and mentally for a fleeting moment of joy and jubilation may be the answer to the question what is the purpose of life at least for those like greg noll laird hamilton and the like they seem to have found something that few of us are bold enough or honest with ourselves enough to pursue to live life solely on our own terms maybe society would fall apart if we all did exactly what we wanted in life but it is wonderful to see people who actually are living out their dreams br br it was this message that really impressed me
<START> elvira mistress of the dark is one of my fav movies it has every thing you would want in a film like great one liners sexy star and a outrageous story if you have not seen it you are missing out on one of the greatest films made i can't wait till her new movie comes out
<START> fred gwynne al lewis sid caesar and yvonne de carlo star in this funny funny movie the late fred gwynne is truly wonderful as herman munster who lives with grandpa munster al lewis wife lily yvonne de carlo and his son and daughter sid caesar is hilarious as the owner of a wax museum that has a whole section dedicated to the munster family when the wax figures of herman and grandpa begin to terrorize the town everyone blames the two the two now have to clear their names before it's too late you'll laugh out loud just like i did
<START> in the hollywood west those trail hands were a rough bunch who when they came to town partied pretty hardy after all trail driving was a lonely business back in the day before railroads got to all parts of the usa br br the drovers who worked for trail boss gil favor as played by eric fleming were no different but fleming was a man of all business he had a job to do and hired a top crew to do it br br with the long run of rawhide and the fact that the regulars stayed with it for the most part we got to know all the drovers at some point a some point story lines were focused around all of them though the bulk were with fleming and clint eastwood's character rowdy yates the number 2 guy with the herd br br clint eastwood's western image was molded by rawhide it's a shame that these are not shown more often probably because they were done in black and white had this been an nbc show this would have been done in color like bonanza and be running as often as those shows are we'd get to see a lot more of a man who became a move legend br br ironically enough it was eric fleming who left the show before it closed to do films he did a few them and was hoping the show would give him a bankable movie name sadly he was killed on a movie location doing an action film drowned in a river had he lived he might have become a name like eastwood's br br clint took over as trail boss in the last season and then the show completed its run and he of course became the icon he is today and not just in the western genre br br rawhide was a tough western who had some tough guys in it no frills in this one these were working cowboys just doing a job and battling the elements and whatever situations they were thrown into every year br br they really don't make television series like these any more what a pity
<START> this was a fantastic episode i saw a clip from it on youtube and i vowed that should it ever show on tv i would glue myself to the set in order to watch i wound up watching it with a friend of mine who happens to be gay and the two of us cried at the end this was a truly well written heartfelt episode of the forbidden love between two cops who i felt really were in coop's words the lucky ones it is episodes like this one that really make cold case one of the most captivating and much loved works of television magic on cbs i anxiously await more episodes and a re run of forever blue because i will always watch it again and again
<START> ah the sex and gore movie it's too bad they don't make these anymore unless you live in japan but if they all turned out like this that is not a bad thing br br the movie basically consists of the two lovely vampires picking up johns along a country road taking them home to their castle having crazy sex with them and then eating them except the first victim who they keep around for no particular reason things are complicated when a woman camping with her husband becomes too curious about these mysterious women she keeps seeing it gets real ugly from here by the end the two vamps are in such a bloodlust that they're eating everything in sight and manage to let their captive victim escape oops so much for that secret existence br br the fact that the two vampyres don't mind taking their clothes off and fooling around with each other is the only thing this movie has going for it otherwise it's a bloody confusing mess why is their tomb so far away from their castle watchable only for the scant few minutes of vampyre playtime the only thing i got out of this movie was these two valuable bits of advice shooting lesbians will not kill them it will only turn them into vampires and don't pick up hookers along a country road they are probably vampires other than that it really wasn't worth my time
<START> watching this movie again really brought back some great childhood memories i'm 34 now have not seen it since i was 12 14 i had almost forgotten about this movie but when i watched it again recently some scenes literally brought a tear to my eye that little robot jinx friends for ever it was just like revisiting my childhood it was an absolutely amazing experience for me i will always cherish this movie for that reason i hope some of you readers can relate to my experience not for this particular movie but any movie you have not seen in a long while very nostalgic br br thanks for reading
<START> just saw ice age a very funny and especially nice looking film the story is simple but effective the characters lovable and nicely fleshed out but what really shines is the digital set design br br more inspired by traditional animated movies than reality the designs give you a really really nice looking world in a astounding use of colour sometimes the touches of reality shine through especially the water was impressive but nonetheless it's a fantasy world based on reality including loads of vast landscapes especially helps to minimise the costs of rendering br br pixar films shine with technical brilliance this one shines with effective uses of technical know how br br enough technical babble the film's entertaining family friendly and sometimes just hilariously funny
<START> lynn hollister a small town lawyer travels to the nearby big city on business connected with the death of his friend johnny yes lynn is a man despite the feminine sounding christian name were the scriptwriters trying to make a snide reference to the fact that john wayne's birth name was marion hollister at first believes johnny's death to have been an accident but soon realises that johnny was murdered further investigations reveal a web of corruption criminality and election rigging connected to boss cameron the leading light in city 's political machine br br that sounds like the plot of a gritty crime thriller possibly made in the film noir style which was starting to become popular in 1941 it isn't a man betrayed despite its theme is more like a light romantic comedy than a crime drama hollister falls in love with cameron's attractive daughter sabra and the film then concentrates as much on their resulting romance as on the suspense elements br br this film might just have worked if it had been made as a straightforward serious drama one reviewer states that john wayne is not at all believable as a lawyer but he couldn't play a cowboy in every movie and a tough crusading lawyer taking on the forces of organised crime would probably have been well within his compass where i do agree with that reviewer is when he says that wayne was no cary grant impersonator romantic comedy just wasn't up his street one of the weaknesses of the studio system is that actors could be required to play any part their bosses demanded of them regardless of whether it was up their street or not and as wayne was one of the few major stars working for republic pictures they doubtless wanted to get as much mileage out of him as they could br br that said not even cary grant himself could have made a man betrayed work as a comedy that's not a reflection on his comic talents it's a reflection on the total lack of amusing material in this film i doubt if anyone no matter how well developed their sense of humour might be could find anything to laugh at in it the film's light hearted tone doesn't make it a successful comedy it just prevents it from being taken seriously as anything else this is one of those films that are neither fish nor flesh nor fowl nor good red herring 3 10
<START> in a famous essay he wrote about charles dickens george orwell points out that many readers always regretted that dickens never continued writing like he did in pickwick papers that is he did not stick to writing funny episodic novels for the rest of his career this would not have been too difficult for dickens his contemporary robert surtees did precisely that only concentrating on the misadventures of the fox hunting set mr fancy romford's hounds is a title of one of his novels among hunters and horse lovers surtees still has a following but most people find his novels unreadable dickens was determined to show he was more than a funny man and don't forget his first book sketches by boz was also a funny book so dickens third book is oliver twist which got pretty grim at points orwell says that for any author to grow they have to change the style of their books dickens would definitely and successfully have agreed to that br br but orwell overlooked the genre writer who transcends his fellows surtees as i said is a genre writer concentrating on hunting but not everyone is interested in hunting but p g wodehouse saw himself as an entertainer poking fun at the upper reaches of the british social system his earl of emsworth is prouder of raising the finest pig in england than being well earl of emsworth his psmith is always prepared to counterattack when he is supposed to be submissive to an unfair superior his stanley uckridge will always have a perfect scheme that should net a huge profit but always manages to come apart at the end and best of all his jeeves will always put his brilliant brain to work rescuing the inept bertie wooster his boss since wodehouse had a limited view of his mission as a writer he was there to do cartoon figures of fun for the entertainment of the world his books never lost their glow they served and still serve their purposes in fact compared wodehouse with his far more serious contemporary evelyn waugh who also wrote funny books but of a more intellectual type the best of waugh remains among the high points of 20th century british literature brideshead revisited decline and fall and the rest but in his determination to make his points if his points failed to interest the reader the book frequently collapsed for every vile bodies there was some failure late in his career like the ordeal of gilbert pinfold while wodehouse could do lesser hack work too his falling did not go as far as waugh's did br br wodehouse also was a gifted lyricist when you hear bill in the score of showboat it is not kern and hammerstein's tune but kern and wodehouse's tune transposed from oh lady lady a dozen years earlier he was a handy dramatist too so it is pleasing to see that he took his novel a damsel in distress and turned it into the screenplay here br br it has the normal wodehouse touches that perfect butler keggs reginald gardiner in a wonderful performance is a scoundrel in rigging a friendly gambling game of chance among the staff of the stately home he heads he is also unable to refrain occasionally from singing italian opera despite constance collier's attempts to control his impulse this is typical wodehouse characterization so is the way the love affair between lady alyce and jerry keeps going well and going down due to the antics of keggs and young albert both of whom want to win that game of chance pot of cash wodehouse always does that type of plot switch with antagonists switching their point of view depending on their present state of interest br br wodehouse was also lucky here to have burns and allan to work with it is generally considered that of all the films they made as supporting actors together such as six of a kind and we're not dressing george and gracie did their best support with fred astaire the fun house sequence which includes the song stiff upper lip is wonderful as is an earlier sequence where the three do a whisk broom dance that astaire learned from burns but gracie's marvelous illogical logic is used by wodehouse in scenes with gardiner see how she manages to confuse him into giving her more money than her change deserves to be only albert happens to notice keggs gardiner's mistake and looks at gardiner as though he's either stupid or mad her dialog with lady caroline collier 's son reggie ray noble the british band leader leading him to imagine that he will marry her but saying goodbye to gracie as she drives off with george to get married is wonderful too br br the film supposedly failed at the box office because of the lack of ginger rogers in it and the weakness of joan fontaine fontaine is not doing a remarkable job in the role but the flaw is really wodehouse's he didn't make the character very interesting but the film can stand without that given the other performers and their characters gershwin's music and wodehouse's marvelous sense of fun
<START> jesse and celine ethan hawke and julie delpy are two strangers on a european train the two come from widely different backgrounds he's american and she's french after they talk a bit on the train jesse manages to get celine to get off the train and explore vienna with him during the next several hours the two wander vienna taking in all that the city has to offer and become madly infatuated with each other but will this newfound relationship last past sunrise br br this wonderful romantic comedy is a breath of fresh air to a genre that has been in decline written and directed by richard dazed and confused linklater before sunrise never bores because of its' small cast in fact it flourishes due to the leads that make you love their characters and have a wonderful charisma between the two smart dialogue makes this a must for romance fans
<START> i think i watched this movie but don't quote me as i may have fallen asleep during watching it as it didn't exactly grip my excitement and imagination at least i know i watched enough of it to know i won't be watching it again soon or ever br br jeez talk about lame really lame totally lame it wouldn't even appeal to a six year old it basically had no worthwhile dramatic impact zilch nada just shlock turned into dreck comedy that was supposed to be comedy ya coulda fooled me ee ee br br now if the aliens had been insatiably carnivorous like in the movie critters we could have had the human characters do something a little more profound than be overly smugly cutesy like yelling and screaming and running for their lives so they wouldn't be eaten so the story could be something more exciting than watching paint dry br br don't bother watching this it's not worth the effort you can find something more interesting to do like watching paint dry or falling asleep
<START> as a member of the cast i was a member of the band at all the basketball games i would like to let the world know after being in the movie that we were not allowed to see it since it was banned in oregon this was due to the producers and the director breaking the contract with the university of oregon where it was shot seems that the u of o sign was shown while we were shooting we were allowed to eat several meals with the cast and production staff mr nicholson was quite memorable for being one of the most ill mannered men i have ever met quite a time for a young 20 year old but certainly not what campus life was really like in the late 60's and early 70's despite what hollywood may think trombone player from oregon
<START> all i can really say is that i'm glad that i was knitting socks while watching the movie or i would be very angry for having wasted 2 hours of my life the acting was terrible the plot was even worse there were some scenes that were meant to be serious that had my husband and i laughing out loud i highly recommend this movie to people who like to do their own version of mst3k
