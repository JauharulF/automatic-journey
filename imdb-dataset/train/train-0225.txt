<START> i am a lover of b movies give me a genetically mutated bat and i am in heaven these movies are good for making you stop thinking of everything else going on in your world even a stupid b movie will usually make me laugh and i will still consider it a good thing then there was hammerhead which was so awful i had to register with imdb so i could warn others first there was the science of creating the shark man which the movie barely touched on in order to keep the viewers interested they just made sure there was blood every few minutes during one attack scene the camera moved off of the attack but you saw what was apparently a bucket of blood being thrown by a stagehand to let you know that the attack was bloody and the person was probably dead what fabulous special effects back to the science i thought it was very interesting that the female test subjects were held naked and the testing equipment required that they be monitored through their breast tissue anyway this movie had poor plot development terrible story and i'm sorry to say pretty bad acting not even william forsythe hunter tylo or jeffrey combs could save this stinker
<START> engaging riveting tale of captured us army turncoat who has to prove his innocence to avoid the hangman paul ryker dodges friendly fire in a seemingly doomed attempt to convince a military court that he was actually a us spy on a secret mission in korea br br in the vein of classic courtroom dramas sergeant ryker is an extremely well crafted mystery ably guided by an outstanding cast director kulik's constant momentum and effective plot twists and turns br br this film was originally made as a television movie in 1964 and subsequently beefed up for this revision with the presence of many name actors and some action sequences dillman reprising his role is spot on as the doubting defence attorney whose attentions sometimes stray to the personal plight of ryker's supportive yet somewhat distant wife played with aplomb by vera miles rounding out the frontline is peter graves for the prosecution and norman fell and murray hamilton in key supporting roles br br marvin's interpretation of the paul ryker character is a balanced depiction of a simple but dedicated man whose normally laid back demeanour is challenged by the desperate circumstances in which he's placed marvin switches perfectly from resigned indifference to passionate determination giving a convincing often intense performance that is the highlight of this otherwise small scale drama it's this performance that should elevate the film to a platform where it occupies a place on the best ever lists of courtroom dramas br br however despite its apparent obscurity sergeant ryker still remains a taut and compelling examination like a book that you just can't put down highly recommended
<START> there are many adaptations of charlotte brontÃ«'s classic novel jane eyre and taking into consideration the numerous reviews written about them there is also a lively discussion on which of them is the best the short film adaptations all suffer from the fact that it is simply not possible to cram the whole plot of the novel into a movie of about a 100 min length consequently these movies only show few parts of the novel the tv series have proved to be a more suitable format to render all the different episodes of the heroine's life br br there are three tv mini series released in '73 '83 and 2006 the 2006 version is not only the worst of these three but the worst of all jane eyre adaptations and a striking example of a completely overrated film the novel's beautiful lines are substituted by insipid and trivial ones and crucial scenes are either deleted or replaced by scenes which have nothing whatever to do with the novel what it all leads to then is that the characters portrayed have not only nothing in common with the rochester and jane of the novel and behave in exactly the opposite way as described in the book but that also their behaviour and language is absolutely not consistent with the behaviour of the period in which the novel is set it is a silly soap opera in which the actors look and act as if they had been put in the costumes of the 1850ies by mistake this jane eyre as it dares to call itself is indeed a slap in the face of charlotte brontÃ« br br the 1973 version is very faithful to the novel in that the long dialogues between mr rochester and jane are rendered in nearly their full length but what works beautifully in the novel does not necessarily work beautifully on the screen at times the language of the novel is too complex and convoluted as to appear natural when spoken on screen and the constant interruptions of the dialogues by jane's voice overs add to the impression of artificiality and staginess and despite the faithfulness to the novel the essence of the scenes is not captured another problem is the casting of the main characters sorcha cusack's portrayal of jane as a bold self confident worldly wise young woman is totally at odds with the literary model and michael jayston although a good actor does simply not possess the commanding physical presence nor the charisma necessary to play rochester although a decent adaptation it simply fails to convey the passion and intensity of the novel and never really captivates the audience br br all the faults of the '73 version stand corrected in the tv mini series of '83 with timothy dalton and zelah clarke although from a purist's point of view timothy dalton is too handsome tall and lean to be rochester he possesses the essential qualities for the role he has an imposing physical presence great magnetism and an air of self assurance and authority and despite his undeniable handsomeness he looks grim and stern enough to play the gloomy master of thornfield convincingly but the excellence of his performance lies in the way he renders all the facets of rochester's character of all the actors who have played rochester he is the only one to capture them all rochester's harshness nearly insolence his moodiness and abruptness as well as his humorous side his tenderness his solicitude and deep frantic love dalton's handling of charlotte brontÃ«'s language is equally superb even rochester's most far fetched and complicated thoughts ring absolutely true and natural when dalton delivers them he is the definitive rochester unsurpassed and unsurpassable and after watching him in this role it is impossible to imagine rochester to be played in any other way or by any other actor br br zelah clarke delivers an equally excellent performance in a role that is possibly even more difficult to play well than the one of rochester she portrays exactly the jane of the novel an outwardly shy reserved and guarded young woman but who possesses a great depth of feeling and an equally great strength of will she catches beautifully the duality in jane's character her modesty and respectfulness on the one hand and her fire and passion on the other her seeming frailty and her indomitable sense of right and wrong she and dalton have wonderful chemistry and their scenes together are pure delight br br as regards faithfulness to the literary model this version also quotes verbatim from the novel as does the '73 version but with one important difference the dialogues are shortened in this version but the core lines which are essential for the characterisation of the protagonists and the development of the plot are rendered unchanged thus the scriptwriter avoided any artificiality of speech while still fully preserving the beauty and originality of charlotte brontÃ«'s language and in contrast to the earlier bbc version the essence of each scene is perfectly captured br br the plot of the novel is followed with even greater accuracy than in the '73 series it is nearly a scene for scene enactment of the novel where equal time and emphasis is given to each episode of jane's life it is the only jane eyre adaptation that has a gypsy scene worthy of the novel and the only one which does full justice to the novel's pivotal and most heartrending scene when jane and rochester meet after the aborted wedding timothy dalton in particular plays that scene with superb skill he renders with almost painful intensity rochester's anguish as he realizes jane's resolution to leave him his frantic attempts to make her stay and his final despair as she indeed leaves him it is a heartbreaking almost devastating scene which will stay with the viewer for a long time br br with even the smaller roles perfectly cast an excellent script and two ideal leading actors this is the definitive and only true jane eyre
<START> for those of you that don't that reference clubberin was 4 fists hitting one body br br anyways onto the review br br i miss wcw saturday night some of my favorite wrestling moments took place on this stage i remember watching stunning steve austin rick rude brian pillman cactus jack dustin rhodes johnny b badd ddp in his jobber days lord steven regal harlem heat ricky steamboat sting i'd be here a while listing everyone point is wcw had an awesome roster in the pre hogan days and they were producing entertaining television dusty rhodes on commentary in it's later years gave me a whole new reason to watch when i started smoking pot as a teenager i really wish vince would put him on the mic for a show or two maybe at the next great american bash they clubberin here comes da plunda he was great br br dirrty
<START> i personally liked the prophecy of 1995 a lot christopher walken was as always great and even though the film wasn't flawless it was a creepy and highly original horror fantasy film that entertained immensely this inferior 1998 sequel is still worth watching but mainly due to walken walken is one of the greatest actors around in my opinion and he is once again outstanding in the role of the fallen archangel gabriel whom he plays for the second time here once again the war between fallen and loyal angels is brought to earth gabriel returns in order to prevent the birth of a child namely the child of the angel danyael russel wong and the human woman valerie jennifer beals this child could once be the determining factor of the celestial war as i said above christopher walken is once again excellent as gabriel besides gabriel however the prophecy ii sadly also includes a bunch of terribly annoying characters the character of valerie was annoying enough and danayel annoyed me even more the biggest pain in the ass however was the character of izzy played by brittany murphy a suicidal girl who wouldn't shut up still walken's performance isn't the only redeeming quality of the film the entire film is quite dreary and well shot in dark colors which contributes a lot to the atmosphere gabriel's resurrection scene in the beginning is furthermore quite impressive and one of the coolest moments in any of the prophecy films the prophecy ii is nevertheless the weakest of the three prophecy films with walken definitely a christopher walken one man show entertaining but nothing beyond that
<START> the thing that makes this movie so scary is the way that it portrays andre and calvin as relatively normal guys these are definitely not people who want to become professional filmmakers since they goof around in front of the camera forget scripted lines etc they are only making the video as a diary to show 'the survivors' how normal their lives were their parents just think the guys are filming for a family home video by researching other kids attacks on their schools andre and calvin learn what not to do and they inform usually in a silly 'this old house' kind of way any potential 'andres and calvins' who might be watching this video how to make bombs get weapons and not get caught before zero day the day of the attack
<START> this film along with rinne are minor gems amongst the retread homage pics that have passed for horror movies so far at the 8ftdf horrorfest and yes that's faint praise indeed 'cause there's not much worse in filmdom than would be auteurs who think atmosphere is a substitute for a coherent plot br br and that's all you get with the abandoned this is a film that was made almost entirely in the directors head sure it would have been nice if he'd transfered it to film but this happened instead it's a very pretty film with a few genuine scares but the last reel is strictly for the latte slurping cineaste crowd
<START> this is a movie of tired yet weirdly childish clichÃ©s there's a nazi witch master performing sf related experiments in the basement oh please br br aiming for a creeping sense of horror and fear the general impression of the film is that of a very immature conception of fright not having any expectations beforehand i am left with an aged xander from buffy and a heroine with ape like face who doesn't seem to know how to act said adrienne barbeau have i only only encountered before in the much more enjoyable cannibal women in the avocado jungle of death br br camera and editing adds to the general impression of lame
<START> imagine the worst skits from saturday night live and mad tv in one 90 minute movie now imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity now imagine something 50 times worse br br got that br br ok now go see the underground comedy movie that vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever ucm is the single worst movie i've ever seen there were a few cheap laughs very few but it was lame even if the intent of the movie was to be lame it was too lame to be funny br br the only reason i'm not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else i know bought it he wasted his money vince offer hasn't written or directed anything else and it's not surprise why
<START> panic in the streets was a decent thriller but i felt a bit disappointed by it the central theme of a city being attacked by a plague in modern times is fascinating but the film never really explores or develops it its well made and entertaining but its not as interesting as it should have been the screenplay for this one is really weak and brings the whole film down none of the central characters are really compelling or believable br br fortunately the film is very well made so it compensates for the weak scripting the direction by elia kazan keeps the film suspenseful and moving at a lightning quick pace there are some standout sequences particularly the memorable chase climax when his direction was combined with better screenplays several years later the man could mostly do no wrong br br the acting is also very good richard widmark was always a watchable leading man and does what he can with an underwritten character paul douglas spends his time yelling a bit too much but does a decent job as well the standouts in the cast are the two villains zero mostel known primarily for his comic roles is effectively slimy as one of cinema's ultimate toady characters jack palance is unsurprisingly a chilling villain panic in the streets is disappointing but still worth watching 7 10
<START> this is the perfect example of something great going awfully bad hence can i advice anyone to watch it well i was kinda obliged by the fact that in was in the tiff competition i still can't believe it won and i only remained until the end because the director was there for a q a section but that was also anything but interesting what's it about well the first half the worth watching one presents three characters a hooker a musician and some kind of official the first two lie about their professions but the third is the actual liar the second half do something else don't ruin a good evening includes some old breasts and heavy drinking but maybe you will see it completely different the tiff jury did were they drinking vodka
<START> as an avid fan of the flashman books by george mcdonald fraser i looked forward immensely to seeing flashy on the big screen when this film was first released sadly it was a huge disappointment then so i left it alone for 20 years before going back to watch it again but it was no better the second time mr fraser is a tremendously skillful writer but i am not a fan of his film screenplay work with richard lester the penchant for slapstick spoilt 'the three musketeers' for me and the same applies here to me the whole tone and feel of the film is wrong the flashman books are uproariously funny in parts but they are adventure novels there is much seriousness in the way the adventures that flashman has after all he is involved in dangerous situations this is conveyed in the novels but not conveyed at all on film due to the its comedic style it is a tremendous shame as it could have a great film had it been a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book when i first read that the book was to be filmed the article said that the film was to star oliver reed i rejoiced as reed to me was the epitome of flashman how i would have loved to see him in the role malcolm mcdowell is a good actor but does not fit the visual image of flashman created by the books too scrawny looking flashman is supposed to be a big strapping fellow neverheless reed was excellent as bismarck what kills the film is that it is made as a comedy the only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which flashman kills de gautet tom bell a great shame as the production values costumes sets etc are superb and the casting is generally excellent just about everybody in the film is well cast apart from malcolm mcdowell possibly the directorship of richard lester was responsible for the way the film is as a recent radio adaptation of 'flash for freedom' adapted by mr fraser worked quite well perhaps one day we may see flashman done justice on screen
<START> they bothered making this movie anyone i didn't think so br br if you are looking for a coming of age movie go rent summer of '42 this is no summer of '42 br br when your big stars are nolte sarsgaard sarsgaard gets more screen time that is your first warning sign and of course for such an artsy movie there is plenty of cursing skin flung around just to make it look artsy br br sarsgaard did his usual uninteresting cardboard character punctuated by moments that were supposed to be intense the intensity is that of someone with bi polar disorder br br miller is most famous for her looks what she had to say about the city of pittsburgh after this movie pittsburgh should hold a grudge against her she misrepresented an actual pittsburgh native br br foster gave sarsgaard a run for his money in the cardboard acting style wow was this his first role after high school graduation br br so we have this weird triangle foster has a crush on miller but is with his boss girlfriend he can't take miller to bed won't take his boss to bed so he hangs with sarsgaard miller watches them get it on br br then after one of sarsgaard's pseudo intense moments foster miller get it on a scene that we are treated to in every sloppy moaning detail finally just to round it all out foster sarsgaard get it on with foster in the miller role now i know how 2 guys get it on as if that was ever anything i needed to know br br after all that all that's left is the tragic ending for one character the retrospective views of the remaining 2 it gets me right in the pit of my stomach oh wait that was the pepperoni pizza i just had br br i'd like back the time this movie took out of my life please
<START> right up until the end the bad guys have the upper hand always which kind of put into question the competence of the good guys a couple of innocent man accused of a crime plots are irritating some unnecessary dialogue in which various dull legal issues get debated this is just a mediocre dumb old western so what's this nonsense about trying to keep things realistic cagney's atypical presence in a western is one of the few if not the only entertaining thing about the movie somewhere around the middle there is a ridiculously timed marriage proposal sort of like where is the kid hiding where is he oh and by the way will you marry me
<START> another one for the babes bullets crowd the story is much edgier than any other musical i have seen cannons hidden up the missing legs of females and places each generatively in the other in a way that comes closer to intelligent comment than we might expect for the locale more effective than contemporary 'drama ' it is hard identify with a woman who keeps a cannon up her pants in lue of leggage pretty remarkable if you consider the context br br despite the cannon up the leg thing providing 90 of the surprises this film also chronicles how greed supersedes all other considerations in the lives of a group of yakuzas who pursue a woman who keeps up her leg a concealed cannon rocket launcher hence no group shower scenes or thongs the hidden projectile launcher which is pulled out from the behind the protagonists back seemingly from nowhere in miike's dead or alive 1999 the torch brought forth out of thin air by the heroine towards the end of the original tomie 2000 or the harrowing flame thrower scene in sunny gets blue 1992 all testify to an almost third world cantinflas esquire influence in the contemporary japanese cinema of which i am at a loss to explain but cannot complain br br you won't see good quality movies of this essence made in hollywood its all but extinct and with cheap crap they pump out for a cheap thrill is all but laughable this is a true film and while its great in its entirety the ending is a brilliant if not unblatant rip off of certain sergio leon pictures involving cannons where legs should be and certainly is appropriate
<START> i watched this movie last week sometime and had the biggest laugh i've had in a long while the plot of the film is pretty dumb and convoluted in a badly crafted way the only plus to be found anywhere in the film are corey savier's impressive abs alexandra paul i think that's her name is horrendous as the preacher's wife who has a history of depression ted mckenzie is gross and his character's a twit on top of it all and as if the fact that you think she's having sex with her son isn't enough they throw in needless sax solos at every opportunity the end and climax of this film is absolutely abysmal and also laughable i mean who the hell wants to carry the child of a con who tried to make you think he was your son and that you were having an incestuous relationship with him
<START> clara bow hula calhoun is daughter of plantation owner albert gran bill calhoun who is mainly interested in playing cards and boozing with friends she's interested in riding in the countryside until engineer clive brook anthony haldane shows up to build a dam one of her father's friends arlette marchal mrs bane then competes for his attentions his wife maude truax margaret haldane shows up for the contrived finale br br lots of 'pre code' elements like nude bathing br br wonderful location shooting in hawaii
<START> 'arms and the man' is one of shaw's funniest plays if handled correctly and this production does a good enough job helena bonham carter pre film stardom is raina the daughter of a military family who has a peacock of a fiancÃ© patrick ryecart and who shelters a soldier from the enemy pip torrens during a raid on the town br br full of colour and energy this production rips along at a good pace and if bonham carter and patsy kensit as the maid are outshone a bit by the rest of the cast they still hold their ground kika markham and dinsdale landen as the parents are delightful and the whole play is generally a happy one br br highly recommended
<START> mitchell leisen's fifth feature as director and he shows his versatility by directing a musical after his previous movies were heavy dramas he also plays a cameo as the conductor br br you can tell it is a pre code movie and nothing like it was made in the us for quite a while afterwards like 30 years leisen shot the musical numbers so they were like what the audience would see no widescreen shots or from above ala busby berkeley what i do find funny or interesting is that you never actually see the audience br br as others have mentioned the leads are fairly characterless and jack oakie and victor mclaghlan play their normal movie personas gertrude michael however provides a bit of spark br br the musical numbers are interesting and some good the rape of the rhapsody in particular is amusing but the drama unconvincing and faked three murders is too many and have minimal emotional impact on the characters this is where this movie could have been a lot better
<START> here's the skinny it seems that this is much older then i thought it was but it's still cool the bike mechs are cool and the story works for the most part there are some character issues that i hope work themselves out by part 2 and my biggest complaint of all that it seems to be a macross knock off not just the animation style but several character designs for example all the girls in this movie look like lyn minmay of macross the mechs look similar to macross as well as the other characters this is really not made for little kids it has graphic violence nudity and graphic sexual content so to make a long story short i give this cool macross knock off 7 stars
