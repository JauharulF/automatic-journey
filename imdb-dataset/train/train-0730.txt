<START> the ladies man suffers a common problem among movies based on saturday night live skits and that is a sketch that usually succeeds in five minutes will not do so well in ninety minutes although this movie does have its laughs like tim meadows as leon phelps a sex maniac straight out of the '70s and will ferrell as a wrestling obsessed husband cuckolded by leon so this movie is funny enough but it's no wayne's world
<START> seed is torture porn no doubt about it but strangely uwe boll has written produced and directed a more polished film than any other he has made in recent memory br br every time i watch a boll film i feel that some pages of the script must have gone missing there are simply huge gaps in the story and dialogue of course nothing makes much sense either the films are somewhat surreal in this respect br br spoilers br br why do the six cops who go to arrest seed split up and go their separate ways when they get to the darkened residence unlike real cops who would enter and clear the house in pairs or by threes why don't the cops ever use their radios how can the bodies decay so quickly a process that would normally take many months i know it's time lapse photography but seed would never be able to stay on schedule killing people if he always waited around for the previous victim to decay to the point shown how come seed gets to wear bib overalls and a mask while he's waiting on death row instead of typical prison uniforms how can seed enter a maximum security prison stroll around the cell block and then walk out again without being stopped or even noticed if nearly 80 people according to some newspaper articles shown in the movie have been murdered why is there only one investigator working on the case why did the investigator suddenly decide that he should go look for seed at seed's house where he was originally arrested and where he murdered his victims didn't he think of doing this sooner why does the police detective go it solo without back up and without even letting dispatch know what he was doing and where he was headed br br this is particularly frustrating when boll obviously goes far out of his way to make sure we understand why the electric chair fails to work properly he spends several screen minutes in setting this up when he could have spent them making other aspects of the film at least a bit more logical br br end spoilers br br in short the film just sort of serves as a framework for a few assorted scenes perhaps boll would think of these as his visions of a brutal death by bludgeoning gunshots to the head execution by electrocution and the skinning of live animals raised for their pelts the opening scenes of animals being skinned were indeed unnecessary and disturbing but i understand their purpose in the context of the film the centerpiece is undoubtedly the bludgeoning death of a middle aged woman by seed using a hatchet it's obvious that much time was spent on this and it vaguely reminds me of the classic scene in reservoir dogs though without the steely dan soundtrack br br is this a good movie no is it worth seeing only if you are a dedicated fan of the torture porn genre or if you are absolutely determined to see a sample of torture porn as i said at the start of this review even though this movie is pretty disgusting and can be sickening at points it is truly much more competent than most of boll's movies perhaps he will continue to improve as a filmmaker i can only hope that he progresses beyond torture porn and continues more in the vein of postal
<START> jim carrey is back to much the same role that he played in the mask a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums and of course they have to be mexican obviously his good will towards his fellow man backfires in that case it wasn't too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums but i like that the movie suggests that things like that shouldn't be ignored i'm reminded of the episode of michael moore's brilliant the awful truth when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay the results were not very promising so it's nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example br br jim carrey plays the part of bruce nolan the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart or even better it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere a little metaphor that comes up when bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film bruce is nearly 40 years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that's seeking to bake the world's biggest cookie he's desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the tv station but he loses his cool on live tv when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague you have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report needless to say he loses his temper on live tv in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film br br morgan freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the man himself displaying a god whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through freeman's massive talent as an actor he is the kind of god who takes his job very seriously but in such a way as to advise his followers as well as the viewers of this movie that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life i love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day there are a lot of people in the world maybe more than our share in america who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans br br one of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewer's religion i for example tend to reject organized religion in all forms and i see god and satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live but despite the fact that i don't believe that god exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time i was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie br br jim carrey's movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he's come if you compare bruce almighty with movies like ace ventura both of which i loved by the way or a lot of what he did before he got into film it's amazing how far he's come he has moved from cheesy tv comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like the truman show man on the moon and the majestic easily one of his greatest films ever jim carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today br br jennifer aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie as she did in the side splitting office space as bruce's girlfriend who becomes increasingly exasperated by bruce's growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him there is definitely some low brow comedy in the film that doesn't really fit with the importance of the film's meaning or the quality of the delivery such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene but it was definitely pretty nice to see ace ventura's friend spike make a cameo appearance as stephen king very well knows it's always nice to see familiar characters it's almost like seeing family again br br bruce is endowed with the powers of god for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him the thing i love about this is that like i said before religion is absent from my life but i was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things i would have done had i been endowed with such powers the movie allows us to learn vicariously this way which empowers the message even more br br the scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film such as the scene when bruce loses his temper about the anchor position the jimmy hoffa scene who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records the scene where bruce's rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera and my favorites the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakery's cooking the movie has plenty of time for carrey to deliver some excellent jokes such as when he says to god who reveals that he's the janitor the proprietor the electrician etc that his christmas parties must be real bashes and to be careful about drinking because on of him might need a ride home i also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes a little too true and as gallagher would add behind every great man is also an amazed mother in law br br bruce almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while and is probably the only directly religious that i can remember seeing that i am anxious to buy on dvd to add to my personal collection it is a comedy written and performed in good taste but with enough relatively low brow humor to keep the kids entertained this is a meaningful comedy for the whole family which is becoming rarer and rarer these days in a world that is about to be flogged with yet another american pie film and another scary movie which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy it's nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching don't miss this one
<START> very badly made film the action violence scenes are ridiculous br br 1 point for the presence of burton and mastroianni 1 point for the real tragic event of the massacre of the innocent italians 2 10
<START> futz is the only show preserved from the experimental theatre movement in new york in the 1960s the origins of off off broadway though it's not for everyone it is a genuinely brilliant darkly funny even more often deeply disturbing tale about love sex personal liberty and revenge a serious morality tale even more relevant now in a time when congress wants to outlaw gay marriage by trashing our constitution the story is not about being gay though it's about love and sex that don't conform to social norms and therefore must be removed through violence and hate on the surface it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig but like any great fable it's not really about animals it's about something bigger stifling conformity in america br br the stage version won international acclaim in its original production it toured the u s and europe and with others of its kind influenced almost all theatre that came after it luckily we have preserved here the show pretty much as it was originally conceived with the original cast and original director tom o'horgan who also directed hair and jesus christ superstar on broadway br br this is not a mainstream easy to take studio film this is an aggressive unsettling glorious deeply emotional wildly imaginative piece of storytelling that you'll never forget and it just might change the way you see the world
<START> dire just dire the script is contrived the acting painful and the story just drags along it is without a doubt a celebration of sally potter and little else this wouldn't be so bad but she's the director writer and star of the film and so is just self glorification i found myself not caring about the developing romance between the principal two characters and the ending came not a moment too soon it has two redeeming features first is that a lot of the shots are really quite lovely particularly in paris and look rather good in black and white secondly whether you're a fan of tango or not the music is by and large excellent except where sally starts singing watch this film at your own risk or if you need an unintentional laugh i am sure it appeals to someone statistically it has to
<START> this was awful andie macdowell is a terrible actress so wooden she makes a rocking horse look like it could do a better job but then remember that turn in four weddings equally as excruciating another film that portrays england as full of chocolate box cottages and village greens i mean that school how many schools apart from maybe hogwarts look like that the twee police station looked like the set from heartbeat a nauseating british series set in the 60s this film just couldn't make its mind up what it wanted to be a comedy or a serious examination of the undercurrents in women's friendships if it had stuck to the former then the graveyard sex scenes and the highly stupid storming of the wedding might just have worked i say just but those scenes just didn't work with the tragedy in the second half i also find it implausible that kate would ever speak to molly again after her terrible behaviour a final note what is a decent actress like staunton doing in this pile of poo not to mention anna chancellor macdowell should stick to advertising wrinkle cream
<START> having just watched this film again from a 1998 showing off vh 1 i just had to comment br br the first time i saw this film on tv it was about 1981 and i remember taping it off of my mother's betamax it wound up taping in black and white for some reason which gave it a period look that i grew to like br br i remember very distinctively the film beginning with the song my bonnie as the camera panned over a scene of liverpool i also remember the opening scene where paul gestures to some girls and says look talent so it was with great irritation that i popped in my 1998 taped version and remembered that the film opens with she loves you instead of my bonnie when you see how slowly the camera pans vs the speed of the music you can see that she loves you just doesn't fit also in this later version when paul sees the girls he says look girls and somehow having remembered the earlier version that word just didn't seem to fit either why they felt they had to americanize this film for american audiences is beyond me personally if i'm going to watch a film about a british band i want all of the british colloquialisms and such that would be a part of their speech mannerisms etc br br another irritation was how choppy the editing was for television just after stu gets beaten for example the film cuts to a commercial break lots of 'em yeah i know it depends on the network but it really ruins the effect of a film to have it sliced apart as we all know what some people might find as insignificant in terms of dialogue and thereby okay to edit may actually go the way of explaining a particular action or scene that follows br br my point is the best version of this film was probably the earlier version i taped from 1981 which just so happened to include the shake rattle roll scene that my 1998 version didn't i started to surmise that there had to have been two different versions made for television and a look at the alternate versions link regarding this film proved me right that the american version had some shorter cut different scenes and or dialogue is a huge disappointment to me and something worth mentioning if one cares about such things imo ones best bet is to try and get a hold of the european version of this film if possible and probably even less possible an unedited version sadly i had to discard my old betamax european version because i didn't know how to convert it br br all that aside i found this film to be perhaps one of the best films regarding the story behind the birth of the beatles being well aware that artistic and creative license is often used in movies and tv when portraying events in history i didn't let any discrepancies mar my enjoyment of the film sure you see the beatles perform songs at the cavern that made me wonder did they even write that back then i don't think so but nevertheless i thought it was a great film and the performances wonderful br br the real stand out for me in fact was the actor who played john stephen mackenna i just about fell in love with him his look mannerisms personality and speaking voice seemed to be spot on he looked enough like a young john for me to do a double take towards the end of the film when you see the beatles performing on ed sullivan for the first time i actually found myself questioning whether or not it was actual beatle footage until i saw the other actors in the scene br br if you're looking for a dead accurate history of the beatles' life and beginnings you can't get any better than the beatles' anthology as it was written by the boys' themselves however if you're looking for a fun snapshot of their pre beatlemania days leading up to their arrival in america and you leave your anal critical assessments at the door you can't go wrong with the birth of the beatles a must for any real or casual beatle fan
<START> i knew nothing of this film before i was convinced to see it by a friend who had heard it was a non stop epic battle scene from beginning to end that couldn't have been further from the truth this was one of the most boring poorly written amateurishly directed horribly acted films i've ever had the misfortune to lay my eyes upon i'd rank it up there with the movie i consider to be the worst film of all time battlefield earth there basically is no story it's hard to believe that the makers of this film thought that this cheesy soap opera crap would be taken seriously as actual historic fact it also features some of the worst dialogue i've ever heard like this little gem guy tells girl you smell like the moon girl replies what does the moon smell like omg you have to be kidding me the scene where the guy was drawn and quartered got some good laughs from the audience since it looked so ridiculously cheap and the sound fx of the guy being ripped apart reminded me of someone making a fart sound with their mouth if this is playing at a theater near you avoid it at all costs this movie is so bad that i actually made the decision about 45 minutes through that i needed to catch up on my sleep and i did awful
<START> from rainy dreary late winter england of early 1920s br br where there is still sadness and many young widows and disabled vets from the great slaughter of men and killer of their womens' dreams known now as world war i br br four women share this lovely small sunny italian castle on a hill one a young widow who is drowning her sorrow in frantic partying two women who will rediscover their own husbands and a fourth woman who is tired of her famous dead friends br br these four women will come together with two husbands and a former soldier almost blind to get a spiritual makeover for one great april vacation in early 1920's italy br br note to would be filmmakers study this film for how mood and beauty can tell a story probably not a film to please many men br br note stock up on coffee hot chocolate and invite the girls over on some dreary late winter day spring is coming enchanted april promises you
<START> a very good adaptation of the novel by amrita pritam urmila and manoj bajpai have given their best br br there is a natural flair in the movie and i felt it right through it looked like bollywood finally gave away it's glamor and had some quality artists performing on screen br br content wise the movie depicted very much what exactly happened during partition by showing the sufferings of a particular family and also shows that trust in one's life goes beyond religion br br the best part was they did not make it a drama with a lot of tear shedding and melodrama br br i simply loved it
<START> let me state at the outset that i have cerebral palsy and i went into this film expecting to have to make allowances for the lead performance i left the theater half convinced that they'd cast an actor who had cerebral palsy in the role even though i knew that was not the case the performances were generally excellent with a special nod to brenda fricker and to hugh o'conner i believe that's his name as the young christy brown christy is talented brash arrogant at times vulgar and petulant in other words human this film along with gaby a true story and the documentary king gimp are excellent portrayals of life with cp by no means a complete portrait but fine examples of the disabled as human beings most highly recommended
<START> goodnight mister tom begins in an impossibly exquisite village in the south of england where the sun always seems to shine before we have much idea of the period we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of world war ii soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings refugee children from london and when shy little william is billeted with reluctant gruff old tom who you just know will turn out to have a heart of gold our tale begins br br and what a load of sentimental claptrap it is in fact it's just the old odd couple buddy formula aren't any new stories being written br br as i suggested there's hardly any period feel in the village and not much more in london apart from the odd old ambulance rattling around and certainly no hint of the horror of the blitz as london's citizens file politely into air raid shelters even when the local schoolteacher's husband is declared missing presumed killed he is later restored to life br br i found goodnight mister tom' cliched and obvious and john thaw's accent conjured up a picture of ronnie barker of the two ronnies with a straw in his mouth doing his country bumpkin' accent br br incidentally my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons that i disliked it and looking at fellow imdb reviewers i seem to be in a minority of one br br
<START> in anne of green gables 1934 marilla cuthbert helen westley and matthew cuthbert o p heggie middle aged siblings who live together at green gables a farm in avonlea on prince edward island decide to adopt a boy from distant orphanage to help on their farm but the orphan sent to them is a precocious girl of 14 named anne shirley dawn evelyn paris a veteran of disney's series of alice shorts who later would adopt her character's name br br anne was only 11 in lucy maude montgomery's source novel but the same actress could not credibly go from 11 to college age during the course of the story the movie suffers somewhat from this concession as many of anne's reactions and much of what she says are more entertaining coming from an eleven year old that from a teenager as in the book anne is bright and quick eager to please but dissatisfied with her name her build her freckles and her long red hair being a child of imagination however anne takes much joy in life and adapts quickly to her new family and the environment of prince edward island br br in fact anne is the original teenage drama queen and the film's screenwriter elected to focus on this aspect of her character which transformed the basic genre from mildly amusing family drama to comedy a change that delighted audiences and that continues to frustrate reader purists br br since the comedy is very much in the spirit of the montgomery's story i can see no reason to take issue with the changes but let this serve as fair warning to anyone expecting a totally faithful adaptation the comedy element is the strength of the film as it is one of the earliest self reflexive parodies of hollywood conventions the actress anne shirley was one of hollywood's all time beauties and the film is in black and white so much of the amusement is in seeing the title character's endless laments about her appearance and hair color contradicted by what is appearing on the screen anne regularly regales her no nonsense rural companions with melodramatic lines like if you refuse it will be a lifelong sorrow to me perhaps the funniest moment is when she corrects the spelling of her name on the classroom blackboard br br tom brown does a nice job as anne's love interest gilbert blythe and sara haden steals all the scenes in which she appears as the cuthbert's pompous neighbor br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> i suppose jedi is now chronologically to be considered the very last entry in the popular saga and it's a very good one as were several of these i liked how directly this sequel took off after the empire strikes back and i appreciated the maturity of luke skywalker as a character and also mark hamill as an actor after hearing so many negative things about the ewoks they weren't so bad i enjoyed the thrilling chase within the woods and i felt there was a lot of well realized emotion with this chapter the ending with some new additions i presume successfully weaves all 6 chapters into a wonderful tale of fantasy i know many true star wars fans hated george lucas for changes he made to the original films but being a relative novice to these movies rather late in life and not missing what i didn't already know i think he made these 6 movies work perfectly as a whole entity oh and err carrie fisher looked quite delicious in her skimpy outfit
<START> since the day i saw this film when it came out in 1981 it has been one of my top 3 favorites the blurb i wrote for amazon is below and i'm just thrilled that it's finally coming out on dvd on 10 17 06 the film's 25th anniversary br br the last credit in this film explains its appeal thank you to the people of manhattan on whose island this was filmed a charming and witty romantic comedy it is a love story written to new yorkers peter bogdanovich is a native who can identify every location west 12th street the ansonia the old fao schwartz the plaza the roxy chez brigitte and city limits which was a country western club one gets the impression that the entire ensemble cast clicked as well off screen as they do on and this intimacy is clearly communicated i laughed i cried it was better than cats not only an ode to dorothy stratten it was also audrey hepburn's last feature appearance she had a cameo subsequent to this film and her inner beauty seeps from the screen buy it make a big tub of popcorn and curl up with someone you love
<START> let me start off by saying that after watching this episode for the first time on dvd at 10 o'clock p m one night i could not fall asleep until about 3 00 a m br br this brief review may contain spoilers br br i'm a long time fan of the sopranos and i can safely say this is the best episode i've seen i'm not saying everyone should feel this way but i do this episode is identical to the weekend i spent with my family watching over my own father comatose in the icu before he passed br br the episode begins with tony in an alternate reality he is a salesman who's identity has been mistaken for that of a man named kevin finnerty br br by the time ten minutes had gone by i knew either tony was dreaming or i was watching some other show it wasn't like the normal sopranos and i loved it br br option 1 is confirmed when anthony or kevin looks into the sky at a helicopter spotlight and we see prodding through it a doctor with a flashlight we see this only for a moment and the sequence plays out until we go back to real life in a situation similar to the one i just stated br br tony has come out of the coma for only a moment his boys take a j home and carmella overcome by stress breaks down in the hallway a signature moment in the episode br br for the remainder of the episode we cut in between the real world the family dealing with the potential negative outcome of this coma and tony's alternate reality which parallels what's going on both in his mind and in the real world around him br br then comes the stellar point in the episode after a j finishes telling his mother he's flunked school she walks in to see meadow sitting at anthony's side br br she approaches tony and utters the best line of the episode anthony can you hear us in tony's world he enters a dark hotel room and turns on a light he takes off his shoes and goes to the phone he tries to dial but he cannot as if he were trying to say something back to carmella but couldn't physically bring himself to do so not yet br br he sits down and looks out his window a shimmering light that has reoccurred throughout the episode now seems to call to him from the other side of the city br br when it's cold i'd like to die by moby marries perfectly with these last images and helps in creating an emotional roller coaster of an episode br br 10 out of 10 br br p s watch the next episode you find out what the light is it's wonderful
<START> did the movie makers even preview this before they released it the script jumps from place to place without giving much explanation the beginning doesn't clarify if its a prequel or not it starts with superman's beginnings on earth and then jumps to a point after the last movie but doesn't really alert the viewer of this very confusing superman himself is weak and in need of prozac he is portrayed as a potential home wrecker a stalker and someone who is clearly depressed and confused this type of character rarely makes for an interesting hero the ending is absolutely ridiculous superman ending up in a hospital just made me want to kill him off myself i'm seriously waiting for a snl skit where superman appears on maury povich and maury says the results are in in the case of the child superman you are the father to sum up ok acting by this superman and kevin spacey but horrible script the movie is basically unwatchable
<START> nathan detroit frank sinatra is the manager of the new york's longest established floating craps game and he needs 1000 to secure a new location confident of his odds he bets the city's highest roller sky masterson marlon brando that he can't woo uptight missionary sarah brown jean simmons 'guys and dolls 1955 ' is such a great musical because it deftly blends the contrasting styles of film and stage during a dazzling opening sequence crowds of pedestrians move in rhythm stopping and starting as though responding to backstage cues even the walking movements themselves are stylised and angular halfway between a walk and a dance mankiewicz's new york city is a glittering flurry of art deco colour and movement a fantasy world so completely removed from reality that even the business of underground gambling and criminal thuggery seems perfectly genial br br as i write this review i've just received word that jean simmons has passed away age 80 this unbelievably was the first time i'd seen her in a film yet she dazzled me from the beginning her idealistic and sexually repressed sarah comes out of her shell following an alcohol binge in havana letting loose with an adorably playful rendition of if i were a bell even though both simmons and brando were non singers producer sam goldwyn decided not to dub their vocals contending that maybe you don't sound so good but at least it's you despite goldwyn's backhanded confidence the pair both do well to carry entire musical numbers themselves simmons suggests the same child like liveliness that audrey hepburn might have brought to the role and brando exudes such self assurance and charisma that it doesn't matter that his singing voice isn't quite there
<START> the first half of the film is ok the second half one of the most tedious experiences imaginable quite possibly the most overrated movie of all time pulp fiction was robbed for best picture this is one of those films that people feel required to love because the main character is slow
