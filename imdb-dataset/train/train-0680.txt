<START> what an awful show science fiction fans seem to watch anything anymore regardless of quality it shocks me that something exceptional like firefly lasts one season while garbage like the battlestar galactica remake spawns a spin off this spin off is pitiful in every aspect of the show the acting is juvenile and uninspired the characters are cardboard clichÃ©s of everything that has ever been in a bad sci fi series the story is bad the dialog is worse than a prime time soap opera the direction is shoddy and the sets are awful caprica is a waste of film a waste of time and a waste of effort this is one spin off that should have never been made
<START> this movie is now my gauge against which all other movies will be compared as in was it as stupid as revolver i too was in the toronto international film festival audience last night where a room filled with over 2000 people walked out in an eerie silence after being absolutely dumbstruck by 2 hours of sheer nonsense jason stratham would have been amazing if only he had a purpose within the first 10 minutes he's given a proposition by andre 3000 and big pussy of soprano's fame which makes no sense at all then there's some shooting and then there's ray liotta wearing embarrassing bikini briefs then there's some animation ray liotta's naked butt lots of shooting teeth gnashing art house wanna be pretensions and more of liotta's embarrassing body that elicited laughs at every showing which i'm not quite sure was the reaction he was looking for not 5 times anyway everyone in this movie thinks they're smarter than the average bear and guy ritchie thinks he's yogi bear incarnate the story lines might have went nowhere but the posturing was outta sight the only way this movie could have been worse is if madonna herself was in it
<START> panic in the streets is an exciting and atmospheric thriller in which director elia kazan achieved a great sense of realism by shooting the movie in new orleans using a number of local people to fill various roles and making intelligent use of improvisation as a result the characters and dialogue both seem very natural and believable an important deadline which has to be met in order to avoid a disaster provides the story with its great sense of urgency and pace and the problems which delay the necessary action from being taken then increase the tension to a high level br br following a dispute between the participants in a card game a man called kochak lewis charles is shot and his body is dumped in the dock area when the body is found and the coroner identifies the presence of a virus u s public health official dr clinton reed richard widmark is called in and his examination confirms the presence of pneumonic plague reed insists that all known contacts of the dead man must be inoculated without delay because the very infectious nature of the disease means that without such action anyone infected could be expected to die within days br br as the identity of the dead man is unknown the task of finding his contacts is expected to be difficult and this situation is not helped when city officials and the police commissioner are not fully convinced by reed's briefing they doubt that the threat to the public is potentially as serious as he claims it is and their initial lack of commitment is just the first of a series of obstacles which prevent action from being taken urgently the investigation that follows is hampered by a lack of cooperation from the immigrant community a group of seamen the proprietor of a restaurant and also some illegal immigrants before the man's identity and his contacts are eventually found br br kochak an illegal immigrant had been in a gang with blackie jack palance raymond fitch zero mostel and vince poldi tommy cook and when gang leader blackie becomes aware of the ongoing police investigation he presumes that kochak must've smuggled something very valuable into the country as kochak and poldi were related blackie assumes that poldi must know something about this and goes to find out more poldi however is very ill and unable to provide any information blackie brings in his own doctor and together with fitch starts to move poldi out of his room and down some stairs and this is when they meet up with reed and an exciting chase follows br br richard widmark gives a strong performance as an underpaid public official who copes efficiently with the onerous responsibilities of his job whilst also dealing with his domestic preoccupations as a family man in an unusual type of role for him he also portrays the determined and serious minded nature of dr reed very convincingly jack palance's film debut sees him giving an impressive performance as a ruthless thug who misjudges kochak's reason for leaving the card game and also the reason for the intense police investigation his distinctive looks also help to make his on screen presence even more compelling br br in typical docu noir style expressionist cinematography and neo realist influences are utilized in tandem to effectively capture the atmosphere of the locations in which the action takes place elia kazan directs with precision throughout but also excels in the memorable chase sequence in the warehouse and on the dockside
<START> in order to avoid confusion let me clarify a couple of points i am not a red neck i am not even a moderate nor a conservative quite on the contrary i am a radical a libertarian i'm not a wasp either i was not even born in the states br br jorge luis borges used to say that there are some kind of folk who do not feel poetry and that these sad people usually earn their living teaching poetry this movie was made by and for people who do not feel poetry by and for show offs and i dare say by and for people who have no sense of decency or for that matter respect for other people's life or death especially when the victims are thought to be mostly 'bloody imperialists' killed in yankee soil i even find the original marketing idea of the eleven episodes of eleven minutes nine seconds and one frame as particularly hideous and repulsive just plain awful why didn't they assign a budget of as many dollars per episode as individuals were brutally murdered in the attack the whole idea rests somewhere between mere stupidity and reckless fascism anybody who is serious about film making and serious about life and death should have angrily declined to participate in this recollection of innuendoes and non sequiturs with two exceptions the episode of burkina faso almost amusing and the one from india which documents the story of a man who was unfairly and wrongly investigated in relation to the attack on the basis that afterwards he didn't return home and that he was an american muslim and truth be told when the facts were known he was honored as a hero all other nine episodes essentially and extremely boring and emotionless can be listed in two different categories br br first 'i don't care about the thousands of victims americans foreigners children youngsters adults old timers ' and can be resumed in pure boredom and lack of emotion makhmalbaf's iran lelouch's france Â i'm afraid i'm going to commit an heresy since it's lelouch's but maybe his episode might be considered built upon an idea which could be regarded as almost original tanovic's bosnia herzegovina gonzalez inarritu's mexico gitaÃ¯'s israel penn's usa br br second 'the bloody yankees deserve it' and can be resumed in frustration and hatred chahine egypt vindicates the suicide bombers loach uk considers the 9 11 reckless attacks were some kind of punishment for the alleged support of the usa to the chilean dictatorship headed by the serial killer augusto pinochet in fact someone should inform mr loach that the victims of pinochet were not related to al qaida and that chile is a south american country which sole existence mr bin laden should have ignored he ought to be informed too that the american government sanctions against the chilean dictatorship were harder than any other ciountrie's and imamura japan windingly points out that wwii is related the attack to the wtc imamura has at least been coherent in this the supposed cause effect linking is entirely nonsensical which plays well with his episode including a man who believes himself to be a snake it pretends to be obscure it is instead quite ludicrous br br there's some kind of error shared by many including some americans and it consists in the belief that this movie wasn't commercially screened in the states because of some kind of censorship nothing further from the truth this movie wasn't screened in the states because it is a complete fiasco a fiasco of the wackyest kind even in buenos aires where peronism and other forms of fascism are nearest and dearest to the hearts of a sizable number of its inhabitants and anti americanism is in vogue the movie was screened in living rooms hurriedly converted into theaters and was applauded by a very select public the usual sad few who routinely lend their applause to other equally 'quaint' spectacles like the sight of a mcdonald's fast food restaurant or perchance an elderly jew being burnt to ashes
<START> imagine turning out the lights in your remote farmhouse on a cold night and then going to bed there's no need to lock the doors the only sound is the wind whistling through the trees sometime after midnight a car with lights off inches up the driveway moments later an intruder beams a flashlight into your darkened living room br br what makes this image so scary is the setting a remote farmhouse at night based on truman capote's best selling book and with b w lighting comparable to the best 1940's noir films in cold blood presents a terrifying story especially in that first act as the plot takes place largely at night and on rain drenched country roads it's the stuff of nightmares but this is no dream the events really happened in 1959 br br two con men with heads full of delusions kill an entire kansas family looking for a stash of cash that doesn't exist director richard brooks used the actual locations where the real life events occurred even the farmhouse and its interior it makes for a memorable and haunting film br br both of the lead actors closely resemble the two real life killers robert blake is more than convincing as perry smith short and stocky with a bum leg who dreams of finding cortez' buried treasure scott wilson is almost as good as dick hickock the smooth talking con artist with an all american smile br br after their killing spree the duo head to mexico things go awry there so they come back to the u s stealing cars hitchhiking and generally being miserable as they roam from place to place but it's a fool's life and the two outlaws soon regret their actions the film's final twenty minutes are mesmerizing as the rain falls the rope tightens and all we hear is the pounding of a beating heart br br even with its somewhat mundane middle act in cold blood stages in riveting detail a real life story that still hypnotizes nearly half a century later it's that setting that does it do you suppose people in rural kansas still leave their doors unlocked at night
<START> men of honor stars cuba gooding jr as real life navy diver carl brashear who defied a man's navy to become the first african american navy diver sometimes by his side and sometimes his adversary there was one man who carl brashear really admired his name was master chief billy sunday robert deniro sunday in a lot of ways pushed aggravated and helped carl become the man he wanted to be br br i loved cuba in this film his portrayal here is as liberating and as powerful as denzel washington was in the hurricane through every scene we can see his passion motivation and stubbornness to achieve his dream we can see the struggle within in him as he embarks to make his father proud i also loved how the director created and brought forth a lot of tension in some of the key diving scenes brashear's encounter with a submarine during a salvage mission is heart stopping and brilliant br br the only fault i could see would have to lie in the supporting cast cuba and deniro's characters are very intricate and exciting to watch which does make you a little sad when they have to butt heads with such two dimensional supporting characters the evil lt cmdr hanks sunday's wife charlize theron the eccentric diving school colonel hal holbrook and cuba's love interest are the characters i found to not have very much depth what could have made these characters more substantial and more effective was a little more time to develop them why was that colonel always in his tower how come sunday's wife was so bitter and always drunk br br another curious question has to be this what happened to carl brashear's wedding i mean if this film is chronicling this man's life wouldn't his wedding be an important event maybe it's just me men of honor however is a perfect example of the triumph and faith that the human spirit envelops this film will inspire and make you feel for this man's struggle which i do believe was the reason this powerful story was told my hat goes off to you carl brashear i really admire your strength br br
<START> years ago i was lucky enough to have seen this gem at a gypsy film festival in santa monica you know the ending is not going to be rosie and tragedy will strike but it's really about the journey and characters and their dynamics and how they all fit into what was yugoslavia while i am not yugonostalgic and tend to shy away from the current crop of yugoslavian films give me ademir kenovic over late 90s kustarica i'd be happy to have the chance to stumble on this film again as it shines in my celluloid memories ever since seeing who's singing over there 15 years ago i still hear the theme tune sung by the gypsies ruminating through my headÂ i am miserable i was born that wayÂ with the accompanying jew's harp and accordian making the tune both funny and sad the late great actor pavle vujisic muzamer from when father was away on business was memorable as the bus driver of the ill fated trip in his typical gruff yet loveable manner hi
<START> every now and then a movie advertises itself as scary or frightening though they usually aren't most modern horror movies fit into this category br br then there are those movies that don't simply cause the tension and adrenaline to pump through your veins harder than usual they actually frighten you to a level that you've never experienced br br halloween is such a film it takes so many risks that would make most movie producers cringe but nearly all of them work halloween is awe inspiring in its simplicity and terrifying as a whole br br the story is simple laurie strode jamie lee curtis is babysitting some kids on halloween night while a madman is on the loose after escaping from a mental institution after brutally murdering his older sister 15 years ago of course the madman later known as michael myers begins killing the local teenage population and eventually he comes after laurie br br sounds familiar right just another brainless slasher filled with dumb teenagers and gobs of gore not a chance br br i think james berardinelli puts it perfectly in his review of halloween because of its title halloween has frequently been grouped together with all the other splatter films that populated theaters throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s however while halloween is rightfully considered the father of the modern slasher genre it is not a member br br he has a point and for a number of reasons first and foremost it's downright terrifying whereas most entries into the teen slasher genre are dumb gore fests one could argue that many recent ones are tongue in cheek but most of those fail as well second there is almost no violence very little of which is bloody john carpenter knows that violence does not equal scary and he relies very little on it actually the body count is pretty low in fact one can argue that this isn't really a horror movie at least not by todays standards of having the most deaths that can be crammed into a single movie each gorier and more sadistic than the last he relies on ideas for scares and also skill third while some of the characters may do stupid things that sometimes seal their fate they don't do them because they're dumb the characters are real people so instead of thinking that the characters die because they're idiots we're frightened because they're making a mistake br br one of the main reasons why halloween is so scary is because it is so easy to believe that it's real nothing is hard to swallow in this film there's no supernatural there's no ridiculously creative plot elements or inventive murders or whatnot instead all the set pieces and camera work save the opening sequence are simple carpenter just sets the camera in place and says action what we get is the feeling that we're actually seeing a murder take place right in front of us br br horror movies are probably the most difficult films to make because in order for something to be scary everything has to be perfect and ideas never work twice it's a hit or miss game which is why if i were to tell you all the good ideas that carpenter has which i'm not they'd seem primitive particularly since they have been repeated with lesser effect over and over again through the years br br acting here is not a plus point because it doesn't need to be this is a movie about scary ideas not a movie about dramatic conflicted characters the actors act like real people not characters from a story nothing more the exception to this is whoever plays the shape or later known as michael myers it can be scary to have a person say nothing and simply kill but it's hard to pull off and even harder to keep people from asking why but the guy pulls it off and the result is terrifying br br this is carpenter's movie through and through he directed it co wrote it co produced it and wrote the chilling score of it this is a man of brilliance and his later movie the thing supports this statement though the thing is not as scary as halloween unfortunately his success has dramatically diminished as it happens when the lure of big money for less freedom is taken advantage of once big time producers recognize your potential as good as this film is it's not without flaws the famous opening scene is disturbing but not very scary and not many of the scares work for the first part of the movie it's not that it's bad it's just that there's no good reason to fear the shape luckily carpenter mostly uses this time to set up a relationship between the characters and the audience while there's no intimacy in this relationship it fits the purpose we grow to know the characters but not so much that it's disheartening when they die but once the film gets to halloween night that's when carpenter kicks things into high gear and it never stops until you get to the end br br while halloween may be flawed it is only slightly so it is an immensely terrifying film and a must see for anyone who loves scary movies be warned though this movie will scare the living hell out of you
<START> this is a movie that is bad in every imaginable way sure we like to know what happened 12 years from the last movie and it works on some level but the new characters are just not interesting baby melody is hideously horrible alas while the logic that humans can't stay underwater forever is maintained other basic physical logic are ignored it's chilly if you don't have cold weather garments if you're in the arctic i don't know why most comments here return of jafar rates worse i thought this one is more horrible
<START> contains spoilers br br the british director j lee thompson made some excellent films notably 'ice cold in alex' and 'cape fear' but 'country dance' is one of his more curious offerings the story is set among the upper classes of rural scotland and details the strange triangular relationship between sir charles ferguson an eccentric aristocratic landowner his sister hilary and hilary's estranged husband douglas who is hoping for a reconciliation with her we learn that during his career as an army officer charles was regarded as having 'low moral fibre' this appears to have been an accurate diagnosis of his condition throughout the film he displays an attitude of gloomy disillusionment with the world and his main sources of emotional support seem to be hilary and his whisky bottle the film ends with his committal to an upper class lunatic asylum br br peter o'toole was when he was at his best as in 'lawrence of arabia' one of britain's leading actors but the quality of his work was very uneven and 'country dance' is not one of his better films he overacts frantically making charles into a caricature of the useless inbred aristocrat as though he were auditioning for a part in the monty python 'upper class twit of the year' sketch susannah york as hilary and michael craig as douglas are rather better but there is no really outstanding acting performance in the film there is also little in the way of coherent plot beyond the tale of charles's inexorable downward slide br br the main problem with the film however is neither the acting nor the plot but rather that of the theme that dare not speak its name there are half hearted hints of an incestuous relationship between charles and hilary or at least of an incestuous attraction towards her on his part and that his dislike of douglas is motivated by sexual jealousy unfortunately even in the swinging sixties and early seventies the date of the film is variously given as either 1969 or 1970 there was a limit to what the british board of film censors was willing to allow and a film with an explicitly incestuous theme was definitely off limits the american title for the film was 'brotherly love' but this was not used in britain was it too suggestive for the liking of the bbfc these hints are therefore never developed and we never get to see what motivates charles or what has caused his moral collapse resulting in a hollow film with a hole at its centre 4 10
<START> to be honest this film is another in a series of huge disappointments most of these so called masters of horror films are only horrifying in terms of their sub par effects and laughable story lines aside from ron perlman everyone else in this film cannot act to save their life the gunshots sounded like someone was playing bop it under the boom mike or something and looked completely unrealistic overall this film is about as scary as home alone the only good masters are cigarette burns jennifer and maybe pelts i don't know how these directors can sleep at night knowing that they have ruined the very genre that some of them used to actually understand
<START> in an otherwise good review loleralacartelort7890 says the truth is that the americans use a secret aluminum anti radiation alloy it is not that well known and the exact specifications are a secret and why is it a secret well why should they reveal it back then if they where in a space race with the russians then it would be very dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation this is completely incorrect there is and was no secret to radiation protection in apollo the design and construction of the apollo command module has long been publicly available it uses a lightweight honeycomb of aluminum and stainless steel the entire outer surface except the windows of course is covered with a heat shield made of a phenolic resin thicker on the bottom that faces forward during re entry these materials are actually better at stopping the kind of radiation we have in space charged particles than lead which is better suited to stopping ionizing photons like x rays and gamma rays br br space radiation is a definite problem for long term space flight because of the risk of big solar flares but it simply wasn't a serious threat to the apollo astronauts the command module gave them pretty good protection during their brief 1 2 hour or so passage through the van allen belts they all carried dosimeters so we know exactly how much radiation they each received no more than 1 5 rem and usually much less of the 24 men who flew to the moon 12 of whom landed 18 are still alive only two have died from cancer alan shepard leukemia and jack swigert bone cancer the rest died from heart attacks pancreatitis roosa and a motorcycle accident conrad these are actually pretty good statistics for a group of men now in their late 70s shepard would be 86
<START> an unmarried woman named stella bette midler gets pregnant by a wealthy man stephen collins he offers to marry her out of a sense of obligation but she turns him down flat and decides to raise the kid on her own things go ok until the child named jenny trini alvarado becomes a teenager and things gradually and predictably become worse br br i've seen both the silent version and sound version of stella dallas neither one affected me much and i cry easily but they were well made if dated trying to remake this in 1990 was just a stupid idea i guess midler had enough power after the incomprehensible success of beaches to get this made this predictably bombed the story is laughable and dated by today's standards even though midler and alvarado give good performances this film really drags and i was bored silly by the end stephen collins and marsha mason both good actors don't help in supporting roles flimsy and dull really who thought this would work see the 1937 stanwyck version instead i give this a 1
<START> this is one of my favorite comedies ever not wanting to condone the uninspiring lifestyle of its hero but taken for what it's worth and not as trivializing alcoholism the movie is simply a lot of fun it tells the unlikely tale of a perpetually drunk irresponsible 40 something bachelor named arthur who is set to inherit a vast fortune but only if he marries susan chosen because the family thinks she might make something of him arthur proposes but then unwisely falls for linda a waitress and petty thief br br dudley moore is perfect as arthur the world's most endearing drunk whose antics are a laugh a minute admittedly moore is arthur and i agree with those who can imagine no other actor in the role the ladies of the piece are also well portrayed liza minnelli sparkles as linda and her on screen chemistry with moore is great jill clayburgh plays susan the wealthy and more appropriate woman chosen for arthur br br however this film is literally made by sir john gielgud who portrays arthur's sarcastic but moral butler hobson it's obvious these two have had a great mutual affection during hobson's longtime employment hobson is arthur's best friend and purveyor of unsolicited commentary and advice the most interesting relationship in this film is not arthur's romance at all but his unusual rapport with this witty and of course perpetually disapproving servant it's the butler you'll remember best long after the closing credits roll
<START> jean seberg had not one iota of acting talent like all her films 'bonjour tristesse' suffers not at all from her looks though she is perhaps the first of those modern women whom tom wolfe gleefully accurately describes as boys with breasts publicists of course use the word gamine but suffers grievously from seberg's dull monotonous killing voice in all her films when had to play anger seberg played it with grossly audible distracting gasping panting between her monotonously droned verbalizations oy br br preminger's adaptation of franÃ§oise sagan's breathlessly juvenile fantasy soap opera plot is noteworthy only for his lush cinematography but then that's difficult to funk on the photogenic french riviera and perhaps for his apt but certainly not groundbreaking employment of black white for the present day scenes from which seberg's monotone narration delivers us to the flashed back to color past br br juliette grÃ©co has a brief moment as a nightclub chanteuse in the black white spotlight delivering in smoky dietrichesque voice the bleak existentialist lyric of the title song this moment is nowadays in retrospect more than a wee bit drÃ´le except of course if you're french particularly if you're a french 68 er longing for the glorious days of the barricades roundabout the sorbonne and your kids riot to retain the lifelong sinecures which have blighted and emasculated france's economy then you still believe in sartre and foucault and all such arcane irrelevant theorists br br david niven has the hardest role having to play with sufficient gusto an aging hedonist who's yet to grasp that life isn't all about sagan's teenybopper notions of a hip cool swingin' mon copain papa deborah kerr delivers her usual consummately professional presence convincingly playing the woman who suffers undeservedly seberg's spiteful teenaged snot nose jealousy fulfilling sagan's shallow teen fantasy of the classical theme of there can be only one queen bee in the hive in fact to kerr belongs this film's sole great and memorable on screen moment br br the dialogue is unnatural i agree with an earlier reviewer who said that it sounds to be badly translated from french combine the unnatural scripting with seberg's incomparably dull unendurable monotone and you can save that valium for another night atop all that the ineptly synched post production voice dubbing is almost throughout obvious and thus much more than irksome this is especially true of the dubbing for mylÃ¨ne demongeot because it spoils her otherwise very pleasing dumb blonde performance br br hunky geoffrey horne gets the short end of the stick here a very good looking young man who also suffered from a less than lovely uncinematic voice which when paired with seberg's drone yields unconvincing scenes of puppy love horne was shall we say merely adequate in 'bridge on the river kwai ' perhaps because his end was held up by those great cinema pros william holden and jack hawkins instead of being unsupported by the regrettably ungifted seberg br br in sum 'bonjour tristesse' is pretty to look at but it's shallow immature soap thin gruel with suds
<START> sometimes making something strange and contemporary doesn't always work to everyone's advantage while i will admit that the set design and concept of the film was rather interesting the execution of these ideas into one congruent story just didn't work this film was so hideously slow and pointless not even robin williams could save this garbage it's obvious barry levinson's dream fell flat on its face but he should have warned the rest of the world about this slop
<START> mardi gras made in china provides a wonderful intricate connection between popular culture nudity and globalization through the making and tossing of beads i saw this film at the international film festival of boston and was expecting a dry introduction to globalization but what i got was a riveting visual display of shocking footage from both china and the united states the eye opening film is humorous in depth serious non patronizing and it leaves you wanting more as the credits role it is worth comparing to murderball it's simply that well done the young women workers in china have various points of view and the owner is amazingly open about the discipline the revelers during carnival are the highlight but only because this excellent film provides in depth context inside the factory in china without narration bravo to the filmmaker for getting inside and finishing the film i would have never thought about the connection between beads china and new orleans now i think about the human connection between almost every object but also the role of globalization inequality and fun more importantly i can make these connections without feeling a sense of guilt after watching this film unlike other films on globalization that i've seen
<START> good exciting movie although it looks to me that it's not been recorded on location in thailand it still looks realistic nice story about some girls having 'fun' in one of the most beautiful countries on the world in real the thai people are very kind
<START> kalifornia is one of my all time favourite movies and it easily could be labeled as one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90 s the film has a very stylish surface to it but behind that are a lot of disturbing and honest depictions of homicidal maniacs and the terrifyng violence they inflict upon others one of the film s strongest aspects is it s performances brad pitt is startlingly great as a trailer trash psycho named early pitt potrays his frightening character almost flawlessly juliette lewis is equally as good playing his naive girlfriend her innocence is almost heart breaking kalifornia has a very simple plot to it that goes steadily and slowly forward for about an hour but it suddenly plunges into a harrowing spree of murder as pitt unleashes his psychotic personality there are alot of shocking scenes and it all mounts to a power house climax that will haunt you for days kalifonia is a film that should really be watched for it s intense look at how monstrous a human being can be and not only for it s violence and gore
<START> i couldn't believe it i had to rub my eyes a few times was it true br br yes there were billy dee williams jeff conaway maxwell caulfield and tracy scoggins all of them have some manner of talent but here they all were in what basically adds up to a cinemax style skin flick set on board a spaceship br br sad as it is alien intruder tries to be unique with a computer virus alien demon harpy whatever else you want to call her named ariel scoggins infiltrating this sort of high tech virtual reality station on board a spaceship where four men are allowed to live out their fantasies as the system is over seen by their captain williams br br interesting maybe but here everything just plays out like a well padded episode of red shoe diaries williams out classes everything right and left and looks like he'd rather be doing anything else anywhere else ah the things people do for money br br the fx are pretty static maybe even less than what you'd expect for a straight to video cheapie like this unfortunately even the female nudity is less than you'd expect sexual innuendo is the real star here and of course it gets all the best scenes br br if you like a movie that's all tease and no brains check out alien intruder of course you'll probably have to look no further than cinemax at 2 or 3 in the morning br br no stars not even for what star power this flick can muster br br leave this one lost in space
