<START> scary but mostly in the sense that will it be over before i turn 70 i saw this as a late night re run in about 1976 and thought it would never end like crackers it's better than nothing but just br br ray milland is a little scary because he looks as if he's been stuffed by a taxidermist yvette mimeux looks as if she's smoked up all the beautiful downtown burbank brown br br it's a sort of roy rogers version of rosemary's baby this is one turkey that should never have been made if you have insomnia and it's 1 30 on saturday morning and there's nothing on but replays of the 1972 roller derby chamionship then i guess it beats that but god help you if this is your only choice for entertainment
<START> if the cabinet of dr caligari is the father of all horror films and of german expressionist cinema this pre wwi film is the grandfather the titular student starving in an empty garret makes a deal with the devil the devil gives him a bottomless sack of gold in exchange for anything in this room the devil chooses the student's reflection in his mirror he walks off with the student's doppelganger who commits crimes for which the student is blamed br br the film is marred by some limitations arising out of the technically primitive state of 1913 filmmaking the plot cries out for chiaroschuro effects but the film is of necessity virtually all shot in shadowless daylight but the scene where the reflection walks out of the mirror still packs a wallop br br more interesting for the trends it fortells than for its own sake the student of prague is still worthwhile
<START> most movies about or set in new orleans turn out to be laughably bad and laughably inaccurate examble remember the savage bees but i'll make an exception for tightrope which almost got it right br br here's one that doesn't inevitably get it wrong the accents are not too bad yes the yat accent down here is way more brooklynese than southern the city of 1950 is shown the way it is was without the obligatory tourist shots and they understand a good drama without trying to make everyone a quirky southerner br br one of the few films to do justice to this city and a good film to boot
<START> no there is another br br because every star wars fan had to have an opinion about i ii iii and because that opinion was biased since we missed so much the atmosphere and the characters of the original trilogy i will state the good points of the return of the jedi and a few corresponding bad points of the prequel of course i loved the music the special effects the two droids but this has been overly debated elsewhere br br what we get in the original trilogy and in this particular movie a strong ecological concern anti militarist positions fascinating insights about the jedi order and the force cute creatures harrison ford's smile a killer scene near the ending when vader looks alternatively at his son and at the emperor the lightning of the lethal bolts reflected on his black helmet and when he grabs and betrays his master to save luke thereby risking his own life oh boy br br what is wrong in the prequel inmho the whole human factor element that the original cast was able to push forward is somehow missing the force seems to be more about superpowers and somersaults than about wisdom too many jedis at once and too many light sabers on the screen the lack of experience of a few actors too often threatens the coherence of the plot br br by the way if you enjoy the theory of the force as explained by obi web obi wen i mean and yoda then you should read a few books about buddhism and the forms it took in ancient japan br br the magic of star wars imho lies mainly in the continuing spiritual heritage from a master to his apprentice from a father to his son albeit the difficulties de mon Ã¢me Ã  ton Ã¢me from my soul to yours as would write bejard to the late zen master t deshimaru
<START> when i first watched the show the first few episodes seemed promising bill compton introduced himself as the stereotypical mysterious vampire and sookie presented herself as an independent woman however the show went downhill from here and the once interesting characters are as entertaining as a cardboard box br br as the story progresses the main characters lose their original personalities along with their acting abilities by episode 5 bill's furrowed eyebrows are so low that his face just consists of a forehead sookie or rather the actress is even more dead than her vampire lover all these tragic events are surrounding her and she only reacts to how enjoyable it was losing her virginity personally i think they made the main characters sleep with each other too early in the show the way they teased each other was something that had me hooked and could easily be toyed with a bit more as soon as sookie loses it she struts around like a total ditz only thinking of bill's libido and the size of his appendage bill also loses his debonair attitude and well he just gets plain silly his actions are never really explained except he does it for sookie why their love for each other is never delved into if there is any love so far it just seems to be sex that is the core of their relationship br br yeah yeah vampires usually equal sex but come on every five seconds i see some sort of humping going on it wasn't that much of a surprise since hbo always tries to pass of a soft core porno as a decent tv show bill popping out of the dirt and just getting it on with sookie with no reason what's so ever i laughed so hard i almost peed myself br br the plot is just a stream of consciousness the characters never go into detail about anything all the events that happen are usually left unexplained the only thing that is constant is the sex br br the only thing i can say that i do like are the minor characters tara and her drunk mother are far more interesting than the major characters the only reason why i continue to watch the show is for the development of the minor characters br br minus the sex and the main characters the show would be much more worthwhile
<START> as i am not a blood and guts fan i found the gory scenes totally unnecessary you spell it and too real for my liking if you're the type of person who gets their rocks off on beheadings on the internet or snuff movies i say go for it it beggars belief what sort of person dreams this sick crap up though br br apart from that it had the potential to be a great movie the music was top class too through the movie and especially the end credits some parts though were a bit unbelievable like you've just been found by your girlfriend trust up awaiting torture and death and all you do is tell her about what had happened and how you got there why didn't he ask her if she happened to have any wipes or even some air freshner or a piece of gum while he was at it come on now most would probably just scream hurry up and untie me then lets get the f out of here quick where were the flys maggots etc and when the girl accidentally came across the place surely the stench of rotten flesh would have sounded a few alarm bells i would only recommend this movie to friends of dennis niellson and the like i'm sure a video like this would make sickos like that have a very happy christmas
<START> i can't say that this film deserves anywhere near the amount of vitriol being heaped on it by some reviewers yes it's bogged down by an overly padded running time hamfisted editing and an overreliance on cheeseball special effects and it lacks much of the energy a comedy needs to get your average audience member to sit through it without checking his or her watch br br on the other hand it's also got some laugh out loud funny lines a talented and earnest cast and the classic underdog premise macy stiller and azaria are brilliant as the core team and garofalo and studi do superb work adding conflict and variety to the team i can't say reubens or mitchell added much to the film overall though each had a few chances to shine br br the plot as i said above is your classic underdog makes good stuff no surprises there since you know they're going to triumph what makes it worthwhile is not the absurd gaudy heroes and villains but the dialogue and interplay between the characters underneath it all these people are children at heart who just want to do right the best scenes in the film give this film its emotional grounding look at azaria's relationship with his long suffering mother macy's endearing innocence in his unwillingness to accept cap amazing's secret identity stiller's rage not unlike that one weird spazzy kid you once knew who'd always go into quivering impotent rages on the playground garofalo's desire to avenge her father this childlike belief that a sense of justice and goodness will always make the world a better place is the true appeal of super hero comics and underneath its parodic exterior mystery men shows us why these hackneyed comic book tropes matter to so many br br it never really gels into a satisfying whole due to the huge number of half baked subplots romance family life conflicts within the team etc but the main plot is such loopy fun that it makes up for that the fact that it's supposed to be good nonsensical fun seems to be lost on some of the reviewers here so i'll issue a caveat if you're the type of viewer who finds his enjoyment of an itchy and scratchy cartoon ruined by the unexplained and illogical am i to believe this is some sort of snort magic xylophone then you are far too literal minded and humorless for this film go rent a sandler film instead br br 7 10
<START> recently shown on cable tv the movie opens with a disclaimer distancing itself from any co operation of real life persons that in itself is an eye catcher yet the script and acting from the main characters is superb and i found myself engrossed throughout due in no small way to the crisp thoughtful and interesting dialogue the film is about a meeting on one day between two real life musical legends who formerly composed together then seperated the film captures the essence of their lives and philosophies in a story which proffers an explanation for their initial split what is so impressive is that the actors give such seemingly realistic portrayals of the characters they play faults and all that this viewer at least was left believing i was witnessing a true event in almost every detail the great skill of this play is that with astute writing and fine acting a movie basically about two of us talking can make an excellent picture worthy of at least an 8 out of 10
<START> the movie lacks credence with the helicopters which didn't exist until the 1950s but no woman would do what was done here even a woman before the women's movement of the 60s and 70s about the only portion of the movie that you could believe in was that germany would want to know where the landing would be ignore for the moment that the british had captured all the spies but even if they had not they wouldn't have let one roam around like this just to reassure the germans that the landing would be at calais it isn't one major thing that makes the movie not work it is the culmination of all the things wrong that makes the movie fail bad directing bad scripts no attempt at authenticity at all all combine to just make the movie fall flat generally speaking spies should fade into the woodwork the suspense comes in with the spy wondering if the information they have is valid or not and worrying about being detected on this one that game was over from the start this spy was doing anything but spying your only chance at getting something that has some credibility and instills some suspense may be to read the book
<START> for those of you who love lord of the rings and love special effects watch this movie this will be sure to keep you glued to the screen you will probably even like it if you like watching people fight with magical stuff
<START> this can be one of the most enjoyable movies ever if you don't take it seriously it is a bit dated and the effects are lame but it is so enjoyable there are giant crabs that attack a girl oh and the crabs sing japanese it is amazingly bad and the ending which has been telegraphed throughout the entire film is hideously awesome predictable but seeing the final fight will leave you rolling in your seat don't even give this film a chance and you will love it susan george is fun to watch and yes she does appear naked her daughter isn't quite worth putting up with but she does get attacked by giant crabs they are the size of large cats this is a 2 but i love it as a movie my god but for entertainment i give it a 7 did i mention there are giant crabs
<START> whew what can be said about gymkata that hasn't already this is nothing but pure halarity from beginning to end if you want a movie that will keep you on the floor laughing this is the perfect movie to get from cabot's wild style mullet sweater combo to parmistan and it's four billion assorted ninjas everything about this film reeks of crap br br directed by robert clouse the infamous mind that brought you the mirror scene in bruce lee's game of death he once again showcases his complete lack of directing talent a few other faces you most likely won't recognize will appear for your enjoyment as well from buck kartalian to tadashi yamashita although you won't remember them or care about them after the movie is done br br supposedly based on a book called the terrible game which if i could find a single trace of it's existence anywhere i would be interested in reading it to see where this thing went wrong instead the book apparently is a figment of gymkata's imagination probably something clouse made up in order to sell his lame idea br br pick this one up and yakmallah it for yourself it is easily one of the best bad movies i have ever seen and that is saying quite a bit
<START> i don't have much to say about this movie it could have been a wonderful tour de force for peter sellers but it is one of the most tragic misfires in movie history that it was sellers final movie makes it all the more painful br br the terrible screenplay direction and shockingly wooden performances all come dreadfully together to make this one of the most unwatchably awful movies ever made br br i wish so much that i could find even a snicker or a chuckle buried somewhere in this pile of putrid blubber but it's a lifeless humorless disaster the truth hurts br br peter why couldn't you have stopped at being there
<START> this movie was billed as a comedy and a mystery it fails badly at both the only mystery here is why would anybody make such a poorly constructed movie the only comedy is the laugh i got when i saw how high the readers here ranked it could there be two movies with the same name the movie i saw starred a girl with pretty blue eyes and a plot that wasn't there br br
<START> from the nepotism capitol of the world comes another junk flick in a fancy wrapper cq tells a lame disjointed mess of a story which is little more than a bunch of silly caricatures a babe and straight man davies running around trying to make a stupid sci fi flick i can't think of any reason anyone would want to spend time with this ridiculous attempt at film making d
<START> why did they make them so big why didn't they just give the money to the poor the question about cathedrals was asked by a student to mr harvey during a school field trip to salisbury cathedral that's a good question he replied partly to inspire them to get them to look up with awe i'm not sure that cathedrals have that impact on everyone but this movie certainly had that impact on me it was awesome br br it didn't start out that way for a while it seemed to be little more than a depiction of well a school field trip to salisbury cathedral if you've ever been on a high school field trip to anywhere this is basically it you have a group of largely disinterested kids just happy to be out of school for a day the bus driver who's driven crazy by them and some teachers trying desperately to keep it all under control been there done that got the t shirt was my initial reaction i figured that in the end this was going to be a typical story of a teacher managing to inspire a group of disinterested students yawn but it turns out to be so much more timothy spall was brilliant as mr harvey a sombre unsmiling teacher with a strange fascination for cathedrals over the course of the movie his story slowly comes out and becomes the focal point of the story we also get introduced to some of the troubled students most notably helen also brilliantly played by nathalie press who's into self mutilation br br this isn't a religious movie but it includes some powerful reflections on religious themes when harvey's colleague jonathon played by ben miles says i don't care what anyone believes as long as they don't try to force it on anyone else harvey replies that isn't tolerance it's indifference which is in fact in my opinion what often passes for religious tolerance in our society there are scenes of reconciliation between various characters and the final scene of the movie was brilliant as harvey climbs back on the bus director susanna white has the camera slowly pan upwards so that the final shot is simply of the sky hearkening back to harvey's comment that the purpose of the cathedral is to get people to look up in awe the cathedral accomplishes its goal we look up into the universe in awe seeking something greater than ourselves however we choose to define it this is a very powerful and very inspiring movie 9 10
<START> i first read pearl s buck's splendid novel in my ninth grade history class and i enjoyed every thrilling page of it it was almost inevitable that hollywood would get hold of it and considering that it was made in 1937 the results are excellent br br certain things have to be accepted in 1937 there was no question of casting asian actors in a major hollywood film in a way this renders the end product rather more interesting than if they had been able to use a more authentic looking cast br br with that obstacle to overcome executive producer irving thalberg and director sidney franklin among others took the trouble to hand pick a splendid and stellar cast paul muni plays wang lung muni was at the peak of his powers as an actor during this period and could very nearly play anything he put his mind to once you get past the makeup it's good but no one is going to really mistake him for a chinese man his performance has all the verisimilitude of his best work br br then there is luise rainer coming off an oscar win the previous year for her performance in the great ziegfeld the viennese actress's star was on the rise and she was given the plum role of o lan despite her lack of experience in hollywood her performance won her a second consecutive oscar the first time in history that happened br br much criticism has been leveled at rainer's performance and her oscar win here she has been called wooden and one note there is a small grain of truth in that however that being said all you need to do is go back to the book for rainer though not chinese played o lan pretty much as buck wrote her it is in fact a splendid performance and one of the best transfers from book to screen i have ever witnessed br br as for the rest of the cast well this was mgm they had the biggest roster of stars and character actors in hollywood at the time and a big budget to pay for the best and in the end they got the best br br the film softens wang lung's marriage to o lan somewhat in the novel with wealth come the lusts of the flesh and he takes on a concubine a move which devastates his wife but her feelings as a mere woman do not concern him in the film a contrite wang lung returns to his wife on her deathbed the two pearls he had taken from her years before realizing too late that she was his true love br br corny yes but that's hollywood considering the obstacles they were up against the film might well have opened to screams of laughter but despite the noticeable dearth of real asians in the cast this film has worn surprisingly well with the passage of seventy three years in fact the most amazing thing about this film is how good it is when it might so easily have been a disaster
<START> this film is one of the finest american b movies of the 90s if you're looking for a serious film look elsewhere however if you're looking for some action a lot of laughs and a tongue in cheek variation on cops fighting gangsters this is well worth watching everyone chews the scenery a bit but that's really what the film is all about and everyone is quite funny donald sutherland and john lithgow have great chemistry and need to do another film together
<START> i was willing to go with the original cruel intentions it went along with the plot and stayed true to the characters of one of my favorite stories however this movie was in my opinion a crummy rehash with essentially the same story line and no clear character choices i didn't honestly care what happened to any of them the strongest part of the original story les liasons not ci is the characters and their interactions not the events themselves i wasn't clear until i read the imdb that this movie was meant to be a prequel especially since the title includes a number 2 i expected a sequel but then determined that it must be a companion piece over all i must say that this movie read to me at least like a soft porn version of les liasons i was not impressed
<START> i remembered this as being one of my favorite books as a child and had been wanting to read it to my 5 year old daughter for a while now i knew the movie was coming out soon so we went to the library to get the book and they gave us preview passes for the next day we rushed home and spent the afternoon reading the book so we could compare wasn't necessary the only thing in common between the book and the movie is the main characters' first name the fact that there is a bet and a whole lot of worm eating oh yeah i almost forgot the kid who cooks most of the worms likes to present his masterpieces with a french accent how the kids know each other the number of kids involved how the bet came about the number of worms that must be eaten the time frame in which he has to eat the worms how they are cooked progression of friendships climax scenes etc nothing is the same but somehow it did not ruin the movie for me the characters are all enjoyable and the film did not leave me disappointed word of caution for parents there was one moment when you could hear the adults in the room collectively draw their breath and that was when billy's little brother referred to his penis as a dilly dick the embarrassing part came when my daughter proceeded to ask those sitting around us does anybody know what a dilly dick is lol that and an occasional shut up is as foul mouthed as this film gets my daughter thought she might get sick around worm 3 and 4 and was holding the empty nacho container just in case but was fine by worm 6 she and i both really enjoyed the film and had a wonderful time sharing the experience
