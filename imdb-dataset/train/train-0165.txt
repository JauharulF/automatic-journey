<START> dumland focuses on the lives of one american family the father a violent and obscene person who loves to fart and use profanity and who has no redeeming qualities the mother who appears to be a paranoid psychotic never really says much the son an obscure annoying repetitive little fellow the animation is simple and crude but does suite the stories and the characters the episodes were originally only available from the davidlynch com website but have now been released on dvd there are 8 episodes on the dvd and a brief synopsis follows br br 1 the neighbor we meet the next door neighbor and find out three things about him he has a really nice shed he only has one arm and he likes to do naughty things with ducks br br 2 the treadmill we find out that the wife has an affinity for exercise but the husband doesn't really think it's a good idea in the end the exercise treadmill is victorious br br 3 the doctor the father has an unfortunate accident with an exposed live wire the doctor's examination is quite thorough if not unconventional but the diagnosis is you are perfectly normal but we knew that br br 4 a friend visits after an altercation with the new clothes hoist a friend comes to visit believe it or not he has one but after we meet him we can understand why no surprises when he tells us what his hobbies are br br 5 get the stick we meet another neighbor he has a stick stuck in his mouth although we never find out how it got there unfortunately removing the stick from his neighbor's mouth ends up being harder and more violent than expected but he is victorious in the end jesus some people can be ungrateful br br 6 my teeth are bleeding this was my favorite episode and was also the most mind numbingly repetitive and annoying hmm what does that say about me not sure why the son's teeth started bleeding but believe me when i say it was minimal to the plot of the story which is an oxymoron as the story had no plot but did have a funny ending involving a fly br br 7 uncle bob after meeting uncle bob and uncle bob's wife we get a distinct feeling that the dumbland gene pool is very shallow uncle bob is a sickly fellow i shan't elaborate lest i spoil it for you uncle bob's wife definitely wears the pants in his family and the father definitely ends up on the wrong side of her ample fist and spends the rest of their visit cowering in a tree in the back yard br br 8 ants after the home gets infiltrated with ants and a misbegotten attempt to bug spray them goes awry he ends up spraying himself in the face with the bug spray and starts hallucinating the ants put on a fabulous song and dance show he goes berserk trying to kill them winds up in a full body plaster and lets just say the ants get their vengeance in the end br br as bad as these stories are there is something that kept compelling me to watch them they do give another insight into the mind of one of my favorite directors david lynch maybe they were an outlet for him to get rid of some of his violent thoughts i did actually laugh out loud at many points within the episodes many aspects are absurdly funny
<START> the temp 1993 didn't do much theatrical business but here's the direct to video rip off you didn't want anyway ellen bradford mel harris is the new woman at millennium investments a high scale brokerage firm who starts getting helpful hints from wide eyed secretary deidre sheila kelley deidre turns out to be an ambitious daddy's girl who will stop at nothing to move up the corporate ladder including screwing a top broker she can't stand and murdering anyone who gets on her bad side she digs up skeletons in ellen's closet tries to cause problems with her husband barry bostwick kills while making it look like she is responsible kidnaps her daughter and tries to get her to embezzle money from the company br br harris and kelley deliver competent performances the supporting cast is alright and it's reasonably well put together but that doesn't fully compensate for a script that travels down a well worn path and offers few surprises
<START> is this film a joke is it a comedy surely it isn't a serious thriller there is no suggestion that there is any intended humor but on quite a few occasions the poor acting poor directing and appalling script had the audience laughing out loud in the cinema the plot is acceptable a promising young artist just reaching his peak shot dead by an assassin he walks in on by mistake the killer sees the young artists work portfolio he is carrying and decides to attend an exhibition of his work at the exhibition the assassin meets the dead artists sister and they end up falling in love it is all very predictable stuff and the end will not have anyone guessing as it is so poorly scripted the film takes place mainly in and around vienna austria and shows what a beautiful city it is do not waste your time on this film though unless you are studying how not to act direct or script a film
<START> moonchild is a very difficult movie to categorise it's easiest to think of it as several snapshots of the lives of the two central characters the fact that these characters are members of a street gang set in an multicultural city of the near future and that one of them is a vampire does not preclude them from having moments like any other people and this is one of the places where this movie is different to anything else i've ever heard of it doesn't get wrapped up in the fact that one of the main characters is a vampire it's just something that has to be dealt with like any other problem the way the characters interact is surprisingly realistic there are embarrassing relatives and tricks that are meant to look cool that just don't work which leaves the film with a lovely sense of not taking itself too seriously for the most part br br the other area that really stood out to me is the languages the fictional city of mallepa contains various cultural groups and characters speak the language that they would be expected to speak japanese gang members speak japanese to each other but chinese when talking to characters of chinese descent possibly the most amusing exchange involves an australian and is conducted in english the actors of the four arguably main characters have three separate mother tongues between them and speak varying levels of each others' languages so it's quite a feat that the movie was made at all which i suppose brings me to the lead actors br br much has been made of the fact that the movie stars two of japan's biggest rockstars gackt and hyde as well as taiwanese superstar lee hom wang whether it is to praise them for their acting or criticise it or simply fangirl about them in my opinion lee hom is the best at playing a straight and realistic character however any lack of acting ability on gackt's part is mostly masked by the fact that the character he plays is prone to being over dramatic i wasn't sure if hyde's character was supposed to be as sulky and sarcastic as he came across but it doesn't really detract from the movie either way br br there are several scenes which take rather melodramatic turns which made it difficult for them to affect me much emotionally although this doesn't seem to stop a lot of people i found it's best to just enjoy the movie for what it is and not take it too seriously it's perfect for getting out and watching with a group of friends it does have its flaws but overall it was very enjoyable and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a few subtitles
<START> it's hard to tell if noonan and marshall are trying to ape abbott costello martin lewis curley larry or some other comedy team but whoever it was they were trying to imitate they failed miserably there's barely one weak laugh in this whole incredibly stupid picture noonan who helped write the alleged script and marshall have no chemistry whatsoever marshall seems to be trying for a dean martin type of devil may care coolness but he doesn't come even remotely close god knows what noonan thought he was doing but being funny sure wasn't it he seems to think that flapping his arms and legs a lot and staring dumbly at everyone and everything is the height of screen comedy maybe for him it is but not for the audience i remember seeing this in the theaters when it came out it was on the bottom of a double bill with a three year old jeff chandler western pillars of the sky which was pretty good and a three stooges short sappy bullfighters which wasn't and about 20 minutes into this thing all the kids in the audience were throwing stuff at the screen it was so staggeringly unfunny that it didn't even measure up to the worst of the three stooges shorts i stayed around for the end of it not that i wanted to but my folks weren't due to pick me up until after the movie ended and by the time this mess was over i was the only one in the theater i saw it again about 15 or so years ago on cable one night and stuck around to watch it to see if it was as bad as i remembered it was worse the only thing it had going for it was julie newmar who was as smokingly hot as ever other than her this thing has absolutely nothing to recommend it the two of them also play japanese soldiers and the way they do it makes jerry lewis' infamous playing of japanese characters as thick lensed buck toothed gibbering mental defectives look benign by comparison marshall went on to host hollywood squares and noonan kept trying his hand at making movies but most of them were almost as bad as this not quite though as i don't think anything could be quite as bad as this a truly pathetic waste of film don't waste your time on it
<START> this is a very real and funny movie about a japanese man having a mid life crisis in japan ballroom dancing is not approved of but when shohei sugiyama becomes obsessed with meeting the beautiful young girl he sees in the window of a dance studio he suddenly finds himself enrolled in dance classes no one is more surprised when he begins to like it than he but he must keep his secret pleasure from his coworkers and family when the truth comes out it is quite funny
<START> it seemed as though the year 1984 was anything but the orwellian nightmare it was calculated to be with george orwell's science fiction novel 1984 turned out to be one of the happiest times in american history the upsurge in the economy and a reemergence in basic american values cultivated an idealistic aura of resumed innocence which was viewed by the american people with a very auspicious disposition there have been many ersatz renditions of classic movies in the past but the originals are almost always considered superior purple rain is such a movie in this category made in 1984 purple rain provided a doggerel of eighties happy go lucky quality music which they incorporated into the making of this excellent film certain artifacts indicative of the eighties are indeed classics screwball comedies neon accented clothing and of course the music eighties music is considered by experts to be the best decade for music in american history set in minneapolis purple rain accommodated the use of naive entertainment with the changing times of the city when i was a little kid i lived in minneapolis for about eight months back then the non white population was under 3 by 1984 african americans had made some in roads into minneapolis and thus they established a firmly embedded culture of their own as well the movie purple rain evokes an eighties style clothing and music ensemble which effortlessly captivated the movie audience i loved the music to purple rain and the innovative approach this film takes to confrontational success is indeed brilliant see this movie if you have not seen it already prince became an eighties icon with this masterpiece for a short time he dated kim bassinger he must be doing something right purple rain put prince on the map this film gets my emphatically assertive verdict of thumbs up
<START> this was a really funny movie br br every 1 in the movie was trying to be serious that is what made this movie so funny i mean come on a shark's head on a human body can it get any funnier good job sci fi keep the comedy movies coming i never thought movies could get anymore retarded if they keep it up they will have to rename the sci fie channel the comedy sci fi channel or something like that br br i cant wait 4 the next blockbuster movie from sci fi br br ill be ready with a bowl of popcorn and a case of beer or a bottle of liquor and ill be ready to laugh it up again
<START> alone in the dark is uwe boll's kick in the nuts to hollywood after house of the dead's punch in the face br br if anything it proves just how much of a master manipulator boll is after forcing artisan out of business over the flop that was house of the dead one can only assume the normally credible lion's gate films only released aitd under contractual obligation after acquiring artisan's assets because aitd is an even bigger example of complete lack of coherent film making ability plot exposition and just plain stealing poorly from other movies because it was supposed to look cool instead of because it fitted within the movie's framework br br but then that's the point isn't it boll isn't trying to make a coherent film because he isn't trying to direct alone in the dark he's just trying to manipulate hollywood br br alone in the dark like house of the dead dungeon siege far cry bloodrayne and the other 3 or 4 projects that are announced or in pre production br br these aren't movies to be directed but investment portfolios every single one of them rushed into production under the pretence that the tax law boll and his investors are exploiting may be closed within the next 2 to 3 years the more bomb projects he can release within that time frame the more money he and his investors can gain why bother making a good movie when a bad movie's making you a mint anyway the result is movies like the awfulness of alone in the dark br br alone in the dark like all his other movies are just a cynical exploitation of hollywood's current trend for lazy film making br br and to those who support boll by calling him misunderstood or the next ed wood congratulations by making a cult figure out of the man you're just making it easier for him to get investors but giving him notoriety br br for more information read here http www cinemablend com feature php id 209 http www cinemablend com forum showthread php s threadid 21699 as an aside just don't ask me how he's getting his cast lists together unless the actors are in on the investment scam somehow that mystery has still to be uncovered
<START> japanese animators have a unique freedom with animation which is why they tend to be able to come out with movies like these movies that ultimately end up on anime fans hard drives and college student's floors but get completely ignored by pretty much anybody outside of its country of origin cat soup is one of those films that from western eyes is supposed to be experienced on drugs or deeply analyzed really it's just a beautifully detailed surrealist journey br br there's no real dialog which makes it easy to pass on to other interested parties uninterested in things like subtitles a cat and his half dead brain dead sister travel through various landscapes of imagination and association there's a general theme of water or lack thereof possibly because of the cat drowning at the beginning possibly because of the title there's an interesting sort of genesis take there's a pig that gets to eat itself an elephant made of water and it's gorgeous compelling exciting and fun provided you don't watch it around druggies who cannot experience anything visually unique without comparing it to an acid trip eventually the movie turns itself off adding another compelling self reflexive level to the proceedings br br polarisdib
<START> the luzhin defence is in the foreground a story of an idiosyncratic chess savant turturro who becomes consumed by the game and in the background via flashbacks his boyhood life and the forces which created the man he has become factor in good and evil in the forms of his his love interest watson and former mentor wilson respectively and you have a plaintive drama laced with poignant and delicately humorous moments mingled with the rich scenic beauty of italy's lake como and the intensity of high chess play an excellent film for those into period dramas the auteur's euphemistic chess play metaphor for orgasmic delight is an indication of the subtle wit behind the film
<START> in 1942 a film tales of manhattan told a set of stories that were basically unrelated but tied together with a suit of men's evening wear each story began when the tails were passed from one owner charles boyer for instance to another ceasar romero winchester '73 a superior film and a great western has a similar plot twist initially it is about how jimmy stewart is seeking stephen horace macmahon for some deadly grudge but in the course of the film the two men get into a shooting contest the prize given by marshall wyatt earp will geer being one of the new winchester rifles stewart barely beats out macmahon but the gun is stolen from stewart and the chase is on br br the gun passes from hand to hand including john mcintyre as an arrogant trader who fatally does not know when to stop being arrogant to rock hudson in a surprising role and a brief one at that to charles drake to dan duryea as the delightfully deadly and psychotic waco johnny dean to macmahon eventually it does return to stewart br br the film is expertly directed by anthony mann every character has a wide variety of experiences duryea gets the rifle literally over drake's dead body duryea forces the issue but he loses it to macmahon who is faster on the draw not that duryea is stupid enough to fight for the rifle as he and shelley winter look at macmahon in the distance winter who watched duryea kill her former boy friend drake drops her distaste for the gunman momentarily to ask why he put up with macmahon's bullying for the gun philosophically duryea explains he can wait some opportunity will come up later on i e when he can safely kill macmahon and get back the rifle br br the characters are remarkably human winters first appears as the future bride of drake but she sees a really big negative side to him an unforgivable side drake is aware of this lapse and it helps lead to his destruction other characters have realistic touches such as j c flippen as an army sergeant who fights an indian attack with steward and steward's friend millard mitchell oh yes and with flippen's fellow soldier tony curtis flippen makes one believe this soldier has been on a hundred battlefields before since 1861 probably steward had showed emotions in other films in it's a wonderful life he showed a degree of anger at times and also a near nervous breakdown when he thinks everything is wrong with his life but here he showed a demonic anger at the expense of a surprised duryea who normally would show such anger himself br br the parts of this film fit very neatly together under mann's competent hands this is one western that never wears out as the audience watches the travels of a winchester rifle
<START> the interesting aspect of the apprentice is it demonstrates that the traditional job interview and resume do not necessarily predict teamwork skills task dedication and job performance and they certainly don't reveal any hidden agendas in other words a good indicator of potential may be to see a job applicant in action which is the point of the apprentice people vying for a corporate position may hand over a sugar coated resume and put on their best personality attire for the interview but these are not necessarily the best indicator of strengths weaknesses and performance br br briefly the apprentice involves 16 job candidates competing for the ultimate career opportunity a position in real estate magnate donald trump's investment company the apprentice refers to the winner who will win a salaried position learn the art of high stakes deal making from the master himself and presumably gain prime corporate connections the position is a dream come true for those wanting to make more money than the gnp of some foreign countries to entice the candidates trump shows off his private jet his private luxury apartments replete with statues and artwork his limos his connections to celebrities and other aspects of the life of a billionaire magnate br br the road to success is not easy the group is divided into two teams that compete against each other each has a corporate sounding name such as versacorps and protÃ©gÃ© corporation the teams are assigned tasks that entail an entrepreneurial venture such as creating advertising selling merchandise or negotiating teams select a project manager who provides the leadership and organizational skills to complete the task if they win the manager receives a lot of credit particularly in the eyes of the final arbiter if they lose the manager may also become the scape goat some of the tasks are monumentally difficult with only a day or two to complete tasks may involve creating a tv commercial or print ad others may involve selling at a retail outlet or on the street br br the tasks bring out the best and worst in the participants they often show immediately who is the most reliable who is the most trustworthy and who is hard working and the tasks also expose who is not a good team player who is inefficient and who seems only out for themselves the tasks invariably reveal in unexpected ways the strengths and weaknesses of the participants and in particular the project manager how well the manager communicates with the team delegates work organizes time and sets specific goals will largely determine the outcome but it does not necessarily predict the winner br br the single most telling aspect of someone's potential is when he or she is assigned as a project manager their real abilities as opposed to their self propagated abilities immediately show through the veneer that cannot be hidden by a 100 silk tie or a beautiful makeover leadership qualities and or weaknesses often become agonizingly obvious after only a few minutes those promoting themselves as top notch leaders are not always as strong when put into a real life leadership situation it is always easier to toot your own horn than to actually engage in leadership project managers even those on the winning teams often do not formulate a cohesive strategy they often believe that by diving off the deep end to complete the task at the first minute rather than taking a little time to organize and discuss how the task will be completed is more efficient more often than not members of an ill strategized team are running around like headless chickens figuring it out as they go along and in the long run they end up wasting far more time br br the winning team gets a taste of the high life such as eating dinner at an exclusive restaurant flying in a private jet and or meeting a celebrity the losing team comes to the dreaded board room where trump hears the lame excuses of the members and knocks off one or more of the contestants like pieces off a chess board with the now infamous you're fired often the project manager is held partially responsible for the team's loss and may be the target of trump's accusatory rhetoric every week at least one person becomes a casualty from the losing team br br my least favorite aspect of the apprentice is the board room while the tasks themselves bring out the strengths and weaknesses in the candidates the board room often brings out the worst unfortunately the rules of the game insist there is one winning team and one losing team even if the competition was close members of the losing team start accusing each other often ruthlessly about who was at fault and sometimes more than one person gets fired i seldom see an under performing candidate take responsibility for their actions in the board room kristi frank and kwame jackson were possibly the only candidates who took full responsibility for her team's losses and received no recognition for this selfless act for me kristi frank and kwame jackson had the most integrity of all the candidates however trump saw kristi as weak and fired her claiming she wasn't standing up for herself which may mean he values ego more than integrity no one should sacrifice their integrity for this kristi frank may not have become the apprentice but she can live with herself knowing she did not blame others unjustly isn't that worth as much as winning br br the strength of the apprentice is also its weakness because team performance is evaluated strictly by winners and losers other evaluation opportunities are overlooked barring huge gaps between the winning and losing teams sometimes a losing team exemplifies a high standard of teamwork and efficiency i have seen losing teams sometimes appearing better organized than the winning team we americans are so often obsessed with winning and losing that we often overlook excellence
<START> there is a story but more essentially the world of this film begins in chaos and comes to order over the course of ten minutes br br it is a celebration of life and an optimistic assertion of objective truth and good representing along an axis unexplored in previous cinema this film should be taught in every high school br br chiasmus
<START> when i bought my toy story tape when it came out to video after being released in theaters i saw a trailer for this that said from the creators of toy story as soon as i saw that i knew this was gonna be a good feature i was right a bug's life like toy story is great story great characters and great animation my favorite characters are dim the rhino beetle voiced by brad garrett and hemlich the caterpillar voiced by the late pixar storyman joe ranft my favorite scene is when slim the walking stick david hyde pierce lifts up hemlich trying to distract the bird and hemlich's like you hoo mr early bird how about a nice tasting worm on a stick and slim's like i'm going to snap i'm going to snap i just died laughing at that scene being a big fan of insects i think a bug's life is my favorite pixar even though i know a lot of people consider it the worst pixar film ever i don't know how you could hate a pixar film i think they're all pretty good films good job pixar
<START> so i had low expectations for this movie to start with but it failed to meet even those while there were some funny parts even one or two laugh out loud parts this movie fell terribly short of what i would call good the funniest jokes were unexpected and over very quickly leaving us sitting there going wtf just happened in addition there were a few jokes that just dragged on and on and on the part where he falls down the mountain had me yawning also the editing was really lacking there were some poor scene transitions but that seems to be the style nowadays it made me laugh but i wouldn't watch it again and i'm very glad i waited for it to rent give it a chance you might enjoy it but don't think you are in for anything along the lines of the 40 year old virgin or superbad
<START> i entered the theater to sky captain in 2004 expecting a good film nearly every review of this movie had been positive the effects looked enticing the previews convincing br br needless to say disappointment actually doesn't describe the feeling i got from this film it was rage br br beyond being boring and poorly written the reason this film gets a 2 out of 10 stars is because everything in the film was stolen from another source i understand the difference between an homage and stealing this was stealing more importantly it seems that the filmmakers didn't steal to progress a point or move the plot along they stole just to show that they could there is literally no point to showing a clip of the wizard of oz in a theater at the beginning of the movie except to set up another scene that i won't elaborate on which steals from the same film needless to say every concept in the film was neither original nor even a spin on an old concept it was literally just a rehash of something i had already seen from pulp era robots reminiscent of the old superman cartoons and the recent film the iron giant to the silent martial artist minion of the villain that has been used in countless films most recognizable in recent years as darth maul in star wars the phantom menace br br on the subject of the actual film most of the performances were completely wooden perhaps this is because the entire movie was done on a blue screen with computer imagery filling in everything save the actors frankly this is no excuse for poor acting if a person was ever a child they understand that a lack of visual reference is no excuse for not trying br br finally there is no humanity in this film the protagonists are the only real human beings here nearly all the antagonists are robots and the number of friendly characters that are shown during the film can be counted on one hand if robots are attacking the entire planet shouldn't we expect to see masses of humanity running from them the sub par performance of the main characters prevents us from connecting to really anything here br br the film wasn't the worst movie out there which is why i didn't give it a 1 rather the film was an example of all that is wrong with modern action films the filmmakers tried to justify the movie with special effects but without artistic vision or originality of any kind it falls flat
<START> when tradition dictates that an artist must pass his great skills and magic on to an heir the aging and very proud street performer known to all as the king of masks becomes desperate for a young man apprentice to adopt and cultivate br br his warmth and humanity tho find him paying a few dollars for a little person displaced by china's devastating natural disasters in this case massive flooding in the 1930's br br he takes his new 7 year old companion onto his straw houseboat to live with his prized and beautiful monkey general only to discover that the he child is a she child br br his life is instantly transformed as the love he feels for this little slave girl becomes entwined in the stupifying tradition that requires him to pass his art on only to a young man br br there are many stories inside this one many people are touched and the culture of china opens itself for our western eye to observe thousands of years of heritage boil down into a teacup of drama and few will leave this dvd behind with a dry eye br br the technical transfer itself is not that great as i found the sound levels all over the meter and could actually see the video transfer lines in several parts of the movie highly recommended 9 10 stars
<START> waste of my life the director should be embarrassed why people feel they need to make worthless movies will never make sense to me when she died at the end it made me laugh i had to change the channel many times throughout the film because i was getting embarrassed watching such poor acting hopefully the guy who played heath never gets work again on top of that i hope the director never gets to make another film and has his paycheck taken back for this crap 02 out of 10
