<START> i'll start with what i liked br br i really liked the songs everything about them was great the costumes music lyrics as long as the translation was good choreography everything br br i loved the crab scene and the cooking scene br br but that's about it br br i get it arty cinema blablabla but too much is too much too much silence it was interesting for an hour but two hours of hearing steps and moaning from time to time really too much boredom no movie should ever be boring no matter how deep it was to be too much porn like scenes i do get it really i get that they were filming a porn movie there but really really really that is too much i truly think that cinema should be for watching and this one is definitely not watchable in no way br br 3 stars for the songs
<START> my take on this at our local festival where people would see me so often they thought me a better source than i may actually have been began with a head shake well i can't summarize the plot but it's a really superb character study of an extremely scary man then slight embarrassment i ran into someone who actually knew what had gone down that is from whom trebor unwittingly gets his new heart it'd been my last film in a long long day halfway through the festival maybe i'd dozed the better a film is the more likely it triggers daydreams that send me really dreaming don't know did know there was an o'henry twist achingly just beyond my ken as things finished and knew it had to do with the heart hence the quietly hilarious talent search my plot loss remark had more to do with intricacies of trebor's connections in france his relation to the dog woman and so on stuff i'd been wide awake for denis barely glances at details that might have anchored another director's treatment br br but i write these things too often from memory especially festival films films whose dvd i don't have at hand le lait de la tendresse humaine is one of many examples and plot kinks fade much more quickly than broader impressions still or already l'inrus in my memory is beyond all else a character study of a sort of dark side superman a super fiend not ensconced in genre or historical trappings but active and plausible relatively soft spoken driven but patient right among us the scar once he attains it makes him just visually i mean in image a sort of hybrid frankenstein monster mad doctor and creation all in one the actual doctors are his tools if he doesn't extract and install the heart himself it's only because it's not possible he's the force always the parasite consuming everyone he touches and finally himself what else is he to suggest that he's us the first world versus the third seems too simple since he feeds no less on his fellow first worlders on all of us br br denis's camera's eye when it looks at things i know goes usually where mine would so i tend to trust her when she looks at things i don't know snow trekking too fast bicycling and forest darkness i've known in small ways but the south seas not at all so i made better entry into l'intrus both france and the crystalline isles of its finish than into beau travail l'intrus is for me a very comfortable discomforting film it's a sequence of places portrayed familiarly with a intimacy that allows us to know them whether we've seen the reality or not a single image trebor cycling his massive weight on the thin racing frame the sounds of violated air and shrieking tires the asphalt ribbon the dark in bright sun evergreens cued me that the film would be linear a road trip a single will driven thrust br br despite trebor's personal power he's a human failure no matter who he's with he's alone though apparently he hasn't always been his body aborts life twice first to need the new heart then despite it l'intrus is tragedy trebor is hubris br br i'm navigating perilously the thread of what i remember let's leave it at that
<START> alan curtis has a loud violent sounding argument with his wife slams out of his apartment has a night of drinking with a mysterious lady with a large hat in a bar run by andrew tombes in a nice villainous part for a change and returns to find his wife dead and the police led by thomas gomez waiting for him his attempts to prove his alibi that he was with that mysterious lady fall because everyone that he can think of tombes elisha cook claims there was never any such person he ends up with no alibi although his secretary who secretly loves him ellen raines believes him convicted after a trial he is awaiting his death sentence raines starts going out after the truth discovering that gomez has some doubts of his own she also finds an ally in a friend of curtis franchot tone who was apparently out of town the night of the crime will she clear curtis in time the phantom lady is based on a novel by william irish the great noir writer cornell woolrich as movie fans know from other works by woolrich leopard man the night has a thousand eyes rear window no man of her own one cannot assume what is true on the surface anywhere the missing wife of a salesman may not actually be upstate sending him messages that she arrived if he still has her jewelry the mentalist may really be able to predict tragedy or was he plotting the murder of his old partner now an oil millionaire did a leopard kill the young women or is the wealthy recluse in town actually hiding some guilty knowledge is the young woman claiming to be the wife of a brother killed in a train wreck actually an impostor here it is raines and gomez with an assist by tone trying to prove curtis did see a woman nobody will admit seeing and if he did see her why is nobody else able to recall seeing her the problem with the story really is curtis's personality he gives in too easily when found guilty of the crime he did not commit in reality anyone who is innocent would be screaming it to the moment they are executed however in defense of curtis's collapse it also happens to other people in various films gary cooper in mr deeds goes to town gets so disgusted about the framing he gets as delusional and mad by douglas dumbrille and his minions that he does not defend himself at first until the people who would depend on his help cry out their fears in the courtroom and reawaken his sense of responsibility but curtis just seems to give up in normal circumstances raines gomez and everyone else would not care if curtis didn't br br but the film survives this weakness the slow unraveling of lies by witnesses bribed by the real killer allows two set pieces for raines with tombes on a deserted elevated platform and elisha cook at a jazz session gomez turns out to be more perceptive than the villain expects in double checking his alibi again and the villain manages to keep slightly ahead of raines and gomez until the concluding minutes of the film if it is not as great a film as double indemnity or the postman always rings twice or the maltese falcon it holds up pretty well until the moment curtis and raines are reunited at the end
<START> i notice from the comments that most of the people discussing this movie are basing their remarks on the mst3k airing that's fair enough that is after all how it got its widest exposure but having had the misfortune of seeing final justice in its original form i'd just like to share a few thoughts and comments on the uncut version br br first off it must be admitted that the original version is slightly more coherent than the mst3k broadcast owing primarily to an expository scene between rossano brazzi and venantino venantini i could use the characters' names instead of the actors' but i just love typing the words venantino venantini explaining why venantini's fugitive character can't just leave malta right away it's not a very convincing plot point but at least the filmmakers tried to cover it whether this scene was cut just for time or because it didn't provide much fodder for riffs i don't know br br another plot point missing in the original the stripper's betrayal of venantino venantini to joe don baker seemingly unmotivated in the mst3k version is explained by an earlier extremely unpleasant scene in which venantini rapes her in the shower while this does give her a motive for turning against him the whole scenario is just really icky there's no other word for it br br some of the mst worthy moments the perpetual truncated shouts of son of a and the deja vu shooting of the sheriff were purely the result of the edited for tv print they worked with and were absent from the original movie br br one scene i wish had made it into the mst3k version before entering the bar to question some people joe don asks the maltese policewoman accompanying him to stay outside because they see that uniform they won't cooperate however joe don himself is wearing his ridiculous cowboy slash sheriff outfit complete with shiny badge i can't imagine why they passed on that great opportunity to make fun of him br br one final observation on the original uncut version of final justice why oh why did they feel the need to put venantino venantini's naked butt up on the screen
<START> this is a movie that plays to everyone's emotions we all want a second chance at things jim morris got one followed his heart and got a chance to live his dream what a great message and what a great delivery by this movie
<START> my name is heather and i am the girl whose story this movie was based on i want to thank all of you who saw this movie and enjoyed it as crude and harsh as some of the things that were depicted in this movie were it didn't really even come close to describing how bad things actually were not to mention the affect everything had on my mother and little sister thanks once again for the great comments that everyone had i truly appreciate them br br hi everyone br br this is heather's mom it's hard to believe that so many years have gone by since this movie was made harder even to believe that people were still watching it a year ago for any of you out there who have gone thru the same or similar kind of situation please know that there are people out here in cyberspace that do understand completely how you feel our thoughts and prayers are with each and every one of you
<START> what begins as a fairly clever farce about a somewhat shady security monitoring company turns almost instantaneously into an uninteresting and completely inane murder mystery david arquette and the great stanley tucci try mightily to make this train wreck watchable but some things are just not humanly possible br br what for instance causes gale to turn suddenly from a sweet motherly figure into a drunken shrew at tommy's parents house why would heinrich although admittedly a sleezebag want to destroy the business to which he devotes his life by robbing and possibly murdering his customers why does the seemingly sensible tommy believe that heinrich could be a murderer based almost entirely on a dream and even if that were believable why wouldn't he go to the police and why didn't gale activate the alarm when she got home especially after scolding howie about it being off of course all of these events are necessary for the plot and i use the term very very loosely to unfold and it might be forgivable if it resulted in even the slightest bit of comedy but everything from howie's description of his date rape to the coroner's misidentification of gale to the final joke about gale and howie still being dead is more tasteless and pathetic than anything else br br i checked the box indicating that my comments contained spoilers but there's nothing more i or anyone else could do to spoil this thing that already stinks to high heaven
<START> i first saw this movie in my plays playwrights course at tulane i was awed at how beautiful and raw this documentary was it is a sincere look into the unedited reality of a life of solitude the family is fascinating and i thought it really showed little edie at her core as a side note my professor even told me that throughout the filming little edie became infatuated with one of the camera men the beauty i find comes from the naturalness of the family's dysfunction it is evident in the relationship between mother and daughter that neither could function in society alone and you begin to wish for little edie's rehabilitation to society in all the film is gripping in its aesthetic quality and it's portrayal of surprising beauty two thumbs way up
<START> the problem is the role of the characters in the film man to man shows a british anthropologist kidnapping two pygmies and taking them to scotland and then realising that they are not animals or subhumans but actually equal to himself the problem is the role of the pygmies in the film two people who are kidnapped treated like animals and yet given such a shallow stereotypical role within the film the kidnapper british anthropologist ends up being the hero of the film because he 'manages' to relate to the pygmies no notion of how the two hostages feel of their point of view of their ordeal i find it is a shallow film with a one sided fundamentally racist view it never manages to move away from the 'white mans' view
<START> i was not nearly as smitten with this as many other reviewers sure it has a pair of lovely girls playing erotic lesbian vampires marianne morris and anulka d play these two lovely sirens with razor teeth that run up to cars on a road out of the way hitch to their home at dusk and invite their prey sex starved men to their boudoir what happens there well after they disrobe and kiss each other mostly they kill their visitors director jose ramon larraz does have some flashes of brilliance with his camera some scenes are quite eerie and effectively shot but sex alone does not hold a film up no pun intended at least consciously there really isn't much of a story here we have the two girls we are shown some inexplicable and unexplained beginning where we see them shot with pistol why what does it mean why do we have the guy that stays for several days greet a guy at the hotel that insists he knows him from years ago does that have a purpose of course i have even more general questions like what is a couple of nice looking girls doing as vampires in the english countryside and having a wine cellar filled with wine from the carpathians anyway the script is riddled with such flaws it is also very sparse on the action outside of catch victims wine and dine them quite literally and then go to bed in the crypt the end gets going with some juicier scenes but it is anti climatic there are as i said some effective scenes by the director i particularly liked the way the girls dressed and were filmed in the woods looking for their prey the house is also a most impressive set and both girls are as i said very lovely marianne morris in particular stands out in more ways than one for you older film fans silent screen veteran bessie love has a brief cameo at film's end
<START> wow only a movie this ludicrously awful could inspire the similar showgirls i mean where to begin the indescibably horrid theme song pia zadora's non expressions throughout the movie the fact that despite being set in los angeles aka land of the casting couch every single man and woman is fawning all over themselves to sleep with pia zadora by any contrived means necessary or what about the fact that every person in the movie is totally unsympathetic because they're either mind numbingly stupid pia or obvious despicable sleazeball everyone else and given that this flick was written by actual screenwriters sorta it shows a shocking lack of understanding of the movie making industry who the hell would admire and kiss up to a screenwriter br br but it's unintentionally funny as hell though the breakdown scene alone will have you giggling and after seeing the climatic i'm not the only one who had to her way to the top scene at the awards all done in the usual bargain basement acting level we expect from such quality thespians as pia i sincerely hope that our dear pia actually reused that speech when she won her golden globe it's fitting and that would totally make my day br br anyway if you're a fan of bad tashy camp give this otherwise tacky movie a try
<START> i saw this film when it first came out in 1978 when i was a sophomore in high school i took a date to see it i didn't get any needless to say because the film was so bad joan rivers' career never tanked as badly as it deserved after making this awful unfunny crap in fact unfunny isn't a severe enough term this film is anti funny you walk out feeling like any laughter that might have occurred was beaten out of you before it could happen this isn't worth watching out of curiosity or out of any sense of it being so bad it's good not even the gang at mst3k could've made this worth watching the fact that billy crystal's career survived this early suicide attempt is a miracle
<START> michael jackson is not very popular in usa anymore however in europe especially germany he has still got lots of fans many will say that this is a bad movie and it is it has no plot it's full of cliches michael praises himself constantly br br but you can't expect a plot or non cliches in this kind of movie it has entertaining visual effects and the music is perfect the smooth criminal fragment the greatest song ever full of moonwalks group dance acts and even the famous michael jackson's bench over makes this film one of jackson's masterpieces with an even good looking and white michael jackson br br a must for jackson fans a must for music fans a must for dance act fans br br however as i'm an mj fan i should warn all michael jackson haters out there don't watch this movie you'd only make your hate increase
<START> lame plot and two dimensional script made characters look like cardboard cut outs needless to say this made it difficult to feel empathy for any of the characters especially the fiancÃ© he looked and acted more like a cartoon in summary i guess you could say it was on par with your typical made for tv drama it uses just about every clichÃ© in the book the tortured classical musician who wants to break out and play salsa the free spirited fiancÃ©e engaged to a bean counter personality she doesn't love i won't list them or else it would be a spoiler because i'd be giving away the whole plot the dancing was ok but nothing special i've seen worse 3 stars for good music the band was really tight i saw it on youtube thankfully i didn't pay good money to see it at a theater i'm still a little shocked at how many great reviews this movie has garnished
<START> i missed almost all of the first season but when the other shows went to reruns i started watching i ended up buying the entire first season off itunes this is now one of my favorite comedy shows patrick warburton is the key his dry sense of humor has me rolling all the time david spade is funny but sometimes a little russell goes a long way i enjoy the other cast members more but not saying he doesn't add to the show br br do yourself a favor if you haven't checked this one out give it a try if you can catch the episode where jeff goes to the sperm bank you will see how good this show is br br i hope this series has a long run
<START> one wonders how the script came to be written br br wayne and the other performers do an ok job but as it is neither comedy romantic thriller or anything else it is all rather disappointing br br one feels as if one of the threads had been pursued it could have been something worthwhile it is nonetheless interesting to see a real turkey of a story made just before the usa became directly involved with the war i wonder if the surrounding politics had something to do with trying to make a movie for all tastes but ending up with something that pleases no one br br nonetheless it has historical value
<START> the long list of big names in this flick including the ubiquitous john mills didn't bowl me over to the extent that i couldn't judge the film on its actual merits it is full of stereotypes caricatures and standard set scenes from the humble air ace hero to the loud mouthed yank flyer the music track was such that at one point about an hour before the end i thought the film was over loud rising crescendo grand flourish and finish then silence but then the movie continued i found no real storyline haphazard writing but smartly pressed uniforms and the pretty jean simmons pre nose job with a rousing little ditty i cannot say that this picture has any of the ingredients which make a film great i found it maudlin mawkish and minor
<START> aka blood castle or scream of the demon br br spoiler br br this was a drive in feature co billed with the velvet vampire a spanish italian co production where a series of women in a village are being murdered around the same time a local count named yanos dalmar is seen on horseback riding off with his 'man eating' dog behind him br br the townsfolk already suspect he is the one behind it all and want his castle burned down the murders first began around the time count yanos' older brother count igor dalmar was horribly burned and killed in a lab accident br br then a woman ivanna erna schuer that igor hired before his death to assist him in his experiments shows up yanos agrees to hire her in place of his brother and together they seek the formulae for the regeneration of dead cells yanos wants to bring igor's charred corpse back to life br br but of course igor is still alive although horribly burned and stalking and killing the women in the village we see his char broiled face appear at various points in the film so we know he's still alive making the whole thing seem a little bit too obvious br br igor meets another fiery end when he gets into a fight with yanos over ivanna with the burning candles falling on to the same bed that igor stumbles on to meeting yet another final char broiled end br br the retromedia dvd is taken from a vhs source and looks quite grainy and bad other than an even scratchier trailer no other extras are included although it has a nice creepy spanish castle and good atmospherics i found it to be fairly boring and predictable with no excitement or mystery whatsoever br br 3 out of 10
<START> this movie was recently released on dvd in the us and i finally got the chance to see this hard to find gem it even came with original theatrical previews of other italian horror classics like spasmo and beyond the darkness unfortunately the previews were the best thing about this movie br br zombi 3 in a bizarre way is actually linked to the infamous lucio fulci zombie franchise which began in 1979 similarly compared to zombie zombi 3 consists of a threadbare plot and a handful of extremely bad actors that keeps this 'horror' trash barely afloat the gore is nearly non existent unless one is frightened of people running around with green moss on their faces and the english dubbing is a notch below embarrassing br br the plot this time around involves some sort of covert military operation with a bunch of inept scientists ie an idiotic male and his stupid female side kick who are developing some sort of chemical called death one that is supposed to re animate the dead unless my ears need to be checked i don't even recall a reason for the research of death one it seems to exist only to wreak havoc upon the poor souls who made the mistake of choosing to 'star' in this cinematic laugh fest br br anyway death one is experimented on a corpse whom i swear looked like yul brynner and after it is injected into his system he sits upright and his head explodes the sound effects are also quite hilarious as the corpse's face bubbles with green slime the sound of 'paper crumpling' can be heard the death one toxin is transported outside and is 'hi jacked' by a group of thieves where one makes off with it but infects himself after cutting himself on an exposed vial br br needless to say the guy turns into a zombie but not before he makes his timely escape to a cheap motel infects a lowly porter and murders a maid by pushing her face into a bathroom mirror the military catch wind of this and immediately take action before 'eliminating' everyone who is unlucky enough to be within the 'contamination zone' and turn the motel upside down they find the infected thief and burn his body only to have the smoke infect a flock of birds that are flying over the chimney stack br br we cut to the introduction of a group of men who are on leave from the army listening to 'groovy music' that is coming out of a little dinky boom box while trailing a trailer load of slutty girls who are leaning out of the windows and showing off their chests can someone say zombie food we also have a sub plot involving a girl and her boyfriend driving a car who stop to inspect a group of birds lying on the road the same birds that were infected by the 'zombie' smoke br br the birds attack the boyfriend and the girl drives off to a deserted gas station to seek water this is one of the most incredibly hilarious moments of the movie she walks around this old dirty rusty and obviously abandoned building where she continues to ask aloud hello is there anyone here please i just need some water she encounters a group of zombies one of which is chained to a wall and the other is swinging a machete after a bit of rumbling and tumbling around on the ground she escapes but not before blowing up the gas station with her lighter br br meanwhile the birds attack the trailer load of whores and one girl gets pecked and infected they all pull up to the same motel where the original infection took place and this is where the second most hilarious moment of the film takes place after a matter of hours a day at the most the same motel is now caked in dust has vines growing throughout it and looks like it has been sitting derelict for years anyway what better place to take refuge than this particular building needless to say the group begins to break down as several people walk off together to get themselves stuck in an incredibly stupid situation involving a zombie attack br br the third most hilarious moment concerns a man and a woman who explore a deserted village of which the woman comments this place is a dump she then proceeds to get 'pushed' off a balcony by a zombie into pirahna infested water where she has her legs bitten off and turns into a zombie within seconds meanwhile her friend back at the motel who got pecked and infected hours earlier is still turning into a zombie br br unfortunately there are just too many inconsistencies in this movie that makes this movie just too stupid for words for example the time rate concerning infected people being 'zombified' differs greatly sometimes it takes seconds other times it takes hours some zombies run others drag their feet and walk really slow some even do kung fu moves while others hide under stacks of hay to surprise people some of the zombies even talk the funniest moment of course is the infamous 'zombie head in the fridge' gag which 'elevates' itself in mid air and 'attacks' a stupid man who goes looking for food funnily enough his girlfriend gets her throat torn out by it's 'headless' counter part lmao br br the biggest disappointment for me though was the lack of story lines involving the people who are in fact killed by zombies we never get to see them come back as zombies in fact the only ones we do see 'zombified' are the ones pecked by the birds and the one girl who gets her legs bitten off other than that i was at least expecting the couple who were killed in the kitchen and or the guy who was killed on the bridge to come back as zombies it is also amazing that these zombies only take a 'few bites' and then move on to their next victim br br the most laughable moment was of course the zombie fetus a pregnant woman who has been infected lies on a bed in a hospital a woman who seems to have a lot of 'medical knowledge' tries to deliver the baby and has her face pulled off by a zombie before having her head pushed into the woman's stomach where a hand bursts out and proceeds to rip the rest of her face off timeless br br as usual all the characters are perfect stereotypes of this genre the megalomaniacal military officer the pathetic useless squealing women who scream to get killed the obvious characters who are about to get killed ie watch for the man chasing a chicken i guess this movie really is a comedy there were many laughable scenes such as the shed that gets blown up with a hand grenade obviously the scene where the entire budget was spent and a climatic scene where a man screams i'm thirsty thirsty for your blood the costumes are really bad the same zombies reappear throughout the course of the film wearing the same 'asian like' clothing that may be found in a bruce lee film and watch out for the blue 60's skirt the girl at the motel is wearing when she and her boyfriend bump into the infected man br br the end of the film leaves open the door as usual for the apocalyptic story line a radio dj who narrates throughout the whole movie turns out to be a zombie himself and warns his listeners about the 'beginning of the end' while the two survivors take off in a helicopter hardly dawn of the dead material if you ask me br br regardless this movie does deliver many laughs the gore is minimal and what gore there is it is very unconvincing let alone unimaginative the usual mix of black blood thick green goo oozing out of weeping sores and 'zombie make up' consisting of green moss zombi 3 makes for a good rental for a sleep over party or a night of beer and popcorn other than that horror fans should stay away br br 3 out of 10
