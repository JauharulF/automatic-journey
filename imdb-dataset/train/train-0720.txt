<START> sudden impact is a two pronged story harry is targeted by the mob who want to kill him and harry is very glad to return the favour and show them how it's done this little war puts harry on suspension which he doesn't care about but he goes away on a little vacation now the second part of the story someone is killing some punks and harry gets dragged into this situation where he meets jennifer spencer a woman with a secret that the little tourist town wants to keep quiet the police chief is not a subtle man and he warns harry to not get involved or cause any trouble this is harry callahan trouble follows him the mob tracks him to this town and hell opens up as harry goes to war meanwhile the vigilante strikes again and the gang having figured it out is ready for her jennifer spencer is caught and harry comes to her rescue during the film's climax sudden impact is not the greatest dirty harry but at the time it gives us a harry that is very much an anti hero ready to go to war just to pursue justice again not the best not the worst but the one with the most remembered line go ahead make your day
<START> i went to see the omega code with a group of other christians totaling about 15 people we all expected a good piece of christian film making what we got was an excruciatingly painful drawn out and pretty boring attempt at a film it has good looking production values but also has poor acting a weak script with lousy dialogue and no real sense of direction from the first 15 minutes we all knew it would be a long night we all hated it and some people in our group placed this movie as reeking of more cheese than anaconda none of us could believe that the movie lasted less than 2 hours flashy effects and crisp looking cinematography can't save this bad bad movie i'd give it a 3 out of 10 and the rating is only that high because i rented the abominable movie werewolf 1996 the night before i saw this movie
<START> it was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including john ritter ben gazarra and audrey hepburn they looked quite wonderful but that was it they were not given any characters or good lines to work with i neither understood or cared what the characters were doing br br some of the smaller female roles were fine patty henson and colleen camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts they showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films sadly i didn't think dorothy stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role br br the film appears to have some fans and i was very open minded when i started watching it i am a big peter bogdanovich fan and i enjoyed his last movie cat's meow and all his early ones from targets to nickleodeon so it really surprised me that i was barely able to keep awake watching this one br br it is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other five years later bogdanovich's ex girlfriend cybil shepherd had a hit television series called moonlighting stealing the story idea from bogdanovich of course there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines br br bottom line it ain't no paper moon and only a very pale version of what's up doc
<START> bah another tired desultory reworking of an out of copyright work never designed to be filmed br br on the plus side toni collette is superb as always being an actual actress you see and there are some nicely handled handover cuts between scenes there are even a few genuinely funny lines and the filmwork score and editing is competent apart from a bizarre lapse into voiceover and speaking to the camera towards the conclusion br br but ah but much of the cast seems to be on autopilot and they are almost all very clearly too old and in one case too young for their declared ages worse they are all speaking austinese that peculiar falsetto self satisfied sing song that couldn't be further from the way people actually spoke in austen's day think yosemite sam i kid you not this is particularly sad considering that we seem to finally be seeing the demise of the equally farcial fakespearan that olivier and his cronies were so fond of bellowing at the top of their lungs br br and worst of all is gwyneth paltrow she's only ever played one character in her films and she stays true to form here running through her entire range smirking to sulking in the first ten minutes then just repeating herself for the rest of the overlong film there is absolutely no chemistry between herself and any of her admirers nor any apparent reason why they would be interested in her apart br br in short there is very little reason to watch emma it's an amiable enough adaptation but if you're going to pack a film full of anacronisms i e an appalingly thin lead who can't shoot a bow or handle a period accent then you might as well do it properly as with the vastly superior clueless
<START> greenthumb grace is left penniless after her husbands death so she turns to ganja growing in order to pay the bills it sounds promising and the ever reliable brenda blethyn doesn't disappoint but the material is sitcom thin there's actually a scene where grace asks her young gardener to give me one a toke and he thinks she's asking for sex and acts all awkward yes it's humour so twee a nun would be bored saving grace doesn't seem to know what it wants to be the stunning cinematography and stately pace evoke memories of ryan's daughter whilst the light hearted whimsy of the country townsfolk could be lifted from any episode of antiques roadshow it does speed up after the first hour but by then it's too clichÃ©d to care the climax manages to be unpredictable only by introducing the most shameless deux ex machina i've ever seen
<START> normally i would have given this movie a 6 it tackles a very important topic and it does it relatively well despite katie wright which is an accomplishment in and of itself br br i have no idea if she was actually instructed to play the character like this or is naturally irritating but she did an awesome job at making it impossible for me to care for lexi there's no dimension to her other than how confused helpless and clueless she is and how good she is at whimpering i can understand how a young girl who blames herself for the loss of her friend and whose eating disorder has spiraled out of control would be distraught scared and in pain however wright's entire performance is based on incessant wailing and sniveling the rest being whining i couldn't help but feel this particular girl's problem was caused not by the demon that is bulimia but by her not having a backbone i very much doubt that's the point the movie meant to make
<START> having seen charley boorman in long way round with ewan mcgregor i was very interested to see how charley would be in his own show i thought charley came across as a lovely guy who is very grounded and down to earth its nice to see that celebrities struggle with their weight and fitness it just show's their human too i don't know a lot about bikes but this show gripped me right from the start the preparation and organising for this event seems immense the event itself seems very dangerous and i'm fascinated to see why charley and everyone else is doing it and how far he gets i love the pace of the show and the fast upbeat music i can't believe he broke his collar bone i really hope its not the end i cant wait to see the next episode
<START> saw this movie on its release and have treasured it since what a wonderful group of actors i always find the casting one of the most interesting aspects of a film really enjoyed seeing dramatic actress jacqueline bisset in this role and wallace shawn is always a hoot the script is smart sly and tongue in cheek poking fun at almost everything beverley hills loved paul bartel's doctor and ray sharkey's manservant this was raunchy and crude but thank god unless you're a prude i heartily recommend this movie fyi for anyone who likes to play six degrees of kevin bacon mary woronov paul bartel were in rock roll high school mary woronov and robert beltran were in night of the comet together they were all three in eating raoul
<START> think of this pilot as hawaii five o lite it's set in hawaii it's an action adventure crime drama lots of scenes feature boats and palm trees and polyester fabrics and garish shirts it even stars the character actor zulu in a supporting role oh there are some minor differences roy thinnes is supposed to be some front line undercover agent and the supporting cast is much smaller and less interesting but basically the atmosphere is still the same problem is hawaii five o another qm product already existed at the time and had run for years it filled the market demand for hawaii based crime dramas quite adequately code name diamond head may have been intended as the hier to h50 as the older series eventually dwindled away but it comes across as a superfluous 2nd rate copy it doesn't suck but it's completely derivative and doesn't do anything as well as the original br br there is some decent acting talent involved here thinnes is an old pro and he gives the role his best shot and he isn't bad but thinnes is only as good as his material and his director ian mcshane is in here as an evil spy master named tree and mcshane tends to be the most interesting actor in any scene he appears in but he's phoning his part in here frances ngyuen is reasonably exotic looking but her astounding skinniness opaque features thick accent and wooden delivery aren't the stuff of which dreams are made relying on her to supply the 'romantic interest' for thinnes was probably the series' biggest mistake at least for for a series aimed at white audiences brought up with marsha brady and peggy lee as our love goddesses give her another 30 lbs and a year with a dialog voice coach and she might cut it zulu is well his usual self enjoyable in bit parts but he isn't a person who can carry a feature by himself br br in addition the plot and dialog are strictly by the numbers with nothing to distinguish them from any other quinn martin production and by this point the american tv audience had seen a whoooole lot of qm productions i think cn dh was one too many and it sank without a trace it wasn't the really the actors' fault and i hope they walked away from this with a decent paycheck and one more entry on their c v s br br mst3000 revived this for their treatment in their sixth season and they had a lot of good natured fun with it worth seeking out in that version if you enjoy the mst approach to movie japery and lampoon but i can't imagine anyone caring about this pilot for any other reason
<START> this is arguably the worst film i have ever seen and i have quite an appetite for awful and good movies it could just have managed a kind of adolescent humour if it had been consistently tongue in cheek Ã  la rocky horror picture show which was really very funny other movies like plan nine from outer space manage to be funny while apparently trying to be serious as to the acting it looks like they rounded up brain dead teenagers and asked them to ad lib the whole production compared to them tom cruise looks like alec guinness there was one decent interpretation that of the older ghoul busting broad on the motorcycle
<START> first of all let me say the i am lds or rather i am a mormon so when i watched this film i automatically gave it the benefit of the doubt i can usually find something redeeming in every movie i watch and this one was no exception it does have its redeeming moments but they are few and far between br br one of the first things i noticed that bothered me very greatly was that it seemed as though halestorm was ashamed of our church in the lds church congregations are called wards and the basketball court is in the cultural hall never once are either of these two names mentioned the church is never referred to by name and the standards is as far as it goes in mentioning what our church believes br br it makes me wonder if the directors are really lds or lds wannabes this film had so much potential it could have really shown our church in a positive light and helped the public to see not only what we have to offer but also what we believe instead it was only mildly entertaining and left much to be desired if i were not already lds i'd be left thinking mormons are stupid idiotic and ashamed of their beliefs br br it is not a film i will recommend to my nonlds friends br br sorry halestorm you can do better than this
<START> in reflecting on this movie i can think of two others to help put it in perspective one relatively forgettable but covering the same geography is coup de torchon the other thousands of miles away and much larger in scope is the unforgettable indochine claire denis has produced a movie that has some of the grand underpinnings of indochine the complex and unspoken relationship between france and her colonial subjects br br i was struck with the dignity of potee with his struggle to maintain his dignity among his peers and with his white bosses i was also struck with the love hate relationship between him and aimee it is the latter that gives the film its driving force it is the latter that links this movie to indochine br br one never is sure what motivates everyone though some of the characters are required of a remembrance of colonialism it is this cynical side of the story that ties it to coup de torchon theirs is the more scandalous story perhaps even more interesting in a depraved way but denis gives us a remembrance of how it was with all the tension and unresolved relationships br br the american black who gives the grown up france a ride in the beginning and end of the movie offers yet another interesting side to the confusion that we in the western world have when we look at africa he says that when he came he wanted to call everyone brother he was coming home but they just thought him to be a little daft france the character and the girl grew up in cameroon but neither fully understands what it is even though they can remember how it was br br
<START> this movie lost me with the crossbow rpg rocket propelled grenade it was like someone cut and pasted a scene from robocop i half expected beowulf to say exclaim i like it br br i watched this because i like chris bruno from the dead zone tv show and he did his part he chose a strange accent but at least he kept it consistent for the whole movie unlike any of his costars they kept slipping into all kinds of speech from old english to modern english sometimes in the same sentence br br there are already many comments on how this movie is different from the source material however even on its own this movie's plot is not good it's just boring which even the low budget doesn't excuse having a low budget means that you need to at least have a good story dialog and decent acting those things don't cost much instead they spent their money on half assed cgi and some decent costumes and sets br br life is too short to watch this movie
<START> after erasing my thoughts nearly twenty seven times there is a feeling that i can now conquer this review for the complex french drama read my lips having written over five hundred reviews i have never found myself at such a loss of words as i did with director jacques audiard's subtle yet inspirational love story thought was poured over what was loved and hated about this film and while the loves overpowered it was the elements that were hated that sparked further debate within my mind read my lips is a drama to be more precise is a character driven drama which fuses social uncertainty with crime lords with the doldrums of everyday office work here is where this review begins to crumble it is all of these items Â but it is moreÂmuch much more as a viewer you are pulled in instantly by emmanuelle devos' portrayal of this fragile woman named carla whose strength is lost to the males in her office as well as her hearing difficulty audiard introduces us harshly to her world by removing sound from the screen whenever she is not wearing her aid causing an immediate unrest not only from the characters within the film but to those watching without sound the world is left open to any possibility and that is frightening br br as we watch this difficult and unsettling woman setting into her life we are then uprooted and given the opportunity to meet paul played exquisitely by vincent cassel a slicked back hair mustache wearing lanky man who was just released from prison homeless jobless and forced by his parole officer to get a job this is how carla and paul meet there is that moment of instant unsettling attraction the one where we think she loves him but he is dark and here is where it gets even more fun Â and where we think he loves her but she is dark the constant role reversal creates the tone of the unknown who as viewers are we to feel the most sympathy for paul sleeps in the office carla helps him carla looses a contract to a rival co worker paul helps her carla's ability to read people's lips comes in handy for a make shift idea for paul the continual jumps back and forth keep you on your chair waiting for the possibility of some light to shine through this dark cave it never does audiard cannot just allow this story to take place he continually introduces us to more characters one just as seedy as the next even our rock our solid foundation with the parole officer is in question when his wife goes missing Â a subplot to this film that at first angered me but upon further debate was a staple finale for this film yet none of this could have happened if it weren't for our characters devos' solemn and homely look is breathtaking as she changes her image for paul the truth of her beauty is discovered paul the wildcard in the film continues to seemingly use and abuse the friendship for his final endgame then just as we assume one carla takes on one last shape br br audiard knows he has amazing actors capturing his characters cassel and devos could just play cards the entire time and i would still be sitting at the end of my chair the story probably the weakest part of this film is at first random the interwoven stories seem unconnected at first but audiard lets them connect bit by bit again the entire parole officer segment was tangent but that final scene just solidified the ends to the means not attempting to sound vague but this complex yet utterly simple story is difficult to explain there is plenty happening but it is up to you to connect the pieces a favorite scene is when carla is attempting to discover where some money is being held that use of sound and scene was brilliant it was tense it was dramatic and it was like watching a who dun it mystery unfold before your eyes br br overall i initially though this was a mediocre french film that i could easily forget about when it was over Â i was proved wrong read my lips opens the floor for discussion not just with the characters but the situations one will find themselves rooting for carla in one scene and paul in the next when a discovery is made in paul's apartment by carla i found myself deeply angry audiard brought true emotion to the screen with his characters and development and what he was lacking in plot Â the actors were able to carry i can easily suggest this film to anyone but be prepared this isn't a one time viewing film repeat repeat repeat br br grade out of
<START> a trio of buddies sergeants all in the british army carouse brawl their way across imperial india intensely loyal to each other they meet their greatest most deadly challenge when they encounter the resurgence of a hideous cult its demented implacable guru now they must rely on the lowliest servant of the regiment the water carrier gunga din to save scores of the queen's soldiers from certain massacre br br based more on the three musketeers than kipling's classic poem this is a wonderful adventure epic a worthy entry in hollywood's golden year of 1939 filled with suspense humor while keeping the romantic interludes to the barest minimum it grips the interest of the viewer and holds it right up to the sentimental conclusion br br it is practically fruitless to discuss the performance nuances of the three stars cary grant victor mclaglen douglas fairbanks jr as they are really all thirds of a single organism inseparable and to all intents purposes indistinguishable however this diminishes nothing of the great fun in simply watching them have a glorious time br br it's interesting to note parenthetically that mclaglen boasted of a distinguished world war one military career fairbanks would have a sterling record in world war two mostly in clandestine affairs earning himself no fewer than 4 honorary knighthoods after the conflict while grant reportedly worked undercover for british intelligence keeping an eye on hollywood nazi sympathizers br br the real acting laurels here should go to sam jaffe heartbreaking in the title role he infuses the humble man with radiant dignity enormous courage making the last line of kipling's poem ring true he is unforgettable br br montague love is properly stalwart as the regimental major whilst eduardo ciannelli is evil incarnate as the thuggee guru the rest of the cast joan fontaine robert coote lumsden hare are effective but have little to do movie mavens will recognize cecil kellaway in the tiny role of miss fontaine's father br br the film picks its villains well the demonic thuggee cult worshipers of the hideous blood soaked kali hindu goddess of destruction was the bane of indian life for 6 centuries ritualistically strangling up to 30 000 victims a year in 1840 the british military in cooperation with a number of princely states succeeded in ultimately suppressing the religion henceforth it would remain the stuff of novels nightmares
<START> saw it at ucsb's reel loud festival and was shocked that it won the golden reel award i wasn't the only one considering the audience had mixed reactions to the piece i thought there were many other better flicks out there but then i learned that the judges were heavily rooted within the area of film theory and other artsy crap while the cinematography and editing are on par with many other shorts out there the storytelling is nothing more than your average student piece seems as though serious student films need to include one of these categories sex intrapersonal struggle and eventual suicide nick and kate cops out and includes all three please be more original br br oh and it might be my outsider's opinion but the guy from montecito sounds a little fake does anyone else thing so
<START> all of you who despaired looking at the emptiness and weaknesses of disney studios' last productions here comes something that should heal your wounds once and for all a bug's life brings the proof that purely synthetic pictures conducting a good scenario provides more interest than fake hand made old disneys like drawings see the lion king pocahontas and all the latest productions where you sadly regret that bambi's magical background and atmosphere are gone forever br br a bug's life 1001 pattes for my fellow french cinemaniaks succeeds in avoiding all the imperfections that make you awaken in the middle of the movie and say hey this thing is computer generated no weak parts a tremendous effort showing its efficiency in the backgrounds and the general look of the sets an astonishing 3d bird close to perfection in its imitation of reality and that's only to mention the technical aspects br br the scenario my friends the real backbone of a motion picture has some thickness curiously and obviously thanks to lasseter's team there is practically no musical sequence in a bug's life which means the story is long and rich enough to free itself from these 3 or 4 minutes that some kids appreciate but most others dislike same thing for the parents or the anime fans like me this movie reminded me of a really old movie featuring steve martin and chevy chase the 3 amigos it had basically the same background story a whole mexican village living in the fear of a few bad guys hires gunmen who finally turn to be actors to protect them etc simple but efficient and brilliantly adapted to a colony of frightened ants facing the wrath of vicious insects br br since microcosmos many movies tell tales of insects their lives fears and hopes but i do think that a bug's life is the funniest and best directed of all the humanisation process has been perfectly well achieved and the whole audience was captivated by flik's aka tilt in france adventures br br a big thank you for lasseter's team especially for the last 30 seconds it's so strange and great at the same time to see a whole theater caught in laughter while the bugs actors forget their lines or hit the camera br br and finally especially for those of you who have seen the french version other congratulations go to the dubbing actors who made a great synchro work on this movie a bug's life is a really good piece of entertainment and i think it will soon become part of my collection of videos a privilege granted to extremely few movies and that's not a problem of storage room go and see it that's an order
<START> first this deserves about 5 stars due to acting some which would give me a better subjective opinion and not an objective one as it should by giving this one well deserved star but then i know that those facts are used for the actor s names to increase the rating of something like this br br i do have a problem with such productions yet another attempt just like untraceable of a systematic propagandistic feature promoting government intrusion on your rights how interesting that it comes at a moment when ips providers trying to preferentiate censor information and the americans and canadians are fighting against that at this very moments this time is not by labeling torrent file transfers as evil that one was intended to remind you of such feeling whenever you transfer data on the net but by literally attempting in creating a sexual frustrated population as a whole seems like fear promotion is hollywood's norm this days especially when coming to thrillers which is the most on demand motion picture genre for past 2 decades or so most viewed best way to try influence the society as a whole such levels of violence are depicted in this 2 features of morally and ethical people that it gives a new much needed meaning to anti heroes figures make no mistake this is not dexter which was meant to be high quality entertainment stop selling fear please the world would be a better place without it and the dollars made of it br br the opening scene and generally the first 10 minutes really give a frightful picture of an erroll babbage that is clearlly suffering of sexual frustration the way he handles the black male is very disturbing if not outright racist for sure a cliche at least in real life someone would probably get a beating for it you will see what i mean the second scene with claire danes's character present is even more extreme at that point i realized in my opinion that erroll babbage is a very dangerous individual to people around him how many people that have seen or will see this movie have never been hold down regarding both sexes out of self common gratification typically the movie gives an extreme criminal case that unfortunately did is and will likely happen again sometime somewhere but fingers everyone else indirectly as well as you could become that etc anyone that is familiar with sigmund freud and jung will know very well that sexuality is not something to be judged let alone asses by such fanatical hero here safe sex in its many forms is healthy and not some evil that apparently richard gere character is obsessed with on his way for some sexual crusade have we not learned anything from the abundant recent scandals involving priests and young boys or for how long an american teenager can see extreme violence on pg 13 but he can not even see a woman breast until r 18 yet the industry targets them with this very same sexual perversions like american pie series for example raise the kids tester one levels but frustrate them and drive them underground in developing fetishes to unhealthy extremes all sexual activities upon mutual acceptance integrates individuals better then some rightous nut case that blames his misfortunes and shortcomings on the lives of others a new german movie that would work great in comparing this 2 distinct and world apart features on the very same subject here like in that movie you will probably appreciate the actors for well portraying the opposite of what they should have been br br i am very disappointed with richard gere especially after the recent hunting party a feature where he really shines and about a more realistic hero after real facts as well but then it just reminds me that all those people are only actors that get paid to play someone's political and social agenda the flock and untraceable 2 heads of the same hidden beast it just reminds you if know anyone with similar views on the subject as a whole as erroll babbage has those here to stay clear of them for their own safety they would kill my family faster then any 0 00001 chances of paul jerrod in anyone's life would br br in the end i recommend this to anyone thinking negative here about my assesment of this particular movie and untraceable actually so you can likely have similar thoughts as i did nothing sweeter then a propagandistic movie shooting itself in the foot for once i agree with the rating this is not a feature for teenagers or kids simply because at best would confuse them even more then the common belief of money fame fashion and how that relates to sexuality scream series and movies as such at least have a defined entertainment value even if a dumb one in my opinion but this one is just another trust me i know what is good for you deeply not so well done i might add subliminal messages
<START> hollow man is one of the better horror films of the past decade the sub plot is original and the main plot is even better the special effects are brilliant and possibly the best i have ever seen in a horror film kevin bacon proves again that he can handle any role that comes his way br br claude rains shocked the world with the invisible man in 1933 well now kevin bacon has shocked us with hollow man one of the most thrilling horror films ever the action is intense and the chills are true you may actually find yourself jumping if you are watching it in the dark on a stormy night the supporting cast includes elizabeth shue josh brolin kim dickens joey slotnick greg grunberg and mary randle all of whom do an exceptional job br br spoilers br br dr sebastian caine kevin bacon and his team have discovered the secret to making someone invisible after animal testings they move on to human testing but someone has to be the subject volenteering caine is turned invisible but when his team is unable to bring back into visibility caine is driven mad by his condition as he seeks his revenge end spoilers br br the film has created memorable shock sequences and is destined to become a classic well into the next century becoming the basis for a spoof joke in scary movie 2 this film grabs you by the throat and never lets go the first 45 minutes or so are slow developing the characters and showing how their experiments work the second half is exciting and appealing to most action and horror fans think of deep blue sea then change the sharks into an crazy invisible man and then change the water into fire and explosions a rehashing of a killer shark movie interesting hollow man gets 5 5
<START> ain't it hilarious when an average schmo leading a pathetic life suddenly has something outrageously magical happen to him turning his life upside down and causing him to learn a few valuable lessons along the way that formula never gets old does it it's such a sure fire way to make a classic film just look at major hits like liar liar and big this must have been rob schneider's line of thinking when he made semi successful deuce bigalow male gigolo and followed it with the animal since i've already traced the plot through sarcasm allow me to color it in more schneider plays a loser cop who's suddenly involved in a tragic accident but is saved through surgery by a loopy veterinarian who loads him up with animal parts causing him to whinny like a horse at inappropriate times run like a cheetah etc this movie is slightly more likable than other schneider starring flicks such as another lame same plot follow up the hot chick but it almost feels like they want audiences to hate it by casting a reality tv star as the romantic lead colleen haskell from survivor and inserting a cameo by norm macdonald my favorite scene just does not exist sorry nothing memorably good except the production value i just want to end this review by saying that slight references to other movies in a movie can be okay but when it comes to lines being delivered the exact same way you can do it there's a word for that milking actually here's another word cheap
