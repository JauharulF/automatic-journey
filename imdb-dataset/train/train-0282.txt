<START> that certain thing is the story of a gold digger viola dana from a tenement house her mother uses her to take care of her two brothers but they are a loving family although dana's character has the opportunity to marry a streetcar conductor she refuses and holds out for a millionaire everyone makes fun of her for her fantasy but are surprised when one day she really does meet a millionaire son of the owner of the popular abc restaurant chain the two marry hastily but the girl's dreams of wealth are shattered when the rich father disowns his son for marrying a gold digger however she truly loves her new husband and the two are unexpectedly successful at making it on their own br br a rare glimpse of movie star viola dana this film is a lot of fun dana's role is accessible natural and entertaining she displays a knack for comedy as well as an ability to do drama br br the mechanics of the film are a lot of fun too the camera displays sophisticated late silent techniques like mobility the title cards are also incredibly clever br br if you like films like my best girl it or the patsy you will enjoy this film
<START> what a wasted cast br br this is one of the most disappointing films i've seen br br usually roger ebert does not let me down but i feel cheated after seeing this movie br br the only thrill is seeing elizabeth banks in her bra that is a sorry statement about this movie it held so much promise but it was like dry humping a transvestite br br this is self absorbed tripe br br i cannot express deeply enough my bitterness at having sat through this movie and hope i can forewarn you of the same disappointment
<START> this film had no huge stars in it but did have a very good cast filled with excellent supporting actors and gene tierney before she became a big star with george sanders reginald gardner harry carey bruce cabot jospeh calleia and cederic hardwicke you'd expect more from the film than it actually delivered most of this i suspect is because of a second rate script as director henry hathaway was a competent and well established man at the helm br br the film is set in east africa during wwii just before the americans entered the war the brits are trying to control their african colonies while subversive nazi elements are trying to stir up trouble among the locals one of the white men in the film is a double dealer working for the destruction of the british empire but lovely tierney playing a sultan's daughter is out to help save the day for good ol' britain br br american film makers have long sided with the empire and the 1930s and 40s saw a plethora of pro empire films nowadays with changed sensibilities the notion of seeing the happy black natives dying for queen and country seems ridiculous and it would be hard to root for either side still in its day this propaganda piece was effective in drumming up support for the british though when seen today the film suffers from a long winded script and silly casting the one bright moment in the film is the final showdown between george sanders and the enemy agent too bad after such a potent scene the film just seemed to talk and talk losing some of its punch
<START> this film has a rotting core of flexible morality and yet a quirky sense of justice so many of the regular joes among us would love to stick it to the man the man in this case is represented by several different characters mr keller who carla reports to at her office later paul owes 70 large to mr marchand the club owner and then there is paul's parole officer there seems to be so much question about this last character's side story reviewers point it out as a weakness in an otherwise well crafted subterranean game of ping pong between our two protagonists escalating tit for tat until their lives change dramatically they are beholden to each agent of the man one or both could be fired killed or imprisoned if they don't do as they are told br br the film has a sense of relief at the end carla finally gets laid her boss is forced out for being a jerk mr club owner is a pulpy mess in his own bathroom they get the money and they need not worry about reporting in to the parole officer because his moral weakness leads him to stash his wandering wife in the basement or whatever the police found to arrest him it is a critical subconscious trigger to the lock tumbler that wound us up so tight never mind that someone else may get paul's file later to supervise his release for the moment they are free they might even get away with it br br woohoo br br they stuck it to the man
<START> weak start solid middle fantastic finish that's my impression of this film anyway i liked simon pegg in the two films i've seen him in hot fuzz and shaun of the dead his role here though took a completely different turn shows his range as an actor but nonetheless i really disliked th character as he was portrayed at the beginning br br there's a kind of humour i call frustration comedy its supposed jokes and wit are really nothing more than painful and awkward moments much like the bean character rowan atkinmson plays there are a number of other comedic actors who portray similar characters too i don't mean to bash them here so will not br br but do be warned that if you are like me and you dislike smarmy and maddeningly bungling idiots pegg shows just such characteristics for the first third of this film it does get better however br br i read somewhere that this is based on a true story hmmm maybe the film's story stopped being annoying and became kind of a triumph of the little guy in the final third i don't need all films to be sugar and light but coincidentally as this film got better it also started to be more and more of a happy ending br br it was also a pleasure to see an old favourite jeff bridges play a role so masterfully i liked iron man but was saddened by the fact that bridges' character was a villain purely personal taste of course as his acting in that was superb nonetheless he was a marvel here as the bigger than life man of vision the publisher of sharps it was nice to see him in a role that i could actually enjoy br br overall then i liked it i just wish i had come in 40 minutes late and missed the beginning
<START> i'm trying to picture the pitch for dark angel i'm thinking matrix i'm thinking bladerunner i'm thinking that chick that plays faith in angel wearing shiny black leather or some chick just like her leave that one with us only get this we'll do it without any plot dialogue character decent action or budget just some loud bangs and a hot chick in shiny black leather straddling a big throbbing bike fanboys dig loud bangs and hot chicks in shiny black leather straddling big throbbing bikes right br br flashy shallow dreary formulaic passionless tedious dull dumb humourless desultory barely competent live action anime without any action or indeed any life sf just the way joe fanboy likes it in fact
<START> i am so upset that abc is giving up on yet another show that has the chance to be a real winner this show is so good the writing and storyline were great an actual original idea for a show instead of another boring reality show the casting was spectacular not only were the characters and actors right on but these are a very talented set of actors the concept and idea is really a new and cool idea for a tv show many of us share this whole idea of connections i really love the characters of steven laura whitney and damien but to be honest there is not one person connected to this show that i did not like even those that only were in for a few episodes sheri appleby for example the acting and characters are so easy to like and so talented i wish abc had given this show more of a chance and not interrupted the show midway also it was not advertised enough truly unfair to everyone this show showed great promise i for one will let abc know how i feel and will keep sending emails to keep this show alive please join me i know we can do it it worked for jerico by the way where is episode 13 i want that last show please support this show and send emails to abc we can do it this show is well worth it petition online to save six degrees http www petitiononline com gh1215 petition html we can do it sign this petition asap
<START> this has to be the best adaptation i have seen it's my favourite and i think it stays very close to the book what really makes this a must see though is the casting of the two lead actors the wonderful timothy dalton is the best rochester i have seen on screen brooding and tragic while zelah clarke is the perfect combination of strength courage shyness and gentleness as jane the story as i'm sure most people know is this the young and plain jane eyre is a teacher at a charity school for girls in the 1800's who advertises her services as a governess in the newspapers she is offered the post of governess at the big mansion thornfield hall to tutor adele the young ward of the halls mysterious and respected owner mr rochester as the months go on he falls in love with jane and puts into effect a few situations to try and see if jane is as madly in love with him as he is with her however there is a secret still waiting to be discovered at thornfield hall and when it is it's effects are devastating this is a moving and well acted drama with nice locations and gorgeous costumes plus as i said earlier excellent acting especially from zelah and timothy
<START> the incredible melting man plays like an extended episode of the six million dollar man but with violence and some nudity i know this film is a bit crummy but i found it impossible not to kind of like it br br the acting and script are not the best but the effects are good for a 30 year old movie with a budget of 50 the title character takes quite a while to actually melt but when he does it's reasonably impressive we also have one inventive death scene involving electrocution of note too is the music it's insane a cheese tastic medley of nonsense br br notable highlights br br marvel at the slow motion nurse who jumps through a pane of glass for absolutely no reason whatsoever br br be amazed by a day in the life of a severed head br br beware of the psychotic cannibalistic melting humanoid called steve br br be astonished when our hero takes a break from hunting the melting lunatic to have a bowl of soup and complain about insufficient crackers in the kitchen br br this film is just too 70's for me to hate it it's tacky and trashy but i thought it was a lot of fun you could do a lot worse
<START> a friend of mine gave me this movie a friend of mine is now in a hospital were a team of doctors are trying to surgically remove a dvd casing from his br br i got quit excited by the prospects of an other michael chabon movie after all his novels have brought me much entertainment and previous screenplay adaptations were great but boy was i wrong br br first off the people that did the casting must have been asleep whilst doing so i imagine the castings went something like this tell me do you like fish yes i enjoy fish very much wonder full you're hired have some money br br than there is the script i have read chabon who i hope went blind before he could see this piece of dong and it has absolutely nothing to do with his novel i'm not quit sure why it annoyed me like it did but it might have something to do with the fact that listening to a speech impaired 90 year old drunk duck hunter with a right cranial lobe dysfunction would have been a treat in comparison to the one liners these 2nd degree model massacre kids spat out br br this is an actual line from the movie if you tell me something that you've never said out loud to anyone before than this moment becomes unique unique does it does it really off course not you plank please pass me the imodium i'll have a whole ing strip br br the directing is well i've got nothing maybe rawson marshall thurber just got word his grandmother exploded or something stick to directing comedies no stick to directing commercials br br this movie is so horrible it left me banging my head against a wall so hard it brought me back to the stone age i give it 2 stars because i don't wanna be the guy that watched a 1 star movie
<START> eglimata crimes is a story about little crimes everyday people commit that in a crazy scenario could lead to the absolute disaster one of the smartest greek series ever actors like ketty konstadinou and maria kavogianni showed a whole new dimension of themselves and talent and gave us moments of incredible 'guilty' laughing every viewer seemed to recognise the bad side of their self in one of the characters or at least a side of their self they wish they had actors of every age that played bigger and smaller parts gained an equally big space in greek audience's heart my personal favourites apart the first two i mentioned are vassilis haralambopoulos athinodoros prousalis and stavros nikolaidis but so many amazing actors passed by some episodes from time to time whoever around the world understands greek should find a way to watch this series even though it's been more than 5 years that it was on tv in greece they keep repeating the series ant1 in every chance there is like summertime or early afternoon zones we'll never forget eglimata or any of the casting crew
<START> ok the story a simpleminded loony enters a life of bored to death young chick and her kid brother and wreaks havoc in their lives is mildly interesting one anyway ideas are nothing everyone has some the execution is everything br br this is what bothered me with this flick and it did bother me immensely the rhythm directing editing was slow the pace was uneven and the climax expected we have seen those frigging highways five six seven times why norton character's troubles were seen as a childish game not enough deep to understand his problems soul blah and to root for or against him is he a coward a manipulator or just a loony references to the taxi driver were ridiculous and unnecessary and for certain not in favor for this flick or to e n for that matter br br and imho it is cowardly executed at the end cheap emotional tricks for teenage lovers somewhere in mid america this guy should have killed the kid blamed the father create a real havoc or the kid should have killed the father at the end etc but no we have gotten cheesy ending where kids miss the loony the father is puzzled over his own life and relationship with them and the loony of course dies the happy dysfunctional family stays unharmed safe and happily bored again so we could enjoy our pop corns undisturbed br br and that scene where the loony enters the movie oh my god i would have to think long and hard to find something stupider than that you do not shoot such a scene with a hidden camera and hidden crew creators of that movie probably thought that was a good idea but it was more than annoying again if you're a 16 years old girl somewhere in kansas nowhere or whatever where and dream about having sex with a crazy man twice your age ok then you might enjoy this movie and its message
<START> having enjoyed mike myers previous work waynes world and saturday night live my expectations of a 60s bond spoof were fairly high it became plain after the first minute that this was an exercise in how to be as puerile and unfunny as possible i swit ched off after ten minutes i watched it the other day a second time to see whether i had been unfair the first time i switched it off after ten minutes i find it hard to believe how even a twelve year old boy could find this funny the dialogue is an e mbarrassment myers is painful to watch as is heather graham and the succession of characters including fat bastard makes matters even worse apart from the mildly amusing title and the psychedelic set design this is one of the worst films i have ever seen i personally recommend you avoid this like the plague though several friends of mine enjoyed it maybe they were blindfolded at the time Âº
<START> i had no idea of the facts this film presents as i remember this situation i accepted the information presented then in the media a confused happening around a dubious personality mr chavez the film is a revelation of many realities i wonder if something of this caliber has ever been made i supposed the protagonist was mr chavez but everyone coming up on picture br br was important and at the end the reality of that entelechy the people was overwhelming thank you kim bartley and donnacha oÂ´briain br br
<START> i grew up watching the original tv series in the sixties and one thing that i can tell you right away there is no comparison this film was totally ridiculous with a flying suit that was alive a martian that took different shapes special effects that looked like something that a little child would create in contrast in the original characters were developed and the viewers developed a feeling for tim and uncle martin the only highlight in this film yes actually there was one occurred when ray walston finally made an appearance at the end he wore dark glasses and made references to living on this planet for 30 years as a sort of homage to the tv series but even the real uncle martin could not save this turkey
<START> who ever wrote the two or three glowing reviews were either involved in the making of this film term used loosely or bank rolling it and should the latter be the case i would want my seven dollars back the actors again term used loosely are awful in fact almost none of them did anything ever again which is a relief the scenery and everything about this screams we had 7 dollars to work with and a day to do it in was this filmed in someones back yard everything about this project says low budget the actors at best were d list do not waste your time unless of course you want to take it back and try to get the rental back the lead bad guy looks like that punk from the 70s show that ended up marrying his grandmother dummee moore my local blockbuster video store lists this as the movie most returned with sad commentary attached even as a 99 cent rental this flick gathers dust someone really must have owed some favors this is a super stinker and i give it 10 turds
<START> i've received this movie from a cousin in norway and had to convert it from norwegian to american format with a copied video comparing this film 1948 with the heroes of telemark 1965 kampen om tungtvannet the struggle for the heavy water casts the saboteurs themselves playing their respective roles though actors were also cast to play the roles of the saboteurs who have given their lives in norway's struggle for freedom in later campaigns the plot is in four languages norwegian along with french german and english complete with norwegian subtitles br br impressive during this course of history was what led to the struggle french scientists were interested in obtaining some two hundred kilograms of heavy water from norsk hydro in vemork to take back to france in order to do lab studies on its effectiveness simultaneously the nazis too were interested in obtaining heavy water to build a secret weapon the french were worried that the nazis might take an early lead by invading norway and through secret codes their man carefully eluded nazi spies on his trip to oslo where he received the heavy water and making it back without hindrance he was watched by two spies as he boarded an airliner but they did not see him hop out on the other side where he crossed the tarmac to another plane nearby where his cargo was waiting for him this clever trick worked by using the airliner as a decoy that the nazis later forced down in hamburg br br however the invasion of norway on the morning of april 9 1940 the nazis took over norsk hydro and it was up to the norwegian underground and british intelligence in london to take action professor leif trondstad volunteered the services of eleven young norwegians the swallow and gunnerside groups who would successfully sabotage the heavy water production in vemork this was shown in detail on how they actually carried out the operation including the sinking of the ferryboat after the nazis abandoned norsk hydro to take the shipment of heavy water on rail cars to berlin br br the quality of the film was fair though there were many splices in the film i highly recommend this film to anyone interested in world war ii history
<START> altered species starts one friday night in los angeles where dr irwin guy vieg his laboratory assistant walter allen lee haff are burning the midnight oil as they continue to try perfect a revolutionary new drug called 'rejenacyn' as walter tips the latest failed attempt down the sink the pipes leak the florescent green liquid into the basement where escaped lab rats begin to drink it five of walter's friends alicia leah rown in a very fetching outfit including some cool boots that she gets to stomp on a rat with gary richard peterson burke derek hofman frank david bradley chelsea alexandra townsend decide that he has been working too hard needs to get out so they plan to pick him up party the night away back at the lab the cleaner douglas robert broughton has been attacked killed by the now homicidal rats in the basement as walter injects the latest batch of serum in a lab rat which breaks out of it's cage as it grows at an amazing rate walter's friends turn up but he can't leave while the rat is still missing so everyone helps him look for it all six become potential rat food br br also known as rodentz altered species was co edited directed by miles feldman has very little to recommend it the script by producer serge rodnunsky is poor coupled together with the general shoddiness of the production as a whole altered species really is lame for a start the character's are dumb annoying clichÃ©d then there's the unoriginal plot with the mad scientist the monster he has created the isolated location the stranded human cast the obligatory final showdown between hero monster it's all here somewhere altered species moves along at a fair pace which is just about the best thing i can say about it thankfully doesn't last that long it's basically your average run of the mill killer mutant rat film not a particularly good one at that either br br director feldman films like a tv film the whole thing is throughly bland forgettable while some of the special effects attack scenes leave a lot to be desired for a start the cgi rats are awful the attack sequences feature hand held jerky camera movement really quick edits to try hide the fact that all the rats are just passively sitting there at various points in altered species the rat cages need to shake because of the rats movement but you can clearly see all the rats just sitting there as someone shakes the cages off screen the giant rat monster at the end looks pretty poor as it's just a guy in a dodgy suit there are no scares no tension or atmosphere since when did basements contain bright neon lighting there are one or two nice bits of gore here someone has a nice big messy hole where their face used to be there's a severed arm decapitation lots of rat bites someone having their eyeball yanked out a dead mutilated cat br br technically altered species is sub standard throughout it takes place within the confines of one building has cheap looking cgi effects low production values the acting isn't up to much but it isn't too bad a special mention to leah rowan as alicia as she's a bit of a babe makes altered species just that little bit nicer easier to watch br br altered species isn't a particularly good film in fact it's a pretty bad one but i suppose you could do worse not great but it might be worth a watch if your not too demanding have nothing else to do
<START> while the prices have gone up a lot and some of the details have become dated any homeowner who's struggled with problems of homeownership should get a lot of chuckles out of this movie i know i did br br mr blandings a new york ad executive decides to move his family to the connecticut suburbs and build himself a nice house there he gets into one hilarious jam after another from mortgages to lawsuits to construction difficulties as the costs and schedule of the construction keep escalating out of control i thought that the funniest scenes were where blandings hires a contractor to dig a well for water they dig down hundreds of feet but never find water yet only a short distance away a few days later the basement of his house to be floods br br cary grant and myrna loy give believable performances as the harried blandings couple overwhelmed by problems they never imagined and melvyn douglas is even better as blanding's lawyer and family friend br br the only caveat is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948 mrs blandings is portrayed as a bit of a naive dimbulb who has no idea how much additional trouble she's causing and there's a black maid horrors so don't watch this movie through the social lens of 2003 and you'll enjoy it all the more br br
<START> i didn't think it would be possible for joe don baker to make a movie as bad as his stinkbomb 'mitchell' but this one succeeds br br i wouldn't recommend this if you're a fan of joe don baker's much better work but if you like to watch fat guys sweat and really really drawn out gun fights you'll love this movie
