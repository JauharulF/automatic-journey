<START> first some background i am english and have lived in london all my life i have been to many games at 'the den' and most other london club grounds i am familiar with the type of person who gets into hooliganism and i know just how they act and how they speak have to say this is a bad bad movie i can tell you that green street is one of the most unrealistic movies i have ever seen i spent most of the movie cringing with embarrassment i felt i should write a mini review because i felt i needed to point out a few things br br a people just don't talk like that in london in real life the filmmakers took the whole slang thing too far and made it sound stupid unfortunately hooligan types do exist but those you see in green street are more like parodies b the actor who plays pete dunham charlie hunnam unfortunately sounded about as 'english' or 'cockney' as osama bin laden he's from up north in newcastle and i'm just amazed any of the other actors could keep straight face acting alongside him how are we supposed to take him seriously why they didn't just get someone from east london to play that part is beyond me i could have done 'a bang up job' myself hehe c mr frodo i mean how can i be expected to take seriously elijah wood kicking the ass of people twice his size and who are genuinely nasty hooligans he'd be dead simple as that honestly as a brit it was hard to watch this film i'm pretty sure this film will bomb here in the uk it may do a little better in the states because the americans just wont know or care how inaccurate it is br br please my american and foreign friends don't believe a word of this nonsense yes these firms do exist but it's all extremely underground and hush hush and on a vastly smaller scale the movie only gets a 2 from me because they actually filmed some of it in london usually they try to film these things in cardiff wales or something and expect us all not to notice
<START> a must see movie for anyone who ever went to camp or wanted to this film captures the absolute essence of what summer camp is all about it is funny it is compassionate it makes you want to watch more about the characters once the credits begin to role if you have not seen this movie what are you doing get off you butt and run the video store have a great summer

<START> i used to have a fascination with the cartoon back in college when it was being made it had much the charm of get smart while it admittedly had its faults it was rather enjoyable br br naturally i was very interested in seeing the film version that was before i saw it afterwords i wished it had never been made br br besides being miscast all around who on earth though broderick was even close to the role it just didn't make the grade br br the effects were reasonable and perhaps the only thing i liked about the movie seeing a live action version of the gadgets in action what was missing was a story and treatment which made it funny or charming or interesting br br the original was a wacky cartoon with a very lighthearted attitude it was fun the motion picture became murky and took itself far too seriously if it had seriously had a great plot or went crazy enough to make it seem like a cartoon on film it might have been enjoyable br br as it exists it doesn't deserve to be considered part of the gadget legacy
<START> one night i was waiting for my friends to come back to the apt and gymkata happened to be on i watched way too much of it it is indeed hilarious and horrifying really think about it this way if in your job you had an idea for something this bad and went on to execute it in as terrible a fashion as this how long exactly would you last not as long as this movie it's a must see obviously
<START> the title should have been the walker the guy expend 90 of the movie walking he doesn't know what he wants or what he is go through life stealing peoples identity for nothing he gets no benefit no money nothing pretending to be another person br br no body was able to understand why he was pretending to be somebody else br br the only thing that was clear in this movie is that he love his father and was a good son but the rest was crap br br may be director is a looser that would like to be somebody else but what he really should do is to get a real job because after his movie i don't think he has a chance to make as a movie producer
<START> this film along with westfront 1918 are my favorite pabst directed films and i enjoyed them more than his much more famous films which starred louise brooks such as pandora's box it's probably because both are very similar to the neo realist films that the italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s this style film called for using non actors just typical folks in everyday settings in order to create intensely involving and realistic films br br in this case the film is about french and german coal miners so appropriately the people in the roles seem like miners not actors the central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the franco german border instead of one big mine it is divided at the border and german workers are not welcome in the french mine despite there being greater unemployment in germany this language differences illustrated wonderfully in a dance hall scene and wwi conspire to create a huge rift between the factions resulting in a we vs they mentality later an explosion causes a huge collapse in the french and the germans refuse to sit back and do nothing risking their own lives they prove that there is true comradeship between miners and men in general br br the film is a strong criticism of xenophobia and tried in vain to get the german audiences to see the futility of war and hatred it was a gorgeously moving film with some of the scariest and claustrophobic images i have ever seen considering history though the film's impact was minimal at best it's a real shame as like this one westfront 1918 jÃaccuse gance and all quiet on the western front milestone had great messages of peace and harmony but ultimately were failures in positively swaying public opinion so from a historical point of view it's an amazing and sad relic that is well worth seeing
<START> this must me one of the worst takes on vampires ever conceived by men how can one turn such a mesmerizing subject into a totally uninspiring story apparantly not such a difficult task first of all a conditio sine qua non of any vampirefilm is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch this one lacks all these things too much light the spots oh my god why in the name of christ judas was that about br br every time dracula came about he was devoured by light in the script to keep him weak for the record just weak there was only one scene that made it almost worth watching near the ending of the movie beatiful dancingscene with dracula and his new conquest i really enjoyed the first one the judas twist was defintely original but this one's just not good not in any way hopefully the third one will cary the vampire signature i like so much in other classics like herzog's nosferatu coppola's dracula or even interview with the vampire
<START> soldier blue is a movie with pretensions pretensions to be some sort of profound statement on man's inhumanity to man on the white man's exploitation of and brutality towards indigenous peoples a biting unflinching and sardonic commentary on the horrors of vietnam well sorry but it fails miserably to be any of those things what soldier blue actually is is pernicious trite badly made dishonest rubbish br br another reviewer here hit the nail on the head in saying that it appears to be a hybrid of two entirely different movies what it is basically is a lame clichÃ©d poorly acted odd couple romance strauss and bergen overcoming their prejudices about the other's lifestyle and falling in love ah bless bookended by two sickening massacres which wouldn't have been out of place in a lucio fulci splatter flick br br there is no excuse for the repulsive prurient gore drenched climax in which cute little native american children are variously shot sliced dismembered and impaled in loving and graphic close up and large breasted native american women are molested raped and strung up no excuse that is except box office the massacre itself whilst repulsive in its misplaced intention is very badly staged and shot a bunch of actors lying around with bright red paint smeared on them intercut with a few special effects sequences of beheading dismemberment dismemberments incidentally which utilised real amputees in their filming now that's what i call exploitation br br forget all the pap you've heard including the ludicrous commentaries that begin and end the movie about this being a protest an indictment of american brutality towards the native peoples this film doesn't give a stuff about the plight of the cheyenne had it done so it would have featured some involving native american characters would have led us to get to know and to care about the nameless faceless innocents who get slaughtered at the climax instead what we get is the silly white bread romance of bergen and strauss lousy actors both in this at least with plenty of blood guts and severed heads thrown in to attract the curious br br which is a terrible shame because there is a movie to be made about the sand creek massacre about all of the real life massacres the us and britain and all so called civilised nations have participated in over the centuries iraq this just isn't that movie
<START> billy crystal normally brings the crowd to laughter but in this movie he and all the rest of them cannot bring any smile on my face or perhaps just one they call it comedy i say it's a waste of my time
<START> this low budget erotic thriller that has some good points but a lot more bad one the plot revolves around a female lawyer trying to clear her lover who is accused of murdering his wife being a soft core film that entails her going undercover at a strip club and having sex with possible suspects as plots go for this type of genre not to bad the script is okay and the story makes enough sense for someone up at 2 am watching this not to notice too many plot holes but everything else in the film seems cheap the lead actors aren't that bad but pretty much all the supporting ones are unbelievably bad one girl seems like she is drunk and or high the cinematography is badly lit with everything looking grainy and ugly the sound is so terrible that you can barely hear what people are saying the worst thing in this movie is the reason you're watching it the sex the reason people watch these things is for hot sex scenes featuring really hot girls in red shoe diary situations the sex scenes aren't hot they're sleazy shot in that porno style where everything is just a master shot of two people going at it the woman also look like they are refuges from a porn shoot i'm not trying to be rude or mean here but they all have that breast implants and a burned out weathered look even the title deviant obsession sounds like a hardcore flick not that i don't have anything against porn in fact i love it but i want my soft core and my hard core separate what ever happened to actresses like shannon tweed jacqueline lovell shannon whirry and kim dawson women that could act and who would totally arouse you and what happened to b erotic thrillers like body chemistry nighteyes and even stripped to kill sure none of these where masterpieces but at least they felt like movies plus they were pushing the envelope going beyond hollywood's relatively prude stance on sex sexual obsessions and perversions now they just make hard core films without the hard core sex
<START> spoilers when undercover brooklyn north det eddie santos nestor serrano was to meet his drug supplier tito zapatti larry romano in the williamsburg section of brooklyn in a buy and bust operation with tito being the one who gets busted that things went haywire with both det santos and tito ending up getting shot and killed by each other during the deadly shootout an innocent bystander six year old james bone jr jaliyl lynn was also killed in the cross fire br br with new york city slated to host the 1996 democratic presidential convention that summer that last thing that the city's flamboyant mayor pappas al pacino wanted was a possible riot over young james bones tragic death by a possible in was later determined that it was a bullet from tito's gun that killed young james member of the new york city police department br br what was far more shocking then even bone's death is that his killer tito zapatti was given probation by the well respected ny state judge walter stern martin landau when he should have been put behind bars for 10 to 20 years by being arrested with a kilo of cocaine in the backseat of his car it soon became evident that the person who got judge stern his job for a 50 000 00 payoff was non other the brooklyn political boss frank anselmo danny aiello it's anselmo who's involved with mayor pappas in a land deal involving the new york subway system that would bring him and his real estate friends tens of millions of dollars over the next two years it would also indirectly connect mayor pappas in the bone killing by connecting him to judge stern who made it possible for tito be be free who's a mutual friend of both him and his gomba or landsman frank anselmo br br to keep all this from blowing up the late det santons is framed by working undercover without the authority from his superiors in the bone shooting in fact those framing santos go as far and hiding some 40 000 00 in cash in his upstate summer home making it look like he was being paid off by tito's uncle mafia boss paul zapatti anthony francoisa for letting his nephew deal drugs with him getting a piece of the action which may well explain him as well as tito getting shot by tito welshing on his paying santos off br br as things turn out it's mayor pappas' deputy in city hall kevin calhoun john cusack who ends up messing everything up for his boss by being too honest in finding who was responsible in covering up tito's criminal record that allowed him to be out on the streets the facts that kevin uncovered lead straight to frank anselmo a major political supporter of mayor pappas who as it turned out was connected by the hip to tito's mafia chieftain uncle paul br br a bit over plotted city hall does show how big city corruption can filter up as well as down to everyone in city government without them like mayor pappas even knowing about it mayor pappas biggest sin was that he was friends with brooklyn boss anselmo who was putting people into jobs like judge stern who were subjected to being blackmailed from anselmo's real boss mafioso paul zapatti br br spoilers it only took a deadly shootout in williamsburg to set everything into motion not by only tito besides det santos and james bone being killed but why he was allowed to be out on the street in order to bring the very popular new york city mayor down mayor pappas was looking forward to much bigger things like governor or even president in his future political pursuits as it turned out his top deputy kevin calhoun in not looking the other way was responsible for his demise as well as that of the mayor's good friend frank anselmo and the person whom he helped put on the bench as a state judge judge stern who's decision in letting tito zapatti off made this whole disaster which resulted in at least a half dozen murders and one suicide possible
<START> i didn't even bother finishing the movie because i was so bored i thought i was going to pass out i was watching it in the movie theaters and me and my friends just got tired so we got up and left to another movie if i ever have to sit through 2 min of that movie again i think i'm going to shoot myself and i do know the whole entire movie because my friend told me what happened at the end and i wasn't surprised at all i mean who didn't know she was going to do the right thing and let him be happy i mean for real you would have to be a complete idiot not to know that i know i didn't miss anything and if somebody ask's me to see that movie i would say over my dead body
<START> in a word this film was boring it lacked life and spark a big problem is with the two leads jude law and gwyneth paltrow had no chemistry whatsoever he was boring and she was annoying br br the visuals were interesting but they didn't enhance the scenes if anything the visuals tended to detach the audience from what was happening on screen none of the action sequences felt real and hence the film failed to create any real drama or a sense of danger br br the film had potential but it needed a better script better acting and a better director i kept thinking during the film you know this movie would've worked if harrison ford was sky captain karen allen was polly and steven spielberg was the director br br ignore the critical acclaims for this film the critics i think are praising the film because they want to like it and want it to succeed even though it fails on so many different levels
<START> i bought this movie and after i watched it i decided that i did not care for it the acting was bad was the principal a robot he had no personality and his facial expression didn't change through the whole movie at times the voices didn't match up people talking and their lips didn't even move
<START> spoiler alert personally i don't understand why pete did not help to save williams life i mean that would be great to know why william was motivated or forced i think secret service members are every day people and there is a rumor the writer was a member of the secret service now he's motivations are clear well known but as a rental this film will not satisfy you cause the old but used twists the average acting these are just things in this film only for keep you wait the end clark johnson as the director of s w a t did a far better work like this time and i still wondering how the producers for example michael douglas left this film to theaters
<START> i've now just realised that by watching this film i have lost valuable precious moments of my life i will never get back thsi film isn't just poor its dire it reminded me of every stereotypical black sitcom ever made br br i regret watching this film br br flixmedia reckons its a race issue apparently white people don't like it because it doesn't have white actors mate i think you'll find the reason why no one liked this was because watching paint dry is far more entertaining and funnier then this pile of drivel br br please stop making crap films
<START> a friend of mine recommended this movie citing my vocal and inflective similarities with des howl the movie's main character i guess to an extent i can see that and perhaps a bit more i'm not very sure whether or not that's flattering portrayal br br this is a pretty unique work the only movie to which this might have more than a glancing similarity would be true romance not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue whale music is just so much more well relaxed but instead that they both represent modern love stories br br in general i'm a big fan of canadian movies about music and musicians for example i highly recommend hard core logo and this film in particular it has an innocent charm des is not always the most likeably guy but there's something about him that draws a sterling sort of empathy
<START> this is the first review i've wrote for imdb so bare with me but i caught this flick on hbo and was sure glad i watched it richard gere is great in this film as the passionate agent detective who bends the rules to get the job done i think the story is great and there's never a dull scene that slows the pace of the movie down some parts of the movie which have to do with demented sex addicts are pretty shocking but if you've ever seen a crime film like se7en you'll be able to stomach the scenes just fine br br so all in all if you're looking for a good detective suspense movie ignore the low rating this movie got on imdb and definitely watch it
<START> i can't say this is the worst film of all time but only because there are still some movies i haven't seen yet this has to be the most pretentious attempt at making a movie of all time the director suffers from the same issues he had with there will be blood though he wasn't quite as bad in that film the whole movie it feels like you're watching a guy trying to hard to impress beyond his abilities it's like he sits in his little director's chair and thinks how would a great filmmaker handle this scene he just doesn't have it in him i don't know if this film could be saved by a great filmmaker there were certainly some nuggets of greatness that could have been polished but nothing was brought to ripen the scene where all the characters are singing was the worst moment in cinema history one by one as we see the characters singing and i squirmed in my seat i kept saying please please just don't have the guy on the brink of death singing too sure enough massive failure
