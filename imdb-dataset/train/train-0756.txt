<START> dumb is as dumb does in this thoroughly uninteresting supposed black comedy essentially what starts out as chris klein trying to maintain a low profile eventually morphs into an uninspired version of the three amigos only without any laughs in order for black comedy to work it must be outrageous which play dead is not in order for black comedy to work it cannot be mean spirited which play dead is what play dead really is is a town full of nut jobs fred dunst does however do a pretty fair imitation of billy bob thornton's character from a simple plan while jake busey does a pretty fair imitation of well jake busey merk
<START> the greatest games of kasparov or fischer can be a mess for a total rookie this is a great movie there is no special agency involved in the plot this is the clue this is a private plot built as a private enterprise this is a self destructive and a self organized plot as a conclusion the scenario described the perfect professional plot private self Âorganized self destructive with no trace at the end anyone can be behind the plot a smart director with some money all can be done just by delegation the director must be just trigger if the normal viewer cannot see the essence of the plot in the explicit sequences of the movie a real plot has fewer chances to be discovered all the actors' performances are well done with some special mention for gene hackman and mickey rooney
<START> hmmm a sports team is in a plane crash gets stranded on a snowy mountain and is faced with the difficult decision to eat the flesh of their dead companions in order to survive sound familiar anyone i refer to alive from 1993 the only major difference here of course is that a big white drunken scare crow of a yeti shows up a few times to drag off the dead i guess humans taste better than yaks br br stupid the man in the first scene does not have a reliable firearm when hunting the yeti nor does he have a backup br br the plane crash is completely bogus it would have either exploded in the air exploded when it hit the ground or become obliterated the people would not have survived but hey it's sci fi br br stupid they survived and they are cold it might be a good idea to harness some of the burning debris nearby so as not to freeze to death fire being warm as it is br br wtf the pilot has frost formed all over his face while he's alive and talking but oddly enough no one else does br br stupid one of the guys tells the others to look for matches and lighters but there are scattered parts of the plane on fire all around them br br stupid they find coats and hoodies and yet there in the cold of the himalayas they fail to use the hoods br br stupid they're staring at a pile of sticks when i reiterate there are pieces of the plane already burning br br stupid the himalayas are notorious for its storms it would be common sense for them to collect the debris in order to reinforce their structure rather than sitting outside bickering there are a lot of pine trees around the branches of which make excellent insulation br br wtf when in doubt use a dead man's arm as a splint br br wtf if the one guy knows so much about the hibernation habits of squirrels bears and leopards in the himalayas then why doesn't he know enough to make shelter and set traps right from the start br br stupid when attempting to trap wild animals mindless conversation in the vicinity of said trap always helps br br wtf do you know how hard it would be to cut a frozen corpse with a shard of glass br br wtf the group was ready and armed to fight the yeti while the other two were standing there defenseless the yeti ripped out the guy's heart and stomped the girl's head and the gang did nothing there's love br br so two yetis and a convenient avalanche to bury the evidence forever or so we think mwuhahahaa the story continues into more idiocy but the most action occurs in the last 15 minutes as usual nice thinking with the javelin and the chain although this is some ingenuity with the magically appearing chain that they lacked in the beginning of the movie when they couldn't even make fire despite the fact that it was all around them br br as is typical for the sci fi originals the loving couple kisses at the end like nothing horrible has just happened to them not to mention they ate human flesh and haven't brushed their teeth in several days br br the very end however is quote lame
<START> a note to all of you budding film writers study this film if your dialog reads like the dialog in this film please shred your script and try again br br i didn't have high expectations but was intrigued by the description indicating there was a mystery at the christmas ornament factory the mystery is resolved very early and the film becomes a straight romance i almost stopped watching it at 5 minutes 10 minutes and at the first break my spouse who is the hallmark lifetime fan gave up at the first break br br forest river is a company town the main business is aikens ornaments who make all manner of holiday decorations the patriarch of the company has recently passed away so the companies future might be in question we soon meet noelle who would rather be on wall street than main street and the mysterious justin who gets a date with noelle after a large snowman she is inflating crashes into justins car once we meet alison aikens doing due diligence for the board we have our story setup br br if you can't nail all the story arcs by the first commercial break you haven't seen enough of this kind of holiday film maybe that's a good thing
<START> the poverty row horror pictures of the 1930s and '40s depress the hell out of me god knows i have nothing against low budget films but the ones produced in that period have such a dreary shabby look about them and in the final analysis just aren't very good the corpse vanishes is slightly more entertaining than bottom of the barrel dreck like the invisible ghost and the ape man but it's no classic bela lugosi long past his dracula heyday plays yet another mad doctor the unbearable elizabeth russell plays his wife they sleep in coffins because as lugosi explains to a doubtful young female reporter luana walters a coffin is much more comfortable than a bed ho hum angelo rossitto and minerva urecal are also on hand which might please hardcore fans of '30s and '40s films
<START> a lot has been said about shinjuku triad society as the first true miike film and i thought this sort of description might have been a clichÃ© but like all clichÃ©s it is based on the truth all the miike trademarks are here the violence the black humour the homosexuality the taboo testing and the difficult to like central character shinjuku is however one of miike's most perfectly formed films he says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different but not necessarily better i think what he means is that the film possesses a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so fresh that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not replicate or better the purity of this film br br as you might expect the violence is utterly visceral gushing blood and gritty beatings are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face only a miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that the film has a fantastic pace unlike dead or alive which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle dead or alive also deals with similar issues miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the japanese and chinese in the postwar period and this emotive subject is handled well here the central character really coming to life when you begin to understand his past br br i cannot sing shinjuku's praises enough i do not want to give away too much this is miike before he began to use cgi to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like kitano's sonatine the central characters are superbly realized and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film has finished you'll be popping it back on again to work it all out
<START> i can not believe i wasted my money to rent this movie i thought it was a porn flick when it started and it never got any better the acting the music drowning out the actors horrible save your money you have to read the movie all the way through b c they knew the music would drowned out the speaking lines i never got the part about the slaughterhouse or the need to continue to show cows and pigs being butchered what did that have to do with the real btk killer i understand why there were no famous actors actresses in this movie the script would have turned me away within the first page of reading you would be better off watching paint dry
<START> it is very unfortunate when a movie such as this is made a great deal of work and money has been put into a film that is amateur at best br br the editing drags on there are obvious mistakes that could have been corrected easily in a second take and the soundtrack is unimaginative so much more could have been done with this video movie i guess they ran out of time or videotape br br hand held shots have a distinct amateur feel to them
<START> barman just wanted to make a movie because he wanted to just as simple as that and he succeeded not only in his goal but also in making a wonderful movie especially visually he knows how to use pans slow motion sequences tracking shots crane shots etc in a beautiful smooth way this gives the movie a very relaxing feel to it br br the story is about the lives of 8 very different characters who have nothing in common except one thing a party that they all attend to which also is the turnpoint of this movie the beauty of this picture lies not in the question how the characters have effect on eachother in comparance with a similar of course better movie like magnolia i simply don't think that that was barman's idea the beauty lies in the different details of experiences that people go through which makes or breaks their lives barman is very successful in telling those little stories that describe little experiences he knows people and antwerp br br the soundtrack of the movie is also excellent but not a surprise as we know that barman is also a very succesful songwriter and musician with his band deus the music is sometimes hot and at the same time relaxing which contributes to the sunny smooth feel of the movie other times we hear funky pop rock melodies which give some scenes the strength that they need br br there's only one flaw and that's the last half an hour was it the runtime which was breaking me up or weren't the last scenes that fresh and accurate than the scenes until then i can't figure it out br br all in all a beautiful sunny movie which lifts the belgian cinema up br br 8 out of 10 br br it's the breeze that flows through a girl's hair on a sunny afternoon making her even more beautiful it's the fresh breeze that makes you relax when it passes you at a crowded party when someone opens the door it's the breeze that carries the perfume from that beautiful girl sitting next to you in the park who you just met a week ago it's the breeze br br
<START> this is a rather dull movie about a scientist that creates a teleporter device and gets horribly disfigured when he uses the machine to transport himself simple plot done before in the fly and others not only does he get disfigured but he also can electrocute people with a touch what is really dumb about this film is that we are expected to believe the place this guy works is against him he could probably make millions for the institution that he is working at but the head of the institution tries to sabotage his teleporter every step of the way in the end the projected man electrocutes three people for no reason then goes after those that have wronged him
<START> if you made a genre flick in the late 80s you basically had a 50 50 chance it would either be set underwater or in a prison sadly we never got an underwater prison flick framed for murder by mafia boss moretti anthony franciosa derek keillor dennis cole ends up on death row right alongside the mob boss' brother frankie frank sarcinello jr but this is the least of derek's problems as rogue government agent and mob stoolie col burgess john saxon who also directs is using the prison as a testing ground for a new supervirus this is the only flick saxon directed during his storied career for a guy who has worked with tons of directors it appears the only ones he picked up any tips from were the cheap o italian ones sure it is low budget but that can't excuse the stilted staging shooting gaffes or clumsy exposition in the first 15 minutes to his credit saxon did make it slightly gory and he works in a hilarious nude scene our lead falls asleep during a prison riot only to fantasize about a female scientist cole who looks like a more rugged jan michael vincent is decent as the stoic lead and franciosa sporting a really bad rug gives it his all as the clichÃ© mob boss the end takes place at marty mckee's favorite location bronson canyon retromedia released this on dvd as zombie death house
<START> after all the crap that hollywood and the indies have churned out we finally get a movie that delivers some scary moments there are some clichÃ©d moments but i'm not sure it's possible nowadays to make an entirely original movie there's not much new here it's just done well br br make sure and pay attention as the subtle scares come quickly and often this is not a movie to watch while you're eating pizza br br there's one very well written red herring in this movie and unfortunately one very poorly cast role cheri christian just doesn't make an effective julie the wife mother for one thing she's totally unsympathetic i know i know she's just gone through a traumatic experience but the viewer never gets to know her as she normally is and the relationship between her and her husband is rather discomforting in an unintentional way i think that the director had meant for us to have some sympathy for her but i never did br br finally a thumbs up for the ending which is both disturbing and satisfying it could easily have been cheapened with a sound effect at the beginning of the end credits but the director wisely resisted br br this is not a masterpiece by any means but it is a good old fashioned scary movie something that's rather rare nowadays
<START> this movie raises a number of pressing questions in my mind firstly how has jennifer tilly managed to sustain a film acting career for all these years based on that ridiculous squeaky voice and the very limited range of hammy facial expressions she employs secondly what on earth were the people responsible for making this offensive and deeply repulsive film thinking of and thirdly given that there were people perverted enough to decide to make dreck like this shouldn't there have been someone in the system the studio the distributors or somewhere sane enough to prevent it actually getting completed and released you really would have to search a very very long way to turn up another movie as profoundly nasty as this and it isn't even billed as a horror movie which inasmuch as it can be seen as belonging to any legitimate film genre it certainly is the movie wallows from beginning to end in the sickest kind of madness violence and abuse and has essentially no redeeming features at all i'm not actually advocating censorship which i don't believe in but i really can't see how anybody could conceivably draw anything positive from watching a film like this
<START> this was a great book and the possibilities for a truly great film were definitely there but the casting decisions completely wrecked the movie hanks is a great actor to be sure but lacks the smarmy morally ambivalent characteristics needed for the lead role jeff daniels would have been my choice br br putting melanie griffiths in for eye candy reasons is understandable but again she did not portray the depth or ambivalence so need to pull this off br br this movie is a great example of how every decision even those early on in the movie production can make or break a file
<START> spoilers br br this movie always seems very exaggerated until i remember that my college campus had a former student turned nazi racist killer who then committed suicide too his name was benjamin nathaniel smith br br look him up in the wikipedia i added a few photos to their article about him br br it's hard to believe but this stuff really does happen br br i'm not a big fan of omar epps or ice cube but larry fishburne kristy swanson jennifer connelly mike rappaport were good
<START> they changed the title of this atrocity to an unexpected love the only thing worse is the film itself the script contains dialogue that would be laughed out of a third grade play recital at one point when the wife leaves the husband a bad cover of all by myself plays over the soundtrack no kidding the actors try but are defeated by the inept unbelievably terrible script direction is staggeringly bad no wonder lifetime has such a bad reputation how do things like this get made i'm turning off the television before it's over
<START> i've almost forever been against the inclusion of songs in a movie my belief was that the quality of the film would automatically be improved if only those extremely annoying songs would be axed however things have quickly changed after watching that horrible black no songs this movie page 3 plenty of songs while black was weak to an extreme page 3 delivers a gripping story with some strong acting good direction the songs were almost incidental blended in almost seamlessly with the film there certainly weren't any women getting sprayed with water for no apparent reason from mysterious water sources while gyrating wildly on the streets at night br br i was pleasantly surprised with the bold and unabashed approach used by the director there was no glossing over of anything and almost every scene was completely believable br br i'd recommend this films for hindi speaking people with at least a slight understanding of mumbai life the former because the english subtitling was below par and contained many errors which at times completely reversed the meaning of the actual statement the latter because you'll definitely appreciate the accuracy of the depiction once you've lived it yourself br br i'd definitely rank this as a work worthy of international recognition the scenes with the gossiping drivers was a nice touch and it served simultaneously as a source of genuine humour as well as another perspective on the whole mishmash the movie does fall short in a few places though where the characters sometimes say the most inexplicable things which detract from the overall direction of the film br br i also thought that a couple of the sadder scenes were not done very well it was a touch amusing to watch rather than arouse any feelings of sadness the whole scene tended to come across as a bit foolish these are minor issues though because the film on the whole is truly a rare treat to watch br br overall it's a cynical pessimistic outlook and a refreshing one at that actors not 'heroes' that's the key a chance to glimpse believable human beings in an extraordinary setting everyday life a behind the scenes look at the extent of the depravity and a rare ray of hope for indian cinema br br 8 10
<START> after the success of scooby doo where are you they decided to give scooby and shaggy their own show but unfortunately they added a new character that spoilt scooby doo success forever they invented a new show with a new title scooby and scrappy doo it was scrappy doo that made this show a complete failure probably for both adults and kids together scrappy was the stupid brave puppy that always looked ready to beat someone up scooby and shaggy were getting scared of the villain and they were also trying to stop him scooby doo doesn't need any little annoying bastard puppy nephews if they wanted scooby doo to be more successful they should have either killed or never thought up scrappy this was just poor maybe your kids will prefer it
<START> based on the average short story by horror writer stephen king about so called 'sleepwalkers' ancient and immortal cat like creatures that suck the life out of virgins in order that this energy may sustain them they have supernatural abilities they can make themselves 'dim' which means they become invisible and can create subliminal mirages to fool people they have been fleeing humans for century's we are told and have one by one been picked off till there are only two left the film starts when a beautiful mother and her son arrive in a sleepy town they are the last of the sleepwalkers and they are on the prowl for virgins to feed on the mother sends her son out to enrol at the local high school so he can find a virgin he does madchen amick and proceeds to try to get her alone so he can suck her dry it is not made clear why the mother cannot seek out virgins herself it would make things easier one would imagine as teenage boys are much more apt to follow a older beautiful woman to a secluded area than a teen girl follow a teen boy however his plans are thwarted as the girl fights back jabbing a pencil in to his ear the police are called and the hunt is on the son is sick from his injuries and so the mother goes on the rampage killing cops left and right in her hunt for the girl who hurt her son and spouting some painfully unfunny one liners amidst the gore finally the girl kills the mother end of movie this movie is rubbish the acting is variable from the average brian krause to the excellent alice krige the special effects are average and showcase some early computer effects which is mildly interesting as it shows how far such things have progressed in such a short time the direction is muddled and the film falls in to camp in places the director seems unsure whether we are supposed to fear the sleepwalkers or sympathise with them and when in doubt allows the film to become hysterical stephen king makes a mildly amusing cameo as an annoying gardener as does mark hamill as a puzzled cop alice krige seems to shoulder the film her character is given depth and she gives an indication of what the film could have been with a better screenplay and better direction
<START> camera work why is the camera work in this movie so jumpy this is annoying and distracting editing the flashes of the still pictures were way too short many of the other scenes were too short also just flashes sound the background music was way too loud and covered up the voices one should not have to rewind and replay to catch what was said doesn't anybody check these things and make them do it over again please reduce the volume of the background music in future is adjustment of the relative sound levels the job of the editor julia wong the plot had way too many loose ends the basic story line had potential i think the film needed more work was it rushed perhaps they ran out of money like a lot of movies it started out great but just petered out toward the end i really don't understand this you know you have the story board before it goes into production so why doesn't all the loose ends get taken care of in the storyboard br br sorry to be so critical
