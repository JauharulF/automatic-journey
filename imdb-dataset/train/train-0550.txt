<START> while this movie won't go down in the annals of great cinema it is a fun way to spend an hour and a half with the family the film is finally being released in video where it should have debuted in the first place br br the film is about an eclectic group of friends who gather for dinners which they have named the hungry bachelors club jorja fox plays a woman who serves as a surrogate in order to get a down payment for the restaurant that she wants to open bill nunn plays a cadillac loving mystery man who becomes her lover fox gives an understated and touching performance and nunn is reliably talented as always micheal des barres is a hoot as an over the top attorney the ensemble casts made up of familiar faces works nicely together to bring this wacky group of characters to life this is a good rental and one of the few you can watch with the whole family
<START> the selection of sylvester stallone to perform the protagonist by renny harlin is commendable since stallone is that sort of tough and craggy person who had earlier rendered the requisite audaciously versatile aura to the characters of rocky balbao and rambo but to compare die hard series with cliffhanger is a far fetched notion br br the excellently crafted opening scene introduces the audience to the thrill suspense and intrigue which is going to engulf them in the ensuing bloody and perilous encounter with the outlaws the heist and the high altitude transfer of hard cash in suit cases from one plane to the other is something not filmed before br br the biting cold of the snow capped alps and the unfolding deceit and treachery among the antagonist forces makes one shiver with trepidation the forces of awesome adventure and ruthless murder kicks the drama through to the end br br good movies are not made every year and people don't get a feast for eyes to watch every now and then apart from the filthy language parlance which endows brazen excitement during certain scenes the movie can be regarded as one that is not going to fade its captivating appeal even watching it after so many years
<START> this film made john glover a star alan raimy is one of the most compelling character that i have ever seen on film and i mean that sport
<START> i took this out arbitrarily from the library the other night having no idea of the film's cult influence or that it is currently being staged as a musical most of the comments here are on target it's moving funny sad and yes a tad exploitive despite the best intentions of the filmmakers the expanded chriterion edition is a must for anyone who loved it when it came out br br i think you can also see in little edie the fall of a class that sort of disappeared you can hear it in old films of jackie o too people just don't talk like that anymore i think as a documentary it would have been interesting to get more information about how the home fell into disrepute old edie at least still seems aware of what's going on to a certain degree couldn't she see the once spectacular home disintegrating br br yet the film's subject is the life the two women have constructed for themselves now a real life tennesse williams one act well worth your time
<START> movie goers avoid watching this movie if you are faint hearted you might want to commit suicide if you are a short tempered you would want to kill the lead performer of the movie br br though he does not have any talent in acting he is the mass hero for all the rickshaw pullers auto rickshaw drivers rowdies thugs and immature and ignorant literates br br he proves you do not need neither talent nor knowledge to be successfully br br he is the highest paid actor in india that shows the taste of movie going public in india 90 of movie goers in tamil nadu are definitely attracted to his kind of nonsense movies
<START> big bad ralph is also on the not so squeazy truck commercials and can be found at numerous brothels around melbourne any given night br br terrible film by the way wasn't shocking just bad uninteresting br br the main guy was in charge of the metal section on countdown and was the lead bouncer at a gay night club in melbourne br br i dunno who the women where probably pros's that ralph knew br br no story of interest its one of those fast forward jobs br br please look up big bad ralph at brothels around melbourne br br hes famous in them br br i wish i could give 0 10 but ill give it 1 only cos i cant give 0
<START> jennifer jason leigh and mare winningham are a good match portraying vastly different siblings but only winningham is able to bring something convincing or substantial to her role leigh playing bar band singer and alcoholic sadie flood constantly leans on older sis georgia an acclaimed folk singer in the joni mitchell mold perhaps due to her double duties as co producer on the film leigh seems to have boxed herself into a corner she isn't credible as a singer and even if this is intentional gives herself far too much screen time at the microphone probably hoping for a tour de force leigh is wire drawn and nervous and jagged however we simply do not see any talent within this character leigh is obviously a solid actress but she makes decisions here that wall us off from her if sadie had even the slightest bit of charisma or appeal we might be able to buy into the concept that she gets the small breaks that she does as it is the likelihood of her ever getting up on stage is slim director ulu grosbard crafts a few intense dramatic sequences and the editing at the finale juxtaposes sadie's bar performance with georgia's sold out arena show both singing the same song and it's a sadly nuanced moment but really what's the point 1 2 from
<START> i just finished watching dressed to kill which is written and directed by brian de palma the dvd had both the r rated version and the unrated version i chose the unrated version since i have yet to view the r rated version i can't be completely sure of the difference there is however a very graphic graphic female nudity including a scene of explicit expression of self gratification in this version i guess you could call this scene soft core porn if this sort of thing may offend you i would suggest you view the r rated version but i digress any comment from here on refers to the unrated version this is a murder mystery psychological horror suspense movie there is very little violence and blood there is however one death sequence of note the act of the killing itself is fairly graphic however the blood it self does not look real it is reminiscent of how a 70's slasher film would look i believe this is done deliberately to offset the violence of the act itself to give the scene a low budget feel most of the violence or rather possibility of such is implied the film is very well paced as far as i can tell every scene had a purpose which i find very rare when compared to many of today's films anyway i also thought the acting was good especially angie dickinson and micheal cane turns in a quietly understated performance in his role which works brilliantly in this case the movie also has one great twist in it in my mind although some people might find it predictable the only complaint and it's really more of an observation i have is that i thought the character played by nancy allen could have been fleshed out more especially considering she has a fair amount of screen time but i think she does a good job with what she is given and this doesn't really take away from the quality of the film the film also has a strong moral to it which is even more relevant today but the movie doesn't hit you over the head with it i also really liked the musical score composed by pino dinaggioi felt it was very similar to the music in the original psycho to me this music really elevated the movie i thought this movie was brilliant for me dressed to kill 1980 is 10 10
<START> i had started to lose my faith in films of recent being inundated with the typical genre hollywood film story lines fail and camera work is merely copied from the last film of similiar taste but then i saw zentropa europa and my faith was renewed not only is the metaphorical storyline enthralling but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating the narrator max von sydow takes you through a spellbounding journey every step of the way and engrosses you into europa 1945 we have all seen death put on screen in a hundred thousand ways but the beauty of this film is how it takes you through every slow moving moment that leads you to death unlike many films it doesn't cut after one second of showing for example a knife but forces you to watch the devastating yet sensuous beauty of a man's final moments i think we can all take something different away from what this movie is trying to say but it is definitely worth taking the time to find out what it all really means i would love to talk more in depth about the film for any one who wishes to send me an email enjoy it
<START> not often have i had the feeling of a movie it could be visionary but clearly this movie has the seed of a premonition br br we should not tend to be alarmists and see armageddon in something because it seems to fit our emotions of the moment but didn't we say this of 1984 had james orwell known the internet becoming reality not long after 1984 in fact it was in 1994 he might have reconsidered writing his story the way he did hindsight rewarded br br it doesn't matter what does matter is that we often regard ourselves as superior to our surroundings but indeed become emotional about a love apple when necessity knocks at our door a snapshot of ourselves at old age br br whatever the time line will prove to be for us i know for a fact we haven't seen the beginning of it yet br br
<START> jÃ¶rg buttgereit goes a bit too far with his movies and themes at times even for my taste but his movies are always something special and hard to classify they are artistically made with also often deeper meaning to its themes this movie is a perfect example of his work br br it's also really hard to label this movie it's not really a movie with a story to it in a sense of having a beginning middle and end in it it also doesn't have a main character but instead focuses on 7 different suicides and killings on 7 different days br br all different stories are being told with lots of class though some of them are of course more 'interesting' and realistic than the others they are not necessarily connected but yet together they still tell a story the movie doesn't feel disjointed at all all different stories have a different feel to it and buttgereit tells the story without hardly using any words also typical for his style but instead lets the images and obvious sensible emotions of the characters tell the entire story it helps to make this movie an effective one to watch br br again the production values all aren't too high and this might be something that might scare off some people it however helps for this particular movie to set the right tone and atmosphere for the entire movie and its dark disturbing and depressing themes br br a buttgereit movie that i 'enjoyed' watching br br 7 10
<START> this series had potential but i suppose the budget wouldn't allow it to see that potential an interesting setup not dissimilar to lost it falls flat after the 1st episode the whole series 6 episodes could have made a compelling 90 minute film but the makers chose to drag it on and on many of the scenes were unbearably slow and long without moving the action forward the music was very annoying and did not work overall there were few characters we cared about as their characters did not grow during the time frame well one grew a bit the ending was as terrible as the rest of series the only kudos here is to the art dept and set dressers they created an interesting look too bad the writer and director lacked the foresight to do something interesting with that element
<START> dialogue stilted clichÃ©d acting hammy clichÃ©d plot predictable clichÃ©d br br just what are christopher plummer nastassia kinski doing in this b rubbish plummer was well established decades before this movie was made kinski had masterpieces like tess and cat people behind her must have been desperate br br the bad guys all have bad guy accents bad bad guy accents plummer especially where did he learn to do german and most of them have bad guy sneers as well the innocent bystanders all overdo their panicking enough to make you laugh the good guy survives amongst other things a 5 throwing knife buried hilt deep in his shoulder just pulls it out and seconds later is using the arm with no difficulty at all marines' machine gun fire i think someone referred to a 50 in the leg which he sorts out by tying a bandage around his pants leg and thereafter he barely has a limp several fist fights in which he sustains multiple punches to the face as well as being run cranium first into a door frame a fall backwards from what looks like the third floor onto paving without the slightest sign of a twisted ankle or any other such trifling inconvenience the script has exactly 3 clever lines the rest of the time it's all so dull and boring br br ok it's not all bad plummer does bring a certain class to his part and is undoubtedly the best actor in this flick of course that doesn't say much but he can do the callous villain without resorting to the ham techniques most of the villains use here he delivers his ve haff vays and meance type lines with some menace but you are always aware you are watching christopher plummer acting the villain br br this movie is truly an awful waste of time the acting such as it is is sort of 70's 007 movies wooden line delivery meets bruce lee's very obviously faked fight scenes but it's not even anywhere near as good as either a roger moore 007 or a bruce lee film don't bother
<START> i really really didn't expect this type of a film outside of america how anyone can take the subject of sexually abusing children and turn it into a thriller is just sick auteuil whom i had previously admired going around like some sort of child saving rambo was ignorant and insulting to all the children being sexually exploited around the world br br what's doubly depressing is that the stunning and ground breaking film happiness came out the year before this film menges and his cohorts should be ashamed of themselves it's admirable to read some of the comments by the more intelligent viewers out there they were able to see the shoddy and ridiculous handling of this topic those of you who think this is great cinema display a disgusting amount of ignorance and you need to watch happiness to open your minds to the true horrors of pedophilia br br do you think your child is more likely to be kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery or be molested by a neighbor teacher friend or even a relative hmm i wonder if they are going to make a film about international child slavery of whatever kind they owe it to everyone to make it realistic and emotionally involving instead of this button pushing crap 1 10
<START> oh god what an idiotic movie incredibly cheap with fake special effects the creature is played by one guy in lame costume and stupid plot all dialogues are unbelievably bad and these actors ha ha ha they're simply ludicrous for example i have never seen so annoying characters like in this junk these dumb kids or pregnant woman with his husband and many more all in all this is a great entertainment if you're drunk avoid it like the plague am i drunk i don't think so
<START> some illegal so called asylum seeker comes to stuttgart and finds that germans are racist br br this is just another already forgotten steaming nugget in a long list of post wwii anti german propaganda films aimed to make germans feel bad for not welcoming each and every degenerate in their country so he can chase german blonds and sell drugs to german teenagers br br if you're looking for good german films in general see der tunnel der untergang europa europa and lola rennt br br but not this br br also das experiment with the same male actor from lola rennt
<START> i think this show is definitely the greatest show jessica alba does such a great job in it michael weatherly also does an awesome job as well as the rest of the cast the show is very intriguing and they have wonderful storylines and their stunts are amazing it's like watching a 1 hour movie it's definitely worth watching
<START> as a movie critic for several dutch websites i have to see lot's of movies and not all very good ones some movies are so bad you won't be surprised that they are released straight on video with taboo iÃ¡m surprised that it is released on video at all this is really low budget bad quality bad written rubbish br br a group of youngsters plays a game of taboo they write down their most sickening wish or act and later on people are murdered for their taboo's the question is should we believe what we see br br the movie has a potential interesting plot twist and i won't give it away here but what could have been interesting stays stupid bad acted and without any reason br br some of the actors have played in bigger titles before so why on earth did they sign up for this if you see this anywhere try to dodge it there is no logic no human sense of quality in this movie
<START> in watching this early demille work it was once again reinforced to me that early demille is far superior to late demille his attention to use of light within scenes is remarkable his pacing is very good enabling much to be told in the space of an hour or so it is a pity that he wasn't as intuitive about the style of his later sound films as he seemed to be in his silent films br br this was the first film in which i had seen cleo ridgely she was remarkable quite restrained and yet conveyed a broad spectrum of emotions br br the ending is wonderful
<START> i love this movie short thing jason steele is amazing my favorite parts are the french song and in the opening title when the spatula soldier yells spoons i crack up every time i would recommend this movie to knox klaymation fans and people who enjoy jason steele's other movies his style of animation is very original it takes a few views to notice the detailed backgrounds his humor is also hilarious and is definitely not something you'd hear before like max the deformed spatula who has a sound and light system in his head that beams colorful lights and happy music whenever he talks about his miserable life this is a wonderful animation to watch anytime any where
