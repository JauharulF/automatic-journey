<START> i cannot stay indifferent to lars van trier's films i consider 'breaking the waves' nothing less than a masterpiece i loved 'dancer in the night' i admired the idea in 'dogville' but the overall exercise looked to me too dry and too theatrical less cinema 'europa' which i see only now was a famous film at its time succeeded in the us the relative success of an european film and got the oscar for the best foreign language movie but did not survive well the time in my opinion it is also a too much explicit and extrovert exercise in cinema art to my taste br br the story has a level of ambiguity that cannot escape the viewer treating the period that immediately followed the second world war not in the black and white colors of victors and vanquished of executioners and victims but as rather ambiguous times when people of both sides were fighting for survival in the aftermath of a catastrophic event that change the lives of nations and individuals forever is still a source of disputes even today more such was novel and courageous two decades ago yet it is the means of expression that really do not appear fit to the task br br the film seems to include a lot of quotes descending directly from the films of hitchcock especially his early films set in the pre war europe with brave british spies fighting evil german spies on trains crossing at high speed the continent at dark the trains were a symbol of the world and its conflicts with all their intensity and dramatism here the train also becomes the symbol of the first sparkles of the re birth of germany after war of its might of its obsession with order and regulation of punctuality and civility the characters that populate the train are far from being the classical spy stories good or bad guys the principal character a young american of german origin coming to post war europe willing to be part of a process of help and reconciliation finds himself in an ambiguous world of destruction and corruption with liberators looking more like oppressive occupiers with the vanquished not resigned to their fate but rather willing to continue on the path of self destruction with love doubtfully mixed with treason br br it is yet this classical film treatment that betrays the director in this case the actions of the characters especially of leopold kessler played by jean marc barr seem confused and lack credibility the overall cinematography seems to be not hitchcock like but rather from a bad imitation of hitchcock in the late 30s the usage of color over the black and white film used in the majority of the time in moments of emotional intensity is also too demonstrative it is not that van trier does not master his artistic means but he is too demonstrative he seems to try too hard to show what a great filmmaker he is he really is great as he will show in some of his later films but it will be left to the viewers to decide this alone
<START> this movie is another christian propaganda film in the line of the omega code not that that is necessarily bad but for the fact that most propaganda films sacrifice sincerity and realism for the message they wish to deliver if you enjoy a styrofoam portrayal of life on the streets and the way the gospel can change a life than perhaps you may enjoy this movie i say save your money and rent the cross and the switchblade or the mission when will christian directors learn that sometimes people say bad words it was frustrating to see criminals depicted who are not allowed to swear huh criminals say bad words and flat characters i really could not relate to also it would've been great if the movie had shown some t a now that would be something i'd like to pay to see who was the blockhead who compared this communion wafer thin story of a movie with the boondock saints and the sting
<START> otto preminger's dana andrews cycle of films noirs are among the largely unsung jewels of the genre because they lack paranoia misogyny or hysteria they may have seemed out of place at the time but the clear eyed imagery the complex play with identity masculinity and representation the subversion of traditional psychological tenets the austere geometrical style all seem startlingly modern today and very similar to melville the lucid ironies of this film are so loaded brutal and ironic that the 'happy' ending is one of the cruellest in hollywood history brilliant on the level of entertaining thriller as well tense and packed with double edged dialogue
<START> very interesting and moving documentary about the world trade center tragedy on 11th september 2001 the main theme of it is the heroism of american fire fighters who tried to rescue as many people as they could the film is deeply emotional and rather disturbing many people seen on screen have lost their lives recommended
<START> there is one great moment in surviving christmas that almost makes it worth the pain james gandolfini cracks a shovel over ben affleck's stupid head br br this movie serves as yet another unfortunate example of james gandolfini proving what a great actor he is whilst simultaneously besmirching his career by acting in this film br br young and wealthy ad exec drew latham ben affleck has been inculcated into believing that one must never be alone on christmas and there from the outset is the underlying problem with our suspension of disbelief in this idiotic movie how many people of drew's social standing in 2004 truly care one way or another whether christmas is spent alone or with half the family or with a fifty dollar prostitute storyline finds drew buying off a family to spend christmas with on the condition that they pretend to be his own insensately ignoring all the indications to the contrary that his money has not bought the emotions he was seeking br br for 250 000 a surly suburban truck driver tom valco james gandolfini and his disheveled wife christine catherine o'hara agree to be drew's ad hoc family against protests from their son brian a very one dimensional josh zuckerman and daughter alicia a very soft focused christina applegate drew then spends the rest of the movie supposedly recapturing his youth or something the messages in this movie are as twisted and illogical as its dry mouthed storyline fraught with overt psychoses drew plasters a fake smile on his face and blindly remains in denial against every denigration that he was supposedly buying the valco family to avoid br br which begs the question if drew is paying these people to recapture some semblance of joyous familial emotion how psychotic must he be to pretend happiness amongst their barbs and mental anguish over his presence it is not a case of the valco family hiding their true feelings and pretending to be happy while around drew three of the four members make it patently clear they despise him is he so incognizant that he cannot see that his money is not buying him the family atmosphere he was inculcated into believing was a truth in the first place as with all movies this opprobrious one wonders how four screenwriters could possibly get so tangled in their own narcissistic dreams of appearing in a credits sequence that they will overlook any semblance of plausibility or intelligence br br director mike mitchell who was responsible for deuce bigalow male gigolo stop right there 'nuff said br br gandolfini and o'hara somehow manage to shine proving their mettle amongst this mess christina applegate is willowy and cutesy and blond and fiery in all the right places scathingly cutting drew into little strips of carcass for most of the movie then doing an about face and falling in love with him because the script tells her to br br and i wouldn't go so far as to say that affleck is a bad actor but john schneider better look over his shoulder there's a whole new level of desperately seeking talent in town
<START> i actually had quite high hopes going into this movie so i took what was given with a grain of salt and hoped for the best about 1 3 of the way through the film i simply had to give up quite simply the movie is a mish mash of stuff happening for no apparent reason and it's all disconnected i love movies that make you think but this movie was just a bunch of ideas thrown together and never really connected br br don't think it's david lynch esquire as some would have you believe it is nowhere near that realm other than some trippy visuals saying it's artsy to disguise the fact there's no apparent plot or story is just a manner or justifying why you wasted the 1 5 hours in the film the acting was good but that cannot save lack of story i do agree with the one comment posted previously it's like being in some other person's head while they're on drugs in other words nothing makes sense
<START> a bizarre and brilliant combination of talents between the director robert siodmak and ella raines as a secretary trying to save her boss from the electric chair by tracking down a mysterious phantom woman and franchot tone as a crazed and murderous sculptor as well there are some fascinating smaller parts played by elisha cook jr as a drugged out trap drummer as well as the other characters who make up parts of the conspiracy if you're used to seeing raines in more wholesome parts she's allowed to go overboard here especially in her scenes with cook franchot tone also plays someone very different and though it isn't a convincing part he acts phenomenally while the conspiracy is too contrived the film has real atmosphere and is very interesting
<START> i have not seen the first film and if it anything like this have no great desire to br br having just watched it a few hours ago i am struggling to remember a thing about it br br from what i remember it's main plot seems to be a group of very annoying people stay at a house with that dodgy old woman from friday the 13th and are stalked by plank of wood man br br some people die the film ends i am starting a law suit against the person who sold me this film as i want compensation for the missing time in my life br br i will pay u Â£1 to take this film off my hands oh wait i already gave it away to a friend
<START> as a rebuttle of sorts to the afi's top 100 films the british film institute worked out a documentary with martin scorsese br br now i am a huge film fan and pride myself on having seen many many films but i am nowheres in comparrison with my idol in this fantastic though long documentary scorsese walks the viewer through several stages of the american history on film this is divided in to several sections including the western the gangster film and the noir full of bouncy enthusiasm martin scorsese is a great tour guide as well as a fantastic professor
<START> i had the opportunity to see this film twice at the 2006 moving picture festival in birmingham alabama i enjoyed it so much that i watched it a second time when they had an encore screening br br when i think of the films that are shown at festivals i usually expect them to be edgy and offbeat often with the feel of an elaborate student project there's nothing wrong with these types of projects of course and i enjoy the unique styles of independent films but sometimes i want to see a more mainstream approach to independent film making by mainstream i mean more like a film produced for national release in other words a movie that you would see in a regular movie theater br br the writing directing cinematography casting and acting in this movie are all totally pro there is nothing typically independent about this film as an aspiring director i am always looking for movies that will motivate me to stop procrastinating and push harder to get my career going this is one of those films as i watched the big bad swim my motivation level was incredible i felt like my adrenaline had kicked in the reason i felt this way was because i was so impressed with every aspect of this production i left the theater excited and ready to start writing that long put off project when a movie makes me feel like that i know it's really good this is the first feature length project from ishai setton and i found myself wishing that it had been my project for me that's really rare br br see this film it's beautifully shot and directed and the casting is excellent paget brewster delivers a very believable and likable performance she has a quality about her a charisma that really draws you in and keeps you focused on her any time she is on screen she makes you feel like you know her personally as a friend that's a gift i think the industry is really missing out by not utilizing her acting abilities more often jeff branson and jess weixler also did top notch jobs i can not say enough nice things about the big bad swim i look forward to future projects from all of those involved in its production
<START> the director states in the behind the scenes feature that he loves horror movies he loves them so much that he dedicated the movie to dario argento as well as other notable directors such as george a romero and tobe hooper basically dedicating this movie to those great directors is like giving your mother a piece of sh t for mother's day the first thing they did wrong was the casting cast people that can act also don't cast a person that is 40 years old for the role of a misunderstood 18 year old recluse that's right he's been in high school for 22 years the reactions made by people as they watch their boyfriends get their hearts ripped out is amusing or like one part when a guy gets stabbed in the ear with an ear of corn haha get it and his girlfriend just goes oh my god the scarecrow himself is quite a character doing flips off cars and calling people losers br br the movie does have one redeeming factor oh wait no it doesn't br br if you absolutely must see this movie than just watch the rock and roll trailer on the dvd it covers about everything and has a really gnarly song dude
<START> the perfect son is a story about two 30 something brothers one who is seemingly perfect and the other who is basically a screw up frequently landing himself in drug rehab centers after the death of their father the two are brought together after a long absence and the usual sibling rivalry resurfaces it isn't until the perfect brother makes the startling revelation that he has aids that the irresponsible younger brother finally makes a move to get his life in order and take some responsibility br br the movie does a nice job of chronicling the younger brother's comeback though it may seem a bit far fetched at times beating drug addiction is never so easy what makes the film more tender is the treatment of aids a topic that has become somewhat passe in cinema over the last 5 10 years and also the development of an almost sweet relationship between the two formerly feuding brothers is very believable and well done the two main actors were both very competent if not terribly charismatic br br a solid first feature effort from director and writer leonard farlinger whose own brother died of aids the ending is nicely done as well br br
<START> i have seen over 1000 movies and this one stands out as one of the worst movies that i have ever seen it is a shame that they had to associate this garbage to the angels 1963 song my boyfriend's back if you have to make a choice between watching this movie and painful dental work i would suggest the dental work
<START> before dogma 95 when lars used movies as art not just a story a beautiful painting about love and death this is one of my favorite movies of all time the color the music just perfect
<START> since my third or fourth viewing some time ago i've abstained from la maman et la putain while i wait for the dvd in the meantime i've read the french screenplay as well as alain philippon's monograph on jean eustache the latter ends with a frustrating filmography eleven films fiction doc and in between impossible to see or in the cases of mes petites amoureuses and le pÃ¨re noÃ«l re see br br a few questions that hit me this moment polish vÃ©ronika's french is plenty colloquial un maximum d' un maximum d' even so does she have an accent i think i can tell she does what does the absence of color add especially at the single spot the fringe of the city is glimpsed how does this fringe differ from the sleep and journey that separates worlds of the tempest and the winter's tale ditto alphaville we may imagine the elapsed years since have done it but does eustache deliberately circumscribe the film's milieu is this an enchanted isle is alexandre's a fairy tale alexandre's always choreographing himself worrying about how or where to stand or walk what to say when announcing these decisions to who have to care less than he does what he does or is this his way of trying to choreograph others by doing it to himself how different is he from vertigo's scottie i say i think very what's the difference and is there one between eustache's lÃ©aud and truffaut's and godard's how different is the present lÃ©aud isn't he still doing it whatever it is in recent roles irma vep le pornographe whatever approaching old age once i arrived early for one in a series of mostly antoine doinel lÃ©aud's character truffaut films for a long while every three or five minutes down the aisle would come a twenty something male in scarf tweedy coat lÃ©aud hair with a direction seeking nose i have no idea whether this was conscious or unconscious mimicry i was that age but have no idea what i myself looked like then no scarf at least i do have a brother though who seems to have learned his carriage from bresson
<START> i see where a few people involved in this debacle wrote reviews to share their side of the story and i thought what they wrote was helpful in understanding it the fact that they basically came up with excuses rewrites budget constraints production formats etc simply underlines how bad this movie is and my criticisms in panning it are not personally directed but simply a warning that this one doesn't make the cut br br it's watchable but barely so there are plot holes in every corner the dialogue borders on the ridiculous and the ending is telegraphed a mile away the modestly interesting feature of a hologram interacting with a recon team get drowned in silly dialogue like who makes a meal in the midst of what is supposed to be a tense and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy would ya wrassle us up some hamburger helper sally between us getting killed by these automated carpet sweepers apparently this elite team equipped with the latest gizmos and red plastic tubed wonder armor has no access to mres once they get into the last rooms they treat the place more like a four star motel than a deadly encounter zone br br the rationale for the encounter with the fearsome rook is that it can't be killed single handedly yet only one scene ago the hero making that case abandoned king to do exactly that huh vivian woo was attractive and hands down the best acted character in the movie but that's not saying much
<START> who in the world told harrison ford that this was a good role for him br br and josh hartnett how does a 19 year old who can't fire a gun become a cop over used cliches plus zero character development and about 15 pointless music industry cameos equal a surprisingly bad film
<START> this is very nearly a perfect film the ideas would be repeated by mamet but never told so succinctly this is really about the failure of trust of the human condition the film weaves the idea that we are all criminals no one is innocent is there anyone alive today who hasn't seen this play out in our own society every single day the film is very much structured like a hitchcock thriller except there are no more innocent characters the world is now completely polluted ruined and everyone is participating in the con could anything be more true br br don't miss the soundtrack it is wonderful
<START> i viewed the movie together with a homophobic friend my wife and her female friend so i had views from all kinds of directions mainly the film made me laugh the sexual tension was not really there and the only noticeable actors were tudor chirila and maria popistasu yes i do think she played her role well even if the script was not appropriate there were good romanian actors around they just didn't have complex roles i applaud puya's entering the movie business i don't know why but i think he's a good guy i just hope he'll be a good actor br br the wife loved the movie though and i think there might have been chords being played and to which i had no ear for if the film tried to present uncommon sexual behaviors and their consequences in todays romania then it failed miserably there were no consequences just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl and the same story becomes just a boring uninteresting plot br br i have no idea why it got all those bafta awards in my book it should have gotten the better luck next time award bafta good luck in romanian
