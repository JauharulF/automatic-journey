<START> this is the first jean renoir silent film i have watched and perhaps rightly so since it is generally regarded to be his best besides being also his first major work overall it is indeed a very assured and technically accomplished film which belies the fact that it was only renoirâs sophomore effort for fans of the director it is full of interesting hints at future renoir movies especially the diary of a chambermaid 1946 and the golden coach 1952 â in its depiction of a lower class femme fatale madly desired by various aristocrats who disgrace themselves for her â but also the rules of the game 1939 â showing as it does in one sequence how the rowdy servants behave when their masters' backs are turned away from them â and french cancan 1955 â nana is seen having a go at the scandalous dance at one point personally i would say that the film makes for a respectable companion piece to g w pabstâs pandoraâs box 1928 josef von sternbergâs the blue angel 1930 and max ophulsâ lola montes 1955 in its vivid recreation of the sordid life of a courtesan br br having said all that the film was a resounding critical and commercial failure at the time of its release â a âmad undertakingâ as renoir himself later referred to it in his memoirs which not only personally cost him a fortune he eventually eased the resulting financial burden by selling off some of his late fatherâs paintings but almost made him give up the cinema for good stylistically nana is quite different from renoirâs sound work and owes a particular debt to erich von stroheimâs foolish wives 1922 a film renoir greatly admired â and on a personal note one which i really ought to revisit presto having owned the kino dvd of it and the other von stroheims for 4 years now anyway nana is certainly not without its flaws a deliberate pace makes itself felt during the overly generous 130 minute running time with some sequences the horse race around the mid point in particular going on too long br br the overly mannered acting style on display is also hard to take at times â particularly that of catherine hesslingâs nana and raymond guerin catelainâs georges hugon one of her various suitors â¦although technically they are being their characters i e a bad actress who takes to the courtesan lifestyle when she is booed off the stage and an immature weakling respectively however like anna magnani in the golden coach hessling renoirâs wife at the time by the way is just not attractive enough to be very convincing as âthe epitome of eleganceâ as another admirer describes her at one stage who is able to enslave every man she meets other notables in the cast are âdr caligariâ himself werner krauss as nanaâs most fervent devotee count muffat jean angelo as an initially skeptical but eventually tragic suitor of nanaâs and future distinguished film director claude autant lara billed as claude moore and also serving as art director here as muffatâs close friend but who is secretly enamored with the latterâs neglected wife br br the print i watched â via lionsgateâs âjean renoir 3 disc collectorâs editionâ â is for the most part a lovingly restored and beautifully tinted one which had been previously available only on french dvd being based on a classic of french literature by emile zola no less it cannot help but having been brought to the screen several times and the two most notable film versions are dorothy arznerâs in 1934 with anna sten and lionel atwill and which i own on vhs and christian jaqueâs in 1955 with martine carol and charles boyer which i am not familiar with
<START> trash bad movies usually ain't bad because i will find them enjoyable this one is so bad that i am out of words to describe it its below bad there is an instruction in the beginning of the film that tell you what to do during the movie needless to say the instruction and a dozen of beer couldn't help me seat through the entire film one tagliner compares this one to killbill which is certainly unthinkable and an insult to our intelligent obviously this tagliner had a plan to tempt you into buying this dvd br br if you are considering renting this one put it down if you are thinking of buying dont think if you unlucky to have this dvd dont play it throw it in trash bin immediately
<START> after the usual chase scene jerry accidentally winds up inside a bottle of invisible ink which was part of a chemistry set he quickly discovers he's invisible so the predictable results occur meaning he uses his new hidden condition to torment tom jerry often is just defending himself but often he has sadistic streak in him that torments the cat whenever possible even when unprovoked br br here he makes tom think his eyes are deceiving him when cheese from a mousetrap disappears before his eyes or milk from a dish tom can't take anymore so he tries to sleep this nightmare off but jerry sets fire to his paw man i hope little kids didn't ideas watching these cartoons back in the '40s and '50s i always found jerry the little mouse more evil than cute br br thankfully in cartoons generally whatever damage a character suffers is gone within seconds and he's back to normal br br the best part of this cartoon is about two thirds of the way through when tom figures out what the story is with jerry and tries different methods to detect where the mouse is located such as putting flour on the floor to see his footprints
<START> cry freedom is an excellent primer for those wanting an overview of apartheid's cruelty in just a couple of hours famed director richard attenborough gandhi is certainly no stranger to the genre and the collaboration of the real life mr and mrs woods the main white characters in their book and in this film lends further authenticity to cry freedom the video now in release actually runs a little over 2 and a half hours since 23 minutes of extra footage was inserted to make it a two part tv miniseries after the film's initial theatrical release while the added length serves to heighten the film's forgivable flaws uneven character development and blanket stereotyping in particular another possible flaw the insistence on the white characters' fate over that of the african ones may work out as a strength viewing crying freedom as a politically and historically educational film as i think it should over its artistic merits the story is one which black africans know only too well though the younger generation may now need to see it on film for full impact it is the whites who have always been the film's and the book's target audience hopefully driving them to change now twelve years after the movie's production cry freedom is in many ways a more interesting film to watch almost ten years after black majority rule has been at least theorically in place 1987's cry freedom's ideals remain by and large unrealized it therefore remains as imperative as ever for white south africans particularly the younger ones who have only heard of these actions to see it and absorb the film's messages in total contrast to american slavery and the jewish holocaust's exposure south africans' struggles have been told by a mere two or three stories cry freedom cry the beloved country ok count it twice if you include the remake and sarafina did i miss one all three dramas also clumsily feature american and british actors in both the white and black roles not one south african actor has played a major role white coloured indian or black and yes i did miss another international south african drama mandela and deklerk though this also highly recommended biopic was released after black majority rule was instituted mandela was played by a black american sidney poitier who also starred in the original s a themed cry the beloved country while the afrikaner deklerk was played by a bald very british michael caine a good performance if you can dismiss that the very essence of afrikanerdom is vehement anti british feelings until local sabc tv and african films start dealing with their own legacy cry freedom is about as authentic as you'll get as villified as the whites particularly the afrikaners are portrayed in the film any observant non casual visitor to south africa even now in 1999 not to mention 1977 when cry freedom takes place will generally find white's attitudes towards blacks restrained even understated looking at cry freedom in hindsight it is amazing that reconciliation can take place at all and it is but cry freedom at time shows not much has really changed in many people's minds yet and that the black africans' goal to freedom and reconciliation is still ongoing this is why if you're a novice to the situation cry freedom is your best introduction
<START> what did the director think everybody who has read the biography of artemisia is left impressed by her guts to face a public rape trial in renaissance times and even suffer torture in order to show that tassi was guilty that fact shows the real independence and emancipation in her most terrible hour she stands her man why do movies depicting renaissance have to be so clinically beautiful and romantic are we afraid to see the gritty side of life or has the hollywood happy happy mood won while i would always defend a director's freedom to create his own reality in a movie i cannot make sense of turning artimisia's life story on its head very disappointing choice by the makers of this film
<START> heavy handed moralism writers using characters as mouthpieces to speak for themselves predictable plodding plot points say that five times fast a child's imitation of britney spears this film has all the earmarks of a lifetime special reject br br i honestly believe that jesus nebot and julia montejo set out to create a thought provoking emotional film on a tough subject exploring the idea that things are not always black and white that one who is a criminal by definition is not necessarily a bad human being and that there can be extenuating circumstances especially when one puts the well being of a child first however their earnestness ends up being channeled into preachy dialogue and trite situations planted to move the plot along the decent production values and interesting use of documentary style camera footage are not enough to accomplish their aim when the script and the acting fall flat br br logic is often compromised for the sake of creating tension soid first tries to blackmail pablo into participating in her documentary in exchange for helping them escape then in the same breath basically tells him not to trust her because she's not helping them out of altruism well duh and for a man on the run pablo is far too swayed by a temper tantrum cristina's well being is so important to him that he's fleeing capture and jail or deportation for her but he's willing to risk all that to appease her when she doesn't want to go to mexico right talk above over permissive parenting third when pablo's employer charlie gives the phone to detective bright she is remarkably unprofessional especially given her seniority did she really think she was persuasive oh yeah i would have turned myself in cch pounder's detective wims could wipe the floor with her br br to be fair i'd like to list the things i liked um i liked the midget and i liked the fact that the midget was named sexy there's cross dressing always a plus juvenile cross dressing no less harry is infinitely cuter than cristina but my favorite moment in the film has to be when cristina kicks detective not so bright i also find it interesting that in a heavily minority cast which i much appreciate by the way the black character is the racist one too bad it's just thrown out there and not further explored br br there's a distinctive unconventional score but it's nonetheless generally context unspecific not enhancing mood or tension in any scene except the pathetic anguished wailing every time the main character is in anguish as though they think his acting doesn't show it enough 'just in case you weren't sure he's upset and we have the musical cues to prove it ' br br stilted clichÃ©d dialogue results in a depressing lack of subtext everything has to be spelled out in dialogue even when the body language had been up 'til then conveying it just fine for example every impassioned speech pablo makes and mrs knight's lament that her child won't be crawling into bed with them in the morning br br 'papi tell me about mama again' what shameless blatant exposition introducing the generic dead wife she's always the most beautiful woman the widower had ever seen the kindest he had ever met why can't we see a man cry over a woman like shakespeare's she may be fat ugly obnoxious but his love for her is deep as oceans now there's a story which would move me br br the police always being literally one step behind them gives many scenes the out of place feeling of a french farce most boring foot chases ever bright and lightning are so out of shape and easily fooled he certainly isn't quick as lightning and she well i don't feel the need to spell things out some guy dragging along a small child outrunning a bicycle cop complete with macho biker picking a fight but then being felled by a child to quote margaret cho that's so sad would we ever see this on 'cops ' br br hackneyed and over the top deus ex machina as an employer would you really waive checking his green card just because he can quote the author of the inspirational saying on a poster behind your desk br br plus several scenes including the above threaten to devolve into porn 'well i'll do this favor for you as long as you do something for me ' i can almost hear the bowm chicka bowm bowm br br when the parents view the footage shot of pablo's remorse the grieving mom's freak out is the most real the movie feels unfortunately this is diminished by the fact that she looks completely swayed by his emotional speech right up until she goes ballistic a more ambivalent look would be more convincing here br br i'm in constant awe of the stupidity of the main character doing things for the sake of plot holding up a convenience store without a mask visiting the dead girl's grave and why doesn't the mother recognize his face from when she saw him before he drove off 'you seem awfully familiar ' br br what is the purpose of that wholly unnecessary somewhat gratuitous scene with soid and the artificially enhanced bartender character development tch too little too late br br speaking of unnecessary traits that never went anywhere detective lightning's saying skeptical detective bright must be a scorpio shows how little he really knows about the occult and i don't think that believing in fate quite qualifies as voodoo mumbo jumbo br br at the end when bright holds pablo as he dies wait why does she care now her character is as inconsistent as soid's what she has to shoot him just because she said 'stop or i'll shoot' she's cared so much about her integrity thus far he was unarmed there was no need for lethal force what's wrong with shooting him in the leg to immobilize him br br finally cristina's childlike acceptance of her mother's death giving dr knight peace over his daughter's death so forced and the contrivance of the family whose child was killed becoming cristina's new family it angers me that she could be a 'replacement' for their little girl it's also unrealistic that a white couple would take in the latino daughter of the man who killed their own daughter i'm not saying there aren't generous loving people who would do that i'm just saying that the characters here are never developed far enough for me to believe that they would do that br br i find it offensive that another imdb reviewer said that of course as a woman she was moved by the sappy scenes i am a woman who reserves my emotional movements for moments that don't wax sentimental in a manufactured manner br br co writer co director co star nebot said himself he wore too many hats during this production too many cooks may spoil the broth but one cook alone just might end up making an after school special br br in conclusion this film's title has less to do with the story and more to do with the feeling of regret helplessness and loss accompanying the revelation that you will never see your money again
<START> well i have to admit this was one of my favorites as a kid when i used to watch it on a home projector as a super 8 reel now there isn't much to recommend it other than the inherent camp value of actors being terrified by replicas of human skulls the special effects are pretty silly mostly consisting of skulls on wires and superimposed ghost images br br but there's something to be said for the sets the large mansion in which it takes place is pretty creepy especially since it's mostly unfurnished probably due to budgetary reasons br br it definitely inspires more laughs than screams however just try not to get the giggles when the wife who does more than her share of screaming goes into the greenhouse and is confronted with the ghost of her husband's ex
<START> falls into the film category of way too ridiculous in the dialogue and execution departments to be taken seriously whereas shriek if you know what i did last friday the thirteenth or my boyfriend's back know they are bad scarecrows doesn't evil dead set such a high standard for the comedic horror on a budget genre that scarecrows is simply out of place br br suspicions of inexperience are immediately at play as there are no hints of noise or vibration in the hull and cockpit of an airborne plane the repeated display of a picture of 3 men just screams for a story arc but nothing comes although the men are obviously the scarecrows there is no explanation br br knowing this film is too serious for it's own good may produce some grins i don't recall if joe bob briggs ever previewed scarecrows but i believe that he wouldn't stoop this low however with an imdb rating of over 6 there are many people that disagree
<START> titanic is a classic i was really surprised that this movie didn't have a solid ten overall in the imdb user rankings maybe it's just cool to not give titanic credit nowadays but when it was first made it was really something when the movie came out people flocked to the theaters when it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month it was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot like the frozen baby or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd many people died on that ship and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that james cameron stepped up to and let's not forget the amazing romance between jack and rose whether or not their relationship was a figment of someone's imagination it was lovely they barely knew each other but they would die for each other they trusted each other they sure as hell are giving romeo and juliet a run for their money i'll never let go jack titanic is a great film down to it's very core it is a powerful story told through brilliant acting excellent cinematography beautiful music and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers it really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie
<START> there is no reason to see this movie a good plot idea is handled very badly in the middle of the movie everything changes and from there on nothing makes much sense the reason for the killings are not made clear the acting is awful nick stahl obviously needs a better director he was excellent in in the bedroom but here he is terrible amber benson from buffy has to change her character someday even those of you who enjoy gratuitous sex and violence will be disappointed even though the movie was 80 minutes which is too short for a good movie but too long for this one there are no deleted scenes in the dvd which means they never bothered to fill in the missing parts to the characters br br don't spend the time on this one
<START> nice movie with a great soundtrack which spans through the rock landscape of the 70's and 80's radiofreccia describes a generation it describes life in a small village near correggio hometown of ligabue the singer who wrote the book that inspired the movie it describes life of young people and their problems relating to the world it reminds of trainspotting with a bit of italian touch
<START> truly one of the most dire films i've ever sat through i've never actually taken the time to write one of these but felt compelled to after witnessing this affront to film making and feel somewhat aggrieved to be wasting my time on such a piece of turd to be honest there were so many parts that infuriated me with their complete randomness and lack of sense e g when would the police force ever shoot people with infectious diseases when would hospitals ever through out such people for lack of a cure why was the guy who spotted him spying on his wife wandering around outside in his dressing gown whilst carrying a gun as she rolled around on the bed also the characterisation as we've almost come to expect in such films was awful e g the way the blonde guy i don't remember his frickin name and don't give a toss anyway completely turned against his girlfriend and ran off to leave her and i ended up wanting them all to meet grisly ends the production was horribly disjointed and the cinematography nothing to write home about
<START> this is a nice little horror flick that fans of indie films will really appreciate it has good acting lots of gore and a decent plot one will be reminded of movies like the hills have eyes and pumpkinhead it's obvious that the budget was not all that big but the film really makes up for it with atmosphere and solid performances by the actors which seems to be lacking in a lot of today's big budget special effects filled films the film really moves along and there is excellent direction and good camera work there are no wasted scenes so the film's length is a bit short in addition it looks like the ending leaves an opening for a sequel which would be very interesting as well so grab some popcorn turn down the lights and enjoy this one
<START> well well roeg touched a bit of a nerve there didn't he he was a genius while he was cataloguing his various characters' descents into psychosis for a couple of decades but as soon as he has the bad taste to suggest that redemption or even some good advice might be found in the bad old catholic church the hipper than thou alternative movie crowd gets extra vicious worse still theresa russell's character faced with experiences that nothing in her avowedly rationalist outlook has an explanation for is unwillingly forced to deal with those experiences on another level that of the spiritual you know the realm of the ignorant and superstitious the sort of thing that the art house cinephiles are supposed to be above oh the horror so she finds her marriage the idea that it might be a uniquely important commitment affirmed by what seems uncomfortably like divine intervention people who find this idea prima facie offensive could maybe ask themselves why they instinctively jump into attack mode at being challenged to take seriously the idea of a spiritual dimension to their lives but they probably won't sure this film has some problems notably talia shire's delirious hamwork as the overwrought nun 1950s style attire and all and the dialogue between marie davenport and the young priest in their last scene is straight out of the spellbound school of glib interpretations though hitchcock's movie escaped similar charges due to the source of wisdom having impeccably secular credentials as a freudian psychoanalyst but sadly nicolas roeg appears to have copped a critical mauling as much for even asking the question as for the possible answers this film presents
<START> i absolutely loved this movie it was so good this movie is told by the parrot paulie's point of view paulie is given to the little girl marie as a present paulie helps marie learn to talk and they become best friends but when paulie tells marie to fly she falls and the bird is sent away that's when the adventure begins paulie goes through so much to find his way back to marie this movie is so sweet funny touching sad and more when i first watched this movie it made me cry the birds courage and urge to go find his marie for all that time was so touching i must say that the ending is so sweet and sad but you'll have to watch it to find out how it goes at the end the janitor tries to help him after hearing his story will he find his long lost marie or not find out when you watch this sweet heart warming movie it'll touch your heart rating 10
<START> just cause is a flawed but decent film held together by strong performances and some creative though exceedingly predictable writing sean connery is an anti death penalty crusader brought in to save a seemingly innocent young black man blair underwood from the ultimate penalty to set things right connery ventures to the scene of the crime where he must contend not only with the passage of time but a meddling sheriff laurence fishbourne twists and turns and role reversals abound some surprising some not as the aging crusader attempts to unravel the mystery the climactic ending is a bit ludicrous but just cause is worth a look on a slow night
<START> you can tell they spent 5 making this it is a waste of your time ugh there is not anything remotely good about this movie i don't know why i kept watching it the chick is not hot horrid acting you could do anything and its a better use of your time like watching tv playing shitty video games i feel robbed simply robbed of my time i have never made a review for a movie before as you can probably tell but this movie i felt like i needed to save the poor souls that are about to watch it and looking on imdb before to see if its decent and looking at the comments there was no action no hot chicks no budget shittttttttttttttty acting it screams bad movie the whole movie is in a room
<START> deep shock plays out like a tv movie a whole cast of commercial quality actors a poorly designed creature to be the bad guy and a script that is more full of technical political jargon and importances than it knows what to do with br br i checked out the movie because of the creature i love to see what filmmakers have in mind for their designs in these cheaply made videos and right off the bat i got disappointed because the creature on the box was not the one in the movie the actors i expected because of the type of film it is really quite generic and not thought out past a certain point the music was typical not thought out action symphonic music br br i liked the design of the computers and technical equipment along with the mini sub design the movie even flowed really well with guiding screens letting you know which set you're watching the story unfold in but there isn't much of a story here anyways br br this movie gets a 3 10 stars imo the boring search and destroy mission to blow up the north pole and these creatures protecting it kinda lame even lamer is the tagged on love relationship between two of the characters that you don't see coming chalk this one up to being a movie which tries to get actors' careers off the bench and into a video don't bother
<START> i have been looking for this movie for so many years i saw this move when i was nine and loved this movie i called disney all the movie stores and the net no luck what a waste it was a very good movie it will be missed
<START> wow this is very unusual in one regard usually the first movie in a long string of sequels is the best of the bunch people are surprised when a sequel is actually better with tarzan i thought this movie was the worst of the bunch or at least the first six which comprise my tarzan collection dvd package i will gladly watch the sequels multiple times but i am through sitting through this turkey thanks to several characters br br well let's start with the good news first br br the good plenty of action with a lot of wild animals on display even if they are just stock footage you see lion attacks crocodiles hippos panthers you name it and you see several of the different tribes of all kinds including pygmies called dwarfs in the movie since this movie was made almost 75 years ago i can't knock any of the realism because they didn't have it in the movies that long ago they do the best they can so you put up with actors talking in front of fake backgrounds however weissmuller did a lot of action scenes and was in great shape he and o'sullivan make a well built handsome couple if there ever was one in those golden years of cinema br br the film has historical value with so many sequels in that it shows how tarzan acquired jane and his beginnings of learning the english language br br the bad from the moment jane parker is taken by tarzan almost every scene with her is maureen o'sullivan in hysterics shrieking and screaming scene after scene it's enough to give you a headache and it ruins the film thankfully she calmed down in the sequels but not in this movie the movie also does no favors for the great white hunter image as c aubrey smith playing jane's father and neil hamilton as harry holt the safari guide shoot at every animal within sight whether the beasts is threatening or not these people are kill happy particularly smith on another note it's too bad there isn't anything in here explaining how tarzan got to be in the jungle in the first place there is no history of him in here or footage of his growing up he's just there when jane and the group get to a certain point in africa
