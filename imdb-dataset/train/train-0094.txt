<START> i love the 80s slasher flicks and i remember when silent night deadly night was pulled from our theaters i was very disappointed so i was very excited to see some of these on fear net you better watch out was what i've come to expect of these types of movies the quality of the special effects were laughable by today's standards the character development too long but all in all it was laugh out loud funny br br the scenes where he loses it because santa aka dad is feeling up his mom and later when the mob is actually shown lighting torches not flashlights as you would in the 80s but real torches really tickled my funny bone however the scenes where he was checking on the kids in his neighborhood gave me a creepy feeling of a different nature i also enjoyed trying to figure out who some of these character actors were it took me awhile to figure out that the main character was the lovable teddy bear on brothers
<START> this is a review of the later english release by disney featuring alison lohman patrick stewart and co br br i really wanted this film to be good really really i'm a huge fan of princess mononoke and spirited away and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this earlier miyazaki film i was eager to see it but i was shocked shocked i say at the quality of this film those later films boast well crafted plots 3 dimensional characters and the best film music since well ever this film just doesn't come close br br might as well start w the positive aspects though like all miyazaki films this one is still very imaginative with a bizarre fantasy sci fi setting in a post apocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species nausicaa can also boast some far superior animation to other films from its time though not as beautiful and fluid as miyazaki's later films and the english voice acting is quite well done br br but this film just isn't good the characters are all cardboard from saccharine sweet little nausicaa to the ruthlessly evil tolmekians to everyone in between once you've seen each of them for 30 seconds you've seen all there is and the fact that the plot just ambles along doesn't help br br then there's the music now hisaichi is hands down my favorite film composer but nausicaa doesn't do him justice half the music is 80's keyboards on overdrive and it usually enters and leaves so abruptly that it distracts the visuals rather than helping them i highly suspect that hisaichi was told to compose a lot of the music before he even saw the picture br br but wait there's a great message with this film right let's all save the environment too bad that this film hits you over the head with it like a sledgehammer there is a scene in which nausicaa hugs a tree no really i ain't kidding br br it makes me a little sad to talk about how lame this film is but for some reason all the other reviews on imdb seem to adore it and when the characters have to talk to themselves in extended sentences to tell you what's going on that's lame br br if you're the kind of person who worships anime enjoys 80's music and plants a tree every arbor day you will probably like this film otherwise save your money for his later films because they rock big time
<START> want to watch a scary horror film then steer clear of this one there's not enough beer in the world to make this film enjoyable br br however there is enough scotch single malt if you can manage it br br if the previous comments weren't enough to keep you from watching this film sober allow me to assist nasa sends one man and two unpaid extras into space to orbit saturn a really big solar flare causes colonel steve west to bleed from the nose things go downhill from there and wackiness ensues br br i actually read the book adaptation which was published and released only in the uk miles better than the film and the book was dreadful at least some pretense is made towards suspense and some sort of explanation of events is pulled out from the author's rhymes with 'gas' br br not to say that the film is completely without merit rick baker learned that he really ought to read a contract before signing on to a film and jonathan demme found that he's really better suited to direct br br yes there is an mst3k episode featuring this flick but it is of course edited quite a bit without the obligatory flashing of the breasts not even the healing power of scotch can save you br br please just go watch raiders of the lost ark if you want to see a guy melt see space cowboys if you feel the need to see astronauts i can not in all good conscience recommend this film to the sober film going public
<START> fiction film it lists as based on a story though it does have a documented by credit about a group of scientists going into the wilds of canada to try and find a bigfoot they want to capture one and then attach a tracking device its lots of scientific mumbo jumbo mixed in what is really a dull film of a bunch of people wandering around in the wilderness there are some attempts at creating tension and scares but to be perfectly honest there is nothing here worth seeing outside of some great looking shots of the wilds this is a perfect definition of an exploitation film it promises you so much a look at bigfoot but in reality it delivers very little recommended for insomniacs only
<START> full of spoilers br br this is a pretty fast and enjoyable crime thriller based on ira levin's play about two gay playwrights caine and reeve that plot the murder of one's rich wife cannon to get the property and the insurance the plot succeeds but christopher reeve as the younger and less established of the two writers decides to make a play out of the actual murder with only slight changes in the details reeve allows that easthampton long island can become southampton long island in the script for instance the rest of the play's plot is a dead giveaway and to tell the truth reeve doesn't mind a little gossip or even an inquiry into cannon's apparently accidental death it will boost the revenues and his own warhol quotient br br michael caine is sidney bruhl the megabucks making playwright whose last four productions bombed and who would like nothing more than to quietly get back to working on a new play perhaps with reeve's input that would redeem his reputation he cannot permit reeve's scandalous play a clef to be produced so what else he tries to murder him in the end they wind up killing one another the manuscript is appropriated by their neighbor the psychic helga tensdoorp and she makes a million bucks selling it to broadway br br it's a lot of fun for a number of reasons one is the production design that multi roomed multi storied house with the big windmill atop situated on nine of what must be the most valuable acres on earth easthampton would be a splendid set of digs anywhere you wouldn't be able to afford a pup tent in easthamptom the house is not overly large or baroque in its decor it's just magnificently modest although it's a little tidy for my tastes the kind of house that's so clean you're afraid to step on the thick carpet for fear of leaving the imprint of a foot br br next the acting could hardly be improved upon caine cannon and fred jones are superb dyan cannon gives a pitch perfect performance as the anxious wife whose slacks are so tight they look as if they'd been sprayed on which is okay given her assets even reeve whose talent was limited seems to find a comfortable niche in his role of affable but psychopathic murderer irene worth as the psychic neighbor helga was in some way hard to define a mistake granted she or someone like her was necessary to the plot but my god what an offensive snoop her character is going around and claiming i feel pain in zis woom i suppose in order to make her a little more interesting she's got up in sweats and a goofy looking cap with bicycle reflectors on it still she's a nuisance from beginning to end br br you have to love ira levin's bitchy dialog the distraught caine begs reeve to tell him why he wrote the tell all play because it's there sidney says reeve and caine shouts that's mountains not plays plays aren't there until some hole writes them great too is caine's call to the police after his wife drops dead of fright as planned he works himself up into a torrent of sobs barely able to speak as he reports the incident and implores that an ambulance be sent immediately when he hangs up his face assumes its usual placid expression he blows his nose into his handkerchief and walks away all business again br br the climax though suitably ironic is confusing and noisy and full of artifice lacking in the wicked charm that levin and lumet brought to the earlier scenes the score is mostly made up of light hearted riffs on the harpsichord neatly fitting into the film br br you'll probably enjoy it
<START> alain resnais films are uncanny in the way that they aren't really edited for continuity but instead the shot seems to finish right where a memory has edited love unto death is at times a quiet existential drama and a roundly creative magical realist movie and either way treats the audience to a whole new aspect of the eros thanatos relationship or perhaps creates a new relationship that of agape thanatos br br the beginning is like a bizarre surrealist horror movie a woman desperately runs around the house while a man lays dying in his bed did she kill him or what happened soon that tension is dissolved as a doctor arrives and pronounces him dead but from there a newer stranger drama begins the man wakes up and after being dead the woman and man fall in love to actually quite tragic consequences meanwhile their friends who are both priests watch on and submit their own debate into the nature of love faith and devotion br br resnais always seems to have some device to make these sorts of narratives work and what's so amazing about his films is that those devices always work in this case resnais intercuts the scenes with shots of snow falling to an arousing orchestral score which fades off and bleeds into the subsequent shots that continue the story trapped in this elegiac aside periodically the film develops a rhythm not too unlike an epic poem and i got strange flashbacks to dante's divine comedy from this one despite the lack of direct reference within the movie resnais is known as a very poetic filmmaker but this extends past just the cinepoem structure to something that forces a degree of introspection in the viewer which has the possibility to bring to surface some odd recollections memory narrative resnais creates br br polarisdib
<START> come on what is the deal with this show power rangers anyways i always felt that the show which was originally brought over from japan in a better form took what was great in japan and turned into one of the most ridiculous and pointless excuses in toy merchandising history there is absolutely no point with this show whatsoever br br the bad haircuts bad costumes earrings etc all show what was ridiculous back in the 1990s from the two idiots bulk and skull to the duhs of the main cast jason trini tommy kimberly billy and zack i just want to say one thing give me a break br br saban brought this from japan and then disney bought the rights to this show around five years ago br br now the public has to endure reruns of this show on the disney channel and such br br all i can say once again is give me a break
<START> because of the 1988 writers guild of america strike they had to shoot this episode in 3 days it's pretty much crap consisting of repeat cut pasted clips from season 2 and was described by its writer maurice hurley as terrible just terrible br br why the producers couldn't just wait to shoot something decent who knows i'm guessing because of the strike the production ran out of money and could only release a flashback episode or maybe roddenberry was too sick at the time to be able to veto this half assery this episode also marks the final appearance of diana muldaur dr katherine pulaski on the series
<START> the film must have been shot in a day there are scenes where you can see the camera reflections and its red pointer even the scenery's green light that blends with the actors the plot and the lines are really awful without even the slightest inspiration at least as a thriller genre movie everything that got to do with poe in the movie has a shallow and childish approach the film is full of clise and no thrilling if you want to watch a funny b movie for a relaxing evening with friends then go for it you will enjoy it as i did but there's no way to take this film seriously
<START> ted v mikels's film corpse grinders 2 is 103 minutes of excruciating cinematic swill the plot is pretty much a mixture of nonsensical business dealings among people who grind corpses into cat food while cat aliens who are losing a war with dog aliens looking to get some of this cat food watching this movie i began to look for any kind of distraction anything to reassure myself that i was doing something else besides losing my mind from the inside out br br several scenes go on for far too long as characters take forever to do simple things i've heard that mr mikels doesn't like to use jump cuts too often fearful that they will confuse his audience i'm not sure if this attitude is avant garde or just stupid try as i might i could not bring myself to care about any of the characters in the unnecessarily huge cast well with the possible exception of the old men who are the caretakers of the factory the majority of the cast are a bunch of no talent amateurs who don't even bother to learn the lyrics to amazing grace before they have to sing it on camera although perhaps the blame should go to the poor sound quality since i only actually heard around 80 of the dialogue while watching the dvd br br this is quite possibly the worst film to ever be shot i've listened to snippets of the commentary and mr mikels comes off as a surprisingly sweet old man what the hell was he doing making this kind of trash i'd like to hear the explanations from the old men who had to lie shirtless on a metal conveyor belt waiting to be ground up movies i've long hated suddenly seem a lot better i long for the intermittedly appropriate music of excalibur and the consistent lighting of dawn of the dead i need to go do something anything don't see this movie
<START> yes this is a horror anthology film and it was a lot of fun that's because although the film clearly was horror some of the stories had a light spirit and there were even occasionally a few laughs this isn't at all a bad thing as sometimes horror films are a bit stuffy and overly serious because of this and because all four of the stories were pretty good it's one of the better movies of this style i have seen br br the unifying theme that connects each story is the house itself four different stories involve people who either rent the home or investigate what happened to the tenants br br the first segment starred denholm elliott as a horror writer who has writer's block so for a change of scenery they rent this house almost immediately elliott's block vanishes and he works steadily on a tale about a serial killer amazingly soon after his block vanishes he begins to actually see his fictional character again and again the psychotic killer appears and then disappears making it seem as if he is losing his mind this might just be the best of the stories as the nice twist ending makes the story come alive br br the second while not bad at all is probably the weakest peter cushing plays a bachelor who is pining for a girl friend who died some time ago though the picture of her looked amazingly contemporary when he enters a chamber of horrors wax museum in town he sees a wax figure that reminds him of his lost lady and he is both fascinated and scared by this later a friend joss ackland visits and he too sees the figure and is entranced by it this all leads to an ending that frankly was a bit of a letdown br br christopher lee then stars as an incredibly harsh and stern father to a pathetic little girl during most of this segment lee seemed like an idiot but in the end you can understand his demeanor though slow this one ended very well br br the fourth segment was the silliest and was meant to parody the genre jon pertwee the third doctor from the dr who television series is a very temperamental actor known for his portrayals of dracula however nothing is right about the film according to him and in a fit of pique he stomps off the set to find better props for this vampire film it's actually pretty interesting that he played this role as it seemed like a natural for christopher lee who played dracula or other vampires a bazillion times give or take a few i enjoyed pertwee's line when he basically said that lee's and other recent incarnations of dracula were all crap compared to bela lugosi's perhaps this is why lee didn't take this part despite some very silly moments it was very entertaining and fun possibly as good or better than the first segment br br considering that the film started and ended so well had excellent acting and writing it's hard not to like this film
<START> for the life of me i cannot get why they would want to make a movie about the jerry springer show it's so incrediably trashy some ways sadly it's a guilty pleasure we all have to admit that we've seen at least one episode it's part of our pop culture i saw this on usa recently it's pretty bad i will admit that jerry does a horrible job of what i think he meant as acting or something like it jamie pressley is in it she's playing herself basically all she needed was her lover boy kid rock it would've been perfect then so i would recommend skipping ringmaster just watch the jerry springer show it's more enjoyable than this br br 2 10
<START> extremely well conceived part whatever happened to part behind the scenes revisitation part reunion film all done in the same campy style that made the original series so much fun i only wish this had been done 10 years ago to include more guest villains who have passed on
<START> this italian movie is basically a soap opera with skin br br the vhs box said it was rated r but the into on the actual tape inside said it was x the latter makes a lot more sense because there is a short scene near the end that was shocking even in the dark you could see dutch actress marishcka detmers performing all sex on this guy and yes you could see his penis in her mouth i read somewhere that this was the first time where a mainline actress had done something like this on screen br br detmers parades around in the nude on several scenes but her face was even better than her body she looked beautiful unfortunately the movie is ugly a real waste of time and certainly not recommended despite detmers' looks
<START> since this is black history month and i'm reviewing the achievements of many african americans on film in chronological order i got this movie on vhs from the library because duke ellington and his orchestra were in it their jazz version of franz liszt's rhapsody was the highlight of this mostly overlong murder mystery musical comedy mixture many other numbers i liked were kitty carlisle's especially sweet marijuana carl brisson's cocktails for two as well as his duet with carlisle on that earlier and the ones by gertrude michael who's great as the woman you love to hate jack oakie and victor mclaglen probably go a little too long with their love hate banter as the producer and detective but they grow on you and toby wing is a sexy dumb tease as nancy who keeps trying to say something to oakie but gets a not now from him every time while many of the characters have a motive for the murders that happen i wasn't surprised by the revelation of who done it and get a load of how naked the women here are though of course their breasts are covered either by their hands or some flimsy top this was very obviously pre code worth a look for any film buff interested in this sort of thing p s as a long time louisiana resident i like noting when someone was born here as carlisle was a new orleans native
<START> my super ex girlfriend is an entertaining movie no more no less br br the story is quiet simple matt saunders luke wilson meets jenny uma thurman on the subway and hooks up with her in the beginning of their relationship everything seems to be ok but then matt finds out that she's g girl at first that seems really cool to matt but it turns out that g girl is very jealous and needy so he decides to break up with her and hook up with his colleague hannah anna faris this makes g girl very mad and she starts to avenge herself on her former boyfriend br br what i liked most in the movie are the scenes where g girl avenges herself on matt it was also nice to see anna faris in another role then her character from the scary movie saga br br i give this movie a 7 out of 10 and recommend it to anybody who likes a nice comedy
<START> tsui hark's visual artistry is at its peek in this movie unfortunately the terrible acting by ekin cheng and especially cecilia cheung i felt the urge to strangle her while watching this it's that bad made it difficult to watch at times br br this movie is a real breakthrough in the visual department when i first saw this my jaw dropped repeatedly and i thought to myself that i've never seen anything remotely like it but this is how it should be done in order to do full justice to the mythical world of chinese historical kung fu novels without a doubt this is one of the best looking chinese historical kung fu epic ever made br br but alas tsui hark hasn't improved much in the writing department and the story and dialog are rather juvenile his apparent obsession with the silly and overly long depiction of the evil guys didn't help either to make it worse this movie is very badly cast they decided to use the hot popular hong kong idols as lead characters but unfortunately both ekin cheng and especially cecilia cheung are totally unsuited for historical kung fu dramas because they lack the nobility and mystique that such characters are supposed to embody adam cheng siu chow and brigitte lin in the 1983 version are infinitely better br br i wish that someday zhang yi mou and tsui hark can join forces and produce a movie that has the visual artistry of tsui but with the maturity and story telling poetry of zhang
<START> annie potts is the only highlight in this truly dull film mark hamill plays a teenager who is really really really upset that someone stole the corvette he and his classmates turned into a hotrod quite possibly the ugliest looking car to be featured in a movie and heads off to las vegas with annie to track down the evil genius who has stolen his pride and joy br br i would have plucked out my eyes after watching this if it wasn't for the fun of watching annie potts in a very early role and it's too bad for hamill that he didn't take a few acting lessons from her danny bonaduce also makes a goofy cameo
<START> i didn't think it was possible for a horror comedy film to fail so abysmally on both fronts really awful the fact that it doesn't take itself seriously usually a good thing works against it primarily because the actors are so wooden you really would swear they are reading cue cards on the upshot though the mst3k version as always has a few laughs
<START> the release of tarzan the ape man in 1932 caused a sensation it may be hard to believe 70 years later but the film had much of the same kind of impact as the matrix or the lord of the rings has achieved at a time when movies and radio were the major sources of entertainment tarzan became an instant pop icon the 'noble savage' that every woman fantasized about and every man wished he could be the only person unhappy about the situation was edgar rice burroughs who while he'd agreed to mgm's creative liberties and enjoyed his hefty royalty checks felt the 'dumbed down' version of his character with no plans to allow him to 'grow' was unfaithful to his vision he would start a production company and soon be making his own 'tarzan' films mgm realizing the value of it's newest 'star' knew the sequel would have to be even more spectacular than the original and tarzan and his mate delivered br br the film had an interesting back story cedric gibbons mgm's legendary art director had gotten a commitment from the studio to direct the sequel prior to the release of tarzan the ape man despite the fact that he'd never directed before the studio hadn't anticipated the film's impact and didn't think a novice director would matter much on a 'novelty' film and they wanted to keep their oscar winning department chief happy gibbons a prodigiously talented and imaginative visual artist loved the freedom of pre code hollywood and decided to have tarzan and his mate 'push the envelope' to the limit tarzan and jane would frolic in a nude swim and jane would appear topless through most of the film maureen o'sullivan said in an interview shortly before her death in 1998 that while a double was used for the swim she trusted the studio and did 'a couple of days' of filming sans top but it became too much of a headache trying to strategically place plants and fruit to block her nipples and the idea was abandoned the film shot those days would be worth a fortune she did do a nude silhouette scene in a tent flashed her breasts at the conclusion of her 'swim' and donned a revised 'jungle' costume that was extremely provocative very thin and open at the sides and the resulting outcry would help 'create' the hays office and the self censorship that would soon engulf the entire industry br br mgm yanked gibbons from the production the 'official' reason given was his workload as art director and veteran jack conway was listed as the new director to appease the critics although james c mckay actually directed the film as conway was busy on 3 other projects including viva villa br br the film incorporated the best elements of the original safaris murderous tribes tarzan fighting jungle beasts to the death to save jane and actually improved on the storytelling harry holt neil hamilton from the first film returns to africa for ivory from the 'elephants' graveyard' and to try to seduce jane into returning to england with gifts of silk dresses underwear and perfume he brings with him martin arlington paul cavanagh a crack shot and inveterate womanizer who sneers at holt's chivalrous pursuit of jane and stalks her as a potential 'conquest' to be had by any means including killing tarzan if and when he can get away with it without being seen br br tarzan barely tolerates the intrusion into his happy life with jane and puts his foot down refusing to allow the hunters into the graveyard arlington finds his opportunity catching the ape man alone and shoots him then returns to the camp with a fabricated story of his demise now jane has no reason to remain in the jungle and she can direct them to the graveyard before her long voyage back to england comforted by the oh so sympathetic arlington but a savage tribe and hideous torture await the group can tarzan being nursed back to health by his ape 'family' recover in time to save jane br br while stock footage is again used extensively the racial stereotypes of the 30s are apparent and the gorillas are obviously actors in ape suits tarzan and his mate achieves a level of sophistication unsurpassed in any other 'tarzan' film as well as a sexiness that even bo derek's blatantly erotic tarzan the ape man couldn't touch johnny weissmuller was in peak condition physically maureen o'sullivan was never more beautiful and 'africa' never looked more romantic and dangerous br br tarzan and his mate was a triumph although it would be drastically edited for many years and remains the classic of the series to this day
