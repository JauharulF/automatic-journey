<START> yokai daisenso is a children's film by takashi miike but as you might expect it's probably a bit too dark scary for younger ones however older children may well eat this up that is if you play it dubbed in english br br the story is that of a young boy who has moved with his mother to the country to live with his grandfather after a divorce during a village festival the boy is chosen as a kirin rider a great honor but with that honor comes much danger and adventure of course br br meanwhile evil doings are at hand as a woman in a white mini skirt go go boots a beehive hair do teams up with an evil yokai to turn people's resentments and discarded items against them and this evil has manifested itself as a flying city in the form of a monster that heads for the city of rage itself tokyo one quite funny scene has two derelicts watching the monster fly over the city says one oh it's only gamera br br the young boy has befriended yokai which are monsters of a kind mostly benign that have isolated themselves away from humans and all the yokai in japan band together to fight the evil br br in many ways miike crew have taken the late 60's early 70's yokai films and turned them into a modern action adventure film for older kids that also combines some strange mechanical monsters that made me think of transformers the look and feel of the film is great the effects are entertaining and some of the humor will just sail right over kid's heads but still older ones might enjoy it as for adults there's not much here not to like if you're a fan of japanese monster movies you'll enjoy the heck out of this br br cool fun stuff kind of dark at times but perhaps that's just miike and what a wild ride 8 out of 10
<START> this is a thriller with a good concept good acting good photography and good intentions all around but which is confused and disjointed in execution br br garcia stars as john berlin an l a forensic detective who has moved to a small california town at the behest of a friend of his on the force there he soon becomes involved in the investigation of an unsolved murder which leads to his theorizing about the existence of a serial killer whom no one else believes in the known victim is theorized to be blind which leads to a romance with a blind girl believed to be a witness at a nearby school for the blind br br despite a basically intriguing story there were too many quantum leaps and plot holes in this movie where i found myself wondering 'how the hell did we wind up here ' or 'how did we find this out ' i found it confusing and disjointed despite the good acting etc john malkovich has a small part toward the end as an f b i investigator out to get berlin br br not recommended
<START> i recently rented the animated version of the lord of the rings on video after seeing the fantastic 2001 live action version of the film the lord of the rings live action trilogy directed by peter jackson will undoubtably be far better than george lucas' star wars prequel trilogy episodes 1 3 will ever be as the real fantasy film series of the 21st century br br i remember seeing the animated version as a child and i didn't quite understand the depth of the film at that time now that i have read the books i understand what the whole storyline is all about to be sure some of the characters are quite silly samwise gangee is particularly annoying almost as much as jar jar binks in star wars episode one awful but i have to say it follows the book rather closely and it goes into part of book two the two towers the good things are that the action is somewhat interesting and some of the animation is quite remarkable for it's time the bad things are that it ends upruptly halfway through the two towers without any result of frodo's quest to destroy the one ring and the animation looks quite dated compared to today's standards br br overall not as bad as many say it is but the 2001 live action version is the new hallmark of the lord of the rings at least ralph bakshi took the script seriously peter jackson has said that the animated version inspired him to read the books which in turn caused him to create one of the greatest fantasy series ever put on film so we can at least thank ralph bakshi for that matter i'll take the animated version of lord of the rings over the live version of harry potter anyday br br a 7 out of a scale of 1 10 far less violent than the 2001 live action version but nowhere near as good for diehard fans of the books and film versions of the lord of the rings
<START> i voted 3 for this movie because it looks great as does all of greenaways output however it was his usual mix of art sex and pretentious crap i know lots of people like this film but i grew tired of it very quickly it is definitely not for everyone the ubiquitous mcgregor obviously took the part for crediblity's sake i guess but he really should not have wasted his time i hate to consign anyone to pseud's corner but please on the plus side it is visually very attractive and i enjoyed the music but could not see it through to the end and i cannot say that for many movies i usually watch the whole thing but this is unbearable
<START> one of john ford's best films 'the informer' doesn't feature any grand scenery of the american west instead the intense drama ford was known for plays out on the no less rugged terrain of british character actor victor mclaglen's face the former prizefighter who once faced joe louis in the ring delivers an academy award winning portrayal of disgraced ira soldier gypo nolan on the worst night of his life br br the plot is gracefully simple in 1922 dublin a starving and humiliated man who's been thrown out of the ira for being unable to kill an informant in cold blood himself becomes an informant for Â£20 he betrays a friend to the tans and for the rest of the night he drinks and gives away his blood money in rapidly alternating spasms of guilt denial self pity and a desperate desire to escape the consequences of his actions br br it is the remarkable complexity given to the character of the seemingly simple gypo that is the film's most impressive achievement in most movies a burly lout of gypo's type would be cast as the heavy he'd have at best two or three lines and be disposed of quickly so the hero and the villain could have their showdown in 'the informer' gypo himself is both hero and villain while the showdown is in his inner turmoil every bit of which is explicitly shared with the audience br br because liam o'flaherty's novel had previously been filmed in 1929 rko gave ford a very modest budget the director and his associates particularly cinematographer joseph h august turned this to their advantage in creating a claustrophobic masterpiece about a man at war with himself in addition to mclaglen's oscar 'the informer' also won john ford his first along with wins for best screenplay and best score
<START> alright before we review i have to ask why isn't this listed individually it may have been merely a tv item in italy but to international lamberto bava fans this is its own film in america this film is distributed on vhs and dvd as either the ogre or demons 3 yes i know it has nothing to do with demons apart from one cast member and the crew but yes i personally was upset that this was so hard to find on this site which is otherwise so useful br br finally let's review the ogre i've seen the trailer for this many times on youtube and honestly found that rather scary the movie itself it is feature length therefore making it a movie has many many strong parts and does manage to scare i was displeased by the last act but on the whole i don't regret having bought the dvd before seeing it available from shriek show i guess the film's tv origins explain the last act i won't give out any spoilers br br the plot is somewhat familiar an american horror writer vacationing at an ancient spooky castle with husband and son only to find it exactly resembles the setting of her childhood nightmares there are faint echoes of the shining but this is a different brand of supernatural horror the woman virginia bryant finds more and more proof that this is the real life place of her nightmares but her husband won't believe her great atmosphere and terror follow br br the multiple nightmare sequences were pretty freaky the ogre cocoon effect was good it reminded me a bit of uncle frank's resurrection from the first hellraiser there's also a few good shocks and a well done underwater scene i give them props that the film never stooped to imitating american films with similar concepts namely a nightmare on elm street the ogre is an original and the monster itself was a scary one when it was presented correctly br br on the shriek show dvd there is a lamberto bava interview in which he is careful to mention that this is not part of his classic demons series he also gives a lot of credit to the real castle in which the movie was filmed indeed this setting contributes a lot to the film the simon boswell music helps too br br there's lots of good stuff here the ogre is not perfect but it is very much worth seeing take it is a lesser lamberto bava achievement
<START> i thought that this movies was a letdown i expected it to be so much better than it was i am so glad i didn't pay to see this movie and that i didn't sit in a movie theater for this one where to begin on this movie the acting in this movie was average the humor was terrible and just the overall storyline of this movie wasn't special i thought that this movie was suppose to be great but it wasn't more than a cheesy waste of time i think that the acting in this movie was terrible no of the actors in this movie had chemistry it just wasn't there i think that if maybe we had a different actor play kirk than jay baruchel it might have been better but the entire time i watched this movie he looked high and i didn't get the feeling that he wasn't acting in this movie now alice eve did a great job as an actress but there was no chemistry between her and jay all the actors in this movie were no names and had very little affect in this movie the humor in this movie was not funny at all there were a few one liners in this movie that were ok but nothing worth saying to your friends that they would understand i think that jim field smith had a hard time with this because he couldn't decide if he wanted a romance or a comedy i honestly think he needs to stick with the burger king commercials i think that this movie could have been better if the writers would have gone to a different director the storyline of this movie is just like every other hot girl just ok guy love storyÂboring i think that it would have been better if it had more originality but what a letdown nothing i honesty would not recommend anyone go see this movie i think that you would have more entertainment at the dentist than at this movie so save yourself the agony and just don't see it
<START> metro goldwyn mayer is a very lost player in the short cartoon market this market is essentially dominated by the looney tunes and the merry melodies shorts coming from warner bros but mgm is also able of releasing hidden gems like to spring an astonishing story about the most beautiful season of the year br br in the environment depicted here spring isn't caused by natural cycles but is fabricated and by who by little male elves who live below ground each spring when the snow begins to melt they start working they begin by felling rainbow rock columns then reducing them to rubble and using this rubble to turn it into color fluids which will be moved up to the ground and bearing grass flowers in other words spring the first half of the cartoon depicts spring's fabrication but the second part is a little bit different old man winter comes back and he tries to extend winter by destroying the elves' work so from this point we assist to a battle between the elves and old man winter br br the music heard here is deliciously wonderful the melodic parts stick in the head like an ink spot on a paper sheet the second part melodies are thrilling and they perfectly fit with the action this is just fantastico giorgio the animation sequences are also a delight the colors are well mixed and every little detail is shown into a massive epic environment the concept itself is brilliant the elves are attracting characters so is old man winter who effectively portrays the cold and ruthless feelings of the white season br br there's also a strong message included here the battle seems lost for the elves at the end until a single late arriving elf jump into the action and it leads to the elves' victory over winter so the point is only one single person can make the difference br br in conclusion to spring is a remarkable lost classic from short cartoon era what is even more remarkable is that this cartoon's director made his debut here and who is to spring 's director it's a certain william hanna
<START> does anyone know the exact quote about time and love by george ede aka father fitzpatrick in the move it had to be you he was talking to charlie and annna in the church as they were leaving if not i will have to rent the movie this was a great movie i also loved serendipity great love story for the soul br br i met my one true love my soulmate and although i had the experience to meet him when i had least expecting it i wasn't ready for that kind of emotional relationship br br altho we did marry i wasn't mature enough to give as much as i thought i would i got complacent and took his love for granted and he withstood it for 7 years br br he finally left with resentment but we are still hurt and angry in disbelief about the way it turned out i had some very hard lessons to learn and we have now been apart 3 years br br this movie meant a lot because i am still waiting on reconciling with my one and only true love i can now appreciate that distinct feeling inside of me and the quote of father fitzpatrick rang true for me br br i know when he has healed enough to trust me again we will remarry br br don't ever get complacent and take true love for granted it has been the hardest lesson of my life br br also the music in this movie is outstanding and meaningful this movie is deep and spiritually uplifting true love is worth waiting for if it is meant to be it will no matter what it will happen nothing is impossible even when it's the second time around thanks
<START> this is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies ever made amitabh as a country bumpkin arjun singh is hilarious the best thing is the laughter never stops the plot is a same old same old story where child is separated from mother who sacrifices everything for her duty with a happy reunion at the end there are villains ranjit and there are brothers sashi kapoor and there are vixens parveen babhi and there are lovers smita patil and there is a blind brother and a grandfather thrown in for good measure but this movie is about amitabh and thats all you remember at then end br br amitabh comes to the city to make a decent living and his dialogue delivery and mannerisms are hilarious later in the movie he turns into the angry young man he is famous for but the humour stays memorable parts include his walking talking and speaking english the song pad gungaroo re bhand meera nachi thi and everything with his dadoo br br all in all i was rolling with laughter throughout the movie if you want 3 hours of entertainment with amitabh at his absolute best this is it it will easily give it a 10 10
<START> to movie this movie felt like one of those after school specials only lower budget and lower everything else i guess this was supposed to an inspirational movie of some sort but it didn't work for me yet some how it comes across as preachy it has very pale shades of flash dance but so what there just isn't any excitement in this movie the dialogue is contrived and clichÃ©d to death of course the whole movie feels like a bad 80's clichÃ© the acting was less than stellar though that has a lot to do with what the actors were given or in this case not to work with on top of that is the poor song choices with really bad lyrics i felt embarrassed for all the actors involved they are all talented but you can't tell from this movie this is just my opinion of course but i have to give flying aka dream to believe a 1 10
<START> my husband and i just got done watching this movie i was not expecting it to be this good i was really astonished at how great the story line was i'm usually very good at figuring out twisty plots but this one had me i loved it i'm going to have to watch it again before i take it back i might even have to buy it
<START> c'mon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode it's just an old 60's tv show this episode of star trek is notable because of the most serious babe yeoman barrow's ever used on star trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location unlike the tng and voyager series which were totally confined to sound stages br br this use of an outdoor location and babe gives proper depth and an almost film like quality to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar show br br except a few notable exceptions i e the city on the edge of forever assignment earth and tomorrow is yesterday the old series of star trek needs to be seriously moth balled and put out of it's boring misery half a dozen good episodes from 79 is quite a poor batting average br br this is typical of the boring stuff gene roddenberry produced back then actually contrary to popular belief where some people worshiped the ground he walked on he actually made a lot of rubbish he doesn't deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as irwin allen for example br br just look at the set of the bridge of the enterprise from a modern point of view they used wobbly plywood for the floor cafeteria chairs with plastic backs and cheap cardboard above the instrument panels you can clearly see the folds in the paper every expense spared or what
<START> first of all this film was not released to theatres tested poorly they say i say they figured the story of crooked cops politicians dedicated newspaper people had been done to death just send it dvd cable tv take the money run br br that being said i usually like this type of movie especially with this named cast morgan freeman justin timberlake kevin spacey br br l l cool j cary elways john heard on the distaff side piper perabo roslyn sanchez br br the plot story have been done to death but the above cast brings life to this violent movie it is actually watchable br br justin timberlake is good as the dedicated young reporter for a throw away newspaper edited by morgan freeman the others are either crooked cops politicians or somewhat decent guys the 2 ladies are the girl friends of ll cool j justin timberlake do whats required it is quite violent many killings etc not for children by no means is the a great film but for what it is the cast it is definitely good br br ratings out of 4 86 points out of 100 imdb 8 out of 10
<START> william powell's final outing as philo vance occurs in the kennel murder case where the murder of a championship show dog leads to two more murders and one attempt of the human kind it's all in the figuring out of how that leads to the who and why br br the philo vance murders by s s van dine were most popular at the time and the clever mr van dine figured out a way to sell his books one at a time to the highest studio bidder this is why you see so many philo vances and so many studios putting them out had bill powell not gone on to greater fame with mgm as nick charles of the thin man series he would have been known as the greatest of philo vances br br it turns out that powell had entered his little terrier captain in the same contest where the murdered dog was entered and then another rival owner became the first murder victim as usual powell shows up eugene palette as sergeant heath whose biggest contribution to the proceedings was using his bulk to break down the locked from the inside door where the first murder victim was found br br i did say locked from the inside and it was an upper story so it was in figuring out the how powell has a lovely group of suspects as extensive as what normally is in a thin man mystery people like paul cavanaugh helen vinson ralph morgan mary astor fill their cast roles well br br warner brothers liked this version so much that in fact they remade it again in the thirties with james stephenson in his one and only outing as philo vance it doesn't hold a candle to this one br br as this is the only powell philo vance that is out on vhs or dvd by all means see this one or acquire it if you can
<START> the only reason i saw this movie was for jimmy fallon who i've had a crush on since 9th grade which was his first year on snl i am a die hard yankees fan and i didn't find the movie painful until the last 15 minutes when they begin showing clips of the alcs games i had to cover my ears and make small noises so i wouldn't have to hear that which must not be heard but otherwise it was completely bearable br br i thought jimmy played the role very well because the character was supposed to be nervous and quirky and he is a nervous and quirky guy i know that it may not be a academy award winning stretch but the movie is just a light fun romantic comedy that is actually appropriate for both women and men to see br br jimmy and drew worked well together and they had much better chemistry on camera than other actors in the past ed burns and angelina jolie in that stupid movie what i think jimmy has a positive career ahead of him and thank goodness because taxi could have killed it i think fever pitch will help him out a lot everyone needs to stop being so critical of his acting ability because he is just starting out in movies i imagine it must be difficult and if you look at any of the other great actors of our time tom hanks russell crowe etc you'll see that they started off in some flops busom buddies australian soap operas here's wishing jimmy a successful career on screen i never wanted him to leave snl but what can you do
<START> where to begin how about with the erroneous synopsis br br x men origins wolverine tells the story of wolverine's epically violent and romantic past his complex relationship with victor creed and the ominous weapon x program br br his epically violent past turns out to exceptionally non violent br br his relationship with creed is so glossed over it's difficult to understand how they have any connection at all we are thrown from one point in the opening scene that shows them as children on the run to a montage of war scenes that they have fought in throughout their long lifespan and finally to the present where they are a part of a hardcore government team of assassins br br there is nothing by way of showing their relationship as brothers at all nothing complex is laid down for us to believe is authentic or even loving br br the romantic element of the movie between silverfox and wolverine was forced and abrupt we are thrown into a romance so fast that it's over before you can blink an eye having just introduced the character silverfox is killed off roughly fifteen minutes later we are left wondering why we should care about this who was she anyway br br for a pivotal element of this weak revenge driven story the romance is surprisingly unexplored it was rushed in simply because it was required br br oddly enough when wolverine finds that his love is dead he leaves her in the woods to rot as he goes off to find sabertooth being the romantic that he is this was out of character for him yet necessary to serve the plot in pulling off a very predictable surprise br br as for the weapon x program lets just say that after the painfully crippling procedure wolverine is up and running eventually he arrives at the home of a conveniently old yet overwhelmingly loving couple surprisingly ma and pa kent aren't alarmed when finding a naked sweaty man in their barn is it any wonder what fate awaits them br br in the previous films and the comic books the main reason that wolverines' amnesia plagued him partly hinged on the fact that he was said to have been viciously evil and coldblooded br br knowing this was the case did he really want to remember such horrors or keep them hidden and continue his current more positive lifestyle of fighting against the villains of the world alongside his team mates br br as hinted to in x2 x men united when stryker gives up some of his secrets it is said that wolverine would be disturbed if he had known of the evil works they committed together this film sets up the team fairly well only they don't really do much of anything no disturbing violence no ruthless actions they merely harass a few natives in foreign lands for the ten or fifteen minutes they are on screen br br it seems that wolverine wasn't an evil man under stryker at all instead he was constantly trying to put a leash on his brother sabertooth which consequently was the violent agent we all thought wolverine was eventually he just leaves all together br br no conflict of duality here at all br br idiotically removing that character conflict of good and evil dulled the story immensely they may as well have given him rubber claws br br there were a ton of other errors in this film that contradicted the x men trilogy including the introduction of one of the lamest deus ex machinas to ever hit a script br br magic memory erasing bullets br br really br br apparently they are the only thing to bring down wolverine yet this was apparently forgotten when agent after agent was sent to bring him down with bullets and bombs that would surely not work on him at all br br another problem with this film is that it tried to focus on wolverine while throwing in a ton of other mutants which did little to nothing at all interesting characters were mere window dressing and did nothing for the story most were in the film for 5 10 minutes max and yet you find yourself wishing we saw more of them and less of wolverine br br fred dukes the blob but not the comic version can punch a launched tank missile with little to no physical damage to him at all but a simple headbutt from wolverines metal noggin is enough to daze him br br cyclops optic beams which instead of being concussive force are now more akin to lasers can burn through buildings but when fired at sabertooth directly it simply smashes him into the ground without even damaging his clothes adamantium trench coats anyone br br the gravity defying mutant gambit instead of utilizing his signature cards is made into some sort of crazy acrobat in one poorly edited scene he is knocked unconscious by wolverine then amazingly enough a few minutes later he is on a rooftop running towards wolverine how he regained consciousness ran away a few blocks climbed up a building then ran back to wolverine and sabertooth in the middle of a scratching match is a mystery yet to be explained br br some have excused this films weakness by claiming it was made from a comic and therefore should be weak on character and heavy on flash the idea that this movie being a comic film is flimsy and superficial because of that fact is incorrect br br the comic book source material the real origin of wolverine is a story worth bringing to the screen it doesn't sugar coat his past nor treat the reader like mindless cgi junkies it is a well crafted story and although retold and readjusted over time began with weapon x by barry windsor smith a much more intense and exciting story br br this fox film should seriously be forgotten br br anyone have that magic gun br br 4 10
<START> the first von trier movie i've ever seen was breaking the waves sure a nice movie but it definitely stands in the shadow of europa europa tells a story of a young german american who wants to experience germany just after the second world war he takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxues train because of his job he travels all through an almost totally destroyed germany meeting with the killing of traitors and hunt for former nazi party members the society is suffering from corruption his uncle has narrowed his conciousness by focussing on the job he has also as a purser on the train by coincidence the main character get involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called 'werewolves' they put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains the atmosphere is astounding the viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man attempting to put the viewer under hypnosis and then counting to wake you up in a new scene just when you think you've seen a lot europe
<START> i rented this film yesterday mostly due to the good looking art and the summary given on the back of the jacket after popping it into my dvd player i re examined the jacket cover and even though i took the cover out of from the plastic viewer i still could not read any of the production detail information about the film this film is entitled evil on the jacket and had to locate it by going to faith films website to find out any linkage to it here on imdb br br the filming and special affects done in the film looked quite good then a line reading actor spoke oh dear this actor's reading sounded like some pimple faced high school jock whose voice just managed to change pitch and no attempt given to go beyond reading the lines from the script at first i thought i got a bad disc out of audio sync then had to surmise it was a foreign film since i couldn't read the jacket english dialog dubbed if they'd casted the right person for dubbing the dialog this film might have been decent i gave it a chance of about 20 minutes before ejecting it when i discovered the bad line reader wasn't going to get killed off but stay as the constant main fixture yes it is that bad the jacket cover art and the art done in the film are great so gave the one star but minus 1 999 999 stars for the rotten dialog i do not recommend this one
<START> absolutely unwatchable lowest quality film making this film makes show girls look good the acting is insufferable the cinematography gives a bad name to amateurism no wonder it went right to video and bypassed the theaters this film wasn't released it escaped
