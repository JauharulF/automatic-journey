<START> 'the italian' is among the great or near great films of 1915 that are available today the year was a turning point for the feature length film especially in america lois weber's 'hypocrites' cecil b demille's 'the cheat' and of course d w griffith's 'the birth of a nation' set new benchmarks for the art additionally that year russian filmmaker yevgeni bauer made two of his best pictures 'after death' and 'daydreams' the french serial 'les vampires' also has its admirers today although i disagree with them the emergence of the feature length film was led by europe mainly denmark france and italy but dominance of this market and to a degree the art shifted to across the atlantic in 1915 br br the most overriding artistic achievement of 'the italian' is its stunning and often innovative cinematography there are some picturesque sunsets mobile framing including a brief overhead angled shot of the italian racing to buy a wedding ring and another shot of him holding onto a moving car and in general there is wise use of varied camera angles and expert lighting throughout an especially amazing shot is a close up of the italian enraged as he slowly approaches the camera for an extreme close up in reference to d w griffith's 'musketeers of pig alley' 1912 he's so enraged his environment even begins to shake around his anger br br unfortunately the cinematographer appears to be unknown the director although originally without credit in the film is now known to have been reginald barker five or so of his other films made for ince are also available today but are rather unremarkable 'civilization' 1916 which he worked on was a large production but a deeply flawed movie by the way i'd guess that one or more of the various cinematographers who worked on 'civilization' also photographed 'the italian' br br moreover the entire production is very advanced for then venice and new york are well rendered despite the film being shot in los angeles for romanticized venice and san francisco for the ethnic slums of new york there are extensive flashbacks although perhaps one or two too many i especially like the clever framing of the narrative as being read in a book by a character played by the same actor george beban who is also the lead in the inner main narrative the reading of the story is further briefly framed by the opening at the beginning and closing at the end of curtain drapes Ã  la the theatre which is reflected within the inner story during the revenge climax in the child's room with the opening and closing of window curtains parallel editing in camera dissolves and irises and such are handled expertly additionally beban and clara williams as his wife play their parts well br br on the other hand 'the italian' does have a few drawbacks the film's early moments of comedy clash rather disharmoniously with the latter parts of harsh and heavy melodrama although the environmental changes from romanticized italy to naturalistic new york works wellÂmostly because it's supported by the lighting and photography the harsh dissolution of the american dream in this film enhanced by the stark photography must have been poignant to the immigrant classes who comprised a disproportionately large population of the movie going public back then the corrigan character should have been foreshadowed more his brief introduction campaigning for another politician seems inadequate for his later centrality to the italian's revenge in addition the filmmakers were either medically naÃ¯f or careless to not explain the lack of breastfeeding of the infant and the unwarranted faith in the healing powers of quietness for the other child aside from the deficiencies in plot 'the italian' is exceptionally well made
<START> this was soul provoking i am an iranian and living in th 21st century i didn't know that such big tribes have been living in such conditions at the time of my grandfather br br you see that today or even in 1925 on one side of the world a lady or a baby could have everything served for him or her clean and on demand but here 80 years ago people ventured their life to go to somewhere with more grass it's really interesting that these persians bear those difficulties to find pasture for their sheep but they lose many the sheep on their way br br i praise the americans who accompanied this tribe they were as tough as bakhtiari people
<START> this movie is damian szifrÃ³n's second immersion in movies after his excellent character study in el fondo del mar with tiempo de valientes he creates extremely well done characters far away from prototypes and with an unprecedented chemistry between them i've seen szifron's talent to present every character in a lighthearted way but just enough to involve us emotionally with them his control over them is magnificent so he restores on the movie a great direction and an overall brilliantly polished script the characters laugh and cry with real sentiment and invite the viewer to join them in their emotions and their evolution on screen br br the spanish takes over the english the buenos aires urban landscape at night replaces hollywood sets and the premise is just as interesting as any other so we have a film daring to compete over hollywood's machinery br br but i want you to see the movie mainly because i've never dealt with such endearing characters all of them it seems the script suits perfectly to the actors and vice versa i really believe with a film making like this argentina is really up to the competition
<START> spoiler alert all throughout australia the summer turned into a deluge of rain and hail stones the size of baseballs that was causing havoc in coastal cities like sydney it's under these hectic conditions that tax lawyer david burton richard chamberlain got involved in a case as a defense attorney involving the death of a local aborigine who was found dead outside a sydney bar br br having five fellow aborigines arrested for billy cormans athol compton death it's determined by the police coroner that billy died of drowning not by violence even though he had bruises on his neck and shoulders yet the court decided to prosecute the five for his death charging them with manslaughter instead of murder br br david defending the five gets no help from them in their defense with the accused assailants opting to remain quite and keep what happened to billy to themselves and take what's coming to them from the court one of the defendants chris david gulpili begin to somehow invades david's dreams as if he want's to tell him what was really behind billy's death br br david at first not taking his dreams of chris seriously begins to sense that their real when he meet him at the courthouse chris confirms david's dreams by showing him a strange looking black rock that david saw chris have in his dreams later meeting chris and what turns out to be an aborigine shaman charlie nandjiwarna amagula who came to his house that evening david is told that he like charlie has spiritual powers that he inherited from his mother's grandfather those powers will reveal to him the future that has to do with the strange weather conditions that are flooding the australian continent the earth chris tells david is going through a gigantic cleansing cycle with the old world about to be washed away and the new world ready to take it's place br br david is confused about what both chris and charlie are telling him but as the rains continue to increase and the ocean waves start to rise he feels that something terrible is going to happen david want's to know if it's all aborigine folklore or there's some scientific facts or logic behind their end of world like revelations br br by now it's obvious that both chris and charlie are members of an aborigine tribe right in the heart of modern sydney that alone can get chris off as well as his four friends for the murder of billy since the australian government will not prosecute tribal aborigines leaving any justice to be done by the tribes themselves still chris refuses to admit he's a member of a native tribe and he and his four friends are convicted of manslaughter in billy's death with the sentences to be handed down by the judge within days br br david now determined to find out what was the reason for chris' silence and why billy had to die is taken by chris to the scene of the crime it's there that david finds out that billy betrayed chris' tribe members by going there with billy not being a member of chris's aborigine tribe it's also revealed to david that he himself has some kind of spiritual connection with the austrailan aborigines as both charlie and his step father rev burton david parslow told him br br the stage is now set for the great and final cleansing cycle that david's been seeing in both his night time dreams and day time visions it comes in the form of a massive tidal wave rolling out of the pacific ocean into the australian coast city of sydney and then submerges the entire continent
<START> sure it was well shot and made very well shot and made but the story was just so weak and the portrayal of lincoln was even weaker not that henry fonda wasn't good but the character he played was nothing but a loon do you mean to tell me that lincoln was a wise cracking smart ass with no respect of the law or the court i mean who the hell was he supposed to be cousin vinnie i mean come on i'll just call you jackass then i understand that ford was going for great funny hero guy but i didn't really like this guy at all he cheats in sports talks like a real sweet simpleton and does not seem to know were to sit in a courtroom how am i supposed to take this seriously br br the twist was even weaker i mean come on that was just stupid the whole story seemed like it was thought up by some 5 year old in his or her dreams saying that i liked it enough it was very entertaining and made me laugh at several occasions so i can't say it's a bad film in fact i must say that i must say it's good enough nothing that entertains me and makes me laugh can be bad but this vivid and silly story was just so ridiculous that i can't understand how anyone could consider it great br br i have no idea how historically accurate this film was but if any of it was true i would really have to shake my head
<START> br br after dark my sweet is a strange mix of sensuality and dullness the film runs slow very slow but takes a rythm to tell a story about murder and passion jason patric never ever was so sexy and powerful the man gives a true performance and rachel ward is all but sexy br br the sexual tension the pshycological heat the footsteps of the past the flashback scenes the weirdness of the patricÂ´s character all becomes a sexy mystery i recommend this one cause is the more sexy dull movie that i ever seen check the love making scene itÂ´s particulary sexy
<START> this show was appreciated by critics and those who realized that any similarities between pushing daisies style and anyone else's was not a steal yes i've seen amelie pushing daisies is somewhat similar but still different enough to be original rather there are too few shows on tv that have this kind of quirky charm the greatest similarity is to dead like me but p d comes by that similarity honestly bryan fuller created both shows both shows involve an undead young woman for example this show never stopped being funny and charming and it was always odd yet was consistently humane br br i must say a word about the conventions of on going story lines some people have complained that this show lacked a moral center because in the first and several subsequent episodes ned seems to get away with causing the death of chuck's father without consequences of any kind first of all this must be a new definition of without consequences of any kind because in spite of the fact that ned was only a boy and did not realize that he had caused the death of chuck's father he nevertheless felt guilty from the moment he realized what he had done further about a dozen episodes into the series ned finally did confess to chuck that he had caused her father's death with his gift now there are no police to charge people with magically causing one person's death by bringing another person back to life so the questions of absolution and restitution have to be taken up without societal guidance in other words it's between ned and chuck who was not inclined to forgive ned anytime soon br br but this does point out a problem with continuing story lines in network dramas i remember when david caruso's character on nypd blue did something wrong and it seemed he got away with it for a whole year then he got caught and was forced to resign from the job and left the show the point is viewers should learn by now and not assume that just because a regular character does something wrong in a single episode and is not caught in that episode that he has gotten away with it there is always next week and maybe even next year
<START> this is one of the best ensemble comedy musical b film's that i have seen and since i'm in my 40's now and only seeing this now i am not an expert but i have seen all the well known films out there when there are a ton of actors getting their lead for minutes at a time usually the comedy interferes with the musical bits and very often the musical pieces interrupt the comedic flow call me in a crazy kind of mood but when i saw this on tcm europe i was laughing out loud with pleasure so who delivered the laughs for me without a doubt mischa auer delivered me some terrific gut busting laughs he even steals the ending it was great speaking of which i think why this movie works is because although l h are a selling point and why i got hooked to watch this one them and hal roach i love them in their early hal roach stuff this keeps them at a minimum and stays squarely on adult fare by 1930's standards and not that far from today's standards if you read between the lines jack haley is also great to watch i admit that i only know him from w o oz and i loved him there and i also laughed out loud here at his waiter bit in the show patsy kelly is the only ugly femme in the 30's movies that actually turns me on something tells me she was a spitfire in real life and the musical numbers have a real professional production busby berkley'ish quality that blew me away from what i am used to in this genre i could go on and on but rest assured i really enjoyed this movie 8 of 10 i saw it on tcm europe and will record it to watch again with my wife on tcm usa good stuff
<START> why does this have such a low rating i really don't get it is it because of the bad acting the bad dialogue well who cares about these things in cheesy low budget horror movies seriously the acting and the dialogue isn't important in those movies people who hate movies only because of bad acting and bad dialogue shouldn't be allowed to rate cheesy low budget movies those movies shouldn't be taken seriously period br br anyway time to talk about the movie right well i loved it i bought it because i expected a gorefest but it's not a gorefest and the gore is pretty bad most of the time it's just animal guts placed on the body of the actors and that's lame but i didn't really care because the movie is hilarious the characters are hilarious the acting is hilarious bad acting is a good thing in cheesy low budget horror movies the dialogue is hilarious bad dialogue is a good thing in cheesy low budget horror movies the zombie rapist with a huge dick is hilarious the flying demon baby is hilarious and i could go on and on and on but i don't want to say too much but i have to mention that there's a scene in which a girl masturbates a sex doll like it's alive lol oh and the zombie rapist falls in love with the sex doll lol br br best lines in the movie br br detective manners sniffs coke detective sloane what the beep are you doing manners what the hell did you snort what the hell is that detective manners it's nothing man it's ehh cold medicine br br detective manners injects heroin in his arm detective sloane what the beep are you doing manners are you beep insane detective manners it's cold medicine br br detective manners repeatedly kicks a random guy in the face detective sloane what the hell's going on manners what are you doing detective manners this maniac was rambling about demons and then he started smashing his head on the rock he just started smashing his head on the rock i think he's on pcp or something br br lol
<START> i have read the novel reaper of ben mezrich a fews years ago and last night i accidentally came to see this adaption br br although it's been years since i read the story the first time the differences between the novel and the movie are humongous very important elements which made the whole thing plausible are just written out or changed to bad br br if the plot sounds interesting to you go and get the novel its much much much better br br still 4 out of 10 since it was hard to stop watching because of the great basic plot by ben mezrich
<START> a few weeks ago the german broadcaster sat1 advertised this movie as the tv event of the year sorry but i've seen better things on tv this year br br i didn't thought much of the movie but i soon reminisced about two other horrible movies when i watched the commercial namely titanic and pearl harbor because the picture looked so familiar the heroine if i can really call her that in the middle and her two loved ones next to her pearl harbor anyone in fact the love story is a poor man's version of the one in pearl harbor and that one was already poor br br but as i like watching movies and analyzing their patterns i eventually decided to watch that rubbish the movie begins with a doctor leaving his family for the military strike against russia near the end of the third reich promising his wife that he will return now fast forward to spring 1948 germany lost the war and the allies russia captured the country and they both try to eliminate each other for world power and their ideologies capitalism versus communism well i guess you already know the story because you have to know it the movie doesn't really bother with it so much and literally takes a dump on historical facts the movie tries to depict the us government as angels and completely ignores the contribution of other countries during the airlift especially great britain who was responsible for nearly a quarter of the rations despite having their country bombed from a country that they're trying to help br br what was also pretty annoying were the historical remarks the people said in the movie like when the heroine's mother tells her daughter that germany might be parted in two with a response like that's impossible or when stalin where the director thought we just stick similarly looking mustache on the actor and he will look like him says that russia has to stop coca cola from spreading in germany yeah right if stalin has ever said something like this or there is this one us pilot who tells his fellow of a bread with meat and everything possible in it please burgers were invented way before that time br br in the movie you once see a map showing the airlines funnily enough the map looks like it came straight out of a laser printer in '48 the us general lucius clay who's main idea was to stay in berlin is portrayed as a guy who is mean and grumpy and all the ideas he historically had like for example the airlift and improving on that idea came from the fictive character phillip turner the love interest of the main actress which leads me to other aspects not enough african american soldiers in the movie there were like two in the whole film also relationships between us soldiers and german civilians was not allowed and by a revealing of such a relationship the us soldier would've been sent home i don't want to say that there were no relationships at all but in this movie there was a couple that almost got married if it wasn't for the death of the pilot in his fake cgi plane which looked terribly unrealistic especially the cgi fire br br if it wasn't enough all americans in this movie spoke accent free german although they only were in germany for a couple of months look i'm also american living in germany for my whole life and even i have a little accent notably bad was also the child acting the kids had like two expressions on their faces normal i look monotonous like a robot and grinning br br all in all the movie was boring from beginning to end moving way too slow especially the love story which was the same as the one in pearl harbor just with half of the dialogue the sad part is that the movie was very successful 8 97 millions watched the first part and 7 83 millions the second part the day after thus sat1 receiving two consecutive wins in the overall market share and a whopping win in the commercial relevant group but like i always think the biggest pile of bull crap is where the most flies go to
<START> i remember being terrified of movie blood when i was younger and gradually getting less so until getting jaded enough as i'm sure many other viewers have become so that the barrage of gory films produced in last few years have entertained me but not scared me or made me squirm the dentist turned that around br br the setup seems simple a mentally unstable dentist wreaks havoc on the insides of mouths and perhaps bodies as well a clever twist though is that the dentist is the film's protagonist so instead of being some one dimensional bad guy with no clear motivation his development is the most extensive of any character and he is very human and believable the viewer thus feels sympathy for him as well as his victims and instead of hoping for justice to come to him i found myself hoping he would somehow find a way to cover up his tracks and return to a normal life br br what really makes a horror movie is the violence and the dentist does it better than any other film i can think of first off the film has tons of tension which is something that modern gore films tend to lack in one scene the dentist is emotionally distraught and has to see a young child patient for the first time as he reaches into the child's mouth you hope that for the dentist's and the child's sake the encounter ends without injury i won't spoil what happens second when the gore does come it hits all the worst squirmy nerves once again i won't give anything away br br of course being a movie that you've never heard of it does have flaws most importantly it's exclusively for horror fans also as another reviewer mentioned by taking place over a span of just a few days we don't really get any background on the characters and the tension drops a little bit during the very end but really the fact that we would even want to know background about the characters is evidence to how good it is and the bulk of the film is solid enough that any small lapses in tension can be forgiven br br it's strange after years of being accustomed to movie gore to suddenly want to cover my eyes at the sight of blood the dentist made me scared and thoroughly uncomfortable and for this it earns my full approval
<START> deliverance is a dead on example of what wonderful movies came out of the '70s while your jaw is dropped during a terminator movie are you really sacred i don't think so because you are there to see what new cgis have been strung together plot matters not br br so many daily situations can become terrifying for no reason at all because there are so many people involved in daily living like a trip to the market or a walk down a dimly lighted street deliverance is so frightening because those innocent actions can turn deadly in a heart beat venturing into the backwoods is a frolic in fun anyone who has that notion does not read the papers watch the daily news nor has not seen some of the other movies that depict the seriousness of trespassing into territories where outsiders are not welcome it is almost unbelievable that the advance dish on deliverance didn't inform almost everyone going to view it this was no picnic and squeal like a pig wasn't a part of deulling banjos br br i hate the term hillbillies because as some users wrote that demeans entire regions of people who are very content to live as they know how without the interference of modern life much is made of inbred that is not sexuality peculiar to the backwoods chinatown should teach us that lesson however city slickers are extremely dumb to enter a closed society and give them attitude i know lots of hillbillies they are moral people when left to themselves their justice can be brutal when they feel threatened or humiliated just like the justice in city streets they don't need any part of the city the city should take its canoe ing and camping to legal sites br br deliverance was the last film i found jon voight to do any real acting i hope i'm wrong he was extremely underpaid for midnight cowboy because he was unknown but demonstrated that he could do that role at the drop of a hat his acting in deliverance was superb it gave us a clear demonstration ordinary people can move mountains if it's necessary but who wants to be thought of as ordinary today his stifled sob at the dinner was brilliant wow for burt reynolds one must ask what led him into those other tacky films his manliness although misguided in this film set the pace for the endurance necessary to make it out of the wilderness not only in the backwoods but the wilderness of everyday life ned beatty was stellar his underwear may not have had versace stitched on it but his shell shocked performance was perfect as noted he became stronger than any of the group by the end of the movie ronny cox played the moral guy to the hilt every man should have his determination to do what is right several users have theorized he was shot or lost his balance when he pitched into the river my theory is that he was so disgusted with the whole journey he committed suicide no gunshot was heard during the scene and voight and beatty did not find a wound br br james dicey certainly knows how to weave a suspenseful tale and was great as the sheriff it is said he was so terrified of acting he came to the set drunk every day his character could see the three canoe rs were guilty of surviving but also knew they didn't stand a chance against a jury of the local people no matter how kindly they were treated in aintry he was also aware that the meaner of the locals could be cruel justice don't come back up here again not many users knew hillbillies were used in the film where ever it was possible what actors could portray them better the mountain men were actually mountain men br br every detail of this movie was perfect no doubt it was dangerous to play in play in better fight for your life in i've experienced some near dangerous incidents and am content to live outside of the fray you guys who feel your manhood raging can have my part br br that we have absolutely killed and continue to do so irreplaceable areas of this country in undeniable to be able to view its grandeur on any media is enthralling but it leaves a bitter taste to realize some do not care about it los angeles where i live is a perfect example it's built up right into the territories for wild animals and steadfastly believes humans come before animals those are their rightful habitats we should leave them be just that any wonder why coyotes and bears and wolves wander into neighborhoods they're theirs br br in some less threatening way we all need to experience the lessons to be learned from deliverance to understand our advancement technologically does not lead to supremacy i thank all those city slickers who went out into the wilderness to produce this modern classic so that it can scare the heck out of me when i watch it you can have the thrill of danger i'll stick to the tv 30 out of 10
<START> gbs wrote his own screen adaptation of this nobel prize winning play but didn't live to see it produced he had won an oscar in 1938 for his brilliant adaptation of his 1914 play pygmalion when otto preminger mounted produced and directed this production in 1957 seven years after shaw's death he had noted british author graham greene do the adaptation and it was a solid choice br br taking a cue from shaw's own screenplay greene uses material from the stage epilogue to create a framing device to meld the two acts of the play one early and one late in joan's story into a unified and most satisfying whole where on stage the shift in tone is buffered with an intermission here it works just as well with a return to king charles balois's bedchamber where the man joan put on the throne is dreaming of the events which led to his current situation and more material from shaw's epilogue the introduction of the shade of john gielgud's warwick the english king maker br br the majority of the language is solid gbs and the performances from stalwart shauvians like felix aymler's inquisitor or harry andrews' de stogumber to relative newcomers the film established jean seberg's career are first rate it may jar some only familiar with richard widmark's many movie villains to see him playing a frail and somewhat silly dauphin but the performance oddly top billed is professional even if arguably miscast br br the symbolism of the opening credits and the director's choice to use the visual vocabulary of black and white filming all serve shaw and the story well go in expecting quality entertainment and you won't be disappointed
<START> poorly made blaxploitation crime drama aimed squarely at the black urban market of the early 1970s pam grier stars in the title role that of a nurse who becomes a one woman vigilante after drug dealing thugs make coffy's little sister a junkie violent nonsense plods along doggedly with canned energy and excitement only grier's flaring temper gives the narrative a jolt she's not much of an actress here but she connects with the audience in a primal way not much different from what charles bronson was doing at this time the film was marketed and advertised as crass exploitation yet still managed to find a sizable inner city audience today however it's merely a footnote in '70s film history and lacks the wide range appeal of other movies in this genre 1 2 from
<START> perhaps it's me and my perverted ways or the fact that i tend to have a very sick mind but i rented this film at random one very weird night and to my great surprise i enjoyed it br br yes i read the synopsis on the back of the dvd box and read that it had been banned for 25 years and figured i was prepared for anything it would offer i was clearly deceived after seeing well everything to cut a long story short i can see why it was banned not only for such explicit sex scenes but for beastiality br br of course as it is freely based on the classic fairy tale of beauty and the beast a personal favorite of mine it tells the story of a girl's sexual awakening over a dream about a duchess being chased by a whatever the hell that thing was like beast with an enormous erection and a substantial amount of ejaculation of course the beast gets what he wants and the duchess decides she likes it and they continue frolicking in the woods br br but that's not all oh there is so much more br br not only do we get to see interspecial sex but there's also humping horses the babysitter who gets down and dirty with the slave when she's not humping the bed to get her er satisfaction and the daydreaming girl masturbating with rose petals br br creative and enjoyable but it did take a while for my father to talk to me again after he watched it after i went to bed i was 15 words of advice when watching this film make sure you're the only one who knows you have it and watch it with the curtains closed it may be fun but i doubt there are other porn films like this one
<START> purple rain what else can i say the title speaks for itself but i think all the actors were well picked the movie had a great story i loved it ever since i watched that movie i've been stuck in the eighties and i'm only 13 my favorite part of the movie was when his father died and he was picking up all of his music compositions and the apollonia was sitting on the stairwell with his earing in her hand critics say that its a drama but i think its more of a romance murphy brown also did a great job in the movie he actually acted like himself i'm so glad i've seen this movie the song purple rain beautifully sung was so heartfelt i cried more than once
<START> like many others have commented before me here i have to say that this movie is bad but not the worst i've seen there will be no direct references to movie plots or sequences in this comment because i hate spoilers br br i got a feeling i was watching an episode of a tv show or something where they had gotten a hold of some extra to spend on cgi i've seen worse of those all in all it is quite an insult to the viewer at least if you have any knowledge about computers and or technology at all there are just too many of these moments of insults to make me feel comfortable and i found myself just begging for it all to end fast halfway through in addition there are countless easy way out scenarios which also is an insult to your intelligence as a thinking human being br br this movie absolutely fades in comparison to the old wargames and i think it's a damn shame they even got to call it a sequel br br two stars from me because of one thing and one thing only the actors' performances aren't half bad considering the regurgitated crap of a script they had to work with still they should never have signed on to this movie not really a career move but i guess we all have bills to pay br br to those of you who gave this movie top score you have to be on the studio's payroll or something that's my only explanation br br to all who haven't seen this one by all means watch it and make up your own mind but lower your expectations to the floor and then some
<START> i figured that it's about time i let this one out pokÃ©mon fans are suffering in america these days why because we rely on kids wb and 4kids entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies as far as the series goes they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the japanese versions to television so what is their problem when it comes to the movies honestly now i have seen all three pokÃ©mon movies in japanese and i will definitely be seeing the fourth one they are excellent movies they are all enjoyable and fun to watch and after seeing pokÃ©mon 2000 in theaters i can't help but wonder how these american producers read the japanese scripts the way it appears it seems that they read and see something that says insert empty moral here' in big bold faced letters it definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on msb extreme sarcasm there and created this crap br br possible spoilers from here on br br well i guess i should first talk about pikachu's rescue adventure my first gripe with this came with no narration i guess they got enough bad comments on the pokÃ©dex narration that plagued pikachu's vacation and instead of going with a caring gentle woman's voice as appeared in pikachu no natsu yasumi and pikachu tankentai they just cut the narration all together this wouldn't have been a problem except for one thing did anyone really understand why the exeggcute didn't let togepi go until the end possibly the fans but i'm sure not the parents then there's the theme song i couldn't help but roll my eyes at this one the japanese theme song was tankentai wo tsukurou' and was sung by japanese children it was fun and enjoyable this one nauseating now one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing kireihana nice music fun to watch that's changed with the bellossom the music sucked for one but on top of that they had all the pokÃ©mon talk during the music which turned out to be jumpy annoying and just unnecessary oh and then there's the poliwhirl who thinks he's a poliwrath you'd think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are basically not much could save this little ill fated dub which is very unfortunate considering its potential but i haven't touched on the worst of it yet br br you'd think that the warning signs would've been apparent to me when i received my issue of nintendo power for some unfathomable reason i had been placing some faith in 4kids and the wb my thoughts were well they screwed up on the first movie but the second is different as far as the theme goes so they should do well ' that in mind i just didn't pay attention to the warning signs i encountered in the theaters when the trailers said you will believe that one person can make all the difference ' with the way they said that at every turn i was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like msb did at the end of the english version then comes nintendo power in which i see all my fears realized in the words the main feature 'the power of one ' at that point i became a bit more uneasy the power of one ' not a good sign however i still kept some of my false faith big mistake br br sitting in the theater i was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which i loved in japanese being turned into complete and utter junk i hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle i can see a point in that since they didn't pander this thing repeating it over and over like in msb however it did more damage than anything else in this movie first of all the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read the world turns to ash ' ah hah so ash is the chosen one whatever in the japanese version the inhabitants of arshia needed a pokÃ©mon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony this time he's the chosen one a greater way that this did damage was to lugia lugia was one of the coolest characters in a pokÃ©mon movie when the movie was about lugia in this one lugia is forced to take a back seat to ash in the scene where they're flying back to the main island lugia and ash are discussing the conditions of lugia's existence not that ash is going to make all the difference overall in this category ash wasn't really the one person' that would make the difference since he was helped by many along the way br br a lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking furura's flute song wasn't nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the japanese one jirarudan's speech to them saying his collection started with a mew card ' ugh even worse misty's outrage originally concerned the way moltres and zapdos were being held why didn't you put them in pokÃ©balls when you caught them this is like caging them to be displayed ' much different from whining about him thinking pokÃ©mon are things to be collected like stamps if there were any real redeeming values in this they came from team rocket some pretty funny lines not really to make me laugh out loud but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach well that was officially the last american pokÃ©mon movie i'm going to see i've imported the third one and find it very enjoyable i would rather not see another japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two i'll be importing the fourth one as well forget you kids wb and 4kids you have forsaken me for the last time
