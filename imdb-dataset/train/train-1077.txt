<START> while this film certainly does possess the stench of a bad film it's surprisingly watchable on several levels first for old movie fans it's interesting to see the leading role played by dean jagger no relation to mick while jagger later went on to a very respectable role as a supporting actor even garnering the oscar in this category for 12 o'clock high here his performance is truly unique since he actually has a full head of hair i never saw him this way before and because he was by far the worst actor in the film this film just goes to show that if an actor cannot act in his earlier films doesn't mean he can't eventually learn to be a great actor another good example of this phenomenon is paul newman whose first movie the silver chalice is considered one of the worst films of the 1950s br br a second reason to watch the film is the shear cheesiness of it all the writing is bad the acting is bad and the special effects are bad for example when jagger and an unnamed cambodian are wading through the water it's obvious they are really just walking in place and the background is poorly projected behind them plus once they leave the water their costumes are 100 dry horrid continuity and mindlessly bad dialog abounds throughout the film so much so that it's hard to imagine why they didn't ask bela lugosi or george zucco to star in the film since both of them starred in many grade z horror films in many ways this would be a perfect example for a film class on how not to make a film br br so while giving it a 3 is probably a bit over generous it's fun to laugh at and short so it's worth a look for bad film fans
<START> anchors aweigh is an entertaining mgm musical that fans of the genre will enjoy but i wouldn't rate it up there with classics like singin in the rain or the band wagon this was the first of three musicals that gene kelly and frank sinatra appeared in together kelly and sinatra play joe brady and clarence doolittle two sailors on leave in hollywood who befriend a young boy dean stockwell who introduces them to his attractive young aunt kathryn grayson a struggling actress who is working as an extra at mgm though both guys are initially attracted to grayson she eventually voices a preference to joe but clarence later hooks up with a waitress pamela britton who he learns is from his hometown of brooklyn the paper thin plot leaves room for several great musical numbers including we hate to leave joe and clarence's lament to their fellow sailors as they're leaving the ship grayson's torrid rendition of jalousie sinatra's dreamy rendition of i fall in love too easily a number which is sadly deleted from some prints of this film and the worry song a fantasy dance that kelly does with animated jerry the mouse from tom and jerry fame kelly also does a sort of kissing bandit fantasy ballet which rivals his pirate's ballet in the later the pirate kelly is in peak form here in a robust and energetic performance that earned him his only oscar nomination for best actor and sinatra's endearingly shy character here is undeniably sexy an entertaining diversion for fans of the mgm musical factory
<START> bette midler is again divine raunchily humorous in love with burlesque capable of bringing you down to tears either with old jokes with new dresses or merely with old songs with more power punch than ever all in all singing new ballads power singing the good old perennial ones such as the rose stay with me and yes even wind beneath my wings the best way to appreciate the divine miss m has always been libe since this is the next best thing to it i strongly recommended to all with a mixture of adult wide eyed enchantment and appreciation and a child's mischievous wish for pushing all boundaries
<START> put yourself into carla's shoes she is an overworked unappreciated administrative drudge who is invisible you know her she's trained three of her last three bosses knows where all of the bodies are buried and might even look back at you in the mirror when you brush your teeth always having time for another thankless task and does it better than most despite a serious disability she has the desk on the way to the restroom that becomes the repository of half finished cups of coffee begging to be spilled what you don't want to hear it well she can't and neither can you until your hearing aid is in place prepare to experience life from the perspective of the hearing impaired br br carla emmanuelle devos needs a change in her life work is leading nowhere friends are relying on her to meet their domestic needs and the only way out starts with a collapse that goes virtually unnoticed she won't take a vacation a contract is going critical so the only alternative is to hire an assistant carla submits requirements that convey her real needs a 'well groomed' man this brings an applicant for approval that reminds us that we should be careful with our wishes br br paul vincent cassell does everything wrong from the start of his job interview and his getting hired clearly demonstrates carla's interest in his non job related qualities she sees potential in this former thief and as the story unfolds their relationship grows in a very unusual pattern of co dependence br br paul has a difficult transition returning to the world outside of prison walls and finds himself in another sort of prison one of the office variety and another of indentured servitude to pay off an old debt his skills as a thief help carla win a political battle in the office but paul sees a grander opportunity with carla's skill in lip reading and draws her even further into a world of intrigue br br this is a brutal film noir unrated and probably suitable for older teens carla grows more powerful professionally as well as personally as the story progresses and her disability gives her clear advantages over the rest of us she grows as a woman discovering her sensual side while she uses her resources to overcome the obstacles of competing in a man's world br br the two main characters are meant for each other in a strange way without paul carla will remain in her role of a doormat she has our sympathy hopes and best wishes even if she doesn't make the best decisions along the way br br you will hear the world through carla's ears from awkward adjustments of your hearing aid muffled sounds all but inaudible without it to relatively distinct voices when you can see who's talking with one major sense disabled we see carla's heightened intuitive power to compensate and we can all use that sense to hear not only what people say but also what they really mean
<START> to be brutally honest i loved watching severed that's why i br br gave it a 1 10 stars because of its starkly unimaginative br br story filming acting everything this film was a riot to watch if br br you enjoy watching bad films in order to poke fun at them you will br br really get a kick out of severed br br the story really doesn't matter it involves some guy who's bald br br and has a sword and goes around beheading random people br br but he has a supernatural twist nobody ever sees him do it br br even when in one very memorable scene he walks into a br br jampacked night club and whacks off some girl's noodle and br br nobody sees it br br severed doesn't merely look like it was filmed on video it was br br filmed on someone's home camcorder the filmmakers had br br knowledge of lighting very thin knowledge and composition br br actually holds together in some scenes but mostly you can't hear br br the actors you can't understand what they're doing and you laugh br br when the next vicitm gets his pumpkin detatched from his body br br go and rent this movie support films like this they are a hoot and br br a hollar
<START> elvira mistress of the dark is a fun camp horror comedy in which the fourth wall is broken a couple of times and the jokes often stay below the navel and the breasts of cassandra peterson become a character of their own br br elvira cassandra peterson is stacked horror show hostess who learns that she has inherited her aunt morgana so she goes to a little town of fallwell which is ruled by the most horrendous monster ever to embrace the earth morality comity elviras boobacious appearance is of course too much for the prunes but the kids of the town get a kick out of her different kind of approach on life and of course there is even more sinister evil her uncle vincent william morgan sheppard who is after elvira's mothers book of spells see elvira actually is a real witch she just doesn't know it yet br br for what it is elvira is quite funny film even though the script does leave a lot of room for improvement most laughs come from the difference between elvira and the people of good morals but there are a couple of good visual gags as well over all direction is okay but it never rises to be anything more than that in all a good intentionally campy comedy if you like this kind of thing that is
<START> there are few films that leave me with the feeling that gregor jordan's 'ned kelly' film did initially i had heard only half hearted recommendations and decided to see it for myself since then i have acquired both the video and soundtrack and have to say that after several viewings i am still very impressed with the underlying character of this film it is also wonderful to see something australian i appreciate its down to earth quality that if you ask me is a rarity as well as the absence of tackiness that takes away from so many films this film proves that you don't necessarily require fancy costumes and a glamorous set that absorbs how many millions of dollars to make a point the cast was a bonus including a variety of well known and might i add good looking people who did well to slip into the role of such unique characters it is interesting to note that much of the criticism regarding this film has been about who played what and how they only said so many lines however if any criticism is due it should constructively focus on the fact that a number of basic elements of the original events were excluded in reality these functioned to made it the hallmark that it is in australian history for example on a closer examination it can be discovered that there was much much more to the relationship between joe byrne and aaron sheritt and that this was in fact responsible for many more of the final outcomes for the gang than were explored in the film also overlooked was the fact that it was not only aaron sheritt's efforts alone that provided the victorian police with their insights into the unfolding mystery yes this is their interpretation of the story and it is understandable that true stories require sensationalism and at times the modification of the original plot to grab the viewers attention i feel that in this case this is the only limitation however i can accept that perhaps historical accuracy is only of significance to those who have a particular interest in the realistic events behind a situation it certainly inspired me to look more closely so watch it and decide for yourself you might not like it at all thats your opinion and thats fine maybe it is a film that appeals largely to an australian audience for me i'd call it a breath of fresh air
<START> don't let the title trick you into watching this movie i read the title saw that it came on in the middle of the night and figured it was one of those soft porn movies this movie is bad if you like soft porn movies then i'm sorry to say this isn't one there are a lot of sex but nothing shown and they only last for 5 seconds or so
<START> this story was probably one of the most powerful i have ever taken in john singleton certainly went above and beyond when putting together this educational masterpiece brilliant performances by the whole cast but epps and rapaport turned in the best and most convincing of either young star's career br br however as a college student myself many of the issues that singleton touched on were taken to the extreme in a sense that while they are issues faced on many college campuses they aren't presented as big or out in the open as this movie would make one believe in some instances it almost seemed ridiculous to think that something of this nature could actually occur however aside from the fact that it was a little over dramatic the film was brilliant and left me stunned unable to talk just think one of the things from this picture i will remember forever was a quote from lawrence fishburn's character knowledge is power without knowledge you cannot see your power brilliant just brilliant
<START> the lady from shanghai is proof that the great genius orson welles could direct a mainstream movie if he wanted to by comparison to his other more artistic works this film has only a moderate amount of craftiness and almost no esoteric elements br br the exception being of course the final scene in the hall of mirrors widely agreed to be one of the greatest scenes in the history of film it alone is worth the cost of a rental br br the sweet surprise was the superb acting by the beautiful rita hayworth her acting during the beginning and middle of the film is so excellent she made the other actors appear as caricatures instead of characters even the great mr welles
<START> you should not take what i am about to say lightly i've seen many many films and have reviewed a great deal of them in print so when i tell you that this film has the single funniest scene i have ever seen in a movie you might want to listen to me there's a lot of diversity of opinion as to what makes this incredibly stupid movie as funny as it is and to those who just didn't get well i can't blame them too much the scene i speak of comes at about the 30 minute mark and involves a dead convict shackled to john candy up until that point i had found the film dumb confusing and it was beginning to lose me when this scene came up i laughed so hard i peed my pants no movie has ever done that to me before when the project began going berserk was supposed to be the sctv movie i remember it being announced as time went on the cast was whittled down to john candy joe flaherty eugene levy there also must have been a regime change at universal while it was being shot because upon being released it was shown in nearly zero theaters when watching this a second time i listened to the theme song which actually flaunts how incomprehensible the plot is in the lyrics relaxed my logic nerve and figured out what was going on aside from the aforementioned routine going berserk has many other hilarious scenes to recommend it this is almost a 3 stooges flick except it's much funnier director david steinberg has razor sharp timing and he must have been laughing all through this as for candy who's basically in charge here he has never been funnier with all the plot devices and explanatory scenes thrown out the window he absolutely runs wild flaherty and levy follow him effortlessly there is a plot but it's a plot like animal house had a plot and yeah the script is uneven and a little slow to start once you know this however you can well appreciate the full sctv style craziness that transpires it is stupid but it's stupid on purpose and you need to remember that when you see it do see it and discover for yourself if it has the funniest scene of all time in it
<START> as a westerner watching another culture's view and tradition of marriag i found just married mesmerizing and delightful the idea of marrying a stranger through the mutual arrangement of parents is difficult especially in this modern age yet this is the case in this hindi film told with humor and fresh perspective we learn of abhay and ritika who have only met once and are now on their traditional five day honeymoon as said it is difficult to believe in this cell phone affluent age that such an archaic custom as an arranged marriage still take place we see the awkwardness that this young couple feels as they come together on their first night and how they try to forge a bond even though they do not know one another we see different views of marriage and commitment as presented by the other couples also on holiday from a couple of forty years married to others still unsure of making marital commitment there's song witty dialog poignant moments blending and comparison of new ways and tradition watching the movie with subtitles definitely loses some of the trueness of the story yet it is still a delight to watch granted some of the plot is a little trite and the bus incident a bit drawn out and contrived however the overall movie was worth watching
<START> i just finished viewing this finely conceived and beautifully acted directed movie it was nip and tuck as to whether i was going to waste my time viewing a movie on the lifetime movie network because of the horribly distracting commercials reading the earlier comments persuaded me to give it a shot after all the worst that could happen would be that i might fall asleep during one of the boring yet lengthy bug spray ads so why did i watch it mainly because when imdb gives a movie a weighted average of 5 8 who's statistical average was 7 3 it must be a sure hit br br i was totally delighted to have taken the time to view this movie commercial pox and all helen hunt continues to amaze me with her ability to take on tough roles adapting her core persona to fit each role br br the portrait she painted in this film of the tough yet perceptively human police officer was beautifully executed when the scene calls for quick witted timely delivered verbal intercourse she can stand toe to toe with any actor yet she is adept at the delivery of volumes of emotional response without uttering a word relying only on facial expression and body language without the commercials which by design kill the continuity of any good film this would have been a real edge of the seat nail biter i gave it a 9 0
<START> when you compare what brian de palma was doing in the 80's to what passes for entertainment today his films keep looking better and better dressed to kill blow out body double scarface and carlito's way are all superb works of a cinematic craftsman at the peak of his powers the guy had a long run of better than average films this is pure hitchcock with an 80's dash of lurid perversion an affectionately told tale of lust and murder with plenty of twists huge helpings of style a stunning pino donaggio score and a trashy giallo inspired plot de palma's love of complex camera work and luscious blood smudged visuals helps overcome the logical holes while the terrific performances of dennis franz keith gordon a good director in his own right nancy allen de palma's wife at the time and michael caine make every scene special let the virtuoso take you on a surreal scary erotically charged odyssey and you'll enjoy every frame of dressed to kill
<START> okay so i just got back before i start my review let me tell you one thing i wanted to like this movie i know i've been negative in the past but i was hoping to be surprised and actually come out liking the film i didn't br br it's not just the fact that every horror clichÃ© imaginable is in this and it's not just the fact that they make every little thing into a jump scare walking into a baseball bat left on the floor are you kidding me it just wasn't scary one thing i was surprised about there was more blood than i thought there was going to be which isn't saying much br br the film starts off with donna being dropped off by lisa's mom at her house she comes in goes upstairs camera pans to her father dead on the couch spooky she goes upstairs where the aforementioned baseball bat scene happens finds her brother on his bed apparently dead how could she tell he didn't have a spot of blood on him killer comes in donna hides under bed mom dies she runs outside screaming for help killer behind her i did it for us cut to therapy session this confused a lot of people everyone was asking whether or not her family actually died or if she imagined it and she mentions how the nightmares have started coming back filler dialogue ensues br br they cut to the chase pretty quick few scenes at the salon they go to the hotel of course the killer is already there for some reason he escaped 3 days ago but the police family weren't informed until he's already there more filler ensues br br i'm not going to go on about what happens in the film because i don't want to spoil it too much if you want to know who dies horror fan made a post about it already but on the subjects of deaths they weren't that exciting people in the theatre actually laughed out loud an experience i've never had before in a horror movie not even in when a stranger calls during several of them one in particular the bus boy guy who gives the most hilarious 'scared' face i've ever seen the only death involving any blood was lisa's and that was pretty scarce her throat is slashed blood if you can even call it that it was practically black splatters on the curtain thing the only other blood was on claire when we see her body apparently fenton decided to stab her a few times after he choked her to death um okay the movie was one of the most clichÃ©d i've ever seen let's see here obligatory close mirror curtain boom scene check twice actually you could tell they were struggling mandatory backing up into killer check there's also the backing up into lamp scene but you've all seen that oh you say you want a birds flying away scare well you got it yes they managed to incorporate one of those in here and of course the we have security on all exits but he still escaped scene shall i go on i could br br for anyone saying the characters weren't stupid are you kidding me oh even though the massive alarm is ringing literally saying please vacate the building and 3 of my friends are missing i'm going to go upstairs to get my wrap these characters were some of the most flawed and stupid characters ever the only likable character lisa made one of the most stupid moves in the movie oh i just realized the psycho teacher is here i must leave my strong boyfriend behind to run off by myself to warn her oh shoot the elevator is being to slow guess i'll take the stairs and run off into the construction site ugh by the end of the film they all deserved to die the only death anyone felt any remorse for was donna's boyfriend i can't even remember his name is that bad and by that time the audience was completely drained out of this scareless clichÃ©d film br br there were some positives the acting was decent for the most part and it was well shot but that's about it br br i'd give it a 1 5 and that's being generous just for the laughs and believe me the audience had a few and brittany snow br br oh and the reaction was bad very bad people were boo ing after the movie ended and buzz afterwards was very negative expect bad legs for this one
<START> very bad movie and i mean very bad the plot is predictable and it's eally cheesy the creativeness of the battle and the dance scenes for the time are the only reason i didn't give the movie a one other than that this is def a movie one can def afford not to watch i feel while watching the movie the idea behind the movie was an interesting one tho kind of clichÃ© bringing country bumpkins to the city blah blah blah but i feel it might have been at least a little better if it just wasn't so cheesy very poorly portrayed from idea to screen i think the plot is somewhat predictable at times tho the dancing i can say at times is pretty good the break dance battle twist was good if u just pop the movie and watch the dance scenes and make up your own dialog maybe it can be a 5 lol
<START> i just viewed murder at the vanities in the newly released universal pre code set and i was amazed at how much i enjoyed the vehicle end to end most of the other commentators have covered the story a murder mystery within a musical but i wanted to add a few additional notes brisson and carlisle are relatively bland compared to even most of the minor players and neither one really seems to have the proper voice for what they're singing carlisle being a trained opera singer brisson a bit wobbly on some of his high and low notes the great victor mclaglen and jack oakie play well off each other with an excellent sense of timing that keeps the ball rolling between musical numbers yes lucille ball and ann sheridan are vanities girls but let's not forget the splendid jazz singer ernestine anderson in the ebony rhapsody number gail patrick makes one of her early appearances sounding a bit like eve arden patrick would go on to become the executive producer of the perry mason tv series then there's jessie ralph as the wardrobe mistress you'll spot her also in david copperfield as aunt peggoty and the bank dick the music is very good brisson introducing the standard cocktails for two in two different scenes sweet marihuana with barely clad peyote button girls in the background blood dripping on one chorine's white skin was wonderfully chilling the ebony rhapsody with duke ellington's orchestra and a bevy of beautiful dancers both black and white mixing it up and i believe this is one of the only early musicals to feature such a mix and the costumes leave nothing to the imagination
<START> very rarely does denzil washington make a bad movie and come to think of it that goes for kevin kline and in this case this must count as one of their best films it is more about of film about how strong friendship can more than the story of steve biko although we do get an insight into what the man was like and how far the reporter and friend donald woods went to preserve the mans name and let the world know what a corrupt putrid society south africa was the direction is outstanding from david attenborough as it was for gandhi although if there is any critisism to be aimed it could be at the length of the film two and a half hours is a long time to sit through a historic movie what is amazing is how he manages to control all the extras thousands of people in both films this film really does open your eyes to what happened before the break up of aparthiet and you cannot fail to moved by it 8 out of 10
<START> i got this as a turkey movie and was i not disappointed br br acting overall even though many have been in other movies it is clear that they had to work hard to act this bad so constantly over this entire movie with out accidentally letting slip some degree of acting br br plot being generous i could say that the scriptwriter did originally start with a plot but but did his best to ignore it the plot broke down faster then a chinese knock off computer br br scrip now that was an abomination of nature it failed to flow with any rhyme or reason the majority of the lines by the characters were at best pathetic to imbecilic the script worked hard to make sure that no character managed to get to be considered memorable i have watched other movies where the extras were more interesting and memorable br br special effects rotflmao they were short bus special br br directing until you can come up with your own directing ability copy the style of your favorite directer otherwise you will only make failures like this br br it is good to know that your friends family have been giving you 10 stars for this movie
<START> to suggest anton newcombe of the brian jonestown massacre could also use some therapy is putting it mildly in dig which won the grand jury prize at sundance we watch him and his band self sabotage over seven years while ex friends and contemporaries the dandy warhols rise to comparative greatness a mobile phone advert anyway br br what elevates dig above its contemporaries is the immense near biblical comic tragedy being played out a depressingly honest treatise on art versus commerce and compromise for all his look at me i'm a bloody genius posturing newcombe is in fact revealed to be a singularly gifted if immensely troubled musician far more talented than his rival the dandy's courtney taylor who narrates the picture if newcombe is dennis hopper taylor's peter fonda br br even sadder taylor appears to realise this evinced by his weary self loathing voice over he knows his band won the battle but at what cost in truth they sold out made indie lite records kept their teeth nice and clean and probably brushed their hair twice before bedtime thus winning record contracts and a large tour bus and jettisoning all credibility in the process newcombe on the other hand lives in filth is continually busted beats up fellow band members on stage kicks hecklers in the head and is last glimpsed in dig being ferried away by police having lost the right to see his child br br two of the best films about rock's subculture have been directed by women penelope spheeris's the decline of western civilization and this one Â an instant classic the moment it was released
