<START> this movie should be required viewing for all librarians or would be librarians all of the best lines are directly related to librarianship the public library vs academic library argument is a classic argument waged among librarians and library school students it also breaks many librarian stereotypes librarians might even be capable of having fun even if they don't usually have sex in the romance languages section the best movie about librarians desk set with katherine hepburn and spencer tracy of course
<START> this wasn't what i wanted to see i bought this on dvd and under the movie i found myself irritated and turned off the movie for a moment br br heres what i didn't like br br 1 they were shooting at the father br br 2 the tribes was really annoying br br 3 the dinosaurs mostly looked to faked br br 4 the bad scientist well he was annoying br br 5 the picture quality on the dvd was really bad br br what i did like br br 1 the music by jerry goldsmith this music is really great i have the bootleg soundtrack from this movie sadly the sound quality is not good but its ok for its time br br 2 the first time we see the dinosaurs they inspire a sort of awe br br 3 baby is kinda cute when he is in the water and is playing br br 4 that funny scene with the tent br br 5 the children who sees this film would hopefully learn that evil always loses
<START> this is quite possibly the worst movie of all time it stars shaquille o'neil and is about a rapping genie apparently someone out there thought that this was a good idea and got suckered into dishing out cash to produce this wonderful masterpiece the movie gets 1 out of 10
<START> the return of chandu is notable if one can say that for the casting of bela lugosi as the hero rather than the villain why he even gets the girl br br the story as such involves the black magic cult of ubasti trying to capture the last egyptian princess nadji the delectable maria alba and use her as a sacrifice as a means of reviving their ancient leader who just happens to look like nadji lugosi as chandu who possesses magical powers tries to thwart the villains br br director ray taylor does his best with limited resources and extensive stock footage fans of king kong 1933 will recognize the giant doors that were used to keep kong at bay in several scenes the acting is for the most part awful the actor who plays the high priest i believe lucien prival for example uses that acting coach inspired pronunciation that was so common in the early talkies the less said about the others the better br br it is a mystery why lugosi accepted parts in independent quickies at this stage of his career because he was still a bankable star at universal at this time maybe it was because in this case he got to play the hero and get the girl who knows as his career started to spiral downwards in the late 30s this kind of fare would become the norm for lugosi rather than the exception br br
<START> oh dear this movie could have been sub titled when writers go on strike what a stinker i had really high hopes for this mostly after reading imdb reviews which makes me wonder about the whole imdb rating system but that's a separate matter i loved steve carrell in anchorman bruce almighty the office etc so i was expecting great things to say i was disappointed is the understatement of the year there are so many things wrong with this movie but i'll confine myself to a the implausibility of any family behaving like these people do a mass aerobics workout what planet is that real life on the clunky script a murderer of love please and the fact that the character of dan is so unlikable you find yourself wondering what the girl saw in him to make her fall in love with him this movie was filled to bursting with clunky dialogue creaking direction ridiculous set scenes and it was slow slow slow we would have walked out after half an hour if we'd not been with my parents who don't get out much and don't like to waste money unlike the makers of this movie who would have been better off throwing all the cash spent making this movie into a bonfire that would have been more entertaining if you like movies avoid this like the plague
<START> although i recently put this on my 10 worst films list i have to say it's probably no worse than burt reynolds in the maddening or any of the look who's talking sequels still it's pretty nauseating even with sexy drew barrymore playing something of a horror movie answer to holly golightly relocating from new york city to los angeles but finding out she's being stalked by a murderous look alike poor sally kellerman a quirky actress of great acclaim in the '70s is reduced here to a paltry supporting role and barrymore's leading man george newbern is the worst type of sitcom actor always pausing for a laugh after every line the picture is swill but drew's bloody shower scene boasts showmanship and the identity of the psycho although right out of a scooby doo episode is interesting but as for the finale get real who had to clean up that mess from
<START> a fashion designer trips over a cat and falls into a pool hitting her head on something floating on the surface with rather cheesy effects this was a tv movie she floats up out of her body she floats through a tunnel of rings of swirling orange smoke and black rigid figures tip into her view they look like the mannequins in her apartment i almost thought i was watching a jess franco movie as her friends revive her a black arm grabs her by the wrist and she has to struggle to get loose when she is revived she remembers everything and has a nasty bruise on her forearm br br shortly thereafter she nearly gets hit by an out of control car that comes up on the sidewalk behind her on halloween she decides with her boyfriend to go to mexico for a vacation when she gets there she's surprised to find it's the day of the dead they're annoyed by another american tourist who keeps following them and he almost drowns them br br the designer is encouraged to join a group of people who've had near death experiences they've all experienced the tunnel but not the black figures or the repeated near escapes from death one of them has and he's very anxious she's also encouraged to meet with a psychic br br a doctor tells her about people he calls walkers the name of the novel this was based on they're people who supposedly died of one cause that when examined prove to have died of another cause thus it's like they continued walking around after dying until they died again but he blames it on poor record keeping br br i watched this on the 102 minute video and it felt awfully long i can't imagine that there's actually a 192 minute version perhaps if it was meant to be watched over two or more nights on tv it would better be watched that way than in one sitting br br i've only read one gary brandner novel floater and if it is representative of his work he's not the most original of writers floater had the common plot of picked on kid kills people in revenge even the variation was pretty common picked on kid dies and kills people years later in revenge from beyond the grave and in fact it has a point in common with this movie in that the kid practices astral projection and when he is drowned he floats up out of his body as here i don't know how closely from the dead of night follows his novel walkers i understand the howling movies don't bear much resemblance to his novels br br it's quite a slow movie and the special effects and cinematography are really held down by the presumably low budget and made for tv shortcomings there are a lot of easily recognizable character actors in it it also feels very dated more early to mid 1980s than 1989 i found it to be boring a much better low budget movie covering similar subject matter that i don't think has dated as badly is sole survivor 1983 arguably the inspiration for the 2000s final destination movies it blows from the dead of night away
<START> i watched this film not really expecting much i got it in a pack of 5 films all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could i expect and you know what i was right they were all terrible this movie has a few and a few is stretching it interesting points the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch the drummer is very like a drummer i e damned annoying and well thats about it actually the problem is that its just so boring in what i can only assume was an attempt to build tension a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious i had my thumb on the fast forward button ready to press for most of the movie but gave it a go and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking coz they don't half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot i thought he looked a bit like a meercat all this and i haven't even mentioned the killer i'm not even gonna go into it its just not worth explaining anyway as far as i'm concerned star and london are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of london who was actually quite funny it wasn't because of their acting talent i've certainly seen a lot worse but i've also seen a lot better best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry
<START> i'm a huge fan of ivan reitman i loved evolution and who didn't like ghostbusters from the trailer you already know that uma's character will get dumped by luke's so the build up is obviously towards the moment when she unleashes her superpowers on him but the pay off is just not there the shark tossing did manage to get a slight giggle but once again it was all in the trailer br br no one does breathless quite like uma and luke is diet owen on his good days if not for riann wilson you would sit there with a constipated smile until your cheeks start to cramp this is a comedy right br br it's not awful it just sits there like a stale cracker behind the fridge this could have been such a brilliant send up of superhero movies and feminism but fails on both counts let's see if jason reitman can salvage the family name
<START> not a bad word to say about this film really i wasn't initially impressed by it but it grew on me quickly i like it a lot and i think its a shame that many people can't see past the fact that it was banned in some territories mine being one of them the film delivers in the shock gore and atmosphere department the score is a beautiful piece of suspense delivering apparatus it only seems fair that chris young went on to be one of the best composers in the business the acting in this film is of a somewhat high standard if a little wooden in some spots and the effects are very real and gritty all of this is high praise for a good slasher film in my book i've noted in some reviews that the film has gotten serious flack having the famous killer's p o v shot and i ask what's wrong with that it is a classic shot that evokes dread into any good fan of the genre and is a great to keep the killer's identity a secret the only thing that stops this film getting top marks in my book is that the surprise twist killer revealed is not handled with more care i mean it just happens kind of quickly though the great performances make it just about credible aside from that pranks is a great movie though i prefer the original title and its a shame that so many people knock it off as just a cheap piece of crap its more than that but only few know that as it seems to have gotten lost in the haze of early 80s slasher what a shame its a really good movie people believe me
<START> house of games is a flawlessly constructed film and one of the few films i have seen that had me gaping at the screen in astonishment at how cleverly and unexpectedly it ends i first saw it on video a few years back after reading roger ebert's review which proclaimed it the best film of 1987 i had my doubts mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year boy was i in for a surprise this was one of the smartest most well written movies i had ever seen br br the screenplay is quite a piece of work not only in terms of the plot which twists and turns and pulls the rug out from under you just when you think you have it all figured out but also in terms of character development on my second viewing i began to realize that mamet's screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations the climax of the movie is particularly effective because it is absolutely inevitable it stems naturally from what we know about the characters and it is therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending the performances by lindsay crouse and joe mantegna also add enormously to the film i cannot picture any other actor besides mantegna playing the role of mike and crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset their work plus mamet's extraordinary screenplay combine to create one of the greatest films of the 1980's it is truly a must see
<START> even though i'm quite young the beatles are my absolutely favourite band i never had the chance to hear their music as it was releases but have loved them since i can remember br br it's the sort of film that is worth trying the once i can see why it wasn't released in the cinema but it is certainly a great film to put on the tv i was flicking through my tv guide and happened to see this film it didn't much details except something like 'john lennon and paul mccartney meet after the beatles have broken up jared harris stars' i'd never heard of him he played john or aiden quinn who played paul however they are certainly underestimated actors br br the film had a slow start but as it developed i could see how well quinn but especially harris played their characters as a huge fan i sort of know what the real lennon and mccartney are like the script was brilliant and harris got lennon's accent personality and mannerisms spot on quinn played mccartney quite well but sometimes went into his irish accent the make up artists made them look excellent br br this paragraph may be counted as a spoiler br br as i mentioned before it got off to a slow start but soon developed and became quite an emotional film i found the bit in the park a total waste of time and quite out of character for both of the musicians as for lennon's rude line in the italian restaurant totally unnecessary the ending was very poignant and brings a tear to my eye whenever i watch it br br it is quite different from the other biographical films i've seen where it's about how the beatles got together and became famous and those never really did the characters that well e g 'backbeat' br br in conclusion i would say if you're a beatles or john lennon or paul mccartney fan give it a chance you may have pleasent surprise at only about 95 minutes long it's worth waiting for the film to develop br br if anyone does know whether the meeting of 1976 really did happen please send it to the 'comments page' for this film i'd be very interested
<START> possible spoilers perhaps i must say that cinderella ii dreams come true is one of the worst movies ever made first of all the movie was made during the height of disney's sequel rampage it was created around the same time as the little mermaid ii the jungle book ii and peter pan ii all of which were disservices to their original film classics disney also made the hunchback of notre dame ii and atlantis ii but i'm going to drop that topic because their original movies were never really classics in the first place let me go ahead and say that i am an avid supporter of good disney films and i absolutely adore the original disney cinderella the sequel to cinderella however was a waste of time the character of cinderella in the sequel was so very unlike the original girl that i grew up watching in the original cinderella was kind and loving the new cinderella had very out of character moments with current era phrasing like i'm going to do this banquet my way let me also tell you that new cinderella as i have affectionately named her says ewww that is the anti cinderella i try to find the best in people but in the sequel anastasia one of the stepsisters is good what the heck why they made it all out to be like lady tremaine and drizella are just horrible family members for poor little anastasia my question to the world did the people at disney watch the original cinderella when making this sequel well it surely doesn't seem so if i remember correctly anastasia was just as abusive to cinderella as drizella and lady tremaine i am all for redemption and forgiveness but there was no point of redemption for anastasia in this movie in the first one anastasia was evil in the second one she is good one just can't leave a story like this i hope disney realizes that this movie among other movies is shaming walt disney's name perhaps now that michael eisner is gone things will start shaping up around the house of mouse
<START> unlike the adventures of buckaroo banzai or big trouble in little china or conan the barbarian which are horrible films that have a certain coolness and self deprecating humor that turn them into cult sensations the golden child is just plain bad br br the premise itself is not unworkable and there are some funny moments but here the eddy murphy flip attitude just deflates any feeling of tension or danger in the story and the special effects are silly enough to do more damage to that tension the mystic secrets of tibetan buddhism are lampooned rather than drawn upon to compel br br without a feeling that anything is at stake or that the characters are faced by real danger why should we care br br who should see this film br br big fans of eddy murphy who can't help themselves br br i can't think of anyone else br br i'll give this film a 4 out of 10 for the occasional joke that worked
<START> i was impressed that i could take my 5 year old son to this movie without having to cover his ears or eyes no sex scenes no profanity and not even any violence just good entertainment enjoyable from beginning to end dennis quaid pulls off this movie very well
<START> i am very open to foreign films and like to think that i grasp what they are trying to accomplish although some things are lost in translation but the simplicity and intelligence of this film were boring i've often thought how interesting it would be to make a movie that just shows a typical day or time period that really had no point now that i've seen a movie like that i will no longer be thinking along those lines there's tones about society racism and some desire but south park has that and when i watch south park it actually moves me to feel an emotion the closest thing i felt to an emotion during this movie was the yawn i experienced after the first five minutes i rate the typical movie a seven or above because i love most every film i gave this film a one
<START> in his otherwise excellent book lincoln in american memory the historian merrill peterson calls young mr lincoln a boring dreadful film this amazingly wrongheaded analysis simply proves that great historians are rarely fine film critics i am working on a doctoral dissertation on abraham lincoln and frederick douglass as part of my preparation for writing the dissertation i made a careful analysis of this film and of tag gallaghers brilliant interpretation of it in his seminal book on ford young mr lincoln comes out that culminating year of the first phase of ford's cinematic authorship 1939 in that greatest of hollywood years ford directed three superb still not fully appreciated films drums along the mohawk stagecoach and young mr lincoln it might seem odd to say that stagecoach is not fully appreciated all but the most purblind of critics must perceive that it is one of of the greatest westerns and perhaps even one of the hundred greatest films of all time however what is not fully appreciated is that these three films work together as a kind of trilogy a triptych in fact ford is creating a sort of mythic history of america on screen drums along the mohawk is the revolutionary war young mr lincoln is pre civil war america finally stagecoach is post civil war america what the three films have in common is that they are an extended meditation on the american adam and his errand into the wilderness what are the psychic and social costs of american manifest destiny as america strives to build a new human city in the wilderness lincoln symbolizes americas journey as he seeks to reconcile the civilizational inmpulse law with the freedom of the wilderness young mr lincoln is not history it is full of historical howlers' as both ford and trotti were well aware but myth this is lincoln the symbol of justice and mercy lincoln the man of the wilderness striving to found a civilization within himself and to become the remarkable lawgiver' of young america young mr lincoln is not history like james agee's long forgotten teleplay about lincoln and like sandburgs biography it is an epic poem a very beautiful epic poem
<START> this one is a great one robert de niro and cuba gooding have teamed up to make a powerful and very influential film this is the true story of the first black us navy diver and the obstacles he faced in attaining his certification at the hands of a racist master diver along the way he must also face plain old bigotry from all of his classmates none of whom want him in their class they move out of the barracks when he arrives ultimately he becomes certified and goes on to have a great career as a us navy diver watch this one it's a great tale of courage and honor as the story unfolds we get to watch racism slowly dissipate and everyone begins to respect men one at a time
<START> the best martial arts movie ever made this one movie is better than anything bruce lee ever did a classic with a thoroughly entertaining and brutal climax jackie chan is the king of martial arts movies and the true king of kung fu it's a great pity that whilst bruce lee had been so overrated it took jackie chan an eternity to become popular in europe and america jackie rules
<START> i am very disappointed with k 911 the original good quality of k 9 doesn't exist any more this is more like a sitcom some of casts from original movie returned and got some of my memory back the captain of dooley now loves to hit him like a scene from old comedy show that was crazy what's the deal with the change of police it seems like they are now lapd not san diego pd it is a completely different movie from
