<START> as others have noted this should have been an excellent hammer style film and it seems to me that that's how most of the actors were instructed to play it but the screenplay is so leaden poorly paced and filled with a lot of dull soliloquies poor timothy dalton is saddled with most of them that it's all too overblown and self important this is an uncharacteristically weak performance from dalton although he quietly nails the climactic scene where dr rock finally realizes what he's done the only actor who comes off really well is patrick stewart who is a most welcome sight freddie francis may have been a great cinematographer but he was a lousy director
<START> if you haven't figured out what is going to happen in this film in the first five minutes then give it a couple more minutes lilia is a widow she has been left on the shelf for too long and she wants to burst out she has a teenage daughter which only highlights that she is not getting any younger while checking up on her daughter she discovers a world she never dared the cabaret where she can belly dance in skimpy sequined outfits while men throw money at her the film is very misogamist it's portrayal of men is dismal which is rather odd as lilia stoops to jiggle around for them not for money but just for the hell of it when she succeeds in arousing them it makes her feel like a woman again she does not wish to connect with them but she is addicted to the attention the other dancers all are mostly aging women who look like men in drag and realize their time in the spotlight is short lived not short enough i say she does find romance however brief with you guessed it no surprises here we didn't see coming though the ending is good you realize that it could have ended no other way maybe this film just isn't targeting my demographic 30 male
<START> the opening 5 minutes gave me hope then meyers proved he only had one good idea for the rest of the movie absolute lowest common denominator humor painful viewing a complete chore written no doubt in less than a week just like the first one give meyers the hook and lock him in a cell with adam sandler and will farrell and don't let him out until he's developed a decent script for something anything he has it in him these austin powers things are just embarrassing br br let goldmember sink without trace
<START> von trier once explained how he created such strong involvement from the viewer with his movies by placing his movie world in about the middle of the real world and the imagined world so as viewers we think we watch a true story while in fact we are thoroughly manipulated often to the point that the movie works disturbing dancer in the dark or painful the idiots idioterne of course the dogme films acted only as a vehicle for this theory besides creating some welcome spotlight on von trier br br the story is typical for von trier our hero is idealistic seems to balance his relations with everybody else but soon becomes the victim of the problems others have created in the past for themselves the idealist inevitably has to reject society in order to stay idealistic and becomes the terrorist mankind is spoiled and purity only leads to self destruction these elements were also very omnipresent in breaking the waves and dancer in the dark the movie is also full of cynical even humorous undertones about the role of the germans and americans in post war germany br br as a technical achievement the movie is wonderfully designed shifting and fading washed out colors screen overlays action on different overlays with the shooting of the soon to be mayor as the most interesting in this movie we can see how good von trier's handles film as a technical medium in his later works he seems to step down from this as if he is not longer interested in technical achievements because they become so easily available
<START> if you want to see a retarded homosexual karate expert beat up a bunch of try hard wannabe mexican gangsters repeatedly for an hr then this is the film for you if not then choose another dvd from the 20c bin which is the only place this film belongs the acting was so horrible that i had to force myself to watch it to the end the cover makes it look so cool but its just another cheap b grade gangster film along the lines of 2 g's and a key bloody streetz and menace i would not buy or rent this film unless you are planing to get stoned and plot editing and acting really don't matter to you it is truly the worst film in the history of humanity
<START> i had no idea what the film is about before i saw it because tashan only had teaser trailers while it was being promoted so i asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said that it is the directorial debut of vijay krishna acharya who wrote the screenplays for dhoom 1 2 and saif ali khan's son ibrahim makes his debut in the film by playing him as a child in his flashback br br after watching it i understood that why their wasn't a proper trailer because there wasn't anything in the film to show the story was extremely dum and even a 10 year old child can come up with a better story line there was hardly any action and the camera shook at every possible angle there is and it's difficult to figure out that who is killing who also the action was daft unrealistic e g 1 man with a handgun managed to kill about 100 men with machine guns br br while i was watching tashan it reminded me of 3 films br br sin city during the opening credits br br koyla anil kapoor's terrible english like amrish puri in koyla br br jhoom barabar jhoom the outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not even a jot funny br br i also heard the budget is 40 crores which is the same amount as dhoom 2 and i don't know where all the money went to anyway if you did not like dhoom 2 then there is absolutely no chance that you will like tashan race was hot on heels and that is a million times better br br the only 2 good songs are dil haara challiya and both songs are shot in greece at good locations but what is the use of it in a rubbish film even anil kapoor's terrible english couldn't save this discomfiture
<START> i found this film to be the usual french slap in america's face the camera all too often focuses on fat people on sloppy homes and on tacky rural areas while the narration seems to sympathize with and admire the small town folks who are introduced to the viewer the cinematography exploits and demeans them there were undoubtedly thin people to be seen in glencoe and neat organized homes but malle chose to show us the worst of what was there to be seen br br i can only hope that some american filmmakers will go to france to reveal to the american public its worst elements i can assure you as a frequent visitor to france that all is not well there foreign immigrants are not readily assimilated thus creating severe social inequities but americans are not eager to unmask the french for their prejudice toward their own compatriots and their envy toward the u s so we're not likely to see films on the subject
<START> i love all types of films especially horror that being said survival does not live up to any of the hype surrounding it br br i can't give it any points on originality there is nothing wrong with exploring the same themes or remaking what others have done it has just become a cop out for indie films to take us on a slasher journey through the woods a crazed killer and as of lately throw in some crazy family on those lines i have to compare it with the likes of texas chainsaw wrong turn though the twist in that one is obvious and others survival falls up way short against comparable films the plot was just not original in any way some films can get by with a weak and way over done plot with superb acting special fx or a slew of other factors survivial doesn't have any of that to bank on if you will note the following the acting in the movie never took off i don't knock or blame the actors for that nor the director the dialogue was at best mediocre and the actors involved never showed not saying didn't have the talent to pull it off i mention 2 standouts the leading man in this film certainly has the look but i seriously thinks he needs to consider more training before he is ready to carry a film the actor who portrayed greg also had potential but we never got to see any of it watch the movie to see why you won't believe it br br the grainy film look ah yes that little tid bit of film making magic designed to take us to the glory days of grindhouse films in today's film making that has become a gimmick it either works or it doesn't in this case it just does not work there are too many other flaws going on so it winds up distracting from the film not adding to it that being said i think they did a good job of adding that grain that is some good quality grain i think with a different script better direction and possibly actors they should try another grindhouse attempt they will probably pull it off br br as far as the tech aspects in my opinion they never quite gelled for me either better care could have been taken with audio sounds like it was fed directly into the camera but there is nothing wrong with that and for being shot on dv it was too soft for my taste br br that is all i have to say about that
<START> the man in the moon is a warm and moving coming of age drama centering around a farming family in the 1950's the main story follows a 14 year old girl reese witherspoon who develops a crush on a 17 year old neighbor jason london who ends up falling for her older sister emily warfield and how an unexpected tragedy alters this family's dynamics forever the 1950's are lovingly evoked here and the screenplay gives you characters you come to care about almost immediately witherspoon already begins to show the oscar winning talent she would develop in this early role and london makes a charming leading man warfield lends a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister that is effective as well kudos to sam waterston and tess harper who play the girls' parents and gail strickland who plays london's mom i was unexpectedly moved by this quiet and affecting drama that stirs up strong emotions and gives deeper meaning to the phrase family ties
<START> i saw dick tracy when i was very young i didn't know who any of the actors were and i didn't know the movie would turn out different than the way it was previewed i sure loved it though br br warren beatty stars as the crime fighting 1930's detective dick tracy who goes after the biggest mob bosses in the city this time big boy caprice al pacino has killed a very powerful man and is out to take over the city with his singer girlfriend breathless mahoney madonna who has her eye on tracy it becomes even worse because a new criminal is invading and the worst part is this criminal has no face he or she is very unknown plus the famous villians are back from the comic book collection br br i thought that this movie was very colorful and creative it was entertaining and fun to watch especially as a child warren beaty was just like james bond of the 1930's the way he played dick tracy br br an ensemble cast of the film includes charlie korsmo glenn headly william forsythe dustin hoffman james caan ed o' ross tommy lee jones mandy patinkin charles durning plus more br br dick tracy is a movie for all ages and is a fun movie for a family to enjoy take my word for it
<START> it's nice to see a film with real people with honest feelings sissy spacek is so absolutely convincing as a simple yet nice daughter to robert farnsworth br br who finally in his last role gets to show what a fine actor he was it is hard to believe that this is a david lynch film it is slow and even sweet and moving one of the best unless you like car chases sex scenes and violence
<START> story of ireland in the 70 s this film is a beautiful reconstruction of small time ireland in the 1970 s all the gang are there see below master boyle the boys the cannon sp o'donnell senator doogan's daugter rose agnes maura and una see this film feel ireland as it was br br
<START> walerian borowczyks la bete 1975 was obviously received in different ways some were appalled some were shocked others applauded the courage i however am completely untouched bored and cannot stop asking myself why the display of incoherent inconsistent images which vaguely orbit around a central theme are considered an intellectual journey br br what was this movie actually about growing sexuality in a woman i've seen great films on this subject but this is not one of them how can one attempt to portray a growing sexuality in a girl without at least trying to characterize her as a person not only as a narrative device to dream in the nude of beasts where there are no characters there is no character study the woman persecuted by the beast was not adolescent the girl having sex with the black butler is he also characterized as a beast has a very grown up attitude to sexuality so where is the consistency is it a movie about religion if yes we would need a bit more thematic material than a priest without function character and charisma but with a strong desire towards two young boys br br is it about bestiality the metaphoric feel of the movie forbids any realistic examination of bestiality especially as realistic examination requires realistic characters so no real bestiality here some mythic beast and two priests talking to each other about the sin of bestiality enough for a college essay on the topic i don't think so br br is it about sex is it about anything i don't know i only know that showing a fired gun doesn't make a film a war movie dealing with a topic must mean more than displaying its own associations with the theme br br so look across the controversy don't be scared by the bestiality nudity ejaculations masturbation and stuff i am not look at it as you look at any other story and you might discover that this is a poorly made poorly edited poorly acted really poorly written okay some pictures are quite nice and the main character is a really good looking girl cerebral masturbation of a director who thinks beating around the bush in a hypnotic slow manner will make a story intelligent it doesn't it makes it boring
<START> this movie is best described or compare to big fish the movie by tim burton but it's a less glamorous and more in you face tale and of course here it's not the father but his grandfather who tells the stories br br the movie's narrative also moves back and forth so the story outline here at imdb might tell you more than you would like to read before watching the movie it's funny and engaging enough even though you get from one story to another and have some dramatic moments too it also surprises you here and there with things you wouldn't expect a nice little movie then that deserves your attention especially if you like movies like that o
<START> every once in a while eddie murphy will surprise you br br in a movie like the golden child especially this is a movie you'd figure would star maybe harrison ford or kurt russell or someone but eddie really does work he's smart he's funny he's brave kind courteous thrifty clean and everything else a hero should be br br having been chosen to secure a mystic child who holds the key to protecting the world from complete evil embodied perfectly by dance eddie goes from california to nepal and back all while the beautiful kee nang lewis wonders if he's all he says he is and a crazy old holy man wong perfect as always knows that he is br br it's exciting breathtaking in spots shocking and of course funny eddie is the only action hero i know who could begin a movie by making rude remarks behind some guy reading a porno magazine and end it with smart aleck remarks about ed mcmahon br br no problem with this child it's a golden find br br nine stars viva nepal
<START> this is a racist movie but worthy of study and enjoyment first time through it the natural inclination is to focus on erbe dad they have a relaxed peaceful thing going what with her still at home about to graduate from high school and him retired and kicking back waiting for inspiration to do something second time through you realize how horribly the sister's husband is dissed by her friends in the backwoods blues bar he takes it it's the thing to do these days and the critical moment passes as if they were chatting about the weather in that same scene the sister's blues song is a real tear jerker if you're the least bit sensitive and like that kind of music her performance feels like the climax of the story a blues story with the good guys being people of color in their element in backwoods sc meanwhile all the white folk in the movie lead what appears to be shallow meaningless lives fit only for making babies that's cool long as you recognize it as fiction
<START> bela lugosi plays a doctor who will do anything to keep his wife looking young and beautiful to this end he drugs brides during their wedding ceremonies to make it look as if they are dead so he can steal their bodies i'm not exactly sure what he does with the bodies i don't remember it ever being fully explained all i know is that he extracts something from them and injects it in his wife i'll just guess that it's spinal fluid spinal fluid was all the rage of mad scientists in the 40s you can pretty much guess the rest from here br br there are a couple well really more than a couple but i'll only write about two of problems that i have with this movie one is the way bela is used sure he does a decent enough job in his own overacting sort of way btw the rest of the cast is simply abysmal but to have him hiding in the back of a hearse or having him creep into the female reporter's bedroom to do nothing is just silly also why have him beat and or kill every henchman he has is it to make him look evil well someone who is kidnapping comatose brides doesn't really need to be made to look more evil br br the second problem i have is the idea of drugging brides why brides wouldn't any female under the age of 20 do watching bela go through these gyrations to get his victims i was reminded of the idiotic fisherman in i still know what you did last summer in each case there would appear to be an easier way of reaching your objective than employing a seemingly impossible plan that depends way to much on circumstances out of your control btw an alternate title for this movie is the case of the missing brides i guess that partially explains the need for 'brides'
<START> in a far away galaxy is a planet called ceta it's native people worship cats but the dog people wage war upon these feline loving people and they have no choice but to go to earth and grind people up for food this is one of the stupidest f k ng ideas for a movie i've seen leave it to ted mikels to make a movie more incompetent than the already low standard he set in previous films it's like he enjoying playing in a celluloid game of limbo how low can he go the only losers in the scenario are us the viewer mr mikels and his silly little handlebar mustache actually has people who still buy this crap br br my grade f br br dvd extras commentary by ted mikels the story behind the making of 9 and a half minutes 17 minutes 15 seconds of behind the scenes footage ted mikels filmography and trailers for the worm eaters girl in gold boots the doll squad ten violent women featuring nudity blood orgy of the she devils the corpse grinders
<START> six degrees had me hooked i looked forward to it coming on and was totally disappointed when men in trees replaced it's time spot i thought it was just on hiatus and would be back early in 2007 what happened all my friends were really surprised it ended we could relate to the characters who had real problems we talked about each episode and had our favorite characters there wasn't anybody on the show i didn't like and felt the acting was superb i alway like seeing programs being taped in cities where you can identify the local areas i for one would like to protest the canceling of this show and ask you to bring it back and give it another chance give it a good time slot don't keep moving it from this day to that day and advertise it so people will know it is on
<START> as a big fan of the original film it's hard to watch this show the garish set decor and harshly lighted sets rob any style from this remake the mood is never there instead it has the look and feel of so many television movies of the seventies crenna is not a bad choice as walter neff but his snappy wardrobe and swank apartment don't fit the mood of the original or make him an interesting character he does his best to make it work but samantha egger is a really bad choice the english accent and california looks can't hold a candle to barbara stanwick's velvet voice and sex appeal lee j cobb tries mightily to fashion barton keyes but even his performance is just gruff without style br br it feels like the tv movie it was and again reminds me of what a remarkable film the original still is
