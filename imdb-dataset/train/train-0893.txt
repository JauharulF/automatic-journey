<START> brief encounter is a ghastly and pointless remake of the 1945 david lean classic which was based on noel coward's play still life a doctor removes a particle of grit from a woman's eye at a railway station he is in a miserable relationship she is happily married social worker of italian ancestry they meet by accident on another occasion form an instant attraction and arrange to meet each other every wednesday the pair fall in love but after spending a few afternoons together they realise that they have no realistic chance of happiness and agree to part coward's original one act play concerned two ordinary people who fall in love sophia loren and richard burton two super stars and veterans of hollywood epics are nobody's idea of 'ordinary people' loren in particular is miscast sophia loren in full make up looking like a million dollars working as a part time voluntary social worker at a citizen advice bureau just doesn't ring true burton looking haggard with dyed hair too much make up and wearing platform shoes doesn't come across as your average general practitioner that said you can't really blame them for having an affair after seeing their spouses burton is married to a literary critic who spends her evenings penning poisonous reviews and who treats her husband with total contempt loren's husband jack hedley potters around the house all day and is terminally boring the most exciting thing he has ever done is nearly have an affair six years previous their final scene together will induce nausea you've been a long long way away etc that great british jobbing actor john lemesurier has a three minute cameo as burton's friend and appears to be slightly inebriated speaking his lines in a barely audible voice it's a sad and forgettable performance in a dismal awful rehash of a cinema classic avoid at all costs
<START> i was hardly aware of the time in history depicted in this 1971 brazilian black comedy however that is not to say it wasn't accessible to me because the movie makes it very clear it's set in 16th century brazil where rival french and portuguese settlers are exploiting the indigineous people as confederates in their battle to assert dominance what is particularly interesting about the movie is that it is made by the portuguese from the point of view of the french the hero is a likable frenchman the portuguese are barbarians and the rest of the french are oppressive and greedy the film's portuguese makers are objective because when all is said and done we see that it makes no difference whose side one takes it's about heredity overpowered by environment in a time starkly defined by tribes enemies are made and perpetuated and like so the environmental integration never progresses br br a frenchman is captured by the portuguese is then captured by an indigenous tribe the tupinambas after they massacre a group of portuguese the tribe's shaman predicted they would find a strong portuguese man to cannibalize as revenge for the chief's brother being killed by a portugeuse musket ball thinking the frenchman is portuguese they believe they now have one nevertheless the frenchman is granted unrestrained course of the village is sooner or later given a wife and assumes their accustomed appearance rather than his western clothes or any clothes another frenchman comes to the village and tells the tribe that their prisoner is indeed portuguese then assures the incensed frenchman that he will tell them the truth when the frenchman finds a secret treasure trove that another european has hidden nearby br br i found the opening scene funny because its narration apposed with its contradictions on screen serve as great satire even if the movie didn't seem to want to maintain that tone very much more often it's actually not a terribly riveting film the bountiful essential locale fierce way of life and ripened native women make not only the frenchman but us too forget any threat and we have the feeling of him as a free man it should not be that terribly hard to escape the cannibalism is as scarce of desire as the full frontal nudity of the cast suggested in lieu as the representative core of pereira dos santos's dry political cartoon of new world mythology and undeveloped social coherence at any rate this 1500s era social commentary shot on location at a bay with 365 islands played almost entirely nude and almost entirely written in tupi encourages effective breakdown of established ways which are topical because they've repeated themselves for centuries
<START> i wanted to love this movie how could i not love it cary grant jayne mansfield stanley donen all icons in their own way however the train wreck that was suzy parker ruined the entire experience for me her acting was so appalling that i sat there with my jaw hanging open not believing my eyes or ears i could barely make it through one viewing that's how hideous she is in this br br cary gorgeous and in fine dramatic form jayne adorable endearing and obviously having a ball the supporting cast does alright and the city of san francisco is captured in all its stunning retro elegance br br then you see suzy parker attempting to speak her lines with a woodenness a deadness a cluelessness that simply defies belief who told this creature she could act oy vey people
<START> tintin and i recently aired as an episode of pbs's p o v series it's based on a taped interview of georges remi a k a herge tintin's creator from 1971 in which in discusses his various experiences publishing his popular character first in a catholic newspaper then in his own series of comic books awesome sweeping views of various comic pages and surreal images of herge's dreams i first encountered tintin in the pages of children's digest at my local elementary school library reading the secrets of the unicorn my mom later got a subscription to cd and i read the entire red rackham's treasure every month in 1978 i remember seeing some tintin comic books in a local book store after that but for some reason i didn't get any probably because i was 12 and i thought i was outgrowing them i do have breaking free a book written and drawn by j daniels published in 1989 six years after herge's death haven't read it yet this film also covers the artist's personal life as when he left his first wife after his affair with a colorist in his employ whom he later married her name is fanny and she is interviewed here if you love tintin and his creator this film is definitely worth a look update 9 4 07 i've now read breaking free tintin and the captain are the only regular characters that appear here and they are tailored to the anti capitalist views of mr daniels with tintin portrayed as a rabble rouser with a chip on his shoulder who nevertheless cares for the captain who he's staying with the captain here is just trying to make ends meet with a wife and daughter that he loves dearly they and other construction workers vow to strike after a fellow employee dies from a faulty equipment accident the whole thing takes place in england with working class cockney accents intact not the kind of thing herge would approve of but an interesting read nonetheless oh yes dog snowy only appears in the top left corner of the cover which has tintin running over the police and the dedication page
<START> i don't give much credence to aids conspiracy theories but its sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatized in the early years of the aids epidemic the suffering and paranoia of the scared and dying often generated such dark fantasies this was especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme demi monde of san francisco the city renowned for its beauty has rarely appeared uglier than in this film a sense of darkness and decomposition pervades every scene br br while the acting and plot can't be said to be well done the films unique cultural context and oppressively dark mood at least partly saves the film from being a complete loss actually i found the most interesting performance to be irit levi as a crusty and cynical jewish lesbian police detective she's interesting though not necessarily convincing br br highlights the film's use of the garishly tragic turandot is an effective motif and there is a sublime silent cameo by iconic performance artist ron athey
<START> a female executioner played by the sexy jennifer thomas ii has the fun job of fulfilling all the fantasies of all the men on death row before they meet their maker and what a way to go lucky this film is not real or we would have a lot more people in this world on death row br br it starts out real slow low light and bad acting like most b films it gets better as it moves along and ends with a bang br br i would rate it very high on the low cost very sexy movies of the 90's it's a must see once the kids are away or in bed
<START> this movie is so good i could watch it all day long mary kate and ashley were robbed at oscar time if i got to be one of the actors i would be so excited i can't wait for the new charlie's angels movie starring mary kate and ashley
<START> tainted look at kibbutz life br br this film is less a cultural story about a boy's life in a kibbutz but the deliberate demonization of kibbutz life in general in the first two minutes of the movie the milk man in charge of the cows rapes one of his calves and it's all downhill from there in terms of the characters representing typical kibbutznikim besides the two main characters a clinically depressed woman and her young son every one else in the kibbutz is a gross caricature of wellÂevil br br the story centers on how the kibbutz like some sort of cult slowly drags the mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follows there is no happiness no joy no laughter in this kibbutz every character situation represents a different horrific human vice like misogyny hypocrisy violence cultism repression etc for example while the protagonist is a strikingly handsome european looking 12 year old boy Â his older brother is a typical kibbutz youth complete with his jewish physical appearance and brutish personality he cares more about screwing foreign volunteers than the health of his dying mother he treats these volunteers like trash after his little brother pleads of him to visit his dying mother whom he hasn't seen in a long time due to his military service he orders quote Â linda go take shower and i cum in two minutes br br there is one other good character in this movie Â a european foreigner who plays the mother's boyfriend when the animal rapist tries to hit the mother's son the boyfriend defends him by breaking the rapist's arm he is summarily kicked out of the kibbutz then for violent behavior against one of the kibbutz members more hypocrisy the indescribably annoying french woman who plays the school teacher preaches that sex cannot happen before age 18 or without love and gives an account of the actual act that's supposed to be humorous for the audience but is really just stupid she of course is screwing the head of the kibbutz in the fields who then in turn screws the little boy's mom when her mental health takes a turn for the worse br br the film portrays the kibbutz like some sort of cult children get yanked out of their beds in the middle of the night and taken to some ritual where they swear allegiance in the fields overseen by the kibbutz elders the mother apparently can't escape the kibbutz although in reality anyone was is always free to come and go as they choose it's a mystery how the boy's father died but you can rest assured the kibbutz drove him to it and his surviving parents are another pair of heartless wretched characters that weigh down on the mother and her son br br that's the gist of this movie one dimensional characters over dramatization dry performances and an insidious message that keeps trying to hammer itself into the audience's head Â that kibbutz life was degrading miserable and even deadly for those who didn't fit in i feel sorry for the guy who made this film Â obviously he had a bad experience growing up in a kibbutz but i feel as though he took a few kernels of truth regarding kibbutz life and turned them into huge atomic stereotyped bombs
<START> a fantastic show and an unrealized classic the league of gentlemen remains as one of the greatest modern comedies of recent times br br with a dark and bizarre style of humor that towers over the tired formulaic approach of it's inferior yet unfortunately far more acknowledged successor little britain the league of gentlemen was truly something special during a rather quiet era in british comedy br br up until it's arrival on the scene there had never really been anything like the league of gentlemen before on the surface a seemingly simplistic sketch show the show soon unfolds as a vivid sinister but incredibly hilarious universe populated with all manner of brilliant comedic creations what really sets the show apart from it's rivals is it's approach to telling us it's story rather than serve us re hashed sketches barely distinguishable from the next here we see each individual or group of characters go through their various journeys and story lines no visit to them is the same and each time they offer us up with a surprise br br gradually over three series' and a christmas special the fictional town of royston vasey is heaving with a grotesque yet hilarious populace and that's probably the main reason why the show is such a joy to watch and also the reason why the show would easily merit more series' unlike other current shows like the catherine tate show or more importantly little britain the league both know when a character has run it's course and have the opportunity to deal with that several fan favorite's who could have easily been kept on to entertain further bowed out before the series came to a close giving room for fellow characters to grow more or allow for the introduction of newer residents of royston vasey to make their mark br br another thing that sets this show above others is that the writing team approach the script process with care and intelligence as mentioned before all four members of the league have a sound mind when it comes to judging the longevity of their creations and when it's time to call it quits in respect to certain characters this awareness has also meant the league of gentlemen undergoes a bold evolution not usually seen in a show of this nature the narrative driven and far darker third series is a brave step away from the more sketch based first two series' and this bold move by the league really pays off with the third series there's less of an urgency for them to please an audience and like the christmas special they pursue individual stories with a clear narrative unlike the more sketch based previous series' that succesfully binded together various sets of sketches into a series' long story arc br br the third series is both a refreshing change of pace of style as well as a real treat for fans who've already seen the first two despite some polarized opinion on the third series any real fan of the league will appreciate what the third series has to offer as well as really enjoy the more character based episodes that only delve deeper into fan favorite's but pair up and inter wine characters that might not have crossed paths previously br br it might take a little trying to get into the change in style but it's definitely worth it and in my opinion the third series is the best and also provides a firm conclusion to the series br br the show's not without it's drawbacks and very occasionally certain characters and set pieces appear somewhat out of place but for the most part the genius writing dark nature of the show and the host of brilliant characters that are often all too close to real life make for a real treat and prove what comedy should be about and puts much of the more recent catch phrase driven and often desperate attempts at comedy to shame
<START> i saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart no other story had such a unfinished ending i grew up on many great anime movies and this was one of my favourites because it was so unusual a story about unfairness and cruelty and loneliness and life and choices that can't be undone and the need for others chirin is made alone when the wolf kills his mother but the wolf is alone too when chirin follows him into the mountain the wolf doesn't kill the lamb even though each night he says maybe i'll eat you tomorrow the tape of it i have is broken and degraded from age and use i will repair it and watch the movie again someday and cry just as hard as i did as a child stories like this with this depth and feeling and this intricacy of meaning are very rare it is a sad story but i've never encountered any catharsis more beautifully made i am glad i have seen this movie and i'm glad i saw it as a child
<START> this is a lovely tale of guilt driven obsession br br matiss on a lonely night stroll in riga passes by a woman on the wrong side of a bridge railing he passes by without a word only the splash in the water followed by a cry for help causes him to act and then only too little and too late br br the film chronicles his efforts at finding out more about the woman on a troll of local bars he finds her pocketbook he pieces more and more of her life together his look changes as his obsession grows he has to make things right in a marvelously filmed dialog with the bastard ex boyfriend he forces alexej to face up to the guilt that both feel br br haunting long takes a gritty soundtrack to accentuate the guilt barking dogs footsteps lovely film noir with a lovely twist a good indie ending
<START> this short film trailer is basically about superman and batman working together and forming an uneasy alliance obviously the two characters have vastly differing views on how to deal with crime and what constitutes punishment it's a lot of fun to see these two iconic characters try to get along i won't go int to the storyline here but i will get into the acting which is terrific everyone is well cast the two actors playing superman and batman are well suited to their characters the same filmmakers that made batman dead end and grayson also made this short film of the three i probably liked this one the least but i still thought it was well done for me world's finest is a 7 10
<START> i look at this page and it seems disapproving to me to have to listen to someone ramble and rant at a real classic sure i agree to let everyone have their opinion but here's mine br br this movie should not be missed by any classic horror watcher and should be seen many casual viewers around the world sure it has lost some of it's flair and greatness with age especially in todays world of cgi effects but that's not why you should like it br br you should like it because it actually is a scary movie even for today's standards it's overall ickyness will creep you out just as much as the original audiences so don't slam a classic if you haven't given it a chance watch it but not with a critical attitude watch it to have fun how it was originally intended
<START> i can barely find the words to express how utterly utterly awful this film is i was sold on the promise of action with segal and stealth aircraft which normally make for an entertaining action movie i can honestly say i'd rather gouge my eyes out with a cocktail stick than have to see this film again the acting was so awful that it was almost funny the story was insanely weak with plot holes so cavernously wide you could fly an f117 through them the script was so poor if i found out that a 10 year old wrote it i shouldn't be in the least surprised the direction and production is so amateur i wouldn't even hire these people to shoot my worst enemies wedding video utter utter drivel those responsible for making this movie have cheapened the art and they should be ashamed of themselves steven segal should never ever show his face in public again i can't imagine what made him agree to star in this the worst film i have seen in my entire life
<START> seriously what were they thinking over the course of years the columbo series has tried out some new things and diverted away from the usual successful formula but this movie really overdoes it this movie is basically very different from any other columbo movie but the differences are not for the good of the movie br br main thing that of course makes this movie different from any other columbo movie is the fact that there is no murder being committed the entire premise of this movie is totally different and it places the columbo character in a totally different environment and situation also the overall is just totally different and more 'modernized' br br director alan j levi did some other columbo movies in the past which all very much sticked to the usual formula it also makes it an odd choice that he got picked to direct this movie br br the columbo character himself also feels quite different perhaps because of the reason that he gets placed in a totally different environment and situation when he helps out his nephew after his bride disappeared right after the wedding the absence of some good relieving and trademark columbo humor also doesn't exactly make this a good or enjoyable watch br br in all honesty the movie doesn't begin too bad but the movie starts to become more and more ridicules with its story as it progresses it's such a stupid written kidnap thriller with a story that starts to become more and more unlikely it also makes the movie more and more unwatchable this is a very little interesting columbo entry that also really doesn't know to entertain its viewers in any way br br it also doesn't help much that the supporting actors aren't the most talented ones around despite the fact that his character is put in such a totally different situation and the movie is shot in such a completely different style peter falk still holds up well and his presence still somewhat saves this movie can you just imaging how this movie would had been without him it would had been an extremely bad and ridicules cheap movie i can tell you br br an odd columbo entry which could be described as a failed experiment to divert from the usual formula br br 4 10
<START> i have never posted a review before but i had to do it for this film this film is so bad i found myself trying to justify how bad it is by trying to think of it as kitsch or parody but it isn't it is truly un self consciously bad this is a serious attempt that flops gloriously other reviewers have pointed out the film's many flaws so i'll try not to repeat these but i do urge you to see this film throughout it i was either speechless literally gasping with disbelief or rolling on the floor in hysterics i haven't had so much fun watching a film in years in fact i'm going to try to get all my friends to see it because it's the kind of movie that needs to be shared br br my favorite parts when arthur auditions to be a go go boy his dancing is unbelievable the gratuitous nudity the director leading actor just had to get a nude shot in the preacher's office with its cardboard and crayon rendition of christ of course the famous wedding scene with the palm trees and the forgotten rings what narrative function does this play the ex wife's wrestling match with ben to get possession of her gun the detailed sequence wherein arthur kills the preacher he apparently burns him up with this incredibly measly match yes the gay religious fanatic brother with his bleached hair and weho fashions and my favorite the use of joplin's the entertainer as the opening soundtrack and pachebel's canon in d major as the closing soundtrack the list goes on and on a must see
<START> i first saw this movie years ago and have continued to view it several times a year when i have an opportunity it is on my list of favorite movies along with some of the classics should anyone tell you it is foolish or outdated ignore them this movie is for anyone who enjoys laughing and music the dancing isn't as important in this film as in other astaire movies so the comedy and acting shine through see this movie if you can it may be light but it is still completely amusing so i know that many people hate black and white films they think old movies can't really be funny this movie should make them change their minds no one i know can watch this movie without being at least mildly amused the only problem with the film fred astaire singing without dancing he may be a great performer and capable singer but it just isn't fascinating and leaves a big hole in the middle of the story the comedy gets a bit clichÃ© at times but the vaudevillesque performances of g burns and g allen are just perfect for the piece and can satisfy anyone looking for some easy laughs give this film a chance even if you don't like old movies this movie can appeal to the ridiculous in any one
<START> br br what an absolutely crappy film this is how or why this movie was made and what the hell billy bob thornton and charlize theron were doing signing up for this mediocre waste of time is beyond me strong advise for anyone sitting down to catch a flick do not waste your time on this 'film'
<START> i refused to watch this when it originally aired treasuring the memory of the late lamented 1960s series with mike pratt and kenneth cope but i can never resist a challenge i should have known better not quite a remake and more of a parody than a homage this show didn't quite know how to play it and plumped with infantile comedy and cartoon plots and characters the three main characters were little more than caricatures of the actors and only emilia fox could act bob mortimer is painful in a straight role the supporting cast were merely comedian acquaintances of vic and bob's wanting to be part of the in joke and far too aware of the situation to be convincing and the cgi though the effects couldn't help be an improvement on those available 30 years earlier merely dazzled the viewer with lights and camera work and did little to mask the poor quality of the scripts and dialogue all style and no substance and whereas the 1960s show is mocked for being very much of its time this 'update' is now also very dated with 'matrix' style fashions obligatory 'girl power' scenes and less than subtle tension between the two living leads
<START> while not exactly offensive the 1967 version of the perils of pauline is certainly moronic the title might lead you to expect a tribute to pearl white the original pauline in the 1914 silent 20 episode serial but for that you would be better served by the 1947 version starring betty hutton this 1967 version is like a mix of casino royale and the weakest of the elvis movies worst of all it is not a blend of these but more like someone scotch taped together segments from each so that the thing skips back and forth between the two styles br br what unity there is in the production comes from the pairing of pamela austin pauline and pat boone george steadman a good match because both lack even the most basic of acting skills imagine mandy moore playing opposite dan quayle br br austin would later play opposite john aston in evil roy slade with the talent disparity between them actually painful to watch in the mid 60's she was the dodge rebellion girl as such she was featured in a similar series of perilous situations imagine sandra dee in a dark blue jumpsuit when the automaker's ad agency replaced her with the dodge fever girl someone got the bright idea to showcase her in a feature film br br what story there is here begins with pauline growing up in the baskerville foundling home run by the actress who played mrs chatsworth osborne sr on dobie gillis george falls in love with her pauline not mrs osborne and sabotages several opportunities she has to be adopted george leaves to seek his fortune and 19 year old pauline gets a job tutoring a young oil rich middle eastern prince when he tries to add the attractive blonde to his harem she runs away and goes from peril to peril these include african pygmies a 99Â½ year old millionaire who wants to freeze her until his one year old grandson is old enough for marriage the movie industry and the russian space program br br all this is intended to be silly and charming but manages only the silly part there is some effort to incorporate a silent film look to the action sequences by simulating the under cranking of a camera which speeds up the action unfortunately everything else film stock production design editing is depressingly 1960's nothing here even approaches the images of pearl white strapped to a log moving toward a buzz saw or tied to railway track waiting for the approaching train br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
