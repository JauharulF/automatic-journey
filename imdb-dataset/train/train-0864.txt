<START> standard rise to fame tale that has a few high points number one lonette mckee as sister who gives a stunning star making performance the fact that she never became a huge sensation after this is beyond me sadly she is a supporting character and we are forced to focus on irena carter's bland character sparkle whose rise to fame is easy boring and unconvincing however whenever the girls go on stage and perform the movie comes back to life the original music by curis mayfield must be praised the copy i saw was a very old vhs tape the picture quality was pretty low as well as the production values i'm guessing all in all its worth a gander
<START> for those looking for a sequel for the fine south african miniseries of the 1980s this isn't it nor is it a historical drama rather it is a dreary little fantasy which has nothing to do with the historical shaka but merely uses his name to give a certain cachet to sinclair's idiotic story about an african superhero who is a combination of jesus lincoln superman and nelson mandela br br on the other hand there are a few laugh out loud moments as when shaka breaks the cross to which he is chained and kicks some serious slaver butt you know like jesus would have done if he hadn't been such a wimp br br true i saw only the 98 minute version but i can't imagine that twice as much of this crap would have been better br br and what kind of a name is mungo
<START> this is definatley one of the best stand up shows evre ever eddie is so off the wall that i've been watching this damn show for nearly five years now and it still rocks every single time just everything from his big broad physical comedy down to the little off the top of the head side remarks it's a masterpeice you need look no further than this line the word herb you say erb and we say herb cuz ther's a f ing h in it brilliant
<START> the film was made in 1942 and with world war 11 around the movie industry decided to capitalize on the fact that spies were around br br the film is fun to watch due to the fabulous dancing of eleanor powell the late miss powell was certainly a great hoofer in every sense of the word she is again paired with a very young looking red skelton here the two of them also starred in i dood it br br moroni olsen who 3 years later was superb as the interrogating police officer in mildred pierce again appears as an officer asking powell to deliver an item trouble is that olsen and his rogues are really the japanese spies br br bert lahr is his usual brilliant self here and he gets ample support from virginia o'brien
<START> from everything i'd read about the movie i was excited to support a film with a christian theme everything about the movie was very unprofessionally done especially the writing without good writing a movie doesn't have a chance the writer director said in an interview that he didn't want to give away how the title relates to the story believe me it was no big surprise i kept waiting for the teenage young adult back story to unfold but it never did as someone who has gone through a divorce i was very disappointed this movie would have been no comfort to me when i first went through the emotional turmoil that divorce can bring to your life as a christian
<START> i was just a bit young for this one but i had to see it there's some excellent music which many folks have mentioned but no one seems to notice a very rare appearance by angel a now mostly ignored but once quite popular musical outfit wearing their trademark white outfits they grind through 20th century foxes and apparently all try to cram into the camera's field of vision keyboardist gregg giuffria remains the bands highlight and has apparently never gotten much of a haircut ever cherie currie ex runaways singer begins a brief but notable acting career here and is quite memorable alongside jodie foster and the rest her topless 3 d scenes in parasite and her ufo sighting in wavelength kept us all watching her for a time br br it's not a masterpiece but it preserves a chunk of its period for all to gaze upon and wonder
<START> gadar is an example of one of bollywood worst overrated movies ever directed by anil sharma who prefers making period related movie gives a rubbish movie the songs were boring and ain't the kind of song you want to listen to in your car full volume sunny deol is famous for making daft movies where he beats up a 100 bad guys on his own he even kicks a metal jail door indian and kicks a moving car far away teesri aankh i can give another 50 examples of disgraceful action by sunny deol but i'm sure most people know this already sunny gives a pathetic performance once again repeating the same type of role a guy claiming to be fighting for his countries piece by using violence amisha patel is hands down dead sexy with an amazing body that i would love to bone but even she couldn't save the film from being a disaster instead of wearing sexy clothes like she usually does in this movie she doesn't maybe cos she was playing a muslim but she doesn't act like one in the movie overall this is a poor show all the way i'm sure it will appeal to some people who love seeing the bollywood actor beat up 100 guys give me a break
<START> to make it short and not to spoil everything this film is about kip giovanni ribsi a car thief who messes up a big delivery of stolen cars 50 in total he is then threatened to be killed by the man who gave him the Âorder' the objective now is to get 50 cars stolen in 3 days with the help of randall nicolas cage a Âretired' booster and also kip's brother and a couple of old friends of randall's as you can see this is the same old big bro' needs to get lil' bro' out of trouble routine and of course randall is the best thief there ever was of course as in all other movies there are also a few setbacks and surprises you never would have thought of but at times it is predictable too so there is nothing fancy about the story br br you are by now probably wondering why this is about 51 times the hot stuff since there are only 50 beautiful fast cool and expensive cars to be stolen well the other hot item in this film is sway angelina jolie who will be a big star trust me she is not only very convincing in the role as a car theft but she is pretty hot too ok not hot as in pretty but hot as in damn cool and sexy she was very believable in this role probably because she is some kind of a wild woman in real life too don't believe me read her biography and for the sexy part well just see for yourself man i only know that she plays the kind of girl i like in this film because she is not too mainstream a bit alternative look and she even comes with a tattoo br br ok the only downsides i felt while watching this movie was that there is not very much action there is one totally unrealistic scene the story is only ok and that there are not much jokes hey but after seeing the whole film i must say who cares why must i say that well because it was still entertaining had a couple of cool car chases good music some bruckheimer scenes where the combination of music and the lines of actors make your eyes go wet good actors who all did their jobs pretty cars one cool wild sexy lady yes i mean mrs jolie and last but not least very nice and cool tools to boost the cars with so some downsides here but still a pretty good and entertaining movie all in all the best way to describe this film is that it is an overall ok movie with a cool Â feelgood ending br br as for nicolas cage wellÂ he is actually one of my most favourite actors in the action genre nowadays after such good films as the rock con air face off snake eyes and finally this one plus what actor has had so many good action thriller's in the last years and such successful ones well no one maybe jackie chan but he is one of my favourites too one thing that is true though about mr cages bruckheimer films is that they keep getting worse the rock was a clear 9 con air was a nice 8 and this well this clearly is a 7 not that that mark is bad does it not show that his films under bruckheimer keep getting worse and that maybe cage has to think longer before he accepts a role in a movie and probably he should make a few less movies no it doesn't show us that because almost all of cage's films were successful in the last few years except for 8mm and bringing out the dead 8mm was not great i admit that but that was never cage's fault and the story seemed good to me about the latter film i can not say anything Âcause i have not seen it yet one thing though i know for sure if bruckheimer would have asked me for those three films i would have said yes to all of them i would have said yes to the rock because the story was great and because you would get to play with sean connery and ed harris i would have said yes to con air because there would be a lot of action in it because the story was good and because you got to act with john malkovich and ving rhames in this one i would have starred because i would have gotten a big paycheque i would have been able to ride some cool and fast cars and because i would have been able to kiss angelina jolie can't wait to see her in that lara croft outfit this one was a good choice of mr cage and it certainly was worth a look at in the theatre br br 7 out of 10
<START> the danes character finally let's buddy have the awful truth leave me alone kiss men if you want to she screams self righteously in front of everyone thus destroying the man who has been in love with her for so long nice girl this might be the place to reconsider all of the giggly charm that danes pours into this character great reason to feel sympathy for her lying in bed and dying but hey remember there are no mistakes except maybe seeing this film br br wait a minute this irony is intended this is actually a masterpiece of ironic wit yes but somehow i doubt that's what the creators of this film had in mind sadly maybe there are a few mistakes after all
<START> an ok movie about downs syndrome a mother has twins one is very sick the other is good but he has downs the mother does not think she can raise him so she gives him to some people who have 15 kids 11 have downs the mom does not like this she thinks he should be with his family i agree too so they take it to court the family gets broken up the grandparents lose it never really says if the mom daughter makeup i think this movie's good but the plot is familiar it's still good has a few unintentional laughs
<START> how has this piece of crap stayed on tv this long it's terrible it makes me want to shoot someone it's so fake that it is actually worse than a 1940s sci fi movie i'd rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense i remember watching it when it first came out i thought hey this could be interesting then i found out how absolutely insanely ridiculously stupid it really was it was so bad that i actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the table br br please people stop watching this and all other reality shows they're the trash that is jamming the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create
<START> br br human body wow br br there are about 27 000 sunrises in human life br br hardly one thousand sunrises will be watched by 90 of humans on this planet br br our days are limited br br excellent movie for all women makers of human body br br thanks and regards br br
<START> the dirty harry series began with very gritty cop action and was almost immediately lightened up for magnum force by the time that the enforcer rolled around dirty harry was little more than a television cop show saved only by tyne daly after a break of seven years dirty harry has finally gone back to his roots maybe he's been gone for too long this time br br clint eastwood makes the first well directed harry film since don siegel made the first which helps considerably harry is a darker character once again not the nice cop he had become he can once again say things like go ahead make my day and really mean it sudden impact is a true dirty harry sequel the enforcer should never have been made br br 7 2 out of 10
<START> the premise is a bit better than the execution but that doesn't mean the film is worth a look splendid supporting cast makes this a fun mystery to unravel raines is great as the resourceful woman determined to solve this puzzlement i always enjoy thomas gomez
<START> this is one of the best animated movies i've ever seen in my life this isn't just a fun movie or a well made movie this is a landmark in the art of animation and even if it weren't just the technical skill that went into making it would grant it a place in the history of animation br br wladyslaw starewicz created a stop motion movie about the secret life of beetles he imagined a coherent world of insects with jobs houses nightclubs movie houses even little props like posters and bicycles and paintings br br in this movie he tells a simple tale of hypocrisy and revenge mr beetle has an affair with a dancing dragonfly much to the chagrin of a grasshopper but he's a cameraman and decides to shoot the fling mr beetle returns home and finds mrs beetle having her own affair mr beetle chases the lover away but forgives his wife the two make up and go out to the movies and the movie they watch is mr beetle and the dragonfly described thus it sounds banal but once seen it becomes a gripping work of cinema along with emile cohl and jiri trnka wladyslaw starewicz pretty much invented everything that future animators would use in their work for that reason he must not remain forgotten
<START> this movie has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made i've seen this movie for the first time a week ago since then every day i see the opening and every time i feel as thrilled as i felt the first time i heard david niven uttering the immortal words from sir walter raleigh's the pilgrimage br br give me my scallop shell of quiet my staff of faith to walk upon my scrip of joy immortal diet my bottle of salvation my gown of glory hope's true gage and thus i'll take my pilgrimage Â br br do you know why it would be a truism to say michael powell's and emeric pressuburger's lives are thoroughly justified for having crafted such a wonderful opening because they had been already admitted in the paradise of poets long before they made this movie br br i imagine both of them facing trial during doomsday and saying nonchalantly to an irate god i beg your pardon sir so do you want to know what have we done during our lifetime well well you'll see we've written directed and produced i know where i'm going colonel blimp red shoesÂ do you think that enough sir it is rather obvious that these two great artists had already fulfilled their duty with god nature the muse or whatever you may call it when they shot a matter of life and death the fact that other people's lives would be justified for their deeds could be not apparent to everybody notwithstanding i feel my life would have a meaning had i never done anything else that to see this movie br br of course old timers will be tempted to say they don't do movies like this one any more they'll be partially mistaken they didn't make movies like this in the past times either br br i've have already quoted keats here but i'll repeat his words a thing of beauty is a joy forever
<START> like my sassy girl this movie is based on a true story posted from the internet but that's where the similarities end the story is generally about this rebellious guy named ji hoon kwon sang woo who is still trying to finish high school whose parents hire a tutor named su wan kim ha neul a woman who comes from a poor background but happens to be the same age as him add to that some obstacles martial arts thugs are always after ji hoon for revenge a scorned thuggish love sick girl who is after him his proclivity for ditching the lessons and you generally can guess the whole story did i mention it's a romantic comedy this movie has some good fight scenes great visual humor and a lot of spunk thanks to the good chemistry between kim ha nuel and kwon sang woo that bring a lot of energy to the story the romantic elements also work because of that reason and i must say i'd want a girlfriend more like kim ha nuel than that girl from my sassy girl personality wise at least she has some spunk but it's more on the cute sweet good hearted way characters are already mostly likable so one might say it had less of a hill to climb than my sassy girl an obstacle that worked for that movie to its credit and the movie is quite clever and interesting most of the way the story kind of sags though about 2 3 of the way where it sort of treads on familiar standard fare where nothing really interesting happens but near the end it picks up a bit again overall a fun cute movie 8 10
<START> the photography of this bid budget production is surprisingly bad colors are muddy and brownish and the photography has very 80ish look to it direction and editing are often quite uninspired and tv movie like too and at first the movie only seems to want to torture its viewers with lurid images of sex and violence hans zimmer's score is also a typically simple and bland work of this overrated untalented composer br br but if you are willing to watch the movie further you are rewarded with a very moving family story a sort of european version of edna ferber's family epos giant while at first you wonder why clara married this idiotic man even his character gets more depth and more background one can judge him by clara delivers the movie's spiritual lesson a great and moving statement set against the terrible happenings in her country her daughter whose lover is a young antonio banderas at the beginning of his international career understands that lesson and ultimately tries to live by it the way the plot was constructed with the ending mirroring the beginning was great the actors all do a great job too i was wondering who is the actress playing blanca all the time but of course it was a really young winona ryder br br all in all this movie really made me want to read the book
<START> this show is awesome i have been a fan since it premiered and it only keeps me watching i've seen some terrible things here that i wish i hadn't but it really shows you how addiction affects all involved not just the addict you can see all kinds of different addictions from drugs and alcohol to the shopping addict or the eating disorder addict and actually it's really sad to see some of the famous faces that have come through also we've seen accomplished musicians an nba player and even young people who really need the help and since they have started showing a few follow ups that's been awesome too now you can see how they are a long while after their ep aired if you haven't checked this one out please do it's on a e and it's awesome the new eps are sunday nights at 10pm est if i remember correctly so set your tivo
<START> richard willaims is an animation god he was hampered in directing this film by the producer the final product is a very uneven film with a very convoluted story but some amazing moments of animation like emery hawkins' greedy joe raposo's repetitive music doesn't help either it was made in wide screen so the vhs doesn't show it in all it's glory let's hope for a letterboxed dvd someday still it's worth watching for some eye popping animation
