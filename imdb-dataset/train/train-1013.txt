<START> i loved this film at first the slick graphics seemed odd with the grainy footage but i quickly got into it there must have been thousands of hours of footage shot and i really admire the work done in cutting it down if you're easily shocked by drugs or violence it might not be the film for you but there are some great characters here and some real tossers technically i liked it a lot too they must have used a new de interlacing algorithm or maybe it was just that the footage looked so dark anyway but i wasn't annoyed by the usual artifacts seen in video to film transfers open water drove me nuts mostly because there are cheap progressive cameras available now and i see no excuse in not shelling for one if you intend to screen in the cinema sorry that's my own little rant i definitely recommend this film if you've ever been involved with the music scene it has some tragic moments but most of it is hilarious i might be accused of laughing at others misfortune but it's a classic piece
<START> where to start this movie started badly and ended badly it consists of extremely poor acting and unrealistic effects that had me cringing in my seat seriously my cat could have acted better than this lot br br some of it was actually laughable because it was so unbelievable i would of rated this lower but they haven't got anything else so heed my warning and unless your so bored your close to suicide and would like a good reason to continue with your suicide mission don't bother with this one i'm still in shock that this could actually be released to the public this should be a crime and all involved should be arrested i gather you've got the gist by now so i'll leave it up to you to decide
<START> if they gave me the option of negative numbers i'd use it this movie was truly god awful i went into the theaters expecting it to be horrible and it somehow managed to exceed my expectations br br the script was weak the acting was painful i wanted to walk out but my friend was driving and wanted to get her moneys worth i think we were both disappointed br br the growing of the breasts when the girls got their super power and changing of the hair color was just wrong eddie izzard just seemed wrong for the part of super villain he came off as oddly weak and silly jenny johnsons uma thurman came off as psychotic and strange as did matt's luke wilson friend vaughn rainn wilson
<START> this is without doubt rajnikanth's worst movies ever the first part is held in place with solid comedy from goundamani but it progressively gets worse and worse and completely illogical our hero also takes a dig at saints with the same name baba through a corny and utterly lame one liner the first half has rajni uttering his usual array of oneliners and style and in the second half becomes a quasi saint after a beggar takes him through a interdimensional portal to the himalayas where babaji not the famous saints he took a dig at earlier gives him special powers for no apparent reason other than karma this is really starting to get interesting now isn't it br br the rest of the movie is about him wasting his magic boons and powers and fighting off politicians and related black magic the usual predictable crap with hilarious implementation oh and the black magic never worked on our hero because he just happened to have a param vir er shakti chakra with him the bad guys and the usual politician villains are clichÃ©d overworked and in the end completely insignificant to the plot which itself doesn't go anywhere br br but despite all the flaws it was fun to kill time with and yell baba related one liners during public events its also fun to watch others curse about this movie ar rehman is said to have composed the tracks for his movie through the cell phone thats how important he considered it br br rajni is very popular in japan and he has included two characters one of them is called keiko why not samsung of japanese origin in this movie just for the sake of it but the way they are portrayed dressed and treated is absolutely pathetic the japanese may stop watching rajni movies after seeing that this movie was probably promotional material for rajni entering politics but the results of the movie itself would have killed off any of his political dreams br br fun if you turn your brain off though
<START> this movie is weak the box cover says east la's toughest gang and it is really santa ana's james cahill acts like a closet queen taking down all the tough guys in the tough chlo gang it is fake boring senseless and whack i tried to get my money back from the video store this movie was so bad it was also on the homo erotic tip far from what the video box proclaims james cahill should act in gay porno james is in every scene he cannot act to save his life the film features eva longoria who is hot but james can't even score with her i felt at times i was watching gay porn and was turned off by the whole film james clearly want's to be with men but rather then submit to his gay desires he beats up gang members over and over and over again his martial arts skills are minimal at best some real gang members would take him and his weak skills and rip him a new one
<START> i really wanted to like this movie and watched all the way through thinking it had to get better don't get me wrong it's not the worst flick ever but it never lives up to it's potential the premise is good the cast is great i was especially pumped to witness the return of david naughton and god love 'em you can tell everyone tried their best it just falls short over and over again brutal massacre should serve as a constant reminder to filmmakers that only christopher guest can do christopher guest movies and despite the fact he makes it look easy you should probably just forget trying to do the same naughton and brian o'halloran are fantastic in this and they should be seen more often they are the reason this gets 4 stars from me if you're going to have the spinal tap of horror i suspect you might want the guy who made spinal tap to helm it just thinking out loud there
<START> this is the kind of movie hollywood needs to make more of no extravagant props no car chases no clever one liners just people dealing with being people br br william macy plays an unlikely hitman who works for his father donald sutherland macy is the dutiful son sutherland is the domineering father son wants out of the business father won't let him macy loves his own son played beautifully by david dorfman the ring he also starts to fall in love with neve campbell a girl he meets in the waiting room of his psychiatrist's office br br it's an interesting juxtaposition of characters and the film follows the reluctant killer as he balances his own needs with those of his family there are many touching scenes especially between macy and his little boy and as you'd expect in a film with william macy in it there's a bit of humor too br br excellent job all around actors and director nice to know they can still make a good film in hollywood on a small budget
<START> this movie is not about entertainment or not even a movie you want to see to pass the time this movie is a genuinely a display of true love that can only come from god one cannot help but be touched deeply by looking at this movie we have several dimensions of love that contributes to the value of this movie there is the divine love of god that is beautifully portrayed god's love transcends the heart and mind and endures and is eternal there is the love in a marriage while the main character grapples with his wife's disease he realizes through god's love that he loves his wife more than he could ever imagine he knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated finally you have the love of child and parent the kids in the family come together and realize that nothing else matters except that love conquers fear dear friends love is not love unless it comes from god because god is love and love comes from god talk to someone and let them know you love them love does no good unless it is given to another i pray this movie can inspire and change the lives of everyone who sees it amen
<START> every great gangster movie has under currents of human drama don't expect an emotional story of guilt retribution and despair from scarface this is a tale of ferocious greed corruption and power the darker side of the fabled american dream br br anybody complaining about the cheesiness of this film is missing the point the superficial characters cheesy music and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess nothing in the lives of these characters really matter not on any human level at least in fact the film practically borderlines satire ironic considering all the gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of tony montana br br this isn't brian depalma's strongest directorial effort it is occasionally excellent and well handled particularly the memorable finale but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled thankfully it is supported by a very strong script by oliver stone probably good therapy for him considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time the themes are consistent with the focus primarily on the life of tony montana and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power the dialogue is also excellent see sawing comfortably between humour and drama there are many stand out lines which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or another br br the cast help make it what it is as well but this is really pacino's film one of his earlier less subtle performances something much more common from him nowadays this is a world entirely separate from michael corleone and frank serpico yet he is as watchable here as ever in very entertaining and intentionally over the top form it is hard to imagine another tony montana after seeing this film in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing but i've come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife not an exceptional effort but unfairly misjudged the supporting players are very good too particularly paul shenar as the suave alejandro sosa br br powerful occasionally humorous sometimes shocking and continually controversial scarface is one of the films of the eighties whatever that might mean to you an essential and accessible gangster flick and a pop culture landmark 9 10
<START> i am not going to spoil the contents to anyone who has not yet watched this humble masterpiece by kay pollak br br a world famous conductor brilliantly played by michael nyqvist seeks peace from stress by moving back to his childhood village the villagers who has followed the genius in silence are slowly tempting him to share of his greatness br br each role in this movie has a very specific purpose and shows a remarkable potential in each of the actors playing their own chord in short but precise words a symphony of love br br not love in the sense of relationship but in the tone of the spirit deeply buried within each of the characters each revealing their own present story their needs their skeletons desires and much more br br i shall not forget to mention the two main parts played by frida hallgren and michael nyqvist whose dramas are played in unforgettable harmonies of emotional feedback they touch each other with a pain connected in their own disability to love themselves br br michael nyqvist is really put to the test here in a very difficult setup in one of those movies that either end up as catastrophic or fantastic and fantastic it became from start to end not one second less or more than enough you are left with a feeling of change and a taste for more br br to this day definitely one of the best movies i have had the pleasure of watching
<START> i loved this movie since i was 7 and i saw it on the opening day it was so touching and beautiful i strongly recommend seeing for all it's a movie to watch with your family by far br br my mpaa rating pg 13 for thematic elements prolonged scenes of disastor nudity sexuality and some language
<START> evil aliens owes a huge debt to peter jacksons early films bad taste and braindead i must confess to never enjoying those films particularly and i say the same about this jake west is a director who clearly lacks inspiration of his own and chooses to steal from those whom he looks up to i lost count of the amount of times a major hollywood film was quoted most notably james camerons aliens the amount of blood and gore on show here isn't funny either the latter end of the film becomes tired and dragged out maybe it would have worked better as a short film the actors a poor the direction is weak and the plot is non existent i can see what the director was trying to do the homage he was trying to pay but others have done the same thing a lot better than presented here 4 10
<START> this was an adorable movie a real feel good movie when you need one the story is light this is no gone with the wind but sometimes one needs this kind of plot funny and warm characters fantastic acting and beautiful costumes wardrobe br br parminder k nagra also from the tv show er is wonderful in this role she is definitely a new shining star for hollywood all should keep an eye on her she's going to be big in the future br br also impressing was the soundtrack for this movie a nice mix of modern and indian tunes i was dancing throughout most of the movie br br highly recommended if a fun movie is what you need
<START> my wife and i are semi amused by howie mandel's show i also like shatner even when he's at his most pathetic br br but this is absolutely the worst show on television br br please cancel this show it sucks a br br the only positive thing i can say is that the girls are hotter on this show and seem to wear less clothing than deal or no deal br br the questions are a mixture of way too easy and incredibly obscure and watching shatner or the contestant say show me the money makes me want to vomit br br this one will not last
<START> reese witherspoon first outing on the big screen was a memorable one she appears like a fresh scrubbed face tween slight and stringy but undeniably reese br br i have always liked her as an actor and had no idea she started this young with her career go figure i actually gained some respect for reese to know who she was so early on i say that because whenever i have watched her perform the characters thus far in each portrayal she also seemed to have her own persona that lived with that character quite nicely in fact br br anyway my first film experience with reese was the little red riding hood parody reese did with kiefer sutherland somehow i assumed that was her first time up at bat not so well done reese
<START> this was the first ewan mcgregor movie i ever saw outside of star wars since then i have become a very big ewan mcgregor fan but i still can't bring myself to forgive this movie's existence br br my sister has always been a huge jane austen fan and because of that i have been subjected to various of the classics emma being one of them i've always considered them irritating stupid and boring however after watching this terrible rendition i was forced to admit that the original emma was delightful and charming ewan mcgregor scarcely serves a purpose in this film after they hacked and mutilated the part of frank churchill gweneth paltrow is ridiculous in an already ridiculous character and the rest of the film is unremarkable and stupid br br my recommendation to anybody who is remotely interested in english period drama go see the originals if you're a ewan mcgregor fan believe me by skipping this film you haven't missed anything but five minutes collective of him in a silly hat and a bad haircut
<START> and a 30 000 budget and this movie still looks like it was made for 50 you can tell from the first frame to the last that he didn't care one bit about the movies continuity or plot he was just happy to be making a zombie movie br br what the end result shows is a lazy film maker who loves zombie movies it could have been great if he just had of given a care the end result is endless zoom ins on poorly done gore and even more poorly produced metal plays over it br br what happens when you combine high hopes big dreams a decent budget hard work and one idiot behind the camera
<START> rebar is an astronaut who goes on the world's first space mission to saturn but of course this being a horror movie things turn ugly and he returns to earth as the only survivor stricken with some bizarre condition that causes him to slowly melt and lose his mind unless he regularly consumes human flesh he kills what apparently is the only nurse in the hospital and escapes to the neighboring town to stalk more victims br br i liked the premise and the monster and gore effects are actually pretty good but the space scenes are just pasted together out of stock nasa footage and the hospital looks curiously like a warehouse a very weak script little character development and overall poor acting keep this one from rising above being anything other than a mediocre slasher flick with the novelty of having a living candle as the killer and more or less only has its gore effects to hold your interest br br 4 out of 10 strictly for the most die hard monster movie fans
<START> elizabeth taylor never could act at all and she was just her usual annoying untalented self in this film this was before she got so fat but she still looked very short and dumpy rock hudson was ok as bick benedict but clearly an actor with more range like william holden would have been better james dean certainly proved he knew how to mumble his way through a movie the whole film is incredibly slow and goes on for far too long the actors were all too young and lightweight and none of them aged convincingly due to the poor make up hudson looked ridiculous just being padded out and dean and carroll baker were obviously the same age br br 0 10
<START> just like last years event wwe new years revolution 2006 was headlined by an elimination chamber match the difference between last years and this years match however was the entertainment value in reality only three people stood a chance of walking out of the pepsi arena in albany new york with the wwe championship those men were current champion john cena kurt angle and shawn michaels there was no way vinnie mac would put the belt on any of the rookies carlito or chris masters and kane kane last held the wwe championship in june 1998 and that was only for one night it was obvious he wasn't going to be the one either last years match was a thrilling affair with six of the best wwe had to offer 2006 was a predictable and disappointing affair but still the match of the night by far br br the only surprise of the evening came after the bell had run on the main event out strolled vince mcmahon himself and demanded they lift the chamber it was then announced that edge was cashing in his money in the bank championship match right then and there with no time to prepare and just off the back of winning the elimination chamber match john cena did not stand a chance and dropped the title after a spear to one of the most entertaining heels in wwe this was the only entertaining piece of action that happened all night br br the undercard like last year was truly atrocious triple h and the big show put on a snore fest that had me struggling to stay away hhh picked up the win but that was never in any real doubt was it any pay per view that has both jerry lawler and viscera wrestling on the same card will never have any chance of becoming a success really does it the king pinned helms who books this stuff and big vis tasted defeat against the wasted shelton benjamin with a little help from his mama br br the women of the wwe also had a busy night there was the usual diva nonsense with a bra and panties gauntlet match which was won by ashley and the woman's championship was also on the line in a match i thought would have been left to brew till wrestlemania 22 mickie james challenged trish stratus in a good match trish won the contest but it was evident that this is going to continue for the foreseeable future br br the opening contest of the night pitted soon to be wwe champion edge against intercontinental champion ric flair this could have been better but it was a battered and bloody flair that retained after a disqualification finish edge obviously had bigger fish to fry br br so new years revolution kicked off the 2006 pay per view calendar in disastrous fashion the only good thing from that is knowing that for the wwe the only way is up they don't get much worse than this
