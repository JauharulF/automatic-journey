<START> the woman in black is fantastic in all aspects it's scary suspenseful and so realistic that you can actually see it happening in real life i first saw this on the tv back in 1989 and with all the lights off and the volume turned up it was probably the most creepy experience of my entire life i managed to get hold of a copy and now i make sure to bring it out every halloween and show it too unsuspecting family members who have no idea what they're in for and all i can do is laugh with glee as for the film br br it starts out with a young lawyer named arthur kipps who is assigned by his firm to go to the market town of crythin gifford to settle the papers of a recently deceased client mrs alice drablow br br this film starts off as a reasonably solid and interesting ghost story but then arthur attends the funeral and from that scene on we do not feel safe we are constantly on edge and biting our nails and that goes on for the next hour or so until the final thrilling finale br br a warning to all new viewers though do not watch this alone
<START> relentlessly stupid no budget war picture made mainly to show off the attributes of the spectacular eve meyer not a bad idea in itself but that should be an embarrassment to everyone connected with it laughable script performances that wouldn't pass muster in an elementary school christmas pageant inept action scenes confused direction by the normally competent documentary director louis clyde stoumen who is apparently not quite sure if he's making a comedy a philosophical treatise on the futility of war or a leering t a by early 1960s standards anyway travelogue of eve meyer's magnificent body and a general air of shoddiness and incompetence worth seeing in order to watch eve meyer strut her stuff but that's pretty much it
<START> one of the cornerstones of low budget cinema is taking a well known classic storyline and making a complete bastardization out of it phantom of the mall is no exception to this rule the screenwriter takes the enduring phantom of the opera storyline and moves it into a late '80s shopping mall however the phantom's goal now is simply to get revenge upon those responsible for disfiguring his face and murdering his family the special effects do provide a good chuckle especially when body parts begin appearing in dishes from the yogurt stand pauly shore has a small role which does not allow him to be as fully obnoxious as one would expect mostly due to the fact that his fifteen minutes of mtv fame had not yet arrived if you're looking for a few good laughs at the expense of the actors and special effects crew check this flick out otherwise keep on looking for something else
<START> i just watched the movie i was afraid it's gonna disappoint me i was rather surprised at the end though the american pie franchise is still in my favorite franchise movies of all times yes it won't be true if i say that i enjoyed it as mush as i enjoyed the original ones beta house along with the previous two pies definitely lost something that the first two pies had it is not gonna become a classic as the first two already did but what the hell it is still funny with a lot of good moments and i think it should be the first movie to pick if you wanna have fun and relax after a hard day at work or school beta house deserves 6 10 but i gave it 7 10 just for being another slice of pie
<START> it's not my fault my girlfriend made me watch it br br there is nothing positive to say about this film there has been for many years an idea that madonna could act but she can't there has been an idea for years that guy ritchie is a great director but he is only middling an embarrassment all round br br
<START> the movie's premise is spooky a woman gets pregnant when kissed by a stranger in a bar br br but as soon as the movie begins a horrible opening scene establishes that this is a c type sci fi tv movie it's a big star trek and a bit x files but more than anything else it's boring br br when the movie kicks into action everything is predictable and cliche it looked more like a 2 parter in a bad sci fi tv series no suspense and no thrills but not for a lack of trying just a lot of predictable dramatic conflicts between the main characters br br don't waste your time
<START> a typical 70s italian coming of age film original and good music but with some quirks interesting but not fantastic photography poor and at times confused storyline e g the role of the wolf dog and where does the boy come from with poor dialogue nice ambiance br br the reason it is still relatively well known and sought after is probably the nude scenes including typical 70s pseudo coitus involving an 11 and 13 year old girl with an older teenage boy eva ionesco and laura wendel it is interesting from a socio political point of view to see how these representations of very young adolescents was considered acceptable and normal in the whole of europe and us 30 years ago whereas now it is more than taboo br br the story revolves round bullying of one girl laura by the other two characters and her discovery of sex a quite accurate representation of an aspect teenage life the character of eva silvia does not evolve to the very end of the film and already appears very versed in the erotic arts there is no coming of age for her she is a very vain young girl who is already aware of her sexual charms but ultimately is just used and ends the film crying like the little girl she really still is the boy is an utterly despicable bully while laura comes across as a very naive and weak victim
<START> the title says it all br br i'm not a film critic nor will i act like the rest of the snobbish people commenting on this movie br br obviously this movie didn't have a multi million dollar budget but the plot was very well done the acting was awesome and the cinematography was great it looked like you all had a lot of fun making this movie i voted 9 out of 10 as the sound was strong on only one channel instead of both but i imagine this might have been an error in the recording of the dvd br br i'll definitely be checking out other movies produced by brain damage films br br dylan o'leary cast and crew i thank you
<START> this is good little shocker not perfect by any stretch of the imagination but tight competent and disturbing an excellent example of a simple idea developed into a compelling 90 minute script br br the set up requires no bells and whistles no lengthy exposition or wordy back story kate franka pontente a young german business woman living in london drifts off whilst waiting for the last tube train she awakens to find the place deserted but quickly comes to realise that she is far from alone someone or something is down there with her and it's intentions are wholly malicious br br in fact she encounters several other characters in her quest to survive including a lecherous work colleague a homeless couple and a caged sewage worker all of whom add pace and substance to the plot there is a slightly awkward gear change somewhere in the middle of the film when tension thriller mutates into gore fest but nothing so clumsy as to slow the hectic pace for those of you with weak dispositions this is likely to be a harrowing ride for those of you who relish a bit of well executed carnal mayhem this should press all the right buttons br br the climax of the film is perhaps less successful than the main body of the film but it is punctuated with a nice moment of unexpected social commentary which provides a satisfying conclusion br br some may find themselves feeling somewhat cheated of a clear explanation as to the exact nature and history of the threat encountered by kate and her confederates however for me this was not the case a horror film writer should not need feel compelled to dot every i and cross every t in the same way a writer of political thrillers might be expected to there are enough clues here to give you a very pretty clear idea of what brought this evil into existence making a detailed and conclusive solution superfluous the retention of a certain sense of mystery is to be welcomed and reminds us that in this film the ride was always going to be more important than the exact destination br br my understanding is that the budget for this film was to say the least minimal in which case our applause for this british horror should be all the louder for at no point does one have the impression of corners being cut or effects failing to deliver br br if this sounds like your kind of film then it probably is buy a ticket and climb aboard
<START> i'm not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies but heard this was good i was stunned easily the most romantic thing i've ever seen in my life stunning brilliant sweet funny and full of heart the chemistry is flawless as is the writing and directing br br ethan hawke and julie delphy are so natural and sweet together you really think they're a couple br br the movies grabs you right away and doesn't let go you can't look away nor can you stop listening to them even the little moments just melt your heart br br this has jumped into the ranks of one of my favourite ever a masterpiece
<START> i know that's not what you expect from a film with this sort of br br lineage it's a direct descendant of the best years of our lives br br and the men films dealing with men who are in the hospital br br dealing with tragic circumstances but this film is full of wonderful br br surprises and performances it features stellar performances from br br eric stoltz and helen hunt including a rather risque nude scene br br and wesley snipes and william forsythe as emanuel levy wrote br br in his book cinema of outsiders about the independent film br br movement the waterdance is coherant attentive to detail and br br unsentimental with a wicked down to earth humor it' s at once br br funny and sad and the entire cast is impressive i was br br extraordinarily moved by this film it's hard hitting yes but also has br br very tender moments and laugh out loud moments a rare gem
<START> ok so here's the basic plot it is 1933 peter sellers is dr fu manchu a 168 year old chinese man who has lived quite a long time the film opens with his birthday in which he celebrates by drinking a special elixir that even the film never mentions prolongs his life well on this occasion the elixir is clumsily dropped by an assistant kato if you remember the pink panther movies and he orders his minions to then go find 6 rare items to make the elixir this creates a global man hunt in which his henchmen end up robbing museums of diamonds and venturing into london to meet up with dr fu's nemisis a retired scotland yard detective nayland smith also played by sellers who tries to stop him in what is suppose to be a witty comedic adventure br br this was apparantly sellers last full length feature film that he made before he died the terrible tragedy is that he was in it sellers who is such a gifted comedian and has had memorable 'funny' roles in the panther movies and particualrly in the movie 'the party' is anything but that in this film this film was absolute torture to sit through and i couldn't even finish it he completly dies and i kept cringing while watching sellers performance after coming of the great work of 'being there' a year earlier how i mean how can he make this and how did this thing even get made like one person mentioned the first 10 15 minutes are ok but then it is all downhill br br avoid like the plague br br rating 1 out of 10
<START> stalker is right girl sees guy girl wants guy girl contrives mundane ways to keep bumping into him girl won't leave him alone girl pretends to be a patient girl can't stop talking about him girl pretends to love another guy or two he doesn't pay attention to her because she's annoying girl still won't leave him alone played right drake's character could have been charming but she's completely wholly unrelenting in her pursuit of cary grant's character her girlfriend in cahoots is dull and sadly drake's attempt at playing charmingly screwball comes off as disturbingly demented grant is himself as usual which is fine for cary but it's as close to a phoned in performance as i've ever seen from him the direction is lackluster and the dialog is just plain dim br br screwball comedy is very difficult to do successfully and when it fails like in this stubbed out butt of an attempt it just stinks worse still drake spends the entire film in need of a lot of valium and a restraining order she ruins any humor to be found in this drier than mummy dust relic
<START> the cat's meow contains a few scenes that boast intelligent dialogue and some fine performances a few of which surprised me eddie izzard is more effective than i expected as chaplin partly thanks to an excellent hair and makeup job by some talented designer joanna lumley is compelling as novelist elinor glyn and kirsten dunst is winning as marion davies though why movies never use her real life stutter is difficult to explain but these elements don't add up to a successful whole the screenwriter seems to have worked very hard on certain scenes the meetings between davies and chaplin are particularly well crafted but not so hard on the big picture several minor characters don't need to be there and don't behave consistently the basic plot is full of illogic e g why does thomas ince think it's a good idea to tell hearst something he really doesn't want to hear and the party scenes are repetitive and tiresome i'd like to think a trip on hearst's yacht was more fun than the movie indicates davies is characterized as a standard bubbly flapper type which isn't really accurate and the screenwriter's ideas about chaplin and love are implausible br br strangely bogdanovich who seemed so connected to the thirties in paper moon lacks a similar affinity for the twenties he insisted the excellent costume designer use only black and cream which gives the party guests a very artificial look and plays only the most stereotypical songs of the period e g yes we have no bananas when hearst insists everybody charleston charleston it looks as if the actors had a ten minute dance lesson just before the scene was shot br br the lives of silent film stars can make fascinating movies i'm sure but not this time
<START> every once in a while a group of friends with a minimal budget but bags of enthusiasm and talent will create a low budget masterpiece that takes the world of horror by storm raimi and co did it with the evil dead jackson and pals succeeded with bad taste and myrick and sanchez made a mint with the blair witch project br br director todd sheets and his chums however are destined to wallow forever in relative obscurity if zombie bloodbath is anything to go by a lesson in how not to make a cheapo horror this miserable effort about a plague of flesh eating zombiesÂnatch serves as a reminder that whilst many people these days have access to a video camera most shouldn't take that as their cue to try their hand at making a full length movie br br it's not that sheets hasn't got an eye for a nicely framed shot some of his camera angles and movements are actually pretty good but rather that a he has a lousy script b he has a lousy cast and c he doesn't realise that he has a lousy script and cast which means that the final film is amateurish in the extreme and unlikely to be watched in its entirety by anyone other than zombie film completists like me or members of the cast and crew like those who have given the film favourable comments br br zombie bloodbath is obviously aimed at undiscriminating gore hounds and sheets who currently has an incredible 34 titles under his belt as a director certainly goes out of his way to please with buckets of offal and blood thrown about at every opportunity but whilst these moments are undeniably yucky they aren't particularly convincing and soon get rather tedious br br so to summarise this is a really bad film with almost no redeeming features except for two br br firstly it features the single greatest mullet in the history of film as sported by jerry angell who plays larry as well as several zombies the magnificence of his barnet coupled with a fetching moustache is reason alone to watch this film br br secondly it has 'pathetic stealth zombies' flesh eating corpses that lie in wait for unfortunate victims to wander by before leaping from their hiding place to launch a feeble attack which requires almost no effort to escape from best known for lurking behind a door for hours waiting for someone to open it 'pathetic stealth zombies' also occasionally hide behind low walls or sit in churches posing as members of the congregation br br normally a film this bad would get 1 10 for me but in celebration of jerry angell's flowing locks i will generously raise my rating to 2 10
<START> holes is not your average disney stuff it's very very fun even for adults who usually cringe at the cutesy focus group designed family entertainment that uncle walt's studio passes off as live action perhaps the secret of this film's success is in its faithfulness to the original book which is a little bit darker than your average kid stuff the action begins when stanley yelnats is sent to a boys' prison camp where all the inmates are forced to dig holes under the desert sun as a form of rehibilitation but as the story progresses stanley's tale becomes interwoven with that of a legendary treasure and this adventure becomes ten times more fun than any disney movie about an all boy prison camp has any right to be jon voight is especially nasty and colorful and sigourney weaver is beautiful as always
<START> i remember first watching sabrina when it came to tv in the uk on itv1 when i was 13 14 i'm now 24 and still love it now as much as i did when i first watched it i get a little stick from some of my friends for still watching a kids show but i don't care lol caroline rhea as hilda is my personal favourite character and later on morgan also became another of my favourite characters i remember spending so much time watching various special events honouring sabrina on the tv station nickeleoden uk i love mellissa joan hart she was great in clarrissa explains all but so much better in this i was gutted when they decided to finish it i hope it will soon be released on dvd here in the uk i'll be first in line lol x
<START> i don't know if i'd consider it a masterpiece of not but it's damn near close it's extremely well made artistic suspenseful intricately plotted thematically challenging and full of bleak foreshadowing and sexual religious imagery there's also some great camera work from jan de bont an atmospheric score from loek dikker and outstanding acting from jeroen krabbÃ© and renÃ©e soutendijk the latter giving one of the most sneaky subtle 'femme fatale' performance i've ever seen like many other european movies this movie has an unashamed non judgmental attitude toward sex nudity and the complexities of sexuality and has zero reservations about mixing it all up with religious and or surrealistic some would say blasphemous images in other words if you can't bear the thought of seeing a lust driven homosexual envisioning the object of his carnal desire as jesus crucified on the cross before the two of them go at it inside a cemetery crypt then this might not be the movie for you what surprised me more is how this bizarre movie managed to completely dodge being a pretentious mess it mixes the abstract surreal parallel fantasy reality scenes and somehow makes it all work like any good mystery you can see the pieces slowly falling into place as the movie progresses there is not an out of left field resolution here the movie has direction there's no needless filler and once it concludes you begin to understand the purpose of what may have confused you earlier if you like the work of ken russell and david lynch i can almost guarantee you will love this movie hell ifÂ you have no idea who they even are you still might like it br br i'm not going to spoil the plot by getting too detailed but the film's opening shot through a web as a spider catches its prey sets the stage as krabbÃ© as unshaven smug bisexual writer gerard reve interestingly also the name of the writer whose novel this is based on crosses paths with a wealthy mysterious sexy woman named christine soutendijk melding androgynous stylings with simone simon like innocence cuteness that's pretty unnerving who may be a literal 'black widow' responsible for the deaths of her three previous husbands the two become lovers and move in with one another but we're led to believe through christine's bizarre behavior and the frequent appearances of another woman played by geert de jong who may or may not actually exist something terrible is boiling under the surface when another of christine's lovers the young and beautiful herman thom hoffman shows up at the house things take an unexpected turn and that's all you need to know br br the 4th man was a huge art house success in much of the world but didn't make it over to the us until 1984 where it was awarded the best foreign film of the year from the los angeles film critics association the most common video is the media release which has been horribly dubbed try to avoid that one and head straight for the newer subtitled anchor bay dvd release since coming to america verhoeven's career has had its ups and downs he has made a few decent films flesh blood robocop and some lousy ones showgirls in fact verhoeven's big hit basic instinct is almost like a less interesting junior league version of the fourth man soutendjik also tried her hand at acting in america and since grave secrets 1989 and eve of destruction 1991 were the best offers she was getting she headed right back home to the netherlands
<START> what a perfect example of less is more kurt russell sgt todd only has 72 lines and something like 104 words what a challenge like a black and white photo when your mind's eye has to fill in the blanks the facial expressions the physical drama the emotive gesture all combines to make a stronger impact this is one of those top 5 movies i can't live without right up there with the classics like road warrior if you liked this check out mad max 2 the road warrior and braveheart both starring mel gibson also gladiator with russell crowe and connie nielsen who was in soldier also the thirteenth warrior starring antonio banderas and blade runner starring harrison ford
<START> i did not enjoy the film joshua at all perhaps it is because i saw another much better similar film titled orphan 2 days prior but perhaps it's really just because this film was not very good i am going with the ladder sure the plot of an evil child is not exactly original but that doesn't mean the film could not succeed it could have been suspenseful and entertaining and chilling but instead it was slow building boring uneventful and really didn't leave me thinking anything more than 'that wasn't very good' when it was all over br br at the end joshua's motivations are revealed i won't give that away but the reality is that he didn't really accomplish his goals since despite vera farmiga as his mother abby disappearing about 3 4th through the movie all arrows point to her returning home soon she was committed to a mental institution because she was losing her mind but then joshua's father her husband was accused of tampering with her medication which tells the audience that the institution realized that she was indeed not mentally ill but rather was being dosed medically so shouldn't she be coming home soon won't joshua have failed won't his mother be living with him and his sister and possibly his father soon i question the father since his future is left open ended br br at the end of the day i didn't care about the characters the evil demon child joshua wasn't really scary the storyline moved slowly and when it picked up it was still boring suspense fell flat every single time when it was over i couldn't believe i had sat through the whole thing br br 4 10 just because the acting was good from the parents especially vera farmiga as the mother but if you want to see a movie about an evil 'child' go see orphan now that's a movie that took an unoriginal concept and created a brilliant movie
