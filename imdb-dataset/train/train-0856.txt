<START> leslie charteris' series of novels of the adventures of the slightly shady simon templar the saint was brought to the screen in the late 1930s with the up and coming george sanders as templar it was a careful choice sanders usually would play villains with occasional nice roles ffoliott in foreign correspondence the title hero in the strange case of uncle harry the framed best friend of robert montgomery in rage in heaven here his willingness to bend the rules and break a law briefly fit his heavy persona while his good looks and suave behavior made templar a fit shady hero like chester morris' boston blackie and to an extent peter lorre's mr moto br br the films are not the best series of movie mystery serials but they are serviceable like rathbone's holmes series or oland's chan's series the show frequently had actors repeating roles or playing new ones the anti heroine in the film here was played by wendy barrie who would show up in a second film in the series this and slightly familiar movie sets make the series a comfortable experience for the viewers who hear the buzz of the dialog always showing sanders' braininess in keeping one step ahead of the bad guys without noting the obvious defects of the plot all these mysteries have defects due to the fact that even the best writers of the genre can't avoid repeating old ideas again and again and again br br here the moment when that happened was when one of the cast admitted his affection for barrie which she was long aware of shortly after he tries to protect her from the police but as the film dealt with the identity of a criminal mastermind it became obvious that this person was made so slightly noble as to merit being the mysterious mastermind i e the script disguised him as the least likely suspect br br barrie is after the proof that her father who died in prison was framed by the real criminals in a robbery gang she has several people assisting her mugs like william gargan and she gets advice from the mastermind on planning embarrassing burglaries that can't be pinned on her the d a who got her father convicted jerome cowan is determined to get barrie and her gang the only detective who seems to have a chance to solve the case is jonathan hale who is shadowing sanders but reluctantly working with him br br the cast has some nice moments in the script hale currently on a special diet is tempted to eat a rich lobster dinner made for sanders by willie best he gets a serious upset stomach as a result enabling sanders and barrie to flee sanders' apartment best has to remind him when he feels better to head for a location that sanders told him to go to at a certain time br br there is also an interesting role for gilbert emery usually playing decent people like the brow beaten husband in between two worlds he plays a socially prominent weakling here whose demise is reminiscent of that of a character in a bogart movie br br on the whole a well made film for the second half of a movie house billing in 1939 it will entertain you even if it does not remain in your memory
<START> may anne reid and toots peter vaughan are paying an apparently infrequent visit to their son bobby steven mackintosh and his family in london even as the visit begins toots suffers a fatal heart attack leaving may adrift unsure and questioning her life and future finding herself attracted to her daughter's boyfriend darren daniel craig her actions lead to inevitable consequences br br beautifully filmed but for all its heralded realism and acclaim the mother offers a collection of mostly unpleasant even repellent characters and asks the viewer to engage with them reid shines as may and it is her skill and commitment as a wonderfully understated actor that salvages the film from a completely depressing mire but michell and kureishi have allowed craig mackintosh and cathryn bradshaw to create such utterly obnoxious characters that it becomes increasingly difficult to care what happens to may as written the characters played by mackintosh and bradshaw are in fact so utterly selfish and cold hearted that one begins to wonder what exactly was kureishi trying to say as directed they are either unwilling or unable to lift bobby and paula above the two dimensional in their ghastly selfishness br br worth seeing for reid's performance but little else a crying shame
<START> in 1594 in brazil the tupinambas indians are friends of the frenches and their enemies are the tupiniquins friends of the portugueses a frenchman arduÃ­no colassanti is captured by the tupinambÃ¡s and in spite of his trial to convince them that he is french they believe he is portuguese the frenchman becomes their slave and maritally lives with seboipepe ana maria magalhÃ£es later he uses powder in the cannons that the portuguese left behind to defeat the tupiniquins in a battle in order to celebrate the victory the indians decide to eat him br br como era gostoso o meu francÃªs is another great low budget movie of the great brazilian director nÃ©lson pereira dos santos the screenplay is very original and the story is spoken in tupi the film is shot using natural light most of the time and is very realistic the actors and actresses perform naked and ana maria magalhÃ£es is magnificent showing a wonderful body and giving a stunning performance the sound is produced by the brazilian musician zÃ© rodrix this movie shows the beginning of the exploitation of my country by europeans focusing in the portuguese and french at that time trading with the indians and exchanging combs and mirrors by our natural resources this movie was awarded in the national festivals such as the 1971 brazilian cinema festival of brasÃ­lia festival de brazÃ­lia do cinema brasileiro with best screenplay nelson pereira dos santos best dialog nelson pereira dos santos and humberto mauro and best cenograph rÃ©gis monteiro art critics association of sÃ£o paulo associaÃ§Ã£o paulista dos crÃ­ticos de arte with best revelation of the year ana maria magalhÃ£es and some other prizes my vote is eight br br title brazil como era gostoso o meu francÃªs how tasty was my frenchman
<START> this pile of sh t is tied in my book as the worst thing ever made i can't believe that someone actually relased this crap let alone acually made it horrible horrible horrible not even worth mentioning the damn story or any details about it that's how bad it actually is avoid it like sars
<START> seldom do i ever encounter a film so completely fulfilling that i must speak about it immediately this movie is definitely some of the finest entertainment available and it is highly authentic i happened to see the dubbed version but i'm on my way right now to grab the dvd remaster with original chinese dialogue still the dubbing didn't get in the way and sometimes provided some seriously funny humour poison clan rocks the world br br the story telling stays true to chinese methods of intrigue suspense and inter personal relationships you can expect twists and turns as the identities of the 5 venoms are revealed and an expert pace br br the martial arts fight choreography is in a class of its own and must be seen to be believed it's like watching real animals fight each other but construed from their own arcane martial arts forms such level of skill amongst the cast is unsurpassed in modern day cinema br br the combination provides for a serious dose of old chinese culture and i recommend it solely on the basis of the film's genuine intent to tell a martial arts story and the mastery of its execution of course if you just want to see people pummel each other along with crude forms of ancient chinese torture be my guest
<START> i love claire danes and kate beckinsale looks amazingly immature in her role the movie is flawed only because it seems the two accused seem to be in some monastery working like monks in the grass and under strict almost martial arts like discipline the acting and filmography and amazing colors of what is supposed to be thailand is eye catching but claire daines steals the entire movie and is unexpectedly profound in her learning the hard lesson of life itself to the very end in an act of amazing unselfishness unheard of and completely unexpected in the real world the flaws are minute and i recommend the film which seems buried sadly forever to rare tv showings i for one want the film for my collection a collection of only 10 rated films watch it you will be very touched
<START> i couldn't wait to put this movie in my dvd player when i rented it then after i started it i couldn't wait to get it out of my dvd player actually i watched all of the movie my wife and i kept waiting and waiting for something funny to happen but nothing funny ever does the box read like the it would be really funny the premise of the movie sound good ben stiller is funny jack black is funny how could this movie miss well it does miss this is the unfunniest comedy i have ever watched nobody i have talked with thought it was even slightly funny it is just a really lame movie trust me avoide it avoide it
<START> i have seen many many productions of the nutcracker now perhaps i viewed this movie from the tainted point of view of a theatrical director but i was disappointed i'm sure people in the specific business of ballet choreography find this production impressive but from a purely theatrical perspective i found everything from design to choreography to be lackluster and unbefitting of a motion picture none of the traditionally weird and impressive costumes looked like what they were supposed to be i e the candies didn't look like candies the rats didn't look like rats but rather like chocolate kisses the acting was weak perhaps toned down too much for the screen and the choreography just didn't do anything for me this makes the entire show very satisfactory at best as if it were intended to not set itself apart from any other production but remember again this is from the artistic perspective of a theatrical director not a dancer or a choreographer but a straight male theatrical director
<START> tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a kid i used to borrow the books from the school library every chance i got my favorite one was the red sea sharks so much action and humor br br this documentary was a brilliant exposition of the background story of herge and his development of tintin the film maker's personal experience in interviewing herge and the story of his relationship with the artist who was the inspiration for the chan character was very moving br br a great documentary of a very talented and well loved artist a great example of someone who has become internationally renown and has brought joy of millions of children and the young at heart all over the world
<START> this movie was by far the worst movie that i have ever seen in my entire life i'm not even kidding it was poorly made and the actors couldn't act it was a waste of my time and money it looked like a movie that my friends and i could have put together on our own the case the movie came in is definitely a disguise nothing in the movie looks like the zombie on the front of the case it appears that the director or make up artist has just put black eye liner under someones eyes an called them a zombie the credits at the beginning of the movie take up almost 20 minutes of the movie which watching the credits was the best part of the movie this was honestly an awful movie and i couldn't believe how badly it was put together scenes jumped from one thing to the other and sometimes u were like whats going on the audio was awful and the action shots looked like a couple of teen's joking around making a fake fight scene br br if you are considering renting or buying this movie i would advise you to at least watch the trailer for it because it show's how awful it truly is i wish i would have watched it before i rented it
<START> i don't hand out ten star ratings easily a movie really has to impress me and the bourne ultimatum has gone far beyond that furthermore this trilogy has come together so nicely that i believe it to be one of the greatest motion picture trilogies of our time though all three films could not be any more different from the ludlum novels they still stand as a powerful landmark in cinematic achievement the bourne ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete yet i could not even attempt to stop smiling for hours br br from the moment that the opening title appeared i knew we were in for a ride paul greengrass has done it again everything we love from the previous bourne films is here once again the action the dialogue and of course the shaky camera however for me that last one was never a problem i think it adds to the suspense br br i will be back to see this film several times before it is released on dvd simply because it is genius it is a perfectly satisfying conclusion and should stand the test of time as a fantastic movie and altogether an unforgettable trilogy
<START> ultimately too silly and pointless yes there is the gilded cage metaphor but probably most kids would miss that forgettable instantly br br animation is as we have come to expect super real the plot line could best be described as thin but tenacious although the ending seemed arbitrary to me br br the sewer underworld is a suitably disgusting reflection of the world above and somehow wealth and money seem to count for a lot there too oh yes and there's a romantic interest with the female being the smarter more savvy and go getting of the pair this in itself is rapidly becoming a tiresome anti stereotype probably your kids will love it though
<START> this movie is entertaining enough due to an excellent performance by virginia madsen and the fact that lindsey haun is lovely however the reason the movie is so predictable is that we've seen it all before i've haven't read the book a mother's gift but i hope for britney and lynne spears sake it is completely different than this movie unless you consider ending a movie with what is essentially a music video an original idea the entire movie brings to mind the word plagiarized
<START> i saw this movie being a jane austen addicted and always feeling doubtful about cinematographic rendering of the complexity of her novels well this transposition is simply accurate intelligent delicate careful tactful respectful intense in a word perfect br br emma is one of austen's most delightful and funny novels thanks to overall irony pervading situations and characters the movie respected this subtle irony not disregarding the comic element miss bates above all what engaged me in the novel and the movie renders it clearly is the deep knowledge of human life shown by the english novelist and the modern look with which women men and their relation are handled and it is astounding if we think how a woman novelist of the 18th century who lived almost a secluded life could grasp such depth and truth about life as she did that most and still fascinates me we can feel this modernity throughout the movie just replace costumes and use a more current language but the situations the feelings the ideas would be extremely modern i think of the morbid interest in other people's lives or that insinuating envy which now as ever rule women's relations and still the difficulty in revealing and giving expression to one's feelings especially love every situation gets a universal and out of time value br br the cast is really talented and offer very good and extremely brilliant performances a young gwyneth paltrow is particularly suitable for this role nowadays she would be probably too mature for it toni colette is simply great and how i envied them for the wonderful dresses they could wear and then the breathtaking english countryside where every situation gets such a magic and dream like dimension a really enjoyable and deserving movie
<START> for what it is raising victor vargas is about as close to perfection as a film can get either sheer genius from a fledgling auteur or just one of those lucky mixes where everything clicked probably some of each this simple little slice of urban life ethnic first love flick fleshes out its young characters with such depth you can almost read their minds the film begins with a strong flavor of street but works its way into a latino family affair and then focuses on a story which speaks volumes about the uncertainty of youth and the profoundly natural desire to love another in my experience never has so much been done with so little cast of tyros novice director etc praised by the critics but not for everyone raising victor vargas is recommended for indie lovers and realists into simple tales rich in humanness a
<START> the film torrent was a first and a last for greta garbo it was her first american made film at mgm the only studio in the usa that she would ever work at it was also the last time that someone else was billed above her in the credits that being her leading man her ricardo cortez br br torrent is based on the popular spanish writer's vicente blasco ibanez's work entre naranjos it concerns a pair of mismatched lovers garbo and cortez who can't quite get together mostly due to the machinations of cortez's mother marta mattox br br mattox is a wicked woman who has some set ideas about who her son should be marrying remember this is spain and such arranged marriages were still even in those times quite proper mattox has gertrude olmstead in mind as a daughter in law she's the offspring of mack swain a man grown rich in hog raising swain provides a few moments of comic relief with his tender concern for the piglets before they grow into big old hogs to be butchered br br blasco ibanez had previous novels the four horseman of the apocalypse and blood and sand previously filmed with rudolph valentino in the lead it might have been interesting if valentino had done this one with garbo but he might have been beyond film making when this was done in any event one of the valentino wannabes ricardo cortez fills in with the male lead br br one reason valentino might not have wanted this film is because clearly the lead character is garbo's unlike the other two works previously mentioned when she gets done dirt by cortez who is doing what mattox and her 'adviser' banker tully marshall tell her she leaves spain and goes to france where she becomes a great opera star and leads quite the scandalous life there br br when she returns to spain and tries to rekindle things mattox is even more outraged she has a political career in mind for her son cortez is now running for the spanish parliament which curiously enough is called the cortes br br the title refers to a flood and a dam breaking causing all kinds of havoc in the countryside cortez in fact braves the torrent in a row boat trying to rescue garbo from harm's way when they do get together they have a brutally frank discussion the brutality coming from garbo br br the special effects here primitive though they seem now are quite remarkable for their time they look very similar to the shots used in 20th century fox's the rains came that came out in 1939 and that won an oscar for special effects unfortunately for torrent it came out one year before oscar made his debut br br i'm not going to give any endings away so you'll have to see the film to find out if cortez and garbo get together in the end garbo rightly won rave reviews for her performance and in an age when exaggerated gestures was the norm in silent screen acting she was remarkably subtle in her role so she would be the rest of her career she had a remarkable face for closeups br br although greta garbo would go on to do far better work than torrent this film is still a fitting debut for her on the american big screen and holds up very well for today's audience
<START> i only saw it once this happened in 1952 i was seven the movie 13 br br we were so young but i kept in mind forever the strong moments of gunga's sacrifice br br i realized that time how much a people can be hardly submitted and used by a foreign nation under these historical circumstances in the movie the personal relation of friendship a kind of friendship that ignores itself the one raised between people who share daily life who see each other faces who knows each other names but belong to different worlds can only make appears then in the most critical moments a troubling question emerges whom are we in first supposed to be loyal which people family motherland the person you know close to you you do not have time to give a perfect answer urgency is there and it is for life or death gunga din gives his answer with sacrifice of himself somewhere in a confuse manner a problem remains unsolved the emotion grows with the rhythm of the movie until somebody dies just one life nothing compared to so many other fictions or realities we can see today because this death this unique vanishing life i lived it i shared with my child unconditional friendship it was lived by the spectator i was that day i loose gunga din for ever as i left behind later my pretty childhood as i left from then so many worlds i lived in i left all that for good and these lines are today a short visit i didn't expect to do this morning when getting up
<START> few films have left me with such a feeling of unease and this is not a compliment since i saw it in a theater how it ended there i can only wonder i was subjected to 90 mn of hateful derivative garbage the main impression being a bit like this other sick o movie don't answer the phone but worse the nastiness of it all rape and all is shown without any distance unlike strong stuff like last house on the left and utter contempt for the perfect victims and everybody involved leaving the viewer to be treated as a sadistic voyeur at the end i felt like taking a shower no credits to the director
<START> surely no saturday morning tv kids' show was ever done this poorly after all those producers had to count on the audience coming back well in this awful offering they could at least count the money they saved on sets the script could have been a reject from some long forgotten space opera serial with a few smarmy lines added for cool dude gerald mohr to murmur to naura hayden no director could have done anything decent with such a loony storyline so the action just plods boringly along the spaceship props are absurd a bulova wall clock and portable typewriter for example but the planet sets have got to be some of the worst in cinematic history most are crude drawings and it's all bathed in an often misfocused red light even mohr's bare hairy chest is used as a prop and it's a bad one as rib thin as the plot any viewer who can make it to the end of this movie will hear a message from the martians and will probably agree completely
<START> annie's wig does not look good she is not cute and pretty enough to play annie annie sticks out in the movie as her outfits look like halloween costumes terrible acting and terrible plots this movie is such a change from the 1982 version i think that a younger and smaller girl should have had the lead role ashley johnson portrays a very boyish annie not appealing at all at least the casting director got it right with daddy warbucks ms hannigan was also miscast camilla belle played molly alright warning this movie might insult your iq so you might just want to only show it to very young children 8 and younger some of the plots are too fictional and could hardly take place in the real world
