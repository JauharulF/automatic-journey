<START> spoilers following i picked up the book evil angels when it first came out knowing nothing of the case just to give the press and the austrialian people a break here i was quite far into it before i began to question the chamberlain's guilt the author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions they did john bryson told the story just as it was presented to the jurors and picked up by the press of the arterial spray the actelone plates dr james cameron's certainty that the collar was cut with scissors that a baby could not be taken whole from her clothes with the buttons still done up bloody hand print etc all quite convincingly after all these were experts in their fields who were testifying with no apparent reason to lie and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong wasn't apparent to me at all it was also highly technical evidence difficult for a layman to understand to this point beyond some hearsay testimony in the trials hardly anyone had ever heard of a dingo attacking a human people didn't believe it was possible the public was suspicious of the seventh day adventists whose origins made them appear to be a cult and all sorts of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt were it not for dedicated selfless lawyers who worked relentlessly to investigate and counter the trial testimony finding azaria's clothes later would not have been enough to get lindy out of jail the book shook me for that reason and i've been reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyone's guilt ever since excepting oj of course i was thrilled that a movie was going to be made about the case and don't think it could have been done better i've always liked sam who i could identify with completely and meryl was perfect as always beautiful photography haunting music i think it's not only a very good but a very important movie too bad it didn't receive more publicity at the time it was released

<START> i found myself very caught up in this movie at least at the beginning and any credit i give to this movie is lacey chabert she was fantastic but thats where it ends i seem to be very good at figuring out who the killer is and i like it when a movie is able to completely baffel me but i felt out and out lied to they whole time they lead you in one direction and then suddenly they decided to go in a completely different direction at the end they gave no hit to it at all thats not misleading that very bad writing and planning someone did not think at all br br i felt the movie would have been much better if they had stuck to the plot that the lead you on they also seemed to not answer anything why did jane maria burn down the professor's house br br its a great pity as i felt it started out as a relatively good movie
<START> aro tolbukhin burnt alive seven people in a mission in guatemala in the 70's also he declared that he had murdered another 16 people he used to kill pregnant women and then he set them on fire br br this movie is a documentary that portraits the personality of aro through several interviews with people that got to know him and through some scenes played by actors based on real facts br br aro tolbukhin is a serious work so analytical it's not morbid at all such a horrifying testimony about how some childhood trauma can turn a man into a monster br br my rate 7 10
<START> at the end of this episode holmes asks watson not to record the case for posterity for a good reason the super sleuth left his little grey cells sorry agatha at home for this tale there is no deductive reasoning no acute analysis of signs at crime scenes holmes bumbles along fifty yards behind the plot the dastardly cam is finally dealt to by an old frail in a manner that would have made charles bronson's heart swell with pride six bullets in the breadbasket in an ensuing chase a pursuer gets hold of one of watson's shoes mercifully the writer didn't decide to tack on the story of cinderella to lengthen the film the murderess holmes and watson escape scot free oh well it is a bit of a change of pace in late victorian london a bit of sixgun law
<START> a very slick modern keeping it sensually hip revamp on the dracula story although staying with the traditional customs with quite an interesting if not fully grasped back story of the prince of darkness the first time i tried watching it i could only make it halfway through before losing interest again it gets off to a good start especially the scenes with the thieves and then their encounters with dracula but then for me it got less involving when it hits new orleans to focus on van helsing's daughter a great place to set it but never took advantage of its settings despite etching a paradise in damn where dracula could flourish produced by wes carven and yeah they throw that name out there but written directed by patrick lussier artistically it had its moments with few dreamlike visuals but some kinetic editing and cheap jolts don't help the messy script does get considerably silly lussier does a polished job that remains rather glassy inserting a lot of blood the make up is suitably achieved and a lot of virgin advertising no i don't mean virgins it's the music company as it does get in numerous shots and helsing's daughter works there too oh that wasn't obvious planting the soundtrack is an amusing choice of rock tunes now the performances are all over the shop but there are few familiar faces to spot danny masterson sean patrick thomas nathan fillion shane west and lochlyn munro gerard butler as dracula just didn't come off as not much of a presence was formed he was simply out shined by the succulent ladies of the night jennifer esposito colleen fitzpatrick and jeri ryan as dracula's brides the likes of jonny lee millar and justine waddell are respectably okay christopher plummer gives out a grizzled turn as van helsing and omar epps has fun with his role
<START> story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy a formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane violent mob by the crazy chantings of it's singers unfortunately it stays absurd the whole time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting even those from the era should be turned off the cryptic dialogue would make shakespeare seem easy to a third grader on a technical level it's better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great vilmos zsigmond future stars sally kirkland and frederic forrest can be seen briefly
<START> radio was not a 24 hour 7days a week happening when i grew up in the 1930s england so children's hour was a treat for me when we had batteries and an accumulator to spare for the power the few programmes i heard therefore made a great impression on my young mind and the 3 that i recall still are toytown one about all the animals at the zoo and grey owl talking about the animals he knew which he called his brothers it was only in recently that i learnt that grey owl wasn't a genuine indian but the tribute paid by the sioux chief makes great sense to me a man becomes what he dreams would that we could all dream as world changing and beneficial as archie grey owl belaney would that a new grey owl could influence world leaders to clean up the environment
<START> this movie could have been a decent b movie if 3 4 of the the movie wasn't so much focusing on the sex scenes i mean he's a sex addict and i'm sure that there's a lot more that goes on with sex addicts outside of having sex on a constant basis michael des barres did a good job considering what all he had to do which wasn't much at one point or another one would have to laugh at him because his character was so pitiful nastassja kinski was alright in her role as the concerned sex therapist she could've of done more though and i'm not suggesting her having sex the person that stood out the most to me in this movie was rosanna arquette in her convincing role as the loving and concerned wife there's something about beautiful inside and out that strongly appeals to me she played that role and as you watched the movie you start to feel bad for her br br diary of a sex addict while not oscar material or a modern classic to anyone's standards is quite informative and does a fair job in showing you how one's personal demons can take over and ruin the very things in life you think highly of
<START> gundam wing is a fun show i appreciate it for getting me into gundam and anime in general however after watching its predecessors such as mobile suit gundam zeta gundam and even g gundam i find wing to be gundam lite br br characters an aspect long held by gundam is to have their characters thrust into difficulties and grow into maturity this does not happen in wing heero is top dog at the beginning and he's top dog at the end personalities do not change growth is never achieved the best character is zechs who is for all intents and purposes a hero throughout most of the series but suddenly the series betrays him and turns him into a villain for no apparent reason br br mecha wing has great suit designs the gundams are super cool with the epyon being my favorite i even consider a few of the oz suit designs to be on par with some of the classic zeon suits but sweet suit designs doesn't quite save the series from boring characters br br conclusion in the end wing has cool fight scenes though riddled with recycled animation but shallow plot and character development enjoyable but not moving like previous gundam outings
<START> this long episode packs amount of astounding of surprises thriller mystery and concerns about a battle of wits of sherlock against charles augustus milverton a master blackmailer this is an excellent overlong runtime of jeremy brett holmes series in the film appear usual holmes's cannon as inspector lestrade and mrs hudson though no moriarty however is a greatest villain charles augustus br br it's a genuine ripping yarn with intrigue thrills and suspense including an exciting final twist this is a particular sherlock movie but we find to holmes falling in love with a servant kissing crying and even robbing this time along with the episode Â¨scandal in bohemeÂ¨ with irene adler result to be the only one which holmes is enamored top notch brett performance he alongside peter cushing are the best sherlock tv while in the cinema is forever basil rathbone brett performs as a resolutive headstrong impetuous sleuth here doctor watson isn't a comic botcher and clumsy pal personified by nigel bruce but is an astute and cunning partner well incarnated by edward hardwicke a perfect counterpoint of brett casting is frankly magnificent special mention to robert hardy as astute nasty hardy today famous by role as cornelius fudge in harry potter is a veteran actor with forty years of career and with several success such as the 10th kingdom and winston churchill furthermore appear secondaries actors with terrific performances nickolas grace sophie gordon serena gordon among others the movie gets a colorful atmosphere the london streets and 221 baker street's house are well designed the motion picture is well directed by peter hammond director of various episodes it's a must see for the arthur conan doyle fans
<START> this is quite an amazing film to watch using digital technology the director rohmer has literally encrusted his living actors into painted backdrops most of the time this works brilliantly especially at the start where the film is like a pop up story book come to life it is less successful in a few scenes where it limits camera angles they had not painted the side of some of the buildings for example but it is a very interesting way to film a historical film which is as much about our own misconceptions and limited views of history as history itself it is narrated using the memoirs of the duc d'orleans' ex mistress grace elliott so an event usually claimed as one of their own by marxist historians especially in france is here told from the point of view of a female aristocratic foreigner inevitably a different point of view emerges there can be no objective representation the use of the memoirs device does give the film a rather episodic quality personally i found the story line around the king's death the most interesting a staunch royalist she is shocked when the duc votes for the king's death a basic knowledge of the french revolution is probably helpful to follow the dialogue between grace and the duc here he was louis's cousin and had himself elected to the assembly where he promptly changed his name to philip equality the filming of louis's death is masterly grace and her maidservant are in meudon out of paris watching from a hill with a telescope we do not see the execution we only hear the maid's commentary like grace the most dramatic event of the revolution happens off screen grace cannot bear to watch her king be killed her view is that of an aristocrat any justification of louis's death is literally beyond her vision this is powerful keenly intelligent film making the love story between the duc and grace is insinuated never told and is powerfully moving tho the duc does seem a bit of a pompous fool at times what does she see in him no accounting for taste the undercurrents of madness simply existing being enough to be a suspect that sweep individuals along in a time such as the revolution are illustrated as grace's life is turned upside down her house is searched daily yet she still orders her servants to cook her food and is incapable of dressing herself if you have any interest at all in a subtle well told film making clever use of new technology to tell an old tale or the representation of a pivotal moment in europe's history narrated by an aristocratic foreign woman its ultimate outsider then this is well worth your time it is a little slow in places but your patience is amply rewarded
<START> don't waste your time or money on this one the half decent cast might fool you into thinking that this teen thriller whilst hardly about to break any records might lightly entertain for 80 minutes br br it won't br br it won't make you scared laugh cry or even challenge your intellect it will leave you wondering how on earth this movie ever finished production yes it really is that poor
<START> i watched free money last night it was the longest 90 minutes of my life with such an intriguing cast i really thought that i was in for a treat especially since i'm a brando fan wrong what a waste of talent it's almost embarrassing to watch at times like the cattle prod scene there were so many missed opportunities for humorous setups why didn't they show charlie sheen's character going back to tow brando's truck ugh it tries to be a slapstick comedy but i just wasn't buying into it skip this one only for die hard brando fans br br i'm giving it 2 out of 10 because i still think the worse movie ever made was skidoo
<START> when i saw this movie cover the first thing i thought was that it was made for video the second thing that came to mind was how similar this looked to another terrible movie darkness falls the tale of this dumb witch who killed people in the dark unfortunately darkness falls was quite the masterpiece compared to this pile of garbage and this movie should not have been made br br the film starts off with a small back story for the witch or more like a pointless introduction of two little kids who are going to go meet the tooth fairy in hopes of her giving them a shiny new bicycle for their tooth the opening is filmed poorly and like the rest of the movie it's certainly not scary in present time the movie is about peter lochlyn munroe peter's renting out his house and his ex girlfriend darcy chandra west and her daughter cole come to stay there cole meets a neighborhood child and they talk of the tooth fairy and how you shouldn't lose your tooth or she'll come for you unfortunately seconds later it looks like the tooth fairy steals her bike and knocks her tooth out how ironic will cole survive the wrath of the tooth fairy and will her mother and peter be able to save her and rekindle their romance this is a bad movie you could probably figure it out br br one of the main problems with this idiotic film is how undefined the tooth fairy is they say she kills you if you lose your tooth but nope she's more like a serial killer who kills at random and if you lose your tooth you're definitely going to go she steals a bike so apparently she's a thief too i said earlier that the idea for this movie was based on darkness falls but where did they get the inspiration for the tooth fairy's appearance let's see she looks like a burn victim and she previously went around the neighborhood slaughtering children hmmm it's almost as though she's an exact rip off of freddy krueger from the nightmare on elm street films and this is not the worst part of this awful mess the climax is this movie might have the most laughable climax not literally laughable because i found it more sickening than funny i've ever seen don't see this br br just a little trivia lochlyn munroe was in scary movie and jianna ballard was in scary movie 3 and they both were in this so apparently scary movie stars are forced to end out their career with bad scary movies br br my rating 1 2 out of 80 mins r for violence
<START> some movies seem to be made before we are ready for them as i watched this film made in 1988 in 1999 i thought i was watching the o j simpson debacle although i have very different opinions about the innocence of the individuals in each situation br br the australian news media if this movie is to be believed devoured the case of a possible infanticide and truth was left as an afterthought it was scary to see the scenes of invasive swarming media hordes ridiculous accounts of half truths and lies and debates over the supposed merits of the case by persons at all levels of society br br equally appalling is the media's depiction as indifferent and uncomprehending of the technical information in the case i do wish more was made of the issue of religious prejudice in the case the accused are seven day adventists br br today these circuses have become common but that makes the lesson only more important br br streep is excellent as usual and this is the best i've ever seen sam neill the aussie accents get a bit thick at times but not incomprehensible
<START> i'm a 53 year old college professor i went with my wife and 12 year old daughter we all enjoyed the movie the film is original witty fast paced and totally charming the plot was easy enough for a 10 year old to follow but twisty enough to keep an adult interested i thought emma roberts did a superb job and the rest of the cast was just fine my only criticism is that the los angeles sets were not as interesting as they should have been they were functional but nothing stood out on the other hand make up costume lighting cinematography editing and directing were excellent altogether i thought it was a totally enjoyable experience i am disappointed that the professional critics almost all adult males savagely attacked the film apparently they have something against films that portray strong intelligent and independent young women their writings reveal more about their own sexist natures than anything about this wonderful family film i recommend it strongly to every child and every parent
<START> being that i am a true product of the hip hop and electronic dance music generation this is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time beat street although not as authentic in some respects as wild style is a film that is guaranteed to tug the heart strings of anyone who takes pride in the culture of urban sample dj based music and electro club culture br br although i will admit that at times the dialogue is somewhat cheesy you can't help but feel for the characters and ultimately wish you were there for the beginnings of hip hop culture in new york city in the early eighties the b boy battle scene at the roxy nightclub a real life real time competition between the legendary rock steady crew and the nyc breakers is just as essential to a hip hop fan's archives as any classic album watch some of the breakers' moves in slow motion if possible to truly appreciate the athletic and stylistic expertise of a seasoned b boy b girl all praises due to the zulu nation
<START> along with aparadektoi the best greek comedy series ever lefteris papapetrou writes and antonis aggelopoulos directs in a magnificent way soso alekos flora achilleas grandpa aristides machi johnnie corrina and michalis in a few words alekos a butcher living in a district around the center of athens is married to soso one day he meets flora an old date of his who now is married to achilleas and lives along with her father in law and his caretaker machi machi also has a son named johnny who appears at the end of the first period and the entire second one the rest main characters are michalis alekos's assistant at the butcher's and bi sexual and corrina achilleas's lost sister who has turned up to be the best prostitute in the entire athens the main story of the series is soso's attempts to kill alekos because he is cheating on her but everything else happening in that are not of lower importance brilliant screenplay with an excellent plot poisonous quotes awesome performances and a great directing original idea and especially the shootings were something that was done at the greek television for a series of the greek television for the first time e g scenes shot under water surely a serial you will never stop enjoying
<START> i had seen this movie when it got released and when i was 12 years old and i still vividly recollect the wonderful scenes of how the hero heroine escape every time when faced with danger and the best feature of the movie was the portrayal of the villain i think many so called action movies copied a lot many escape scenes from this movie and not only does it never impress me when i see such copying it always increases my appreciation for this masterpiece the lead actors have acted wonderfully the slow and realistic development of the chemistry b w the hero and heroine was extremely natural and wonderfully portrayed as children we felt that the love that developed b w them was very natural the way they face and overcome all their trials and tribulations together was something that can make even kids realize the value of true love sacrifice and caring i recommend that every person see this movie when given a chance vijay
