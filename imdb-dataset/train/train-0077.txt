<START> a neat 'race against time' premise a murdered john doe is found to have pneumonic plague so while the health authority and nopd battle everybody and each other trying to find his waterfront contacts the murderers think the heat is because the victim's infected cousin is holding out on them br br this movie is freely available from the internet archive and it's well worth downloading a lot all of this movie was filmed in genuine new orleans locations which makes it interesting to look at for what is now period detail though to me it does look under exposed even for noir maybe mobile lighting rigs then weren't what they are there is also a plenty of location background noise which is slightly distracting car horns in the love scene anyone there are a lot of non professional supporting artists in crowd scenes and this may explain why the pacing of the film is slightly saggy to begin with not much chance for retakes or recasting though the final chase is worth hanging on for there's not much wrong with the lead actors either jack palance is genuinely scary as a charismatic intelligent psychopath the later scene as he alternately comforts and threatens the sick cousin is terrific while widmark as he often did pitches the righteous anger of the man on a mission at a believable level most of the time br br somebody should remake this no supernaturals no mysticism no special fx just a good yarn full of character conflict and a topical theme another reviewer mentioned the writer john kennedy o'toole and that's spot on with the number of oddball new orleans types peppering this dark sleazy against the clock drama there's even a midget newspaper seller br br community what community d'you think you're living in the middle ages
<START> after seeing the trailer for this movie and finding out spike lee was directing i was excited to hear about this event i wasn't alive at the time i didn't live in new york so i expected more of a history lesson than anything what i got was some interesting acting a lot of sex and about 30 minutes worth of film that actually had anything to do with the son of sam i guess the film wasn't about the son of sam but it was a peek into the summer of '77 label me disappointed br br
<START> when i saw the movie at first i thought that it was boring because nothing was happening but when all the scary things started to happen like when church dies and is brought back to life and also gage and his mom die and there idiot dad has to bring them back to life even though he nows the warnings and ignores jud this is not steven kings best work i thought that his best work was the shining i don't think that people who see this movie and comment on how awful it was are wrong because all they think is that what were they thinking as if that person can do a better job in making a horror flick i mean making the gage evil and how he kills jud is genius making the most innocent most unsuspecting character into one of the killers is cool people who didn't like the movie are dumb because all it is a scary movie and nothing all don't expect something from a movie that it isn't it still in a general area wasn't that good i still recommend people to watch the movie
<START> indian burial ground if those three words appear anywhere in a real estate listing look for a different neighborhood a young couple with a young daughter and a toddler age son move into a maine house adjacent to a pet cemetery and after a l o o o ng hike an ancient indian burial ground seems the indian ground can bring fido or fluffy back from the dead if you don't mind having a raving hell beast for a pet it can do the same for dead people if you don't mind having a homicidal zombie around the house br br throw in a busy two lane blacktop speeding big rigs a well meaning if somewhat dim old neighbor and one kid who really doesn't get enough supervision and i think you can figure out what happens from there an over the top illogical mess which in all fairness does offer up a few scares br br well there are worse stephen king adaptations such as maximum overdrive which king also directed but there are far better ones too such as salem's lot the dead zone and both versions of the shining
<START> you know the story a group of plucky no hopers enter a competition they seemingly have no chance of winning it's a tale that has been done to death by hollywood bring it on the karate kid escape to victory best of the best etc now korea gives it a go with a taekwondo team struggling for glory Â and guess what Â the result is predictable but ultimately satisfying br br the fact that this movie doesn't fall flat on its face is down to the talented young cast who really make you care about the characters and this in turn keeps you watching to the end br br fans of your typical martial arts movie may be disappointed Â taekwondo does not deliver the usual flurry of moves and acrobatics seen in most kung fu films the action is limited to albeit impressive kicking and the occasional punch this doesn't matter though since it is the interaction of the characters and their fight to make something of themselves which makes this movie a success
<START> absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time i have seen it at least a hundred times and i can't go through it without crying i defy anyone to watch the reunion of celie and nettie or shug and father and not feel your eyes getting misty whoopie goldberg should have one an award for amazing portrayal and for the person who said you can't love the movie if you loved the book wrong im a testament to that
<START> i normally have no problem walking away from a bad movie however this was an unique case this movie was so bad that i actually sat through the whole thing almost praying it would have one minute of good movie time to justify the hour and a half that was wasted needless to say i was brutally disappointed set at a beach house where a group of college friends are celebrating vacation this movie suffers from numerous problems making it not worth seeing first there are gaping plot holes second very few of the c list i don't even dare call them b actors can act worth a damn so any scenes that have potential fail miserably third the rate of the film is very choppy and awkward to watch most of the time making suspense building very difficult leading to very few surprises for the audience fourth and most importantly the ending is completely anti climatic partially because of how it ends setting who the killer turns out to be and partially because the dialog is just atrocious to the films credit it is the only movie that i will ever say is the worst movie i have ever scene and i've seen a lot br br so just like a bad joke you would have been all the happier never hearing the next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret you will be yelling no you really don't as you run in the opposite direction
<START> this is where the term classic film comes from this is a wonderful story of a woman's bravery courage and extreme loyalty poor olan got sold to her uncaring husband who through the years learned to appreciate her yeah right a pearl br br luise rainer was the beautiful star who had won the best actress oscar the year before for her small role and what a waste of an oscar in the great zigfield it really didn't show what if any talent she had other than her exotic beauty but in good earth she shows that she can really act her beauty was erased and she had no great costumes either people say that she didn't show any real emotions in this film like hell her character olan is a shy and timid woman with inner strength she is quiet during parts of the film with only her eyes and body to convey her emotions example those scenes during the fall of the city and when looters were being shot if you people are saying that she doesn't act well in this film you are not looking br br paul muni shows that he can act as well his character is not a likeable one to me he never sees her for what she is until the very end of the story a sweet loving and dedicated wife and mother with her own special beauty the greatest one of all the beauty from within like a pearl br br if you get a chance to see this film watch it you will see one of the best films that the golden age of hollywood created
<START> young beautiful eva hedy lamarr marries an older man zvonimir rogoz unfortunately he can't satisfy her sexually and ignores her frustrated she goes home and plans to get a divorce then one day she's skinny dipping in a lake in the middle of the woods her horse gallops off with her clothes and she runs after it she meets young and very handsome adam aribert mog they make love and she realizes this is the man she wants br br ending spoiler naturally since this was made in 1933 she has to be punished for her sin so it leads to a tragic finale end of ending spoiler br br this horrified people in 1933 but it's pretty tame by today's standards lamarr's nude swim shows nothing and when she runs after the horse totally nude it's either shown in extreme long shot or is covered by branches and such there's only a few minor shots of her breasts also when she has sex with mog nothing is shown but her face but you see her achieving an orgasm these scene were considered pretty extreme in their day and were cut out completely of the american release now today they're back in this film would get by with a pg 13 easily now br br shock episodes aside this is just ok it is beautifully filmed and there's next to no dialogue except for the music score this could be a silent picture luckily all the actors are good lamarr and mog especially and they're so attractive that they just take your breath away watching them also the sequence where they make love is easily one of the most beautifully shot and acted sequences i've ever seen in a movie the scenes with the sexual symbolism there's quite a few of them are unfortunately pretty obvious today i actually started to giggle during one br br so great direction beautiful imagery attractive actors good acting all around but i wasn't exactly bowled over by it i found the movie slow moving beautiful imagery does not make a picture for me somewhat dull obvious static and had a negative ending i can live with the ending but it doesn't excuse the other problems i had with it also the final sequence is really strange and out of place so i admire this film more than anything else it was well done and i'd recommend it but with caution many people seem to love this movie so i'm in the minority use your own judgment
<START> in film i feel as though it should be more than just art i think it should be more than that a way to tell a story on screen this short from david lynch tells a story but not much of one i felt that it was funny but too bizarre to be a comedy it is good film making but there really isn't anything else to it as i've said before i am a huge david lynch fan but i get frustrated by some of his work because i don't see a need for it at all this is definitely my least favorite thing he has done so far but i know he's still got a ton of talent and i am excited to see what he has in store for us in the future if you like lynch check this out but don't be surprised when you don't like it very much
<START> the sentinel represents everything about the soul lessness of hollywood and the saddening lack of imagination present in so many movies these days i cannot possibly think of one good thing about it it's all so generic so factory made and so lazy assembled that it really only exists as an infomercial on how to make money from the unsuspecting undeserving public br br a plot about a secret service agent planning to assassinate the prez could well be entertaining if handled by a good director or caring cast that is douglas is the one who is framed basinger is the first lady with whom he is having an affair an undeveloped unresolved plot contrivance sutherland is the best pal who believes his guilty because there would be no movie if he didn't and longoria is nothing a woman with a fortune of maybelline and that's it i guess there are less requirements for women when entering the secret service as usual in a film like this the role of the prez himself is nothing more than a tool a token and is very badly written br br clark johnson's he who gave us the equally as pathetic swat back in 2003 mechanical direction lacks any kind of signature and has all the visual sophistication of a cheap tv movie douglas basinger and sutherland look incredibly bored and phone in their performances from afar eva longoria the most over exposed woman of the 21st century is basically only in this to attract to the desperate housewives audience her role is 100 pointless and she does absolutely nothing to further the plot or add to character development she barely has 2 lines to rub together a truly shameless marketing ploy br br if you're a glutton for punishment then don't let me stop you but it is time and money you won't be getting back
<START> this movie will not sit well with some but it is a must view i am glad someone finally brought up for discussion the realities of how african american couples worked to make a name in communities and how many of them felt trying to stay there as other african americans moved in br br minor spoilers br br this little showtime film is almost like a spike lee joint you have an african american male danny glover who worked his way hard through the traditionally white law profession positions in the 1970's like any american he moved his family to be compatable with his upwardly mobile status but forgot there was still alot of problems going on the only african americans in the neighborhood at the time was the maids one owning a home wow br br then the blending in began his wife whoopi goldberg is told to get involved so she does what all the other women in her neighborhood do and just when the man thinks he and his family are in right next door comes another african american who got in because they won the lotto mo'nique and in his eyes and he wants nothing to do with them for he doesn't want the neighborhood to think they are alike he of course is of a better calibre his new neighbor is ghetto not an shouldn't be there who's got a problem now br br what this film shows you is the great pains it takes for this family to fit in and how they lose themselves in the process it makes you question where does racism begin and end and with whom it shows how no matter what colour you are and how much money you have you can still shut yourself off from the real world and helping those around you it also shows how these african american children when blending in neighborhoods such as these fall into the trap of changing themselves to suit the culture complete with blonde hair and blue eyes mind you around them they laugh along with the jokes not knowing they are the joke and not knowing why br br but overall this film is about 'people' no matter what race you are this film gets into how terrible you can be towards your neighbor and toward each other all for the sake of fitting in all because you feel you have more money than others so that automatically makes you better and you forget the struggles you had and those coming up behind you br br again not for everyone but take a look and judge for yourself br br
<START> i loved this film seen this evening on a movie theatre big screen the audience laughed out loud at some very interesting things and the fast pace was most enjoyable br br i do as a singer and musical director question one section of roby keeler's vocal in by a waterfall the key modulated and she was suddenly singing much lower in a very mellow voice that bore no resemblance to the somewhat tin like higher twitter voice she used in all her other vocals br br does anyone know if this was overdubbed by another singer it sounds it to me i would love to know br br thanks so much
<START> has to be one of the worst wastes of 35mm movie film ever unleashed on the public the sequel to the at least entertaining pseudo documentary original film the legend of boggy creek bad script worse acting etc etc dawn wells had to be hoping that gilligan would come rescue her and take her back to the island just to escape from this piece of clap trap
<START> i am amazed at how this movie and most others has a average 5 stars and lower when there are crappy movies averaging 7 to 10 stars on imdb the fanboy mentality strikes again when this movie came out just about everyone slammed it even my ex girlfriend said this movie questionable years later i sat down to watch this movie and i found myself enjoying even laughing quite a bit this and the replacement killers are the movies that had people labeling the director antoine fuqua as the black michael bay i don't see how since most of fuqua's movies are smarter than anything michael bay has came up with at any rate br br story alvin sanders jamie foxx is former convict that is used by a no nonsense treasury agent edgar david morse as a pawn to catch a killer named bristol doug hutchinson alvin's every moves are tracked by a bug implanted in his jaw after an accident while these agents are after bristol bristol is after the gold bricks that were taken in a heist gone awry br br jamie foxx is funny as well as great as alvin sanders alvin is a fast talker that is a lot smarter than he lets on doug hutchinson is okay as bristol he can be over the top sometimes in his john malkovitchesque demeanor he was better here than he was as looney bin jim in punisher war zone david morse is good as the hard edged treasury agent even mike epps is funny as alvin's brother stevie both him and jamie had some funny moments on screen br br the only flaw of the movie is the some of the attempts at a thriller fall flat the scenario at the horse race track is way over the top but i couldn't look away the director went all out there so he gets points for that plus the bomb scene with the treasury agent tied to a chair while the detonator rests on the door was pretty nifty br br all in all bait is not a bad movie by a long shot its never boring its always funny and i wasn't checking my watch every minute that should count for something bait is one of the most underrated movies of 2000 period br br ps to the reviewer that claimed this movie is too violent how long have you been living under a rock i'm pretty sure you've seen the die hard series and every movie by quentin tarantino but those movies aren't violent right weirdo
<START> yet another film about a tortured self centered arrogant unfeeling hateful self destructive lead character we are supposed to care about br br don't get me wrong i am very open to all kinds of off the wall movies that have as the lead character a strongly self destructive character what i object to about this one is that there is so little background to this guy why did this guy hate himself and the world had the script dealt with this more they might have managed to elicit some sympathy for him as it is he just comes off as an unpleasant hateful character not tragic just hateful br br after taking great pains to make this guy as crazy and anti social as possible and making his fate as dark as possible the writer then has the nerve to make a happy ending br br this is not the worst film i have ever seen but it is in there putting up a good fight man don't waste your time
<START> the first power 1990 was a terrible film that came out during the late 80's early 90's era of cheaply made horror films i found this movie very boring but extremely hilarious in some parts this movie lacks so much sense and credibility that it ain't even funny the swift justice system in this film makes texas look weak by comparison lou diamond phillips is in way over his head with this role he plays a hard boiled cop and tracey griffith melanie's more attractive sister plays a psychic don't waste your time with this one because it's bad what a minute i take it back this movie makes a great party film check out the switchblade crucifix packing nun she has the nicest legs i've ever seen on a nun that wasn't in a jesus franco nunsploitation flick yeow br br this marked an end of an era for l d p his star was tarnished and he couldn't draw flies to a dung heap it was d t v for him until his ressurection a few years later br br not recommended unless you're desperate
<START> and i never thought a movie deserved to be awarded a 1 but this one is honestly the worst movie i've ever watched my wife picked it up because of the cast but the storyline right since the dvd box seemed quite predictable it is not a mystery nor a juvenile catching film it does not include any sensuality if that's what the title could remotely have suggest any of you this is just a total no no don't waste your time or money unless you feel like watching a bunch of youngsters in a as grown up kind of gothic setting where a killer is going after them nothing new nothing interesting nothing worth watching max makowski makes the worst of nick stahl
<START> i saw this film when i was a young child on television thank you canadian broadcasting corporation and had nightmares about it for years afterwards br br trnka was one of the mentors for bratislav pojar one of canada's national film board's best animators pojar was in turn a mentor and collaborator for the great drouin if you like trnka you should see night angel br br the symbolism is obvious but deftly used the oppositions of beauty and life the plant are placed in opposition with the anonymity of the gloved hand the poor puppet hero is condemned despite a lack of political agenda br br what i most remembered was the feeling of oppression in the decor the small room where the action takes place is the character's entire world the invasion by the hand is a complete violation of that world br br beautiful and haunting film i found a copy of this and other wonderful shorts by trnka at the public library and showed it to my own kids a must see
<START> halloween is one of those movies that gets you skin deep it is in my opinion the scariest movie of all time michael myers is the best boogeyman ever he was just so terrifying what makes halloween so special is that there was no special effects where you can tell how computer animated it is this was on a low budget and had a one note score yet managed to scare the hell out of people 25 years and this movie still has the same effect as it did in '78 br br it's about a boy michael myers he kills his sister at the age of 6 and so many years later escapes the mental institution dr sam loomis is after him and will do anything to get him back since he describes michael as pure evil the blackest eyes the devil's eyes michael is on a mission though to kill his other sister laurie played by a new jamie lee curtis she has to babysit on halloween while her friends are out partying and of course we know the rules they get it but laurie may stand a chance since she's the virgin d br br halloween pays many homages to psycho we have another character named sam loomis and jamie lee curis the daughter of janet leigh halloween is an absolute terrific movie that breaks boundaries and makes you lock the doors bolt your windows and turn off the lights they're gonna get you they're gonna get you halloween the ultimate horror film br br 10 10
