<START> vipul shah has done some really impressive work as a filmmaker in the past 'waqt the race against time' and 'namaste london' were entertaining and interesting to watch 'singh is kinng' was fun which he produced his latest outing as a filmmaker 'london dreams' comes up as his careers weakest fare br br 'london dreams' has a mediocre storyline it's about how success turns friendship into hatred agreed it has the potential but when you watch 'london dreams' you wonder what's happening this film has maybe the worst climax in recent times vipul shah the writer puts vipul shah the director down br br the first hour is boring the second hour is better but again the climax is horrendous how can anyone forgive a person who decided to destroy you i won't ajay devgn suddenly decides to go to india and ask forgiveness to his diaper buddy thanks to his uncle om puri when he reaches india rather than slapping or abusing him salman welcomes him with band baja and says he was the reason behind the entire fiasco was vipul shah's intension to show salman's character as a god if yes than you've failed completely the only question i want to ask vipul shah is that would you welcome a person who destroyed you with such a great reception write what you feel don't fool us the audience we are sensible enough to understand what's good or not br br this is a musical but the music by shankar eshaan loy is terrible not a single song stays in your mind br br salman is superb though he carries the film on his shoulders and does really really well in the emotional scenes but again his character is shown as a god which makes him look like a retard in the end ajay is equally good but salman has over shadowed him completely asin is wasted and what is a great talent like om puri doing in this film rannvijay hams though aditya roy kapoor excels brinda parekh is alright as the vamp br br on the whole this dream remains a dream
<START> yeah i saw the rough cuts the unedited sex scenes the dire cut scenes almost on a par with the film 'the need' for awful acting this movie is as bad as bad films get the bad script bad acting bad effects bad locations bad stunts bad everything the best 'actors' in the film were the lap dancers they hired for the vampire extras br br sean harry the 'foppish actor' as someone else put it makes a matchstick look talented here his amazing ability to badly drive a car when it is obviously being shook by people on the bonnet check out the reflection in the windscreen his inability to turn left which is class oh and don't forget the sex scene plus his noteworthy use of a toy gun which the props guys couldn't even be bothered to disguise as a real gun the other actors on screen could barely deliver their lines it was as if half the time they were waiting for a line that wasn't there br br the 'special effects' were soooo good to the point that the guys who did it took their real names off the credits br br if you want a laugh at a party then rent this movie then again there are plenty of good comedies that are just as funny and don't give money to people who don't deserve it
<START> one of the last great musicals of the 60s i was 7 years old the first time i saw this movie and it's always been a favorite since then the musical numbers are all memorable in the 60s the people who were cast in musicals actually had musical talent unlike a certain academy award nominated current musical based in a large midwestern city all of the main roles were beautifully cast ron moody shines as fagin as does shani wallis as nancy oliver reed was a menacing bill sikes who thankfully has no musical numbers lol and mark lester as oliver and jack wild as the dodger were great too mark lester comes across as an innocent waif which was what dickens intended when he wrote the book then of course there are the dozens of dancers who perform in consider yourself i'd do anything who will buy and be back soon many who were children this is a great show for the whole family
<START> in what would be his first screenplay based on his own short story turn about william faulkner delivers a bizarre story of loyalty sacrifice and really strange relationships the story originally was about only the tone young and cooper characters but mgm needed to put joan crawford in another picture to fulfill her contract and faulkner obliged by creating a female role crawford insisted that her lines be written in the same clipped style as her co stars' young and tone leading to much unintentional hilarity as these three communicate in a telegraph like shorthand that sounds like a monty python sketch wuthering heights performed in semaphore seriously the almost entirely pronoun less sentences make ernest hemingway read like henry james br br the film also reflects some familiar faulkner themes with an almost unnaturally close relationship between brother and sister as may be found in his sanctuary and elsewhere when young proposes to crawford in tone's presence in lieu of an engagement ring all three exchange their childhood engraved rings with one another the closeness of tone and young is also noticeable especially as they go off to their thelma louise fate frankly it's creepy br br not as creepy to this new yorker however as the recurring theme of the massive cockroach wellington which crawford cheerfully catches and which is shown gamboling over her hands i had to turn away and young turns into a gladiator blech br br that being said there are some nice performances young is particularly engaging in a scene where he's taken up in cooper's fighter plane and roscoe karns is delightful as cooper's flying buddy tone despite his inability to express himself through realistic dialogue has a nice moment dashing away his own furtive tears over his buddy young's fate crawford stripped of meaningful dialogue as well mostly comes across as either wooden or melodramatic which is quite a balancing act for one role br br the battle scenes not surprisingly for a howard hawks film are the most exciting part of the entire picture but not enough as far as i'm concerned this is 75 minutes of my life i'm never going to get back
<START> first this movie was not that bad it was entertaining at least to me for probably all the wrong reasons i have never seen the original so can't compare the two br br this movie reminded me of that weird christopher reeve movie village of the damned the two movies have different plots but that creepy disgusted feeling and unwanted comedy exist in both br br the wicker man is suppose to be a mystery thriller men please don't anger the women movie i don't know the whole pagan thing and sacrifice was a little off br br nicholas cage his glorious bad self goes to a secluded island called summerisle when he receives a letter in calligraphy from his long lost fiancÃ©e who claims her daughter has been taken and hidden by fellow islanders br br cage is a police officer and being the weary policeman he is he goes to the semi uncharted island leaving no word of his whereabouts to anyone who is located in the real world stupid br br things get weirder when the large amish esquire women who populate the island snarl at him and lie about the whereabouts of the missing girl his fiancÃ©e is no help who seems to be elusive and weary the whole time cage stays on the island when he learns that the missing girl is his daughter and he is the lucky man tricked to come to this island as a sacrificial victim during the islands sick harvest festival br br in this movie males do not fare so well a sick twisted display of feminism br br i found the movie laughable at times particularly when cage punches some women and runs around in a bear suit i think there were too many potholes in this movie i find the whole concept of angry women secluding themselves on an island without any care for males quite entertaining but the way it was portrayed in this movie was just weird while most women have had some jerk hurt and anger them this is clearly a form of sexism i would have turned the movie off in disgust if the roles were reversed this movie is something to watch maybe just once or twice it is not a thriller it should be categorized as just strange
<START> whipped is 82 minutes long this review is 82 words long three unlikable new york lotharios ruthless scammers end up wooing the same woman played by amanda peet with disastrous results that applies to the story and the film too sophomoric to be misogynistic flaccid and ridiculous whipped mixes the philosophies of shock jock tom lykis with penthouse letter fantasies though technically proficient it's dated grating poorly written mean and obvious people don't act like this people don't talk like this really
<START> well i do disagreed with the other comment posted piedras is much much better them magnolia or any of the other films that were mentioned br br specially about non real characters i think that someone just wrote that only because he never lived in the spanish society like i did and i'm not spanish is a very real film with real characters very well done by one of the best spanish actress antonia san juan br br about be a european film in contrast with an american film well we different societies personally i dislike american modern films a lot i like the classics and some of the andy american films but they are very few br br is a film about the continuous constitution of a person liked or not we all make mistakes but some can learn about the mistakes
<START> six different couples six different love stories six different love angles eighty numbers of audience in the movie theater looking at the eighty different parts of the silver screen br br i am sitting in somewhere between them looking at the center of the screen to find out what's going on in the movie all stories have got no link with each other but somewhere down the line nikhil advani trying to show some relation between them i tried to find out a few lines i could write as review but at the end of 3 hours 15 minutes found nothing to write the movie is a poor copy of hollywood blockbuster love actually br br my suggestion don't watch the movie if you really want to watch a nice movie
<START> this might be the poorest example of amateur propaganda ever made the writers and producers should study the german films of the thirties and forties they knew how to sell even soviet style clunky leader as god like father figure were better done disappointing the loss of faith regained in church at last second just in time for daddy to be saved by the hoover god was not too bad unfortunately it seemed rushed and not nearly melodramatic enough a few misty heavenlier shots of the angelical hoover up in the corner of the screen beaming and nodding would have added a lot the best aspect is hoover only saving the deserving family and children who had proven their worth unfortunately other poor homeless were portrayed as likable and even good yet the hoover god doesn't help them a better approach would have been shots of them drinking spirits to show the justice of their condition finally bright and cheerful scenes of recovery after hoover saved the country from the depression should have rolled at the end we could see then how hoover god had saved not just this deserving family but all the truly deserving amateurist at best
<START> i love horses and admire hand drawn animation so i expected nothing short of amazement from dreamworks new animated picture spirit stallion of the cimarron i guess you could say i was a little bit disappointed you have wonderful animation and at first what seems like a perfect story a story about absolutely nothing but a horse in nature the animals don't sing cute songs or even talk a major plus sadly the film has an uncalled for narration by matt damon a sappy soundtrack by bryan adams and enough action scenes to compare it to a jerry bruckheimer production if the film makers would have just stayed with simplicity we'd have a masterpiece here this is not a great film but it is good entertainment for small children i would recommend this film to families because it has its heart in the right place and its the only thing out there right now that isn't offensive to small children not bad but could have been much better very pretty visuals though
<START> the brain or head that wouldn't die is one of the more thoughtful low budget exploitation films of the early 1960s it is very difficult to imagine how a script this repulsively sexist could have been written without the intention of self parody and the themes that are expressed repeatedly by the female lead ginny leith a detached head kept alive by machines i vs and clamps seem to confirm that the film was meant to simultaneously exploit and critique gender stereotypes shades of the under rated boxing helena br br the genderisms are plentiful and about as irritating as an army of angry ants the dialog is hyperbolic over dramatic and unbelievable and the acting is merely ok but not consistent why have i given this film a 4 because some thought clearly went into it i am really not sure what point the film was really trying to make but it seems clear that it strives for an unusually edgy and raw sort of horror without the blood and guts today's audiences expect br br another unique and interesting aspect of the brain is that there really are not any heroes in this film and none of the characters are particularly likable br br all considered this is a fairly painful and disturbing look at early 1960s american pop sexuality from the viewpoint of a woman kept alive despite her missing body after what should have been a fatal car crash her lover is threatening to sew a fresh high quality body onto her and force her to continue living with him she is understandably non plussed by all of this and forced to befriend a creature who is almost as monstrous as her boyfriend oh there are also some vague references to the 1950s 60s clichÃ© about the evils of science run amok br br recommended for b sci fi buffs and graduate students in gender studies o w not recommended
<START> the secret of kells is one of the most unique beautiful and eye popping animated films i have ever seen before watching this film i was convinced that nothing could give up a run for its money and that it was a shoo in to win in this category but i found in kells a serious contender br br the secret of kells tell the story of a young orphan named brendan who lives with his uncle the abbot of kell the abbot is a loving guardian but perhaps a bit too strict and much more concerned with fortifying the wall around the town from a coming attack by vikings than he is at nurturing the boy's imagination when the legendary brother aidan who looks surprisingly like willie nelson shows up and takes the boy under his wing brendan goes on a journey into the woods and meets a lovely forest nymph named aisling who takes a liking to him and saves his life more than once with aisling's help he attempts to save the town and help brother aidan complete the mystical book whichÂlegend has itÂcan turn dark into light br br see my full review of the secret of kells at http theoscarsblog blogspot com 2010 02 movie review secret of kells html
<START> this movie is well done on so many levels that i am in awe that the score is as low as it is 5 9 10 576 votes as of this writing this movie has incredible special effects a true epic storyline complex great character interaction and mind blowing battles they have to be seen to be believed the only complaint i have is the subtitles on the hk dvd version i got some lines were not translated br br i just don't understand when i read hear from various sources it has a confusing plot i couldn't follow the story or characters came from nowhere from the very 1st time i watched this movie i understood it followed it knew why characters were there and i absolutely loved it i've watched it about 8 times already and each time it is pure enjoyment oh and this is not just my opinion because i've shown this movie to many fellow americans people who have never seen an hk film before who feel the same way not one of them failed to follow the storyline and each person declared their love for this movie oh man why can't we have stuff like this coming out of hollywood at least lord of the rings had a nice marriage of special effects character development and storyline br br this is not coming from a asian film lover newbie either i own an extensive library of asian films and i must say that this movie is one of my greatest dvds when you watch it you will be blown away by the amazing special effects and epic feel of this movie you will be drawn into this fantasy world and you won't want to leave i've seen both the 1983 version and the 2001 both done by tsui hark and the 2001 is far better in comparison imo br br besides the subtitles i have one additional complaint about this movie i didn't want it to end i'm begging you mr hark can we please have a sequel
<START> i saw this movie a few months ago on cable and it was fantastic william h macy is one of my favorite actors and his performance was just amazing he makes you care for his character even when he is clearly doing the wrong thing and neve campbell gives a performance that is with out a doubt the best performance i have seen by an actress this year she is fantastic as a wild young woman who is wise beyond her years br br donald sutherland is just plain creepy as macy's father and john ritter is fine as a shrink stuck in the middle of everything that is happening br br i wish that this was in the theater because i feel that it's a movie that should be view by a wider audience that's a shame because it's a hell of allot better that most of the new movies coming into the theater now br br
<START> i was disappointed the film was a bit predictable and did not live up to the hype plastered all over the box having said that the characters were well developed the windego myth was used in a unique premise and the house was pretty spooky but it just missed for me i kept waiting for that big ahhhhh or boo but it never came br br furthermore the movie was plagued with poor filming of poor special effects thus showing to much of a bad thing and not using atmosphere and viewer imagination to create the horror and suspense try movies like session 9 or the cube if your looking for a low budget but well conceived horror movie
<START> even if this film was allegedly a joke in response to critics it's still an awful film if one is going to commit to that sort of thing at least make it a good joke first off jeroen krabbÃ© is i guess the poor man's gerard depardieu naturally i hate gerard depardieu even though he was very funny in the 'iron mask' three musketeer one otherwise to me he is box office poison and jeroen krabbÃ© is worse than that the poor man's box office poison really that is not being fair to the economically disenfranchised if the '4th man' is supposed to be some sort of critique of the bourgeoisie what am i saying it isn't let's just say hypothetically if it was supposed to be it wasn't sharp enough satire is a tricky thing if it isn't sharp enough the viewer becomes the butt of the joke instead i think that is what happened the story just ends up as a bunch of miserable disgusting characters doing nothing that anyone would care about and not in an interesting way either for a more interesting and worthwhile application see any luis bunuel film very sharp satire br br potential spoiler alert br br really the blow job in the cemetery that jeroen krabbÃ©'s character works so so hard to attain do you even care is it funny since mr voerhoven is supposed to be a good film maker i will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume it was some misanthropic joke that got out of control though i'm guessing he didn't cast jeroen krabbÃ© because he's the worst actor and every character he's played has been a pretentious bourgeois ass except he's incompetent at it so it becomes like a weird caricature do you think mr voerhoven did that on purpose and jeroen krabbÃ© is the butt of the joke as well i just don't see it so you understand the dilemma i'm faced with here right it is the worst film ever because he's supposed to be a good director so there is some kind of dupery involved i knew 'patch adams' was horrible without even seeing it do not be duped by 'the 4th man s deceptively alluring packaging or mr voerhoven's reputation as a good director etc etc
<START> i was bored one night and red eye was on and thought why not br br red eye is one of the best movies in a long time br br i mean i just got into the movie cause it was just so brilliant br br the story is new and different br br the movie also has two great leads in the movie with rachel mcadams as lisa reisert and cillian murphy as jackson rippner br br the acting is just brilliant and you get the feel for the people in the movie br br the music is just excellent it give you chills and can also make you feel relax br br i just love how the movie was just so well done and it never gets boring br br red eye is just phenomenal nothing more and nothing less br br it's a excellent thriller br br overall i enjoy red eye so much that i can watch it over and over again br br if you like red eye then i recommend elektra and cry wolf br br i give red eye 9 out of 10 br br great movie
<START> look i'm sorry if half the world takes offense at this but life is confusing enough i don't need to watch it that way i dig anthony hopkins big time i even watched fracture and i knew that would be a steaming pile of quentin but this thing is not well shot and it's not daring even if it is artsy well produced films have reasons for cuts and fast edits not this oh but it's a realistic interpretation excuse this thing'll make your head hurt it's the fastest moving picture ever to take you nowhere at all i still love ah and i'll always give him another chance but if you aren't made of time to watch bad ideas on screen skip this
<START> i expected something different more passion drama again another failed attempt of originality i'm sorry to say that the film falls into the old clichÃ© of 'cheesiness' 15 year old teens may appreciate it though the acting was not very convincing and the lines common lacking any wit still the soundtrack was good and well adapted i can't say that this movie is a total flop because people do watch it but it didn't meet the public's expectations and sunk into mediocrity so to conclude the production keeps you in front of the tv for almost an hour and a half which is an appreciable thing thus i guess its worth seeing if you don't get annoyed
<START> after 16 years tim burton finally disappoints me whatever happened to the old burton who read the dark knight returns by frank miller as research for his preparation to direct batman back in 1988 89 by the looks of it burton didn't research the book nor the movie cause he got everything wrong this movie sucks it's not as good as the original and it doesn't deal with the same subject as the original if you want a good ape movie watch the original br br out of stars
