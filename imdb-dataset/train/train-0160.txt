<START> or maybe that's what it feels like anyway the bat people is about as flat as a rug bland as a sack of flour and as exciting as a rock and as intelligent as all three combined br br okay plot in a nutshell fitting vessel that a doctor moss gets bitten by a bat while checking out a cave with his wife mcandrew and subsequently turns into a bat well not exactly a bat but a bat like creature that looks more like a werewolf who kills his victims in a first person camera viewpoint br br but then there's the business of the sheriff pataki who is about the worst kind of sheriff the hick kind he hassles people he leers at married women he steals handkerchiefs from haberdasheries the fiend he smokes with one of those cigarette holders in his mouth and talks at the same time making him look and sound like buford t justice in smokey and the bandit and this is the worst part he's the most likeable character in the whole film br br the whole film though is just tv movie of the week like crapola guano in this case it's an aip for crying out loud what did you expect oscar caliber stuff br br and what else can you say about a film that not even mst3k can save br br how about no stars for the bat people full version or mst3k version br br by the way if there's ever a sequel for this movie i'm burying my tv

<START> european vacation aka national lampoon's european vacation is the weakest of the vacation films the first and third one the most superior of the films while chevy chase and beverly d'angelo return as clark and ellen griswold with new actors in the roles of russ and audrey griswold this time they are given a weaker script with very bad dialogue this causes the pacing to suffer with the jokes not very funny at all to be more specific what really causes this film to suffer is the fact that the jokes as they are are just pasted together into a cobbled together script rather than serving a central plot as the other 3 vacation films have oh well they can't win them all 4 out of 10
<START> this is one of those movies that you and a bunch of friends sit around drinking beers eating pizza and laugh at unfortunately for me i found myself watching this one alone my friends and i rented a big block of movies and never got around to seeing this one it was due back and i figured that it was a waste not to watch it so i did and i was impressed at how absolutely terrible this movie is br br now i love bad movies quite a bit and i probably would have liked this one if the hero wasn't so utterly loathsome the entire movie i was hoping that he'd put that stupid sword down and let someone kill him he does very little heroic things in the movie he's a beefy disgusting stupid thing he has less redeeming qualities than the villains do and what was it with all the naked chicks i mean i love naked chicks just as much as the next guy but this movie went a tad overboard in that department br br well anyway if you love bad movies and can stand a disgusting hero then i'm sure you'll like this schlock of a film
<START> i caught the last half of this movie on cable one night and was struck by just how morbid it was even when one of the two victims is at his most deteriorated the camera keeps going the lingering shots of his corpse being uncovered and his concentration camp figure being zipped into a body bag are both moving and depressing don't watch this movie if your already depressed then again don't watch it if your feeling really good
<START> this show had a lot of hype but i didn't know about it until the midseason season 1 someone even recommended the show to me but i decided that if i was going to watch it i was going to wait until the end of the season so i could watch it in bulk due to the show's format i'm happy i waited i imagine it would have been fairly annoying have nearly every episode end in the middle of some cliff hanger then have to wait another week to find out what happens in the next second of the story br br somehow this show has managed to throw in too much sex jason will have sex with pretty much anything that moves right after he finds out that one woman he had sex with was killed he's in bed with another woman the next night then tara and sam get it on despite each of them knowing that sam is in love with sookie and for some reason sookie gets mad when she later finds out about it even though she's sleeping with a vampire one of the problems with the show is that it doesn't do a good job of making you care about the characters i really didn't care for jason at all along with his endless pursuit of tale he was rude to the people who actually were concerned for him after a few episodes i wouldn't have minded if he got killed somehow for that reason i was for the most part uninterested in the murders until sookie's grandmother became a victim since the first two were more closely involved with jason br br then once sookie and bill have sex the story gets a few more subplots tara's mother wants an exorcism then the exorcist lady tries to convince tara that she should have one to remove her own demon i wasn't so much bothered by the whole exorcism thing as i know there are some people who really believe in that stuff however they waste little time in showing that is it a farce right after tara spends about 1300 on exorcisms for her and her mother at other points some of the developments happen too fast jason continues being a jerk trying to sell his grandmother's stuff to buy vampire blood which apparently is the new crack or something in his search he finds this girl who will do v vampire blood with him they get high and within three days fall in love with each other and kidnap a vampire for a constant source of v another example is when bill has to go to a vampire tribunal he's only gone for two days before sookie starts to feel abandoned and start to wonder if he thinks vampire politics are more important than her br br subtlety is not this show's strong suit it doesn't take a genius to figure out something is going on with the local dog although my assumption wasn't dead on it wasn't that much of a surprise but the finale two episodes was where it really got annoying as it just shoved all the developments in your face as if you couldn't possibly figure the out for yourself when tara gets into the car accident the naked lady's face with the pig is clearly shown and was easily recognizable when she shows up at the jail for the bailout as if that wasn't enough they later show the lady again with the pig at her house then it's time to wrap up the murder story at the end of the penultimate episode it's revealed that renee is not who he says he is and most likely is the killer in the final episode they shove renee being the killer in your face sookie remarks that it's odd that renee's thoughts don't have an accent i thought that was fine as it adds to renee being a fraud but the next scene is full of incriminating evidence against renee they show that renee has the tape of maudette with the vampire and his fiancÃ©e finds a tape in one of renee's boxes about how to fake a cajun accent at this point it was just ridiculous i mean we get it so blah blah blah stuff happens bill almost kills himself while failing to save sookie who still manages to kill renee they start to set up season 2 by leaving unfinished issues the naked pig lady and sam have a history lafayette has gone missing and might have been killed jason is in the process of being brainwashed into being a religious nut by some anti vampire church which makes me care about him even less br br it's almost surprising to see how many people absolutely love this show i think i just expected this show to be better i'm interested in seeing what happens in season 2 but if i watch it i'll most likely wait for the season completion
<START> an occasionally surrealistic thriller that will push most people's buttons the 4th man is sure to offend anyone with a taste for the politically correct the story's protagonist is a bisexual alcoholic catholic writer gerard krabbe with a seriously twisted sense of imagination verhoeven offers up br br gerard has an example of everything wrong with the modern man he's shiftless delusional unable to control his urges afraid to commit to br br meaningful relationships and utterly apathetic about life in general as the character himself states at one point he is a professional liar unable to recall the truth br br the movie opens with gerard dreaming of spiders consuming christ and then waking to begin the long march to his own destruction he chases off br br one man a boyfriend presumably then chases another at a train station later at a lecture he meets a woman who seems to want to help him or br br perhaps she has more nefarious plans she quickly captures gerard in her web enticing him with sex and money having plenty of both she's also got br br secrets like three dead husbands is she lonely and genuinely looking for someone to nurture or is she a deadly black widow luring gerard to his br br death will garard be the 4th man she kills the woman is christine soutendijk and verhoeven does his best to keep you guessing what she's up to br br this is an interesting movie with a lot of sex and intrigue it's similar to verhoeven's em basic instinct em but has a lot more depth and is certainly more shocking there's a lot of very strong gay content which may make some viewers squirm highly recommended for fans of intelligent br br psychological thrillers or anyone looking for something entirely new
<START> i read nothing but good things about this movie and finally had a chance to watch it late last night and it was everything i expected it to be and more this is the way a proper horror movie should be i think the reason it was so scary was because it was so realistic the spooky sounding score was perfect for setting a dark mood i liked the dramatic opening scene and enjoyed how the rest of the movie played out it was very easy to follow and understand unlike some movies which are way too complicated the special effects were very good i would love to see more horror movies like this one this is easily one of my favorite's a realistic thunder and lightning storm would have set a nice atmosphere for this movie other then that it had all the elements a good horror movie needs i highly recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate a good scary movie that pulls no punches i will be adding it to my collection the dvd has some interesting special features
<START> the vigilante has long held a fascination for audiences inasmuch as it evokes a sense of swift sure justice good triumphs over evil and the bad guy gets his deserts it is in fact one of the things that has made the character of dirty harry callahan as played by clint eastwood so popular he carries a badge and works within the law but at heart harry is a vigilante meting out justice his' way which often puts him in conflict with his own superiors as well as the criminals he's pursuing but it's what draws the audience anyone who's ever been bogged down in bureaucratic nonsense of one kind or another delights in seeing someone cut through the red tape and get on with it even if it's only on the screen and that satisfaction derived from seeing justice done and quickly is one of the elements that makes sudden impact ' directed by and starring eastwood so successful in this one the fourth of the series while working a homicide harry encounters a bona fide vigilante at work an individual whose brand of justice parallels his own with one exception whoever it is he's definitely not carrying a badge br br in his own inimitable way inspector callahan has once again ended up on the bad side of the department and is ordered to take some vacation time so he does as only dirty harry' can in a small town north of san francisco harry finds himself smack dab in the middle of a homicide case which he quickly links to a recent murder in san francisco because of the unique m o employed by the perpetrator unaccountably harry encounters resistance from the local police chief jannings pat hingle who advises him to take his big city tactics and methods elsewhere not one to be deterred however harry continues his investigation which ultimately involves a beautiful and talented young artist jennifer spencer sondra locke gradually harry discovers a link between the victims the burning question though is where does jennifer spencer fit into the picture br br eastwood is in top form here both in front of and behind the camera and it is arguably the second best of the five film series right behind the original dirty harry ' it had been seven years since the last harry' offering the enforcer ' 1976 but eastwood steps right back into the character with facility and renewed vigor and this one definitely benefits from having him in the director's chair as he is able to recapture the essence of not only his own character but that spirit' that made these films so successful and he does it by knowing the territory and establishing a continuity that all but erases that seven year gap between s 3 and 4 as with all the films he directs eastwood sets a deliberate pace that works perfectly for this material and creates just enough tension to keep it interesting and involving from beginning to end br br the screenplay by joseph stinson is well written and formulated to that distinctive dirty harry' style the dialogue is snappy and the story itself conceived by charles b pierce and earl e smith is the most engaging since the original dirty harry ' as it successfully endeavors to play upon the very personal aspects of the drama rather than entirely upon the action the characters are well drawn and convincing and of course this is the film that gave us one of harry's best catch phrases go ahead make my day ' br br as harry clint eastwood perfectly embodies all of the elements that make this character so popular he lives by a personal moral code a true individual made of the kind of stuff we envision as that of the pioneers who settled this country and made america what it is today harry personifies that sense of freedom and justice we all strive for and hold so dear possibly more so today than ever before no matter who we are or where we come from there's undeniably a part of us that wants to be harry or at least have him around dirty harry' is an icon of the cinema and it's impossible to envision anyone but eastwood portraying him for better or worse eastwood is' dirty harry without question just as sean connery is james bond and basil rathbone sherlock holmes br br sondra locke is entirely effective here in the role of jennifer spencer a young woman wronged and out for vengeance or as she sees it justice ' she manages to bring a hard edged determination laced with vulnerability to her character with a convincing introspective approach that is far beyond what is typical of the action' genre even amid the violence locke keeps her focus on jennifer and the traumatic events that have brought her to this stage of her life her portrayal makes a perfect complement to eastwood's harry and becomes in philosophy and deed something of his counterpart br br in supporting roles two performances stand out paul drake as mick creates the best psycho' since andy robinson's dynamic portrayal of the serial killer in the original dirty harry ' with actually very limited screen time drake establishes a genuinely disconcerting presence that is believable and convincing which adds much to the purely visceral response of the audience this is the guy you can't wait to see harry take care of in the end also effective is audrie j neenan who makes her character ray parkins the epitome of the proverbial low life ' who can be found in any bar in any city it's a performance that evokes a gut level response and it adds greatly to the credibility of the film in that it helps provide that necessary sense of realism br br the supporting cast includes albert popwell horace mark kevloun bennett and nancy parsons mrs kruger with a perfect blend of drama and action sudden impact' dispenses justice that is a fulfilling respite from reality the perfect justice of a not so perfect world that makes for a satisfying cinematic experience 9 10
<START> 'panic in the streets 1950 ' owes more to british noir that its american counterparts like reed's 'the third man 1949 ' and dassin's 'night and the city 1950 ' director elia kazan chose to film largely on location capturing the fresh and vibrant decadence of the new orleans slums in a decision borrowed from the masters of italian neorealism he also hired many non professional actors for minor roles lending an air of authenticity to the cityscape however any further comparisons with neorealism would be misguided for 'panic in the streets' is pure melodrama of the best kind a murdered illegal immigrant fished out of the bay is found to be infected with pneumonic plague a deadly air borne mutation of bubonic plague which is transmitted from human to human and untreated has a mortality rate that approaches 100 clinton reed richard widmark an officer with the u s public health service convinces the doubtful police chief paul douglas to undertake a city wide manhunt for the men responsible for the homicide lest they also be infected with the illness br br in my younger years i found wolfgang petersen's 'outbreak 1995 ' to be among the most horrifying movies i'd ever seen that thriller which owes plenty to 'panic in the streets' working title outbreak terrified me so efficiently because it depicted the ebola virus as both an invisible and invincible killer Â how does one defend themselves against such a thing kazan's film is the first that i know of to approach the subject of biological epidemics though it has difficulty ascribing visual recognition to an enemy that is basically undetectable to the human eye it instead uses jack palance as a human personification of the plague despite his venturing out among the filthy dregs of human society you never get the sense that clinton reed is placing his own life at risk some viewers have noted that reed never inoculated himself against the plague though i think it's safe to assume that he did so at the same time as the morgue staff nevertheless there's still a strong sense of urgency in the hunt for the infected man's killers underground street rats who pollute the sewers with their misdeeds br br in medieval times when the black death now widely believed to have been bubonic plague swept across the civilised world killing a third of europe's population many identified the destruction as being the work of the devil jack palance's character blackie serves effectively as satan in human form the angular jawed thug can occasionally be charming and charismatic but is always liable to explode into fits of violence his two hoodlums played by guy thomajan and zero mostel through terror more than anything else are constantly grovelling at his feet when one lackey falls ill with fever blackie deduces that the man's immigrant cousin must have brought something in with him the irony of his conclusion not passing unnoticed and so attempts to ascertain what this presumably valuable object must be he cradles the dying poldi in his arms a grotesque display of faux affection that is both pathetic and unsettling blackie satan is finally stopped Â not by the authorities but by the burden of his own infection evil Â as he attempts to board a cargo ship the primary vessel by which the plague spread across europe
<START> i love alec guinness and that's saying a lot after this film actually he is not bad in it he just seems to stand aside be urbane and his usual delightful self but invest nada it is obvious the girl he is matched with is a featherweight even as an inexperienced young french girl sir alec wouldn't have chosen her when he was young and very obviously isn't too happy about it now br br the interesting character is the brooding brother of the odd suzanne another twit donald aspires to be a french heathcliffe and i waited in vain for the source of his mystery what deep dark secret was he hiding behind that forehead was he in love with the father's mistress why did he jerk suzanne's hair when she plotted to bring the disparate parts of this turkey together on the country estate or perhaps he had simply had enough of her obnoxious acting br br the film would have been charming with guiness and the older woman reminiscing and seeing paris together that would have been a great story two lovely experienced people in a beautiful city after the destruction of world war ii why didn't somebody come up with that i suggest watching alec guiness in the card a little known but worthwhile film
<START> a great ensemble cast a fond remembrance of younger carefree days this movie takes me back to when i went to summer camp indian summer while full of practical jokes and pranks is about growing up and coming to terms with life with middle age life my family i thoroughly enjoyed this movie
<START> the title got my attention and then i wondered what will come out in the plot as we have seen so many super people movies these years and in fact i really liked it as there were a number of unusual funny scenes that i didn't expect uma thurman performed as average in g girl's role surprisingly i was again able to watch her toes in wide screen like in the beginning of kill bill luke wilson however played very well the idiot everyday guy who meets the big woman i could really get into his situation if you want a light touch of fun you should definitely watch g girl's and average matt's adventures especially to cheer up your partner 7 10 in my collection
<START> poor basil rathbone an egotistical composer who's lost his muse he's been faking it for some time buying his lyrics and his music from various sources trouble is that two of the sources bing crosby music and mary martin words happen to meet and fall in love and then they discover what they've been doing complications ensue but all is righted at the end br br crosby and martin sing terrifically mary had signed a paramount contract and also at the same time doubled as a regular on crosby's kraft music hall radio show for reasons i don't understand movie audiences didn't take to her so she went back to broadway and did one touch of venus in 1944 and stayed there br br basil rathbone in one of the few times he played comedy does it very well his ego is constantly being deflated by sidekick oscar levant and again i'm surprised they didn't do more films together br br as in most of crosby's paramount vehicles no big production numbers but i agree with the previous reviewer about the title tune being done as an impromptu jam session in a pawn shop good job by all br br a surprisingly original plot and great entertainment
<START> the movie never becomes intolerable to watch and to tell it straight it has nothing to show either except maybe part sexy alicia silverstone in a nerdy non sexy character in revealing quite sexy dresses the story is very easy to follow or there's nothing to follow you can see in either way there is no suspense little action unimpressive dialogs unsatisfactory sensuality same boring locations and very bland acting kevin dillon is totally worthless silverstone well i didn't concentrate too much on her acting i confess yet as i said earlier if one has nothing to do except watching a movie this won't look so bad 4 10
<START> after seeing driven on a plane flight to america 3 years ago i truly believed i had seen the worst film ever created and i could relax safe in the knowledge i would never have to suffer that much in front of a screen ever again unfortunately as i found out last night this was not the case revolver is so monstrously bad i am actually thinking about recommending friends to go and see it just so i don't feel like i'm the only one stupid enough for being conned into watching this its really quite amazing how much this film falls completely on its face with the constant and i mean constant voice overs of the main characters with totally inane pretentious nonsense i was actually getting angry in the cinema listening to andre benjamin's utterly relentless droning for what seemed like half the film whilst all the time thinking what would turkish have done to this complete joke of gangster con man whatever he's supposed to be when he made his offer i'll tell you what he would have told him to f k off blown his head away and watch with utter disdain as his equally inept partner waddles away as fast as his chubby little legs would carry him i mean what are we supposed to believe is going through jake's head when they offer him their solution to his problem they're con men therefore they must obviously also have the skill to cure incurable blood diseases i mean ffs doesn't he start to wonder why his symptoms aren't getting worse doesn't the penny drop on the third day what is happening instead of richie subjecting the audience to a painfully patronising phone call from avi to jake to let him know he's been conned br br anyway i can add a small positive note to the film by moving on to the dry humour if provides thankfully of a similar standard to his previous filmsÂÂ bulls t this film doesn't try anything as smart as redeeming itself through some well timed amusing lines oh no it somehow managed to be so disastrously unfunny i genuinely didn't hear so much as a titter from a completely packed cinema Â and anyone who knows the ugc in sheffield knows how full a main screen can get and not 1 person so much as smiled maybe he never wanted the film to be funny and fair enough you can still make good gangster films without comedy but what was he planning on hanging this film on may i ask the unnecessarily baffling plot i sincerely hope not br br by far the most satisfying moment i went through last night was hearing the very loud sighing coming from all directions of the audience as everyone desperately prayed for the film to end it was also really quite amusing watching just how fast patrons were fighting and dashing for the exits after they realised it was over and they were free from their torment br br i'll round this off i've got to finish writing this is making me angry again by elaborating on the end i mean sh t the endingÂ no sorry i can't your just going to have to go and see it it can't be put in words it just can't and after you've seen it you'll know why uuhhhhh Â shudders Â
<START> sugar spice is one of the worst movies of 2001 the film tries to cross heathers and bring it on and fails when i saw last january i was so disgusted by the film that i walked and talked on my cell phone to my girlfriend for the last half hour of the movie i've heard that the dvd has a director's cut maybe i'll check it out but this pg 13 trash movie is s and the worst kind of s maybe if the film had some t a that would've have made it okay but the gags are lame and the acting is horrible worse than a troma film
