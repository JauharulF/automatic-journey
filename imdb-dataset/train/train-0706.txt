<START> it used to be my thinking that movies required plots or some other means of making you care at all about the story line or anything that is going on this movie has showed me that you don't actually have to have anything like that br br i could sum it up simply as that but imdb wants me to have more lines it was kind of pretty not compelling in the slightest the way the characters talk in the movie makes you think it should have taken place over a matter of days but there is no passage of time and i'm pretty sure it all happens in an hour br br if you are looking to entertain yourself then buy a gallon of milk and see how fast you can drink it before throwing up it would be a far better use of your time time that you will never get back jurassic park 3 was pulled off better than this movie
<START> a very well made film set in early '60s communist yugoslavia the five young actors who are the teenagers at the center of the story give strong sincere and emotionally deep performances a clear depiction of how the natural trust and naivete inherent in teens can be easily manipulated and how that impacted the rest of their lives highly recommended
<START> i was surprised at just how much i enjoyed this most thoughtfully delivered drama which owing to its rather unimpressive 6 6 rating i nearly missed as i rarely give the time of day to any movie rated below 7 10 having said that i'm so glad i gave stone angel the viewing it so very much deserved and so should you if you are one of the increasingly rare sensitive soulful and thoughtful sorts of person left on this earth in living form br br i must say that in many ways though not all viz its themes execution style production etc stone angel very much reminded me of the much praised the notebook i am so surprised that other commentators didn't pick up on the many similarities which repeatedly struck me throughout this movie so i can only assume that those who've written comments have yet to see the notebook they may not share any alzheimer's theme yet i can confidently say that if you very much enjoyed the notebook you will certainly find much to engage your time most fruitfully with the stone angel but even if you've not seen the notebook nor read the book on which this move is based which incidentally i haven't either you should definitely find much to hold your attention firmly as long as your favourite genres don't include fast paced action thrillers this is a movie for thinkers and those who like to reminisce about time's passing how life changes as the years pass and what might have happened in one's life as one gazes back through the years br br this bizarrely underrated yet great movie really deserves a rating of approximately 8 10 i can only blame its current lowish rating of 6 6 10 on the 11 of idiots who gave it 1 10 after all it has attracted less than 300 votes at the time of my writing this comment nonetheless if those 11 who gave it the lowest ranking possible were really expecting car chases and explosions why didn't they look for even a few seconds at the movie's premise and promotional lines oh dear whatever the world is coming to don't miss this most underrated gem of a movie but only if you have a brain i e your top ten doesn't include transformers fight club nor the terminator
<START> i was subjected to this atrocity by my wife tried to turn it off after 10 minutes but was forced through the whole thing this must be hands down the most gruesome pretense of a movie ever br br there were great script moments such as br br sammy if she gets over here right away she gets a bonus madam a boner sammy no a bonus br br to summarize horrible script terrible acting and incredibly illogical
<START> stephen j cannell apparently decided a few years ago that he would broaden his horizons and dabble in horror the result dead above ground is an abysmal piece of junk now had i noticed his name in association with this particular film i'd have put it back but no i didn't have my glasses on and therefore i missed it damn i really do need to bring those with me while video shopping first question would be who the heck is the target audience for this it's almost like a scary kids movie but then again there's topless babes and some gore and some bad words spouted here and there the main characters are so cute that you want to see someone anyone go after them with farm implements of some kind seems that a guy opens a bed and breakfast that has a checkered past a child murdering witch that collected children's teeth lived there probably something the real estate agent failed to mention of course now in the modern day there's a little girls ghost around to warn the real live little girl that now lives there that something bad is going to happen it does and there's also two bubbas that were squatting on that property when the new owner took over so they're out for revenge too this whole thing has the feel of some made for cable junk that's for the kids at halloween except for of course the things that aren't suitable for little kids so not only is this mediocre it's confused too a big boo and hiss to anchor bay for putting this out too considering their usual track record with fine releases this is a new low the uk gets a phantasm box set we get the tooth fairy hardly seems fair 1 out of 10 absolute garbage
<START> snuggle down in your favourite chair and switch on the play station as you toss this into the waste disposal unit spend a useful 90 min living your favourite game disjointed poorly filmed non directed junk it takes a bits from several other science fiction movies and badly attempts to join the parts into a pathetically weak story there's nothing new here the filmmakers do not seem to realise that providing simple entertainment would achieve a monetary game but a touch of skill ingenuity and flair is required to turn it into a good film any money spent watching this is a waste and personally i would like my 90 min of life back
<START> in a nutshell this is a cookie cutter romantic comedy that really wants and tries to be something more it wants to be harold and maude annie hall the graduate it wants to be deep and human it has interesting camera shots lighting music editing all of which give it the feel of an important movie the dialog is smart at times there are some laugh out loud moments br br but here's what keeps it from ultimately being anything more than a formulaic late night cable in flight time killer br br 1 david schwimmer how many times can joe sad sack puppy dog stare blankly into space with his jaw hanging open before it starts to get annoying maybe some drool would have helped br br 2 gwenneth paltrow she's really flat here and not just in the chest her role is supposed to be this lively nice caring girl who just keeps getting herself into wrong situations is very confused as a result and that is why a sad sack loser like schwimmer has any chance with her but gwenneth plays her very dull combine this with puppy dog drool face above and you have very little chemistry to care about br br i kept picturing someone else in this role kate hudson for example br br 3 the script and the plot the stuff that happens just basically doesn't ring true all the problems get wrapped up in the end with such a neat and tidy bow on top that it seems like a whistle blew and the script writers just said oops time to wrap it up got a train to catch so they pulled out the hollywood formula book checked off all the boxes and went home
<START> jimmy dean could not have been more hammy or absurdly loutish hysterical if viewed through the eyes of mystery science theatre 3000 which i rate as a 10 i mean the sight of this obese corn fed hog trouncing around malta should be enough to send you to the vomitory if you make it that far into the film this ugly hysterical farce should be placed with the likes of booty call pumpkinhead swarm and the smurfs go to bangladesh a gulp film like this proves that sometimes actors writers producers etc get behind on their mortgage or get stoned to the point of insanity it begs the question who was so stupid to finance such a whale but then had good judgment prevailed and final justice never was then we wouldn't have the delightful spoof voice over in mystery science theatre 3000
<START> this film was a big disappointment br br i take the opposite view of the critics this is not a case of the material not being up to the level of the actors here the actors bette davis and james cagney are simply not up to the level of the material clark gable and claudette colbert were every bit as big as davis and cagney and look how it happened one night turned out an all time classic with a very similar story davis proves that she has no talent for comedy good thing for her that this is just about the only comedy she ever attempted davis' one note performance oozes petulance but none of the nuances of colbert's acting in it happened one night cagney who was a great comedy actor just seems out of sync with his costar davis the script provides some decent lines and gags but the delivery seems better suited to drama than comedy br br part of the problem is the soundtrack which like the delivery of davis and cagney seems more suitable to a light drama than a comedy br br jack carson who played similar roles throughout his career has more capably handled very similar material in a fairly typical supporting role eugene palette delivers a respectable performance in a slightly different role as an old west relic harry davenport is very good but in one of his poorest performances william frawley is quite irritating his character's constant references to fictional cops are a poor effort at irony br br i really love every one of these performers and it is a shame that as an ensemble they achieve no more chemistry and no better result than the bride came c o d
<START> many people know how it feels when a loved one is lost the feelings of pain grief and sorrow can be unbearable however sometimes it is the memories they leave behind that trigger the saddest emotions this theme is superbly portrayed in the short film 'tulip' directed by the award winning australian actress rachel griffths described as a movie 'as much about memories as it is about love' a string of sensitivity and sentimentality is expertly threaded into this triumphant 15 minute film br br 'tulip' is a beautifully wrought touching and heart warming story of a man's journey in coming to terms with the loss of his wife through the relationship he shares with a very special animal 'tulip' the film opens with a rising dawn the chirping of birds and a vast landscape introducing the sense of rustic harmony present throughout the film a soft music plays marking the entrance of ruth jean bain she wears a flowered dress and apron with a sun hat on her head she gently pets tulip caressing her ears and patting her back the furnishing of the house is impressive and the attention to detail is creditable a vase of tulips can be seen on the bench reflecting the peaceful rural community will charles 'bud' tingwell greets ruth as she is spooning the milk from the bucket they pour the milk and coffee together a sign of companionship and teamwork not a word is said but it is obvious that their relationship is close and affectionate they paint a perfect picture of happiness br br sadly happiness doesn't last forever the tragic passing of ruth affects will deeply an effective scene of fading cars highlights will's isolation and vulnerability at the end of the day of the funeral soon he sinks into depression and becomes oblivious to his surroundings when everything seems hopeless and lost at will's moment of despair tulip becomes the symbol of ruth the genuine connection will has with his late wife it was through tulip that will learns to cope with the absence of ruth and overcome the heartrending feelings of loneliness br br each of the characters is realistically and solidly portrayed especially the part of will charles 'bud' tingwell brings the character to life through personal investment the recent loss of his own wife audrey tingwell is effectively reflected in his acting every sag of his shoulder and every frown on his brow make the viewer empathize strongly with the character the character of ruth is wonderfully carried out by jean bain although ruth does not say a single word throughout the movie her sweet personality and loving relationship with will are obvious lois ramsey and kati edwards give delightful performances in supporting roles as the friendly margaret and mary they also add a subtle humor to the bittersweet story br br an anecdote from griffths' childhood the story of loss and discovery is remarkably captured in 'tulip' beautifully shot and superbly acted this film will surely make you misty eyed triumphant or feel like drinking a cup of milk
<START> creepy lascivious wolf the young red is wearing full make up and extremely short shorts robe got about 20 minutes through and realized it could be a pedophile's dream come true the up beat music sounds a lot like something i'd hear at a strip club i actually think this movie is a sick joke it's not a family movie gross glad i was watching this with my daughter i don't want her to think it's normal for families to view quasi kiddie porn together very bad very sad it's sold as a family film joey fatone will probably be embarrassed he was in it and what's with advertising it as a special effects spectacular the effects do look low budget gawd awful
<START> this film stars among others slapchop vince offer who also wrote edited and directed and joey buttafuoco not exactly names that scream out quality and with such uplifting skits as supermodels taking a dump it's exactly what it sounds like a guy who robs a sperm bank the rhymer necrophilia with a rotting corpse black market fetuses featuring a guy scooping what are supposed to be them out of a jar lots and lots of gay jokes a skit about a giant phallus who is a superhero and forced abortions the skits are painfully unfunny such as batman and rhymer the acting not good enough to be considered amateurish and the film is crude just for the sake of being crude and stupid i truly believe a group of 8 year olds could have easily made a funnier film with the same budget br br apparently this film resulted in a lawsuit by slap shot vince against the scientologists frankly i wouldn't know who to root for in this case apparently he alleged that somehow scientologists destroyed his reputation and sank this film no matter that the film is repellent junk from start to finish and 99 unfunny by comparison ebola is funnier and these are the nicest things i can say about the movie br br by the way that is bobby lee from mad tv wearing a diaper and participating in the dumb fake porno film it's amazing his career could overcome this
<START> the matrix' was an exciting summer blockbuster that was visually fantastic but also curiously thought provoking in its twilight zone' ish manner the general rule applies here and this sequel doesn't match up to its predecessor worse than that it doesn't even compare with it br br reloaded' explodes onto the screen in the most un professional fashion in the opening few seconds the first impression is a generally good one as trinity is shot in a dream immediately after that the film nose dives after a disastrous first 45 minutes it gradually gains momentum when they enter the matrix and the agent smith battle takes place but it loses itself all speed when it reaches the 14 minute car chase sequence and gets even worse at the big groan worthy twist at the end worst of all is the overlong zion rave' scene not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with the plot but it's also a pathetic excuse for porn and depressive dance music br br the bullet time aspect of the matrix' was a good addition but in 'reloaded' they overuse to make it seem boring in the first one there were interesting plot turns but here it is too linear to be remotely interesting the movie is basically just a series of stylish diversions that prevent us from realising just how empty it really is it works on the incorrect principle that bigger is better it appears that the matrix' franchise has quickly descended into the special effects drenched misfire that other franchises such as the star wars' saga have br br the acting standard is poor for the most part the best character of course goes to hugo weaving's agent smith' the only one to be slightly interesting keanu reeves is the definitive neo but in all the special effects there is little room to make much of an impact academy award nominee laurence fishburne is reduced to a monotonous mentor with poor dialogue carrie ann moss' part as the action chick could have been done much better by any other actress br br a poor thrown together movie the matrix reloaded' is a disappointment those who didn't like the first one are unlikely to flock to it this one's for die hard fans only even in the movie's own sub genre of special effect bonanzas minority report the matrix etc this is still rather poor my imdb rating 4 5 10
<START> i thought that baseketball was one of the most funniest films i have ever seen it's witty humour made me giggle all the way through and the fact that trey and matt are so over the top boosts the film's comedy br br i have just bought baseketball on dvd and its just one of those movies where you would never get tired of watching it i have a very short attention span and i think this film has so any funny bits that it keeps me entertained throughout the humorous quotes are memorable and can make me laugh for hours if i remember them later br br so overall i think that baseketball is brilliant movie which everyone should go see especially if you're younger like me as it will keep you laughing for a long time afterwards br br p s does anybody think its weird for me to like them both hehe
<START> there are exactly 2 good things to be said about fantasies both mentioned by a previous reviewer as well br br a bo derek's extraordinary poetry inspiring beauty she has shots in this movie where she gives even catherine zeta jones a run for her money and that's a high compliment indeed her nudity is brief and discreet but just looking at her face is enough br br b the greek island setting with its sun and crystal clear blue waters br br other than that there is no story the dialogue is abysmal and at times unintentionally funny he touched you where you're a woman and peter hooten's character is a slimy jerk bo overplays the naivete of her character but then again when you have to work with dialogue this bad it's unfair to blame the actors the fact that she kept saying the name damir in almost every sentence is a major irritation oh and although the film is set on a greek island there is hardly a greek word to be heard apparently everyone there from kids to old people speaks english the whole time
<START> the hip hop rendition of a mos def performance according to the film's musical credits it is an incredible piece of savage consciousness that slams the violence in your heart with each snap if anyone can tell me someplace this song live wire snap by mos def from the ground truth an undeniable duty to see as the americans who might not support the mission but embrace each soul caught inside this savage miscalculation of purpose they take on the haunting as so many of us can sit back and be angry br br live wire snap by mos def where can it be found br br desperate to find it br br medically unable to serve
<START> hellborn starts as a young psychiatric doctor named james bishop matt stasi takes up his residency at st andrews insane asylum or 'mental illness facility' as they like to call it there with nearly 600 patients bishop meets his boss dr mccort bruce payne is put to work he gets ward 'a' where some seriously deranged dangerous patients are held if that wasn't bad enough during his first round of visits bishop finds a dead body has threatening sounding graffiti messages sprayed over his room bishop starts to hear stories from the patients about sinister goings on at the asylum soon finds out for himself the stories have more than a hint of truth about them br br known as asylum of the damned in the us this supernatural horror film was directed by philip j jones i sort of liked it but in the end there were too many unsatisfying elements for me to totally enjoy it the script by matt mccombs takes itself pretty seriously i quite liked the basic idea behind some of it's ideas but there are a few things which work against it for a start the film is just too slow the story is pretty good doesn't give itself away too early but it takes an absolute age for it to get going i was rapidly losing interest with each passing minute i also thought the so called twist ending was far too predictable the ending itself far too bland forgettable it's a shame because i liked the story the character's the setting some of the ideas but it's simply too slow frankly dull to keep one entertained over it's 90 minute duration it's one of those films which i would like to recommend but in all honesty i can't br br director jones does a good job this is actually a well lit quite atmospheric film i wouldn't say there's anything scary here i'm not sure if hellborn was shot in a real insane asylum but if it wasn't they did a great job on the sets the film looks pretty good overall unfortunately there is a real lack of gore or action there are two hand print shaped wounds a severed tongue that's it absolutely nothing else in terms of blood or gore which has to go down as a disappointment depending on who you believe which review you read the special effects are either the worst ever or very good well as a devoted watcher of low budget horror i was very impressed with the effects especially the demon thing which looks mightily impressive is a man in a suit type effect rather than a terrible cgi computer graphic although it's an impressive suit it all depends on your expectations i suppose br br technically the film is good it looks nice enough the lack of cgi computer effects is something i welcome the acting isn't great though it certainly could have been better br br hellborn is a film that disappointed me there were some good stuff about it but at the same time some terrible stuff which unfortunately outweighs the good i sort of liked parts of it but as a whole 90 minute viewing experience i'd find it totally impossible to recommend to anyone
<START> second part actually episode 4 8 of the hit danish tv series is slightly inferior to the first one but has plenty of laughs and scares as well this time udo kier plays two parts as the monster baby and his demon like father other standout parts this time are sÃ¸ren pilmarkÂ´s doctor krogshoj who must face the horrible revenge of dr helmer and once again patient mrs drusse tries to solve the mysteries miss marple style ends on a cliffhanger and following the deaths of lead actors ernst hugo jÃ¤regÃ¥rd dr helmer and kirsten rolffes mrs drusse you wonder how theyÂ´re ever going to be able making part iii but i hope von trier will give it a shot sadly morten rotne leffers the downÂ´s syndrome dishwasher 2 died shortly after as well look for stellan skarsgÃ¥rd in a cameo
<START> perhaps one of the most important and enjoyable greek films i've seen in the last ten years excellent performances especially yiannis zouganelis is great well written script and effective direction from a very special for the greek very average standards auteur a film obviously influenced by sam peckinpah's straw dogs that could be a masterpiece if it avoided some evident and exaggerative situations and symbolizations in the end nevertheless this is a movie which deserves our attention and belongs to that rare category of greek movies which should be watched outside greece it's a shame that in greece didn't work commercially in addition with other fake and cursory big productions like politiki kouzina
<START> marvin rob schneider does not have the ingredients to be a cop which is his lifelong dream but his luck changes when he has a car crush a very bad one and is found by a doctor the doctor has to use animal organs to rebuild him after this moment he starts to have wild behaviours unconsciously and becomes a best cop one could ever be by the time he realises the changes and his animal instincts starts to take over his human side in the mean time he finds a lovely girl and try to be a perfect gentleman that means he has to control himself and behave civilised i am not a big fun of rob schneider in fact this is the his first film i have seen however i can easily say that he is the best person to play the loser see his part in ally mcbeal quite funny actually there are some good parts in the movie such as his flirting with the goat in such movies the biggest problem is that the script is seems to make the viewer feel less intelligent i am sure this movie is okay to watch as long as it is not taken too seriously but very sad to see such films doing very good in the box office the animal is not the worst film i have seen to date but fails to get more than
