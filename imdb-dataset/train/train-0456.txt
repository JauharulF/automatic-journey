<START> i had the pleasure of viewing this beautiful film last night with the wonderful addition of a question and answer session with the director following the viewing i suspect that the first commenter has never lost a parent or someone very close to them in death i have had many such losses and this movie spoke to me one of the major themes is how we don't deal with questions issues stories with our loved ones until it's too late they're too incapacitated or dead before that happens talk to your loved ones listen to and record their stories tell people you love them resolve differences i loved the message that there are no mistakes i love the director's portrayal of the relationship of the two daughters as one of six siblings it's clear to me he understood how complex those relationships are his history as a cinematographer also comes through loud and clear what a beautiful movie the casting is outstanding a film not to be missed
<START> it's always nice to see angela bassett getting to do a role that she can really sink her teeth into she is at times intense funny and even sexy in her role as lena a colored woman forced to make a home on a desolate mudbank just outside of cape town south africa danny glover is also good in a not entirely sympathetic role as her partner boesman willie jonah gives a finely nuanced performance as the stranger that discovers boesman and lena's new living area it's not often that you get a chance to see an intelligent film dealing with mature themes although it is based on a play the late director john berry who also directed claudine opens the material up by having the film shot in the widescreen cinemascope format he also keeps things visually interesting through the creative blocking of actors and by showing us things only mentioned in the play just like diahann carroll in claudine john berry may have directed angela bassett into an academy award nomination this is definitely a film worth searching for
<START> i've spent years looking for a copy of this film 16mm dvd vhs so i could show it to my kids the movie is funny and spike and the members of his band show why they were the best musicians in the business they had to be that good to play that demented i like it and recommend it for movie lovers of all ages br br the movie is about a turn of the century firehouse with a crew of misfits that are firemen and the department band when not fighting the fires there's the usual running gags plus the mayhem of spike jones and his orchestra also comedy relief provided by comedian buddy hackett and straight man hugh o'brien
<START> this movie proves that good acting comes from good direction and this does not happen in ask the dust colin farrell is usually a fine actor but in this he is juvenile donald sutherland comes across as an amateur why because the script is awful the adaptation is awful and the actors seem bored and half hearted the atmosphere of the movie is bad i could only think when it would finish and i turned it off half way the director has done a very poor job and even though i have not read the novel it is certainly a missed chance the atmosphere this film is trying to evoke and the message and storyline never reaches the audience in one word it is a terrible film
<START> this was a great movie but it had the worst ending i think i have ever seen the actors were great and displayed wonderful talent the entire story was twisted and unexpecting which is what made it entertaining as good as the movie was the entire film is judged by the ending which was terrible maybe a sequel could eliminate this bad ending
<START> 102 dalmatians 2000 dir kevin lima br br believed to be cured cruella de vil close is released from prison and sets out to make a new start in life things are going well for cruella who is busy helping homeless dogs off the street when the clock strikes on big ben things turn bad the hypnotic cure is reversed and cruella is back and this time she is determined to make that spotted coat she always wanted br br glenn close reprises her role as cruella de vil and once again is the highlight of the film every scene with her in is worth watching in this dull sequel which feels more of a repeat of the previous film rather than a new story br br she's changed Â ken sheperd ioan gruffudd
<START> rarely do i see a film that i am totally engrossed with this was one of them it had good acting dialogue plot and the scenery was beautiful i laughed out loud many times especially the scene dealing with the kitchen raid the slapstick comedy performed by the lunkhead hired hand had me one the floor but i admit that i am a sucker for slapstick the story dealt with a group of people in their 30's coming back to a summer camp that they had attended 20 years previously it was a farewell week of camping as the place would be closed down permanently at the end of the season as adults the camp looked different and they felt differently about it and each other i recommend this funny moving movie to all br br
<START> i know that in this episode there's other stuff apart from what i am going to discuss and in fact i think it has some virtues for example the fact after we had been given a very negative opinion of jin from seeing sun's flashbacks in house of the rising sun we get to see jin's side of things and get a new more balanced understanding of his life br br but there is an element in this story that made me so deeply uncomfortable that it greatly dampened my enjoyment of the whole episode before now in the scene where jin appeared with blood on his hands and shirt it had been hinted that sun's father was someone who was getting rich through shady illegal methods i thought maybe he was a mob boss even mobs operate in korea just like in almost every other country in the world so it was a reasonable possibility however in this episode we learn that sun's father is in fact the boss or a top executive of a korean automotive company and that what jin had been doing was physically attacking a government official who was actually going to be murdered on his behalf br br i may be especially touchy about this because i happen to work in the automotive industry but i would say it is spectacularly offensive and racist to even suggest that this kind of thing goes on in korea that huge serious companies like hyundai or kia which must be the model for this fictitious car company as they are the only ones that actually exist in reality operate with these mafia like methods instead of like any normal automotive company of the west it is just unbelievable to me that the writers would have the gall to write something like that into the story and that there hasn't been an uproar in korea over it it feels like extraneous buy american propaganda portraying foreign car companies as criminal untrustworthy third world outfits
<START> cassidy kacia brady puts a gun in her mouth blowing the back of her head out on boyfriend neal jason dibler cassidy was the lead singer of a demons and death rock band who couldn't shake the sad feelings of her boyfriend's neglect towards her you know i can find other reasonable ways to solve this other than putting a bullet through your head she returns however possessing the soul of dora jill small her friend who is to replace her on vocals so that the group can finish the album halted by cassidy's untimely death but cassidy made a deal with the dark one and souls are to be collected she's consumed by this anger towards mainly neal but all the band members or anyone within the music studio get dead when they fall prey to whom they believe is a rather distraught dora not cassidy returning for payback br br lousy micro budget horror flick looks cheap has a cheap cast who should make plans in another line of work and boasts cheap kill scenes which aren't effective one bit
<START> i love the movies and own the comics the comics are different then the movie but still i'd give it 10 out of 10 it was awesome if the movies got anymore awesome i would have her babies and i am female read the comics you won't regret it yes in this movie since brian p the artist for her died we don't get nearly as good artistic work i mean seriously don't get me wrong these people did great but different versions for different people different strokes for different folks as the saying goes any guy who doesn't go bonkers over her is insane or does not like women or you know just plan insane if i could count on my fingers how in love and how many times i have read the comics i would run out of fingers for sure but hey there is always toes
<START> teenager eddie spends his life being bullied and humiliated due to his obsession with heavy metal music one day he finds out his hero sammi curr has died supposedly burned by the establishment which wanted to put a stop to his music but eddie has his last record never released and when he plays it he starts receiving messages telling him how to deal with his tormentors before long sammi has revealed he intends to return to life at the local halloween party to exact revenge on the town which once mocked him br br filled with humour and in jokes this is a highly entertaining film sammi himself is an original horror movie villain plays on the 'evils of rock music' obsessions of the 80's well worth watching
<START> the problem with the killer elite is that just by seeking this film out and investing time to watch it you are putting more effort into the experience than many of its principals did particularly director sam peckinpah br br the already volatile peckinpah was heading into rough weather with this film according to at least one biographer this was where he became acquainted with cocaine add to that his binge drinking and it's no wonder things fell apart br br it's a shame because the concept behind the film is a good one and the first ten minutes promise much mike locken james caan and george hansen robert duvall are private contractors who do a lot of dirty work for the cia they move quick live well and seem like the best of friends then something happens to shatter their brotherhood br br an opening scene shows them blowing up a building why exactly we aren't told par for the course in terms of this film's murky motivation but the implication is these guys hurt people and don't really care antiheroes much like the wild bunch of peckinpah's not so long ago an opening title tells us they work for comteg then adds with obvious tongue in cheek the thought the cia might employ such an organization for any purpose is of course preposterous that's a pretty clever way of letting the audience know all bets are off br br add to that a traditionally strong peckinpah backup cast including burt young gig young and peckinpah regular bo hopkins in the plum role of a madman who can't pass up an opportunity to be shot at for 500 a day and you only wish that the scriptwriters including the celebrated sterling silliphant tried to do something more with the story than turn it into a platform for lazy one liners and bad chop socky knockoffs an attempt at injecting a dose of liberal social commentary is awkwardly shoehorned in you're so busy doing their dirty work you can't tell who the bad guys are someone tells locken as if either he or we need it pointed out br br worse still are peckinpah's clumsy direction and sluggish pacing we're 40 minutes into the film before we get our first battle scene a completely chaotic collection of random shots where a bunch of people we haven't even met before are seen fighting at san francisco airport their battle intercut with a conversation in an office suite br br by the end of the film what's left of the cast is having a battle inside a fleet of mothballed victory ships ninjas running out in the open to be gunned down while caan tosses off one liners that undercut any hint of real suspense lay me seven to five i'll take the little guy he wisecracks just before a climatic samurai duel between two ninja warriors from china which we all know is the land of the ninja the battle takes place in san francisco but surprisingly no mounties arrive to break things up br br caan is much better in smaller scenes like when locken recovering from some nasty injuries is told by one of his bosses played by a smooth arthur hill that he's been humpty dumped by the organization caan refuses to stay down and his recovery scenes though momentum killing for the movie feature fine acting from him and amy heflin van's daughter as a supportive nurse caan was one of the 1970s' best actors and his laconic byplay with heflin duvall hopkins and both youngs give killer elite real watchability br br but you don't watch killer elite thinking about that you watch it thinking of the film that got away
<START> nobody but nobody could chew the scenery like the divine one ruth elizabeth davis and elizabeth and essex is a great example why although she overplays the part at times watch her when she gawfs about raliegh writing the lyrics to a song her ladies in waiting are about to play in that one moment she makes us understand how elizabeth was able to rule and rule absolutely at other times she is done in by the script's sappiness when elizabeth has to be vulnerable she comes off as weak and shrewish this has the added effect of undermining her authority when she blows her stack and threatens to dispense justice it's hard to take her seriously br br flynn exudes charm making us see how essex was able to worm his way into elizabeth's heart but he is totally inept at conveying the complexity and sheer evil of the man it also doesn't help that essex is badly underwritten why is he this hothead who wants to overthrow his queen even as he swears fidelity to her except only that he is more blue blooded thus more worthy of rule and why does raliegh betray elizabeth by intercepting her and essex's letters he's in no risk of falling out of favor and we know where essex and his head is headed so why does he risk his own head by speeding up the inevitable br br what did curtiz do with all the he was given he doesn't even bother to try to hide the fact that his battle scenes are shot on a sound stage he should've ended it with elizabeth the first time alone at the tower everything else that follows especially the final scene between her and essex is unnecessary the costumes are fantastic and is it me or does bette look exactly like susan sarandon
<START> this film could be one of the most underrated film of bollywood history this 1994 blockbuster had all of it good performances music and direction i remember i was in allahabad when this movie was running and it was somewhere in march at holi time the people there were playing its song ooe amma at their loudspeakers in highest volume if someone who likes to watch some like it hot and drools over marilyn monroe he should see this movie thumbs up to govinda how many of you know that this film was shot in south of india and after sholay could be one of the very few blockbuter to hit silver screen with films like these indian comedy could never be dead
<START> this apology for a movie is about absolutely nothing rachel griffiths must have needed the money the film must have been made on a very low budget because the lighting was non existent i made a vow if i ever see pete postlesumthingor other i'll commit suicide i'd be happy to know if there was 1 a plot or 2 a script my biggest regret is i wasted my time watching this rubbish
<START> william hurt may not be an american matinee idol anymore but he still has pretty good taste in b movie projects here he plays a specialist in hazardous waste clean ups with a tragic past tracking down a perennial loser on the run played by former pretty boy weller who has been contaminated with a deadly poison current pretty boy hardy kruger jr possibly more handsome than his dad is featured as weller's arrogant boss in a horrifying sequence at a chemical production plant which gets the story moving natasha mcelhone is a slightly wacky government agent looking into the incident who provides inevitable high cheekboned love interest for hero hurt michael brandon pops up to play a slimy take no prisoners type whose comeuppance you can't wait for the coca cola company wins the product placement award for 2000 as the soft drink is featured throughout the production shot lovingly on location in a wintery picture postcard hungary
<START> and here's yet another piece of evidence to claim that we should all worship the italian giallo and acknowledge it to be the absolute most unique sub genre in horror emilio miraglia's the red queen kills seven times is a totally mesmerizing wholesome of original plotting stylish production values enchanting music great acting talents and inventively gory murder sequences it's a fabulous giallo released in the golden year 1972 that belongs in the top five of every fan of italian cinema the storyline doesn't just introduce your average black gloved sexually frustrated killer but blends good old fashioned revenge motives with the macabre myth of the murderous red queen at young age their grandfather tells the constantly fighting siblings kitty and evelyn about an uncanny lady who once every 100 years on april 6th kills seven people of which her sister is the inevitable last victim fourteen years later kitty has become the successful choreographer of a prominent modeling agency even sharing her bed with the general manager when suddenly the killing spree begins sister evelyn would be the obvious culprit but she moved to the states recently or has she complex yet compelling and involving red herrings are thrown at you every couple of minutes and the red queen character is definitely the most fascinating killer in giallo history her face can never be seen but she wears a blood red cloak and produces the most ghastly laugh whenever she made a new victim she's not exactly gentle either as her victims are barbarically stabbed with a dagger dragged behind cars and even impaled on fences that latter one is truly one of the greatest most gruesome acts of violence i've ever seen what more could you possibly request some classy and tasteful nudity perhaps the gorgeous female actresses got this more than covered among them barbara bouchet and a young sybil danning emilio miraglia isn't the most famous giallo director as he only made this one and the equally recommended the night evelyn came out of the grave but his influence and importance should not be forgotten
<START> generally it's difficult to rate these cut paste films some of the segments can be quite good while others bring down the rating of the overall product in this one for instance the all girl scene in the doctor's office was quite exciting one of the best in this viewer's limited viewing history then there's asia's segment the lady is always entertaining and the story that binds the whole together was an interesting concept the swap scene that closes out the offering ain't bad either technically the production values are fairly high recommended
<START> i love this show br br every time i watch an episode i repeat that line and remind myself how good of a show this is i am a huge sci fi fan and this show has grounds to be the most important science fiction show in the history of film tv there are so many theories in this show about the universe i could start a religion its amazing season after season the show gets better and better br br i've been a fan of macgyver since i was 5 19 now and i find it so ironic that my 2 favorite tv shows of all time star richard dean anderson its also interesting how each character is practically the opposite of the other br br back when i first saw stargate the movie i instantly liked it and considered it one of my favorite sci fi flicks then hearing a tv show would spin from it i got really excited but didn't get showtime till the fifth season was almost over br br though i'm disappointed to hear that roland emmerich and dean devlin wanted to do a trilogy of movies but the studio optioned the series instead br br id say though that it turned out just fine maybe even better br br this show is amazing and i hope it never dies atlantis here we come
