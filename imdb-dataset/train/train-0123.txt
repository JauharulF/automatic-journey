<START> ok first a correction to the tag posted on this movie's main page abe lincoln did not walk with his sister in the movie nor did he stop at his sister's grave the individual in question is ann rutledge who was a very close friend to lincoln in his new salem days some say that ann was in fact lincoln's girlfriend but there is no evidence to support it br br now there are fabrications and fictionalizations in this film hollywood has always taken dramatic license with anything under the sun and young mr lincoln is no exception however the courtroom case that is in the film is based on a real event the accusation of murder against william duff armstrong and even though it's largely fictionalized in this film with lots of name changes it will still have viewers riveted to the screen this is hollywood's golden age with drama at it's finest and henry fonda gives possibly the best lincoln played by anyone
<START> i saw this movie by accident yesterday at a cinema i had some hopes for the movie because i really like spoorloos the vanishing and the book it's based on the movie starts out okay as it at first seems to be a nice thriller quickly though the movie becomes a mess with uninteresting plotlines characters that are never fleshed out and nobody in the audience cared for like marjoke and terrible editing the movie has fade to black bits that are just way too long a messed up chronology that jumps back and forth and lots of scenes that just don't add anything to the story and could easily have been dropped after suffering through the story you'll get treated to one of the worst endings i've seen in a very long it should also be mentioned that the movie has lots of explicit sex scenes which you're probably used to if you watch a lot of dutch movies it's hard to mention any good things about this movie about a third of the audience had already walked out of the theater halfway into the movie and i didn't hear a kind word after the movie was over avoid this movie at all costs it really destroyed any faith i had left in the dutch movie industry
<START> a great opportunity for and indy director to make an interesting film about a rock musician on the brink of stardom it could have been a decent film if it would have dealt with john livien's traumatic past and how it is torturing his psyche instead it is a ridiculous attempt to identify john livien's life with john lennon's john livien's suicida mother's hero was john lennon and she wished for him to become as powerful and prolific as lennon himself instead of focusing on john lennon's musical brilliance and his wonderful ability to bare himself for others to learn something about their own life it showed lennon's legacy to be that of a confused drug addicted soul who should looked upon as a god instead a man i am a huge john lennon fan and this movie reminded me of another crazy person obsessed with lennon lennon's killer mark david chapman lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by someone else who had an identity crisis with lennon do we need to be reminded of that john lennon gave so much to the world with his music and honesty and i was repulsed to see another disturbed person as the main character in this movie obsessed by lennon and not show his beautiful contributions to the world yoko ono graciously honored john lennon's memory by making the memorial in central park to give his fans a chance to pay their respects and remember john instead the director of this movie chose to use that site to have the killer attempt to commit suicide i found this so disturbing and disrespectful to lennon's memory he was a man of peace who died a brutal senseless death and to see such violence near this site felt like a revisiting a terrible wound for any lennon fan it ruined the movie completely for me it could have been a decent movie but it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth let john lennon and his family rest in peace and not be reminded of his vicious murder by this irresponsible movie
<START> i thought before starting with these movie that it might be a good one but when i started with it i found it really awful they said movie is being made in afghanistan but i think 95 of the movie is shot in india you can see indian made cars you can see lars drinking bisleri an indian water brand hindi written on the road you can also see temples in afghanistan hahah its really funny and many more stuff which proves its not shot in afghanistan i think one should not waste his her time watching this movie pure time waste i would recommend to do something else instead of watching this movie or may be might heart is better idea but don't watch this waste of time
<START> life stinks is a parody of life and death happiness and depression the black and the white always present in our lives mel brooks performance is brilliant as always and the other actors work is fine too this movie has some capra flavor thatÂ´s why is so good br br there are some unforgettable gags such as the one when brooks tries to earn some money dancing in the street and all the people passing by just ignore him or when he meets a funny crazy man who believes is paul getty and then start arguing and slapping each other br br if you havenÂ´t seen it you donÂ´t know what youÂ´ve missed br br this movie tells us about the old and eternal struggle of the poor against the rich br br the only difference between this movie and reality is that this movie has a happy ending and reality hasnÂ´t br br yes indeed life stinks
<START> this movie is one of the most underrated movie of its time when watching this movie your filled with action and when somethings not really happing the humour is un matched brilliant writing for a movie that was made to give us a bloody mix of a game show where criminals are the contestants and a near future where the general public all have a thirst for blood also arnold doesn't let us down with some of his best one liners i don't want to spoil anything for you but i will tell you when arnold gives his i'll be back line he gets the best response of them all in this movie hope you enjoy this gem as much as i did
<START> radiofreccia is still a good surprise in italian cinema the film is based on a book of italian songwriter luciano ligabue who also directs the movie and writes the music score of course br br the film is a portrait of north italian province life in the emilia romagna region we're in 1975 the time of the first free radios one of the boys of the movie creates radioraptus youth wishes friendship love sex individual dramas and unemployment are among the themes but the film speaks also about drugs freccia the main character is a victim of heroin slavery br br without being boring and moralist the story flows very well the spontaneity of actors is strong and the way of directing as well obviously luciano liga ligabue is neither fellini nor a movie professional first of all he's a musician but he succeeds in making a good product unfortunately he'll not repeat the success with his second movie da zero a dieci not good at all br br in radiofreccia actors are generally not very famous the only star is stefano accorsi one of the most popular young italian actors see in a small role another italian songwriter francesco guccini he's the nice communist barman and football trainer
<START> i would give this movie 5 rather than 3 if it would be at least in time when i've seen it in first time it was just what you could wait from the work that is based not on the artistic abilities of the directors but on the idealistic or i would rather say idiotic habits of our kazakhstan government it's a shame because 'qazaqfil'm' was been shooting nice movies when it was not honoured by the name of shaken aimanov but it was actually ran by him the movies like 'konec atamana' 'kyz zhibek' or even 'aldar kose' but after mr aimanov's death the production of quality movies went down almost dramatically in 10 years time there were very few films produced however in late 1980s 'assa' was shot it was a film about first organised crime groups in the big country one year later mr rashid nugmanov shot another film with the co staring of the same actor singer v tsoy at that time he was already a soviet russian rock legend the movie called 'igla' the needle or something it was completely new somebody called that period as resurrection or a new kazakh movie wave unfortunately nowadays we do not have a quality movies our directors shooting movies on the french and japanese financial support and thus movies are not for the public but for the authors professional critics some of them take a price on international author movie festivals but there a very few of them become a business asset products and again back to our 'nomads' such movies usually unpopular because of vast aspects the same effects was with nikita mikhalkov's 'sibirski cyrilnik' about russian tsars that was also shot on parities with foreign partners i think they were french or maybe british nobdy liked it even in russian public it become as a main topic of a comedians and comedy shows like 'kvn' imho
<START> criticism of the film evening based on the novel by susan minot and adapted for the screen by minot and michael cunningham has been harsh so harsh that it may have discouraged many viewers from giving the film a try the primary criticism has centered on the fact that very little happens in this film about a dying woman's fretting over a mistake she made one summer in her youth that famous actors were given very minor roles that the entire production was over hyped etc for this viewer seeing the film on a dvd in the quiet of the home a very different reaction occurred br br ann grant lord vanessa redgrave is dying in her home by the ocean and her medication and memories allow her to share a man's name 'harris' with her two grown daughters nina toni colette and constance natasha richardson as her daughters sit at her bedside ann relives a particular summer when she was a bridesmaid for her best friend lila mamie gummer a marriage both ann claire danes as the youthful ann and lila's alcoholic brother buddy hugh dancy objected to feeling that lila was simply marrying a man of her class instead of the boy she had loved harris arden patrick wilson her housekeeper's son who had become a physician harris buddy lila and ann are woven together in a series of infatuations and romances that have been kept secret until now 50 years later as ann is dying the older lila meryl streep visits ann at the end and the secrets are revealed 'there are no such things as mistakes life just goes on ' the film is a delicate mood piece and the script by minot and cunningham is rich in atmosphere and subtle life lessons yes there are gaps in the story that could have used more explanation but in order to maintain the aura of nostalgia of a dying lady's words such 'holes' are understandable the film is graced by the presence of not only redgrave richardson redgrave's true daughter collette gummer streep's true daughter meryl streep claire danes eileen atkins glenn close hugh dancy and patrick wilson but also with an ensemble cast of brief but very solid performances the setting is gorgeous cinematography by gyula pados and the musical score is by the inimitable jan a p kaczmarek lajos koltai being julia' directs judge this film on your own grady harp
<START> best movie ever this movie broke my ribs just by the force of laughter but it was well worth it i don't intend to do a summary of this excellent movie just go see it if you have the chance i think you will either love it or hate it that's the qualities of a real cult movie
<START> this movie had a great ensemble of adult actors along with a cast of youthful actors that are going to be in movies for a long while if there is any justice the directing and editing was great i may look up the book that this was adapted from it must have been great i liked it sigourney weaver jon voight and tim blake nelson were a blast to watch henry winkler and nathan davis were not seen enough but were fun when they were onscreen the kids at the camp couldn't have been better as i said i liked it
<START> this movie has a very simple yet clever premise an unemployed man trying to steal from a convenience store and the store clerk catches him in the act the thief runs away with the store clerk right after him all the while the store clerk is in trouble with a low rank yakuza chinpira gangster along the chase for the thief they catch the eye of the yakuza who's been looking for the convenience store clerk the story then moves into high gear in the form of a tom jerry cat mouse but is added with the dog chasing after the cat the entire 2nd act of d a n g a n runner can be translate to english as pinball runners is about the chase and the chase goes on on to the point that by the end of the 2nd act the bum forgets why he is running away and the yakuza don't remember which of the 2 guys he is chasing nor does he remember why they're running away from him br br similar to sabu's later film postman blues the bulk of the film is simply all chase and action with plenty of physical comedy and dark humor injected to keep the audience engaged what falls short is the ending to which the chase stops when the three men run out of steam and into one of the most chaotic mexican stand offs you'll see on film that looks almost as if sabu was paying homage to tony scott's true romance written by quentin tarantino
<START> i watch movies for a living picking out which ones are good enough to distribute tossing aside those that don't make the cut i'm not saying that i know more than anyone else based on this i'm just leading you to how i came to watch the gospel of lou anyways so many bad movies land on my desk and i actually sit through all of them i don't actually watch everything usually i just look over at the tv occasionally while i'm working the scan for production value performance and how well the story is being presented if something catches my eye i'll take the time to watch it lou drew me in during the first few minutes where i closed my laptop and wheeled my chair over to the tv so i could completely tune in needless to say i was enthralled throughout the whole movie the story is told well the characters are either endearing or repulsive depending of course on the actor and directors intention for the character and all very well played at times i caught occasional amateur mistakes in the camera work and editing but the emotional nature of the story make these faults easy to dismiss i've heard other people's comments say that at times the film brought tears to their eyes other time extreme elation i was laughing one minute and crying the next and was incredibly touched by this movie sadly i was unable to acquire it because i was as the saying goes a week late and a dollar short that's the way it goes sometimes but at least i had the pleasure of seeing this one and i can't wait to see what kind of response it gets good luck and great fortune to you bret carr if you read this you are without a doubt a talent to watch for
<START> we have a lake we have an animated meteor crashing we have a killer stop motion dinosaur with flippers okay so let's call this movie the crater lake monster what else can we add hmm two idiots called arnie mitch to define the ultimate definition of comic relief we also got to have a sheriff who doesn't really do a damn thing in this film and whom nobody listens to aw crap we're over halfway through the movie and we forgot to insert a bad guy no worries let's introduce some guy with a moustache have him rob a store to indicate he's a bad guy then have him pop up somewhere near the lake have him chased through the woods and all this for the sole purpose of him ending up as dinosaur snack food that should work br br a complete clumsy mess this film its logic will twist your mind to force laughter out of you the first film to feature dave allen as a stop motion supervisor after this one he joined forces with charles band for several years until the the mid nineties when band ran out of money to pay him i guess the dinosaur effects are charming and the whole film is pretty damn unintentionally funny unfortunately that's about the only good thing that can be said for it br br good badness yes the mind bending logic in the narrative should be enough reason to put it on the list if not arnie mitch will do the trick 3 10 and 8 10
<START> brian dennehy bill paxton joe pantalino and best of all jeff fahey all in one film wow is all i can think to say about that these are four of the most underrated actors in the biz and they work beautifully together it's like poetry the way they play off each other and ooze the natural ability to seem as though they had been best buddies for eons for even shooting the film br br the film itself is fine and one that can be quite intense to view the first time and the four stars help the re watch ability to a great extent i cannot describe how good it was to see bill paxton and jeff fahey together on screen the greatest moment being when they watch a couple from a distance and fill in the vocals themselves it almost brought a tear to my eyes br br a good film a great cast go see why four words fahey dennehy paxton pantalino
<START> demonicus rocked you guys need to understand how hard it rocked unfortunately the words needed to explain the extent of the rocking have not been discovered for a tiny idea pop like 50 hits of e watch death factory while on the phone with jesus wait jesus is on call waiting you're having phone sex with will smith on the primary line seriously that movie so good you need to watch it at least a 4 times to catch all the subtleties well not so much subtleties as much as it takes the length of the movie times 4 in order to ponder why the people at full moon are allowed to a live and b reproduce what is our world coming to
<START> directed and co written by eytan fox the writer director of the highly acclaimed 2002 mini feature yossi jagger 2002 this comparative epic at 1hr 53 minutes is another fine romantic drama in which we must deal with tragedy as well as celebrate the beauty and joy in life westerners especially urban gay men like myself need to be moved outside our safety zone and be informed of the real life and death struggle elsewhere to be able to love with equity br br while yossi jagger focused on a pair of gay lovers in the closeted confines of israeli military service ha buah is centred on a group of civilian friends both straight and gay who share a unit in the heart of israel's generally gay tolerant but not always gay friendly capital tel aviv br br ha buah opens with a dramatic border check point scene in which noam ohad knoller Â yossi from yossi jagger first meets handsome young arab ashraf yousef sweid romance soon blooms Â but in that political climate opportunities would have to be seized quickly or lost altogether br br from there we follow an intricate interplay among the members and lovers of the housemates and the unavoidable effect of ashraf's very conservative family if you follow this film's dialogue attentively enough then you will have no reason to be disappointed with the ending br br the soundtrack for ha buah is vibrant and the visuals are both beautiful and stark Â i e real life in the middle east br br the english subtitles are very easy to follow and you quickly relax and appreciate world cinema at its best
<START> nacho vigalondo is very famous in spain he is a kind of bad showman who can make you feel sick very embarrassing nacho had made some commercials in tv i remember one in which nacho was looking for paul mc carney around madrid the commercial was about a mc carney cd collection br br this little movie is like a nacho's commercial bad storyline bad directing and awful performances i can't believe that a disgusting movie like this was in the kodak theater poor oscar br br nacho could made this movie because of his wife the producer of this 7 35 a woman very well connected with spanish tv business men
<START> this movie was absolutely wonderful the pre partition time and culture has been recreated beautifully urmila has given yet another brilliant performance what i truly admire about this movie is that it doesn't resort to pakistan bashing that is running rampant in movies like gadar and loc with the partition as a backdrop the movie does not divert to political issues or focus on violence or what is right and wrong the movie always centers around the tragic story of urmila's life her fragile relationship with manoj bajpai has been depicted excellently the movie actually shows how the people both hindus and muslims have suffered from this partition the theme that there is only one religion is truly prevalent in this film
<START> slow and riddled with inaccuracy over looking its flaws this is still an interesting account of the famed and heroic siege of the alamo during the texas fight for independence from mexico james arness as jim bowie brian keith as davy crockett alec baldwin as col travis raul julia as general santa anna this made for tv project also stars david ogden stiers kathleen york and jim metzler very good original music by peter bernstein
