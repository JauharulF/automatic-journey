<START> i really didn't like this film the plot was very predictable typical american plot i'm sorry guy gets the girl kind of thing at the end and london has a monorail bank of london bank of england is what it really is i did however like the look of tracy island and the thunderbirds themselves and the brits were baddies apart from parker and lady penelope what was up with that oh and they kept on saying stuff like here come 'the thunderbirds' but it was never known as 'the thunderbirds' in the series why do that i'd like to see this re made in 20 years with more british cast i preferred the original series sorry
<START> this movie starts out brisk has some slow moments in the middle but generally moves along well has a few very good moments then peters out at the end of act 3 i was able to get to see this in la premieres 2 times with 2 different endings jason lee is a star but he is not tomorrows leading man he is humorous and holds his own but he is better served as a supporting actor julia stiles does 'ok' in a comedy role new for her but she doesn't 'steal' this movie the way a star of her caliber should for an actress who has so much potential 10 things save the last dance o it is hard to watch her continue to do roles that are so 'average' and then not have her take the role and run away with the movie like daniel day lewis did in 'gangs' selma blair is a good young actress as well and does an 'ok' job i didn't expect an academy award performance from her and she didn't deliver one but her performance was adequate chris koch delivers another film that is 'above average' perhaps the problem lies in the script more than anything else i 'did' like this movie but it is not a movie where you walk away and say 'that was great ' this 'story' has been done so many times before and there was just not much new here the rehearsal dinner scene was probably the best in the movie and larry miller gives an incredible performance in a supporting role he could be the best surprise of the film if you want to go see a movie that will make you laugh a few times and have an enjoyable evening i can still recommend this film but unless they have changed the ending again leave during the church scene or you will surely be disappointed
<START> this could have been interesting Â a japan set haunted house story from the viewpoint of a newly installed american family Â but falls flat due to an over simplified treatment and the unsuitability of both cast and director br br the film suffers from the same problem i often encounter with the popular modern renaissance of such native fare i e the fact that the spirits demonstrate themselves to be evil for no real reason other than that they're expected to besides it doesn't deliver much in the scares department Â a giant crab attack is merely silly Â as generally the ghosts inhabit a specific character and cause him or her to act in a totally uncharacteristic way such as susan george seducing diplomat friend of the family doug mcclure and edward albert force feeding his daughter a bowl of soup br br at one point an old monk turns up at the house to warn albert of the danger if they remain there Â eventually he's called upon to exorcise the premises however history is bound to repeat itself and tragedy is the only outcome of the tense situation duly created Â leading to a violent yet unintentionally funny climax in which albert and mcclure possessed by the spirits of their japanese predecessors engage in an impromptu karate duel to the death at the end of the day this emerges an innocuous time waster Â tolerable at just 88 minutes but in no way essential viewing
<START> dull cheap sci fi thriller made with an almost total lack of conviction a control room full of computers and other devices used to receive and decipher messages from outer space is run by only one man and is very poorly guarded at night and full of campy sound effects christopher lee is not only wasted but he also gives one of his few i'm here strictly for the money performances 1 2
<START> because this was simply awful 101 dalamatians was funny even if formulaic but this is nothing more than puerile drivel the same plot except with the story excised from it the world's most intelligent and horribly annoying macaw tim mcinnerny proving that he really can't do comedy everone remembers percy in blackadder but that was his high spot it's all been downhill since then direction so poor that if a group of college students had made this you'd throw it in the bin and tell them to do it again properly this time ieuan grufford better go back to hornblower sharpish whilst glenn close and gerard diepardieu ought to go into hiding for several years br br perhaps i could be too harsh after all i didn't manage to sit through the whole film it gets 1 10 only because i can't give it 0
<START> this movie is one of the most unintentionally bad action films ever put to film dolph friggin' lundren with a japanese accent is funny enough but add really corny buddy buddy action to the mix an eccentric and over the top villain a clichÃ©d love interest subplot and one of the worst endings of all time and you've got yourself quite the little suicide inducing cure for people who enjoy their life and up till watching showdown had never contemplated killing themselves with a blowtorch br br i don't know if it's just me but the whole homosexual subtext is none too subtle there are constant references to male genitalia and not by females either brandon lee and dolphin talk about each other's manly parts and in fact before going on a suicide spree brandon says to dolphy in case we don't make it i want to tell you you have the biggest d i've ever seen br br now is this what a normal man would say to another man in an action film no less and would you want those to be your dying words br br later there's this gem br br dolph regarding the villain i would like to cut off certain parts of his anatomy brandon man you've got a fixation br br as the guy at ruthlessreviews com pointed out unfortunately dolph doesn't respond with 'i've got a fixation i've got a fixation you're the one who decided that his last words should be about my privates i was just gonna chop of his ears and his nose man br br this is relentlessly silly stuff and great fun if you're someone who enjoys receiving root canals from unlicensed dentists without novocain it's about on par great fun for the whole family
<START> saw this in preview great movie wonderful characterizations witty and intelligent dialog actors were fantastic peter falk will be up for an oscar paul reiser was charming photography was marvelous reiser was at the theater when we saw the film and he gave a vivid account about the making of the film it had been a long dream of his to write a semi autobiographical account of relationships between sons and fathers and more specifically between him and his father this was achieved in a dramatic and entertaining fashion the supporting cast was well chosen and gave the film a feeling of family i recommend this film to anyone who is longing to see intelligent drama and wonderful performances
<START> i rate this movie with 3 skulls only coz the girls knew how to scream this could've been a better movie if actors were better the twins were ok i believed they were evil but the eldest and youngest brother they sucked really bad it seemed like they were reading the scripts instead of acting them spoiler if they're vampire's why do they freeze the blood vampires can't drink frozen blood the sister in the movie says let's drink her while she is alive but then when they're moving to another house they take on a cooler they're frozen blood end of spoiler br br it was a huge waste of time and that made me mad coz i read all the reviews of how this movie was great how many awards this movie won and this movie was f ing s t
<START> about time they released this movie on dvd i know some say wb rush the release of this movie because of the dreamgirls movie but how can you rush the release of a movie that's been in you catalog since 1976 br br i'm very disappointed with the dvd release of this movie no special feature no 5 1 dd sound come on wb you can do much better then this the audio and picture quality on this movie needs some serious help br br seem wb didn't place as much time and attention to this movie because it is a black movie and my have okay sales they could have kept the cd which by the way dose not have all the songs the original cd has br br would i recommend this dvd for purchase yes because it is a classic film but wb need to go add some more special feature take notes from other group movies the five heatbeats or the temptation were you may view just the performance and the sound on both are much much much better than this dvd
<START> ah clichÃ©s clichÃ©s clichÃ©s they're a main part of a wide variety of horror films this one has a lot of them still it's stephen king one of the best masters of horror this movie was really good just too predictable and what horror movie doesn't have stupid people this one is overcrowded with retarded victims just practically begging for their life to be taken pet semetary i found to be creepy a little the way everything is set up was really spooky but not terrifying for the most part the acting was somewhat believable the suspense wasn't that suspenseful but the entertainment level is set at a major rank my eyes were practically glued to the screen all stephen king fans must see this movie but as for anyone else expect an okay thriller
<START> i'm disappointed that reiser who wrote the film felt the need to use so much profanity for no reason whatsoever maybe that's his idea of adult films plenty of nasty words with bathroom humor thrown in i thought better of him and think less of him for this movie br br falk's acting and some moments of humor as well as some possibly important themes are what made me give it such a high rating br br this might be a good movie for adult children to watch and laugh over about their own folks and their foibles but the lack of consideration for audience families seriously detriments what could have been a family film but fails certainly not worth spending money on though it might be worth a watch for free on television
<START> well where do i start i think it's very insulting to the original annie with aileen quimnn i love the film annie and i was expecting this to be a brilliant film but i was so disappointed the acting is awful the original annie came out a few years before i was born i'm now 25 and annie is still one of my favourite films so i was really excited to see annie 2 the acting was awful in the film were any of the characters original very badly written directed and acted this is not a film i wish to see again and any annie lover i recommend that you don't watch this film because it will only leave you very disappointed the young girls singing isn't bad but still doesn't compare to the original
<START> from the start this film was awful why was it that bad if it isn't the naked women not only in need of a decent plastic surgeon but also the expertise of a dentist followed by a free hand out of colgate whitening then it's the 'crazy' old guy at the gas station who isn't so much crazy but more i'm not sure how to act a great deal so i will stare straight ahead and look as stupid as i can while pretending to shout in robotic tones about something in the woods then back to these naked nymphs in need of a cure for gingivitis apparently without touching you and this is according to the opening scene they can cause a nasty looking red rash on your neck which i assumed to be a chunk of flesh missing but just looks as though it could do with some tcp to clear it right up then you have sophie holland who plays ally i have never seen such baaaaaad acting she is more of a me me me if i'm not having fun no one else is and i don't wanna do this so i won't and i'm the meanest cow on the planet i'm sarcastic petty and if i don't get things my way i will sulk kind of person reminds me more of a 6 yr old girl's attitude i don't think it's even worth mentioning the dire camera angles that remind me of blair witch or how low budget the film actually was that when judd was hacking at the 'locked' door it was in fact open before he reached to unlock it from the other side this film is completely laughable if it were a spoof then it would have been successful only just though but as a horror film is was just plain wrong i can't even being to describe everything that went t ts up in this movie i would run out of room although it was funny to watch andrew drip raspberry juice in his ear every time he opened his mouth while tom savini's character was completely blind to the two hiding under the table directly in his line of vision it was even funnier when these two thought they could escape on a god damn tractor which as we all know is thee number one hated vehicle to get stuck behind since its so god damn slow so is it any wonder they don't get away with it and how many people do you know that can slice open their wrist and then run around for hours as if nothing ever happened no pain no weakening from blood loss nothing but the silliest part is when all of a sudden and i mean that literally it's one year later and molly is still wandering the woods after having escaped the nymphs and then lo and behold shaun hutson picks her up of course not without a line to promote his books altho admittedly he is one of my fav authors but suddenly and with absolutely no hint of an xplanation as to how and why she's evil herself and lures hutson to his death then we cut to the crazy dude from the beginning suddenly wandering round the woods with a petrol can even after his 'dazzling' performance on why no one should ever venture there for whatever reason cue the nymphs stupidly slappin each other around a bit for fun while crazy pours petrol everywhere and here endeth the film finally my conclusion if you hadn't already guessed by now absolute rubbish there was no proper thought went into it at all whoever was aiming the camera needed firing and come to think of it so did 99 of the cast if the right director actors and budget got behind this it could have been decent but once again low budget english horror films but the rest of the genre the country and the english film making industry to shame and i'm english so i'm allowed to say that in fact the only decent and exciting part of the movie is in the first 15 20 mins when we watch it turn from night to day over a field type area all i kept thinking throughout this was jesus christ in heaven why oh why did you allow someone to make this its absolute cow's testicles but i can't turn a film off after i've started watching it unfortunately i had to watch from dusk til dawn afterwards just to remind myself that tom savini does have it in him to act well if there was an option for 0 10 then believe me i woulda chose that cuz this film isn't even worth the one point i did give it br br but this is just my opinion watch it and decide for yourself
<START> meatball machine has got to be one of the most complex ridiculous awful and over exaggerated sci fi horror films that i have ever came across it is about good against evil and a coming of age tale with the aim of to entertain with bloody sleazy and humorous context because of that the violence isn't particularly gruesome and it doesn't make you squirm but the gratuitous bloodletting and nudity does run freely the performances by issei takahashi and toru tezuka is the worst i have seen if that was not enough it is also directed by an unheard of director called yudai yamaguchi this movie just have it all it is bad to the bone a must see for every b movie freak simply an enjoying and rare gem
<START> after a cold sex scene between andy and gina in south america we know that andy is a payroll manager who finds himself in a hard economic situation where he badly needs some extra moneyÂ we also discover that he has been stealing from his job and using the money to his drug habitsÂ he's also attempting to keep up with his wife who just might be having an affairÂ br br to solve all their problems he persuades his brotherÂa likable loserÂto join him in a plan to steal their own parent's small storeÂ their parents are happily married and proprietors of a jewelry store situated in new york's westchester countyÂ sixty thousand dollars is all they'll need to get their life out of desperationÂ br br three main characters are important in this movieÂ br br first the two brothersÂ each of them is a complex individual threatened with multiple motivations and sunk into doubts and disappointmentsÂ the two are desperate characters financially and emotionallyÂ br br andy is selfishÂ he feels that he has never had the love of his fatherÂ he is the corrupting influence turning his brother into an assailant and his beautiful woman into an adulteressÂ br br hank is a puppet too weak to resist his brother's wishesÂ his ex wife is one of the reasons he needs money as he owes her hundreds in child supportÂ he longs to regain the confidence he once had with his fatherÂ br br the third character is their weary and deplorable father charles hanson albert finney especially in the haunting climactic scenesÂ br br telling you more about the details could lessen the impact of the film and therefore the entertainment br br tomei's performance conveys great depth and emotion even with her look her touch her particular moveÂ br br lumet's direction is firm fresh and brutal
<START> having just finished cronicles of the heroic knight mere minutes ago i find myself extremely please but questions still loom over me while it would appear that the first 7 episodes or so are actually a retelling of the events of the first record of lodoss war the truth is that they really aren't it would appear that the creator of cothk had a different vision as to how the original ended and that may be the reason that the first 7 episodes occur but i do not find that to be the case cothk does say it starts 5 years after the war of heros which parn was a part of i think the director made the first 5 episodes seem so much like a recap of the original just to give the viewer a small reminder and an introduction to characters and their deeds done because they appear much less after the series kicks into spark's story now once the series does kick into spark's portion we find ourselves kicked up another 10 years 15 years now since the war of heros spark and his crew do in some cases resemble parn and his crew once the journey kicks into gear especially the love story that brews between spark and neese i also thought several times throughout cothk that i threw in the original series and if it wasn't for spark's long blue hair i know i would've pressed stop more than once to make sure the right disc was in by no means do i consider these major set backs however the writers did a fine job in crafting believable characters and a remarkable storyline the only thing that makes me hurt is that ashram and wagnard return ummmm how don't get me wrong both are great villains even though ashram's only villainous trait is that he supports the marmo perhaps i missed something during the coarse of the series that explained that part as far as sequels go though i highly recommend cothk i place both cothk and even more so the original record of lodoss war far above the lord of the rings trilogy both of these are more epic than anything i've ever seen or read i highly recommend this
<START> snow white is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view the plot is pretty much foreseeable the characters are stereotypes the editing too exaggerated anyway the movie seems not to have a lot of artistic ambitions br br instead i think this is a straight commercial thing including a character from the french part of switzerland the actor is the leader of the band he is touring with in the movie the band's called sens unik seems to aim to a larger audience a straight german swiss movie would not have sold in the french part and vice versa what really got on my nerves were the product placements all over the movie sometines scenes remembered of advertisement clips br br i also think the topic of young people taking drugs without any other targets in their lives is a wide spread reality in zurich therefore it should be elaborated with more care i hope samir got enough money with snow white in order that his next movie is gonna show his true artistic skills
<START> what seemed at first just another introverted french flick offering no more than baleful sentiment became for me on second viewing a genuinely insightful and quite satisfying presentation br br spoiler of sorts follows br br poor cedric he apparently didn't know what hit him poor audience we were at first caught up in what seemed a really beautiful and romantic story only to be led back and forth into the dark reality of mismatch these two guys just didn't belong together from their first ambiguous encounter as much as mathieu and cedric were sexually attracted to each other the absence of a deeper emotional tie made it impossible for mathieu an intellectual being to find fulfillment in sharing life with someone whose sensibilities were more attuned to carnival festivities and romps on the beach br br on a purely technical note i loved the camera action in this film subtitles were totally unnecessary even though my french is presque rien i could watch it again without the annoying english translation and enjoy it even more this was a polished very professionally made motion picture though many scenes seem superfluous i rate it nine out of ten
<START> what a shame that a really competent director like andre de toth who specialized in slippery shifting alliances didn't get hold of this concept first he could have helped bring out the real potential especially with the interesting character played by william bishop as the movie stands it's pretty much of a mess as asserted by reviewer chipe the main problems are with the direction cheap budget and poor script the strength lies in an excellent cast and an interesting general concept characters pulled in different directions by conflicting forces what was needed was someone with vision enough to pull together the positive elements by reworking the script into some kind of coherent whole instead of the sprawling awkward mess that it is try to figure out the motivations and interplay if you can also a bigger budget could have matched up contrasting location and studio shots and gotten the locations out of the all too obvious la outskirts the real shame lies in a waste of an excellent cast hayden taylor before his teeth were capped dehner reeves along with james millican and william bishop shortly before their untimely deaths few films illustrate the importance of an auteur with vision more than this lowly obscure western which in the right hands could have been so much more
<START> this is the second movie i saw for horrorfest this past weekend the gravedancers being the first gravedancers was better i can only guess from watching this that the production must have been quite limited i will admit the story started out interesting but really fizzled for me in the end we weren't really given time to sympathize or understand any of the characters which only made each of their erratic characteristics even more annoying i have to mention that there was also a bit of mis casting with a 12 year old boy acting as sheriff the only reason i sat through the whole film was to find out what the big secret was which turned out to not be all that interesting some more background about the family would have helped but they didn't really seem like a family at all to begin with br br to me this film is so amateur that i couldn't even see putting it on dvd the four rating is for the initial potential the story might have had this was one to skip for horrorfest
