<START> you get 5 writers together have each write a different story with a different genre and then you try to make one movie out of it it's action it's adventure it's sci fi it's western it's a mess sorry but this movie absolutely stinks 4 5 is giving it an awefully high rating that said it's movies like this that make me think i could write movies and i can barely write
<START> it as absolutely incredible to me that anyone could make the comment that this film is not preachy it is not only oppressively preachy but absurd stagebound dramatically straight jacketed and painfully overwrought watching it one feels like an 8 year old child being punished by having to write i will not become a fascist on the blackboard 100 times br br now i understand that it was made during the height of ww2 and was intended to be a brave condemnation of hitler and the terrible suffering he brought about which anyone would whole heartedly applaud and i'm sure it accurately captured the mood of the day but it is presented in such an immature over obvious sledgehammer way it fails abysmally as a work of art br br the only good performances here are from paul lukas who brings sincerity and intensity to his role as a quietly heroic anti fascist and lucile watson as the amusingly ill mannered rich grandmother who slowly comes to realize how dangerous the world has become though their rootless upbringing has subjected them to all kinds of hardships the children are ridiculously shown as robotically well behaved little snips they do not even remotely resemble real human beings and bette davis a great actress here is so one dimensionally noble i cringed every time she was on screen her every word her every gesture is meant to convey how supportive and understanding she is of the sacrifices her husband has to make and the great cause he is fighting for that she must've been wired to receive a painful electric shock if she dared allowed any hint of doubt or shading to surface in her portrayal br br so yes this is a very important film just not a very good one
<START> my definition of a great movie is if you want to continue to see it over again this movie for some reason strikes a cord in me even though the scenes with scott glenn still make me winch i watch it over and over again and love the music
<START> rene clair's groundbreaking musical if you want to see where songs first drove a story this is the place this is the story of a starving young artist who finds he's won the lottery just as his creditors come calling unfortunately his ticket is in his coat which is in his girlfriends apartment and has been given to an on the run convict who then oh but that would be telling br br this is a light and frothy story where much of the dialog is sung most people think this didn't happen until oklahoma or andrew lloyd webber its the sort of movie that they don't make any more and rarely did when they did its sound a film from the early days that plays like a movie from five or six years later clair moves his camera around in ways that not even busby berkeley was doing though to be honest comparing the two film makers is unfair since berkeley was doing essentially stage bound dance numbers and clair was moving the camera through the real world its an amazing little movie and its a charming movie that will just make you smile its just a fluffy piece of enjoyment br br i'm sorry i can't say more its just a nice little movie and thats really all you need to know
<START> in september 2003 36 year old jonny kennedy died he had a terrible genetic condition called dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa eb which meant that his skin literally fell off at the slightest touch leaving his body covered in agonising sores and leading to a final fight against skin cancer in his last months jonny decided to work with filmmaker patrick collerton to document his life and death and the result was a film first broadcast in march that was an uplifting confounding and provocatively humorous story of a singular man not shying away from the grim reality of eb the film was also a celebration of a life lived to the full produced and directed by patrick collerton and first shown in march 2004 the boy whose skin fell off has become the most talked about documentary of that year it attracted nearly five million viewers and after the screening the public donated over half a million pounds to jonny's charity debra a jonny kennedy memorial fund has been set up to raise another half a million with the aim of ensuring that jonny kennedy left a one million pound legacy

<START> throughout this film you might think this film is just for kids well it is mainly pointed towards them but it's also well rounded enough with the jokes pointed also at the adults in the audience this time around the muppet gang try to get on broadway with the dire straits keeping them from getting it produced leading them to splitting up but kermit won't stop and his determination keeps things moving along until after getting the deal together he gets hit by a car and sent into amnesia br br it's a send up in part of those old starring vehicles from the 40s with musicals actually as the topic of a musical only here there's the usual lot of zaniness and wonderful moments thrown into a pot of hysterically funny moments lou zealand's boomerang fish gonzo's water stunt display the whisper campaign among many others but also with a lot of heart too the muppet writers aren't shy of the conventions on the contrary they embrace them to the point where it's almost refreshing to see such a 'lets put on a show' story where through thick and think the characters will meet their dream br br while not as totally original in scope as the muppet movie it's got many catchy and memorable songs excellent locations all over manhattan and even some intonations of inter species dating and marriage cameos include liza minneli a frog elliot gould as the cop brooke shields propositioned by a rat edward i koch gregory hines and joan rivers so get ready to sing along or just have a lot of big laughs and romantic yes romantic times with one of the best muppet movies
<START> the straight story is a multilevel exploration of the goodness and beauty of america at one level a slow walk through the heartland it's kind inhabitants and amber grain at another level about growing old and remembering what is important and actively forgetting what isn't david lynch gives us time in this movie and helps me to remember that so much can be said with silence a remarkable movie that will rest gently with me for some time to come
<START> despite disney's best efforts this is a rather enjoyable movie about following your dreams i was surprised that it didn't strike me as over sentimental this movie played fair dennis quaid was very very good in the role which is saying something for a sports movie i can't recall how many sports movies have had little quirks that bother me here everybody looks the part this movie is surprisingly good and i predict that it will do surprising business as it is a g rated movie that doesn't require the viewer to stop thinking ebert to the contrary this movie is a success
<START> i completely disagree with the other comments posted on this movie for instance the movie is based on the book and if the writer had a gay character in it then how could hollywood just throw in a token gay character in the movie and besides there was two gay characters and i thought they reflected each other great one was normal and the other was more feminine but it wasn't over the top and diane keaton gave a wonderful performance and if the other reviewer had the decency to actual watch the entire film they would have seen that her character developed through out the film by interacting with the other characters for instance when she and adam went to look at the car that sara crashed in the junkyard you could see the maternal side of her come out and later in the film you saw that she too was invincible but i guess if you're too worried about gay characters and characters that are flawed then this movie is bad but if you're more open minded and i don't know actually have some inkling of what is good then you'll enjoy this film
<START> this is a musical adaptation of dicken's oliver twist for the most part the original story has been maintained though for the flow of the film certain subplots such as the summer he spent recuperating and the half brother are omitted the biggest difference in the film and the story is that by the end of the book fagin is hanged an ending very different from this musical film br br this is a one of a kind musical one whose style and scope really hasn't been matched before or since not only are the songs often quite singable and memorable but the choreography of the film is a sight to behold whereas in most musicals a few people or perhaps even a small group are choreographed dancing here the numbers often run into the hundreds or perhaps more it's truly a sight to see and i was fortunate enough to have seen it in the theater when it debuted and is one of my earliest childhood memories having just seen it again a few moments ago i would have to say that the film only got better over time great sets wonderful acting and singing this is a special treat that is hard not to love br br by the way when i saw the film again tonight i was surprised by just how high and feminine mark lester's singing was for the film well according to imdb his singing was dubbed by a girl and this would definitely account for his voice
<START> bored londoners henry kendall and joan barry as fred and emily hill receive an advance on an inheritance they use the money go traveling their lives become more exciting as they begin relationships with exotic betty amann for mr kendall and lonely percy marmont for ms barry but they remain as boring as they were before arguably bored director alfred hitchcock tries to liven up the well titled as quoted in the film from shakespeare's the tempest rich and strange by ordering up some camera trickery an opening homage to king vidor's the crowd is the highlight the low point may be the couple dining on chinese prepared cat br br rich and strange 12 10 31 alfred hitchcock henry kendall joan barry percy marmont elsie randolph
<START> considering that i felt like picking up a new jet li film to see some but kicking and brainless hand to hand fighting i grabbed this title br br unfortunatly this movie contains more gun battles ala chow yun fat but nowhere near as good than jet li and company's acrobatic fighting thus it was a let down br br the faucet fighting was interesting and even funny considering this was something totaly unexpected in a jet li film for me more on the line of say jackie chan br br but alas i'd recommend fist of legend tai chi master or even the enforcer over this dissapointment br br rating 4 for martial arts rating 3 for overall movie score
<START> for those who like their murder mysteries busy this is definitely the one to see as it is chock full of interesting and suspicious characters most of them wealthy long island socialite types as the star detective william powell is alternately starchy and inspired behaving at times as if he and his suit went to the cleaners and got pressed together mary astor is very lovely here br br powell had made a career out of playing the lead character philo vance in a series of movies made at a couple of studios over several years in between these films he developed into a somewhat offbeat romantic lead at times even essaying gentleman gangster roles already middle aged he was stuck in somewhat of a career rut by the time this one came along as with so many early talkie stars it seemed that his time had come and gone that he was fine for early depression prohibition era films but that with changing times he was perhaps too mature and dandyish to endure br br the kennel murder case directed by the criminally neglected michael curtiz is one of the last of the old powells while the next year would herald in the first of the new ones the thin man the success of which would catapult its leading players into the hollywood stratosphere in kennel we can see the movies still in a somewhat stiff ritualized pattern as the camera does not move much with the acting like the presentation tending toward the theatrical there's no harm in this approach though which has its charms it gives the movie a baroque quality
<START> i very much enjoyed watching this film i taped it while watching so that i could review it later i actually enjoyed the second viewing more since i was able to absorb more of the clever dialog between natalie and adam the 2 main characters i thought the way this story evolved was very thought provoking i got very intrigued with how natalie was going to interact with her daughter's friends at first it seemed that she was going to spew a lot of animosity but once she started interacting more pleasantly i had to see how this visit was going to unfold i wasn't disappointed gradually the secrets that sara kept from her mother started to reveal a daughter who was not so perfect a flawed human being like most of us who wanted her freedom from a domineering mother who thought she knew her daughter but unfortunately had to learn in a very painful manner that sometimes to really love someone you have to give them their freedom the viewers who stuck with this film to the end saw a very touching performance from diane keaton who is always wonderful even in some of her less well received films think town and country the closing scene of diane keaton driving home was well worth waiting for revealing that anyone who loves another human being has got to learn that we have to live our own lives we love others but don't own them and ultimately we have to let go it's a hard lesson but well worth contemplating now and then thank you cbs for this broadcast it was worth the long wait
<START> if you make it through the opening credits this may be your type of movie from the first screen image of a woman holding her hands up to her face with white sheets blowing in the background one recalls a pretentious perfume commercial it's all downhill from there br br the lead actress is basically a block of wood who uses her computer to reach into the past and reconstruct the memories of photographs to talk history's overlooked genius ada who conceived the first computer language in the 1800s br br the low budget graphics would be forgivable if they were interesting or even somewhat integral to the script br br poor tilda swinton is wasted
<START> you probably all already know this by now but 5 additional episodes never aired can be viewed on abc com i've watched a lot of television over the years and this is possibly my favorite show ever it's a crime that this beautifully written and acted show was canceled the actors that played laura whit carlos mae damian anya and omg steven caseman are all incredible and so natural in those roles even the kids are great wonderful show so sad that it's gone of course i wonder about the reasons it was canceled there is no way i'll let myself believe that ms moynahan's pregnancy had anything to do with it it was in the perfect time slot in this market i've watched all the episodes again on abc com i hope they all come out on dvd some day thanks for reading
<START> have you ever had a cool image in your mind that you thought it would be nice to be in a movie like seeing a detective peeking through the cracks of a broken fence of some abandoned house or seeing a woman walking down a street looking cold and intense and awfully alert yeah imagine stretching that image to a whole movie you pretty much got the idea of broken though there's no detectives in this movie i'm just using it as a visual example but the intense looking woman is here and she filled pretty much 99 of the screen time i got nothing to complain about that woman she's a perfect choice for this role br br i consider myself a very open minded individual who can find enjoyment out of all kinds of artistic expressions and i can truly enjoy some really moody stuff it would be really cool if i can frame one of the scene from this movie and hang it on the wall let's be honest here the acting is superb some of the expressions on the actors face are what keep me watching br br now onto the problem of this movie beyond the mood there's not much anything else here the director basically took an obsession of an idea and ran it far beyond what it was worth i don't consider it to be a spoiler if i say the obsession is mirror let's face it this singular idea is all over the bloody place and that's all the director got to work with granted there are a few twist and turn here and there if you paid any attention nothing is going to surprise you in the end obvious plot holes aside br br now i'm not picking bones with this style of art since i enjoyed them most of the time i still believe that we should judge an art base on the medium it uses to express whatever the artists want to express movie is not a piece of music or a picture or a painting or even a poem and certainly not just a cool image in your mind it's all that plus a good story and character development i consider the lynch style of movie making cheating it is irresponsible and cheap and a waste of the medium we gave movies 2 hours running film time for a good reason therefore we should judge it differently than judging a single frame of imagery such as a photograph or a painting br br this movie is not completely lynch style thank goodness it has a linear development and eventually came to a conclusion it does not have much story or character development it presented itself rather seriously with characters composed of common folks thus distance itself from other fantasy stuff at least from the surface it does not offer any explanation of the fantasy element nor did it ever attempt to build a coherent world around it the oddity came from nowhere and seems rather isolated and accidental maybe the coherency remains in director's head but from what i can see he did not put much effort into realizing it on the screen br br where did he put his effort in then it seems that he spent a lot of effort in building the mood and enhancing it with the music the music often built up tension which eventually turn into a tease only in the later part of the movie the scare and tension materialized br br in the end i felt like ok i know what you are trying to say here but is that the point you are trying to make by spending two hours building up all these tension it is rather irrelevant with who the characters are and what kind of life they have and we are given very little about who the characters are all we have is this circumstance that just took placed disappointing but i guess the director did not have much material to work with and it shows
<START> slim slam slum is a sad and disappointing picture there is absolutely no reason to this sorry excuse for a picture don t go there what ever you do don t watch tv shop for 10 hours straight instead that way you will be slightly amused
<START> mgm were unsure of how to market garbo when she first arrived in hollywood mayer had a lot of faith in her and her appearance in torrent justified that she did not speak a word of english so she must have found it difficult to work also ricardo cortez did not make it very easy for her br br the torrent of the title is the river juscar that winds through a sleepy little village in spain leonora greta garbo hopes someday that her voice will bring great wealth and happiness to her struggling parents leonora and don rafael ricardo cortez are in love but he is under his mother's thumb and cannot get her to consent to his marriage meanwhile dona brull martha mattox has evicted leonora's parents from their home and they send leonora to paris hoping to give her a chance to further her singing career leonora sends a note to rafael urging him to remember his promise and come with her his mother is enraged and forbids him to go so of course he caves in to her request br br years pass leonora has a new identity she has become la brunna the toast of the paris opera rafael has turned out just as his mother wished he is running for office and is courting a safe young girl remedios gertrude olmstead who is a hog heiress mack swain plays her father leonora decides to visit her old home and i agree why hasn't she helped her mother out her mother is still living at the family home working as a skivvy and taking in washing leonora and rafael meet but leonora is full of ridicule garbo is so enchantingly beautiful it is hard to believe that he could be happy with remedios br br the dam is bursting and the torrent is flooding the town leonora's house is in the path of the raging river but when rafael attempts to rescue her he finds she is quite safe they then re kindle their romance there is a horizontal love scene in this film very similar to the one in flesh and the devil br br dona brull goes spreading gossip about how leonora really got her wealth and leonora's mother believes her and tells leonora to go rafael meets leonora just before she is about to tour america again he intends to go with her but again he lets her down he spends so much time listening to other people destroy her reputation what will she do for you but drag you down the irony is she has just secured a top government job for him if he comes with her they meet again years later she is as fresh and vibrant as ever he looks older than his years bowed down by mediocrity br br it is certainly a good film with a positive message to follow your heart br br lucien littlefield does a good job as cupido the barber and leonora's old and faithful friend br br highly recommended
