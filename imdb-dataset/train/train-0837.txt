<START> even though this was a disaster in the box office it is my favorite film it gives a powerful message of family it has a lot of violence and has one song with a bunch of girls in bikinis compared to other bollywood films the action scenes in this movie are more realistic it is an incredible combination of akshay kumar and amitabh bachchan if you want to see the indian godfather amitabh portrays that in this film don't read reviews by critic they're just ignorant this movie has good mix of comedy romance drama and especially action so if you want to see action more realistic than main hoon na still good movie this is the movie
<START> this is a movie that has a lot of things that only japanese people can understand even well translated there are some things that are obviously private jokes or regional symbolism my guess is that it tried to send a message of some sort but that just got wasted on me br br what i felt that is basically this is a mediocre movie with nice special effects some kid becomes the one and in the end has almost no relevance to a yokai war that makes no sense whatsoever anyway it would have been nice to understand what the hell they were talking about but between the azumi bean washing yokai and the one that looks like a big tongued umbrella rihanna eat your heart out i couldn't really discern the plot br br bottom line nice visuals the kid screams a lot the river princess is terrible cute and the rest is crap
<START> stereotyped derivative unoriginal and boring western the two popular stars charlton heston and james coburn both give performances that are far from their best and justifiably so they both have superficial roles and character traits stated mainly by dialogue heston is a sheriff who liked the world better as it used to be before and coburn is an outlaw who owes something to the man who locked him up and has to pay his debt additionally heston is so old that he has trouble riding a horse and coburn is mean and tough but not as cold blooded a killer as some of the minor villains apparently the filmmakers couldn't come up with even one original idea about how to make this movie somewhat distinguished 1 2
<START> it surprisingly had a plot i've seen movies with less plot i don't wanna mention asian movies but i thought the camera wasn't bad at all for a cheap movie like this and also the atmosphere wasn't too bad there is no real reason for most things people do and the way they react to what happens although i do think that about a lot of movies in this case it was horrible of course br br it ripped off some movies so badly just for single scenes the acting was bad but i've seen worse the movie was bad but i've seen worse watching this film is an experience between boredom laughing fits death wish sadism horniness and entertainment on a low level br br so if you like gory movies with stupid plots this one is the right film for you br br i gave it 3 10 because it can be entertaining if you don't expect to see a good movie and you're in the right mood
<START> this movie is a bad attempt to make original fans feel complete the one thing people have forgotten is the fact that the reason the original won such acclaim was strictly do to the fact that it was supposed to make you feel incomplete br br this movie makes me want to go to the washroom i am not a negative type of guy but man the acting in this flick is no comment the plot was a bad reflection of the life of carlito brigante and i am sorry to have had two hours of my time and my money wasted on this flick i still love the original and will do my best not to let this movie ruin my opinion about it
<START> well tivo recorded this because of angelina jolie it had 2 5 stars it seemed promising it went downhill fast br br there is much overacting even from angelina she's about 20 and playing a 16 year old there are three characters that are supposed to be italian everyone else is italian american the native italian accents were good i thought the young male lead is cute my wife says everyone else in this movie is a fat italian woman even the men br br i should have known that when dick van patten was cast as a randy doctor that that was a bad sign the two couples chasing their kids around are like the four italian stooges br br my wife would not let go of the remote hopefully she was not taking makeup clothing or decorating tips it was a sick and twisted combination of hideous and garish it was hidegarishous br br cutting off my left ventricle was not sufficient to distract from the pain of watching this movie if this movie shows up on your tv do yourself a favor and ram your head through the tv screen instead you'll be glad you did the only movie i've ever seen that was worse than this was hamburger the movie or maybe deadly friend
<START> it might be a little erroneous to open a review by describing a film in terms of other films but i think it's the best way to give an approximation of the place election occupies in the gangster genre arena it works somewhere in between the godfather and kinji fukasaku's yakuza opus the yakuza papers aka battles without honour and humanity in that it is simultaneously both romanticized and realistic dark and gritty but it's also a johnnie to film and as such it carries the distinct touch of the hong kong auteur br br every two years the hk triad elects a new boss only this time one of the candidates is not overly happy with the result so he decides to take matters into his own hands much to the dismay of the rest of the triads and the police that's the story in a nutshell but rest assured it has a lot more going for it than that as in the yakuza papers there's a great deal of scheming back stabbing and forming and switching of allegiances sometimes all it takes is a phone call in one of the most memorable scenes i've seen in recent time which might not necessarily make for deep drama but makes for an interesting plot and good character conflict fans of the gangster genre are likely to appreciate it in that aspect election is not as action oriented as one might expect although it is violent and i'm not talking about the glossy glamour version of hollywood violence this is dark and grim to's camera lingers in the scenes of people being brutalized in ways that reveal both the humanity and inhumanity of the perpetrators and victims after all violence is an integral part of us whether we like it or not br br if you're familiar with to's style then you should know what to expect the pacing is relatively slow and deliberate the cinematography is great slick and dark in equal measures utilizing dark hues brown dark green and orange while the smooth tracking shots add a vibrant quality to it in the end election occupies a peculiar place it's not exactly a character study and it's not an action oriented gangster film it explores a situation the election and its aftermath but does so in style and is both realistic and romanticized the triad ceremonies in particular echo of an oriental godfather
<START> elephant walk may not be the acme of literature or of film but it is great entertainment in the quasi melodramatic mode it is the story of love both genuine and illicit as well as overweening ambition devotion and the arrogance of personal tyranny a previous reviewer john mankin questions why the central focus of the film the mansion called elephant walk should have been built by the former owner the governor the late tom wiley right across the elephants' traditional path to the major source of water the river to miss this point is to essentially miss the point of the whole center of the film the hubris of man that his son played by peter finch should become enthralled by the super image and enigma of his revered father is not unexpected since the son was without a mother growing up in a foreign jungle with only his father and his father's rowdy 'boys' club' as his role models the point of the father was that he was a self made man who would tame nature to his liking and that liking was not just a tea plantation upon the lands the elephants once dominated but also that he would dominate even the large bull elephant that led the herd and thus he would dominate his son and all around him and so we join the tale after the elephants have been denied the crucial dry season access to their pathway to water who could know that this dry season would last so long and what the elephants would do in desperation to get water this is the nexus of the film what will animals do to get water what will humans do to get power or love ceylon today's sri lanka is the huge island off the coast of india where the plantation is located and one quickly learns that it is the real scenery of the story not just the expenses of miss taylor were it not for this exotic location much of the film was shot in ceylon and the magnificent bungalow this would have been just another potboiler one must recognize the atmosphere created here as integral to the time and place as it illuminates the latter day wealth and power attained by the english immigrant 'conquerors' that were part and parcel of the british raj it is only such wealth gained by the use of virtual slave labor that one could build so magnificent a residence of ebony teak and marble not to be overlooked are the wonderfully carved jalees grille work window and doorway borders evidently specified by art directors j mcmillan johnson and hal pereira and obviously made by the cheaper labor on the island such craftsmanship reveals the careful attention to detail that these men sought br br for those immune to the blandishments of time place and architecture there is always the allure of miss taylor as she marries a man she doesn't really know and is tacitly wooed by a another man against the background described and under the overarching tyranny of the legacy of a man deceased as i said it is not great literature nor even great film but it is great spectacle long before that term was debased by the special effects extravaganzas of today br br this is one of those films made to be seen on the giant screen of an outdoor drive in not on the home tv so arrange the largest screen to see it on to fully appreciate its fine camera work and scope
<START> this was filmed back to back with the 1992 re make of conan doyle's famous novel 'the lost world' and it shows br br the film starts promisingly enough with a ruthless organization intending to exploit the lost world and challenger et al returning to defend the prehistoric plateau but then things go downhill everybody is stranded on the plateau and we're left with a feeble boring over length rehash of the first film br br the dinosaurs who are hardly ever seen are just laughable are we expected to take that cuddly toy that's supposed to be an ankylosaur seriously and the tyrannosaur seems rooted to the spot br br do yourself a favor and get hold of the 1925 silent version of the lost world unbelievably in this age of cgi and other advanced effects the twenties version is the best and will remain so until somebody finally decides to do a decent re make
<START> this movie is the worst movie i have ever seen it is humorous how bad it is the entire time i was watching it i half expected music to start and the doctor starts dancing i've seen porno's with a better plot when the raptor was trying to get in the door i think someone was throwing a plastic doll against the door from about 2 feet away but as i said it is so bad you need to watch it so that you can see just how bad it is me explaining it isn't going to do anything compared to if you watch it i don't recommend renting it but if it comes on tv watch it for about 30min just to see what i mean i couldn't watch more than 30min but if you can sit through the whole thing then you have some good willpower
<START> mark frechette stars as mark a college radical leftist mark is accused of killing a cop during a campus riot and he flees all the way to the desert he does so by stealing a small plane at the local airport and flies it himself br br once out flying over the desert mark spots a car from the air a young woman named daria steps out and sees mark circling in the plane mark swoops the plane very low several times causing daria to duck or get hit when he lands he becomes acquainted with daria who is strangely charmed by mark's aerial highjinks br br after engaging in soulful conversation for hours mark and daria get naked and make love in the sand but with mark evading the law they realize that he needs to keep running so mark and daria's brief tryst is quite poignant because it doesn't get to develop into a full blown romance br br zabriski point was the eraserhead of the early 70s both films have a rambling vague quality along with complicated meanings and characters frechette was as reckless in person as his character was in this film a few years after making zabriski point frechette robbed a bank in real life while serving his prison sentence mark died an ignoble death he was killed by a 150 lb weight which fell on him when he was weightlifting br br the best thing about this movie was the splendid cinematography and special visual effects the incredible slow motion scenes of debris floating in the air after an explosion were a stroke of genius although not as ground breaking a film as easy rider was zabriski point still resonated with the early 70s counterculture i recommend it for those who like avant guard films which showcase the upheaval of the youth rebellion during the early 70s
<START> i'm no big fan of martial arts movies but the video shop was nearly empty and jet li was in lethal weapon 4 and i got it free when the other films i'd rented either way i rented it i absolutely loved it my flatmate and myself 22 year old biochemistry and accountancy students spent the half hour after the film making strange kung fu noises and throwing beermat shurikens at each other i can't explain it well maybe a little tequila i never enjoyed bruce lee skinny bloke kicking big bloke beating him kicking bigger bloke etc film ends think jackie chan with a little less comedy and more action
<START> i really liked this movie and went back to see it two times more within a week br br ms detmers nailed the performance she was like a hungry cat on the prowl toying with her prey she lashes out in rage and lust taking a too young lover and crashing hundreds of her terrorist fiancÃ©'s mother's pieces of fine china to the floor br br the film was full of beautiful touches the maserati the wonderful wardrobe the flower boxes along the rooftops i particularly enjoyed the ancient greek class and the recitation of 'antigone' br br it had a feeling of 'story of o' that is where people of means indulge in unrestrained sexual adventure as she walks around the fantastic apartment in the buff she is at ease and why not what is to restrain a devil in the flesh br br the whole movie is a real treat
<START> oh my where to start this movie was just awful the writing was bad acting was bad special effects were bad i think the only good thing about this movie is that it made me laugh i was in the mood for a scary movie but certainly didn't get that i thought it would be decent enough since i'm not picky i've watched several bad horror movies in fact it is my goal to see all horror movies not matter how awful they may be at one point in the movie i made a comment about the corn syrup blood and in the special features they actually admit that it was karo syrup brand name corn syrup the movie had all the necessary things for a horror movie blood nudity crazy killer stupid moves but it was just completely lacking anything to really make it good the writer should either take some classes or just give up
<START> i did not like the pretentious and overrated apocalypse now probably my favorite vietnam war film is the deer hunter the deer hunter focused on one part of the war and then focused on the lives before the war this movie is essentially deer hunter 2 the script is too loose compared to the deer hunter the story is never developed to the point that the audience can truly understand and feel for the characters like the deerhunter did the vietnam flashbacks are not as gripping or involved as the ones in the deerhunter this is why i can only give this movie 7 out of 10 br br however i think that the acting was outstanding deniro and harris are truly amazing actors they totally immersed themselves in their characters and expressed the great anguish of two former friends who lost their best friend bobby in combat harris' character is a half dead alcoholic who hides the guilt that he has in bobby losing his life trying to save his br br i also like the supporting cast everyone in the town is part of the movie the town obviously can't handle vietnam vets very well like many small towns it is all about being quiet humble and minding one's business harris' character however can't be any of these things it is interesting how wars effect people some people rebound quickly while others never really recover
<START> beware spoilers this movie was okay goldie hawn and chris sarandon were the best two in it okay so the goofie foreign guy who spoiler here trades with the biker for his clothes was funny this guy's boss was good too but the movie really belonged to sarandon and hawn these two should have had a lot more time on screen together they're chemistry was great the bathroom scene wow romantic sweet yummy br br hawn is a goofy cocktail waitress who saves a foreign man and ends up at the whitehouse in the middle of a plot due to the greed of politicians to talk about sarandon would be to give a lot away spoilers this is a rather untypical romantic political comedy and it satisfies both somewhat the political side a whole lot more than the romantic it touches on political issues and just barely skims on romantic areas br br
<START> a very strange and compelling movie it's about a very awkward and tightly wound man who attempts to navigate his life as a door to door fundraiser salesman the director was able to capture a very unnerving tone that really served the story well original and unsettling while also finding a great deal of humor in the pain that accompanies life there is a sequence at a testing facility that really stood out and made me laugh out loud which is not something i do as frequently as i should one of the more memorable films i've seen in a long while hasn't left my mind and i look forward to future efforts by bronstein fantastic performances all around the simple line i really appreciate it is now iconic to me
<START> how can anybody say that this movie is a comedy if i had not gone with then my finacee i would have fallen asleep and asked for my money back i love gwen paltrow but it was like she was on the wrong set i like most chick flicks but i hated this one this is the only time i saw so much clevage and was not turned on those outfits were way overdone no one talks that way anymore and i don't think they even did then the dancing part was horrible my ex said to me later didn't ya like that part didn't ya think it was sensous i said yes only to spare her feelings now i know why we never married this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
<START> this film is in the mandingo drum type br br they were both dreadful but they are 100 better than this tripe br br badly acted made oliver reed is the main name eartha kitt also is in it tis a pity rating is 1 2 about as low as yu can get br br as always br br jay harris
<START> and what a combo two of the century's great singers star together in this underrated musical he writes music she writes lyrics and they both work for basil rathbone who can't write either because his wife died actually she just got fat best scene is the pawn shop number where bing sings an impromptu number while the swing band gets their instruments out of hock just wonderful and this is a rare starring role for broadway legend mary martin and she's quite good charley grapewin john scott trotter william frawley oscar levant once again the manic pianist charles lane and helen bertram co star and who knew rathbone could be funny
