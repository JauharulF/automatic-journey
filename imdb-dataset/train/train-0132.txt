<START> i must admit this is one of my favorite horror films of all time the unique way that john carpenter has directed this picture opening the door to so many mock genres it will chill you to the bone whether it is your first time watching it or your fiftieth the sound the menacing horror of michael meyers and the infamous scream of jamie lee curtis gives this film instant cult status and a great start for the independent era i love the music i love the characters the familiar yet spooky setting the simplistic nature of the villain and the random chaos of it all there is no really rhyme or reason to the killing in this first film giving us a taste of michael's true nature is he insane or in some way just a very brilliant beast that question may never be truly answered but carpenter gives us his 100 and more devotion to this amazing masterpiece br br john carpenter is the master of horror while lately his films have not been the caliber that they once were see ghosts of mars halloween began his powerhouse of a career this is his ultimate film while he did release other greats i will always remember this one as the film that caused me to turn on all the lights beware when babysitting and check behind closed doors because you never knew where the evil would appear next carpenter has this amazing ability to bring you into the world in which he weaves with the power of his camera he places these images of meyers in places you least expected while giving you the perception as if the murderer is right next to you i loved every scene in which we panned back and there was michael watching from the distance without anyone the wiser that was scary yet utterly brilliant i loved the scenes in which carpenter pulled your fright from nearly thin air there you would be minding your own business when suddenly that horrid mask would appear out of nowhere like the characters you too thought it was just a trick of the eye but that is where carpenter gets you it isn't michael isn't a ghost he is a human being or at least we think yet he has a stronger mental ability than most of the main characters this leads into some really dark themes and unexplored symbolism but even without that this is a spooky film br br then if you just didn't have enough of michael just vaporizing in the windows of your house carpenter adds that chilling theme music i still have that tapping of the piano keys in my mind constantly wondering if meyers is looking at me through the window carpenter has found the perfect combination of visual frights and chilling sounds to foreshadow what may happen to our unsuspecting victims next it is lethal and it is done with refreshing originality and more unique thrills than anything released by today's horror hollywood could muster carpenter's halloween is a breath of fresh air in the midst of what could be a rough horror year with actual scares being replaced by paris hilton you know that the quality isn't quite the same br br finally i would like to say that even the simplistic nature of the opening murder in this film is terrifying and chilling the use of the clown mask sent shivers up my spine the way that it was filmed with that elongated one shot using the child's mask as if it were our own eyes is still one of the best horror openings ever it completely sets the tone for the remainder of that film you have the babysitter theme you have the childish behavior which carries with michael throughout the film and you have the art talent of carpenter all rolled into one i could literally speak for hours upon hours about this film but instead i would rather go watch it again it is worth the repeat visit many times br br overall i think this is one of the most outstanding films in cinematic history skip all those foreign films that think that they are going to chance the face of movies leave it to a budget tight carpenter and the slasher film genre this singular movie redefined a whole generation of horror films and still continues to be an influence on modern day horror treats the lethal combination of a genuinely spooky murderer the powerful cinematography of the events which normally doesn't amount to much in horror films and the beauty of jamie lee curtis is exactly what makes halloween that film above the rest sure freddy is cool and you feel sympathetic for jason but michael is real he is troubled and he is on the loose lusting for the blood of babysitters what can be better br br grade out of
<START> i liked this movie cute and funny i found this film to be a good family film the dirtiest part of this movie was when it made references to the new york yankees you have to be in red sox nation to understand that ny yankees is a dirty word sorry to say that to the yankee's fans i recommend this picture for the entire family of course with your typical love comedy movie there's a long moment in the movie with i'm in love and what do i do but the movie makes up for that with all the slapstick moments the movie show's some moments of how the red sox nation in fenway park how the fans felt about 86 years of the sox always screwed up at the end of the season and how the love of the sox and the love with another human go hand to hand
<START> the film had many fundamental values of family and love it expressed human emotion and was an inspiring story the script was clear it was very easy to understand making it perfect for children and was enjoyable and humorous at times there were a few charged symbols to look for the cinematography was acceptable there was no sense of experimentation that a lot of cinematographers have been doing today which quiet frankly is getting a little warn out it was plainly filmed but had a nice soft quality to it although editing could have been done better i thought it was a nice movie for a family to enjoy and the organization of information was just thrown at you which was something i didn't like either but in all it was a good movie
<START> on first watching this film it is hard to know quite what has happened but on a subsequent viewing it become more clear i enjoyed this movie dean cain was excellent in the role of bob lexa doig's character was confusing to understand at first she was out to trap bob but i really believe she landed up loving him although by then she had broken his heart dean cain's performance was an usual excellent he gets better with every film he does my only question at the end of the film was what happened to bob camilla and the baby it was left for the viewer to decide
<START> mario's first foray into the world of 3 dimensions is incredible miyamoto's masterpiece was reason enough to buy a nintendo 64 when it was released in 1996 and it still holds all of it's charm today this game is an instant classic that set the standard for 3d adventure platform games
<START> as much as i like big epic pictures i'll spare you the namedropping it's great to kick back with a few beers and a simple action flick sometimes films where the plot takes a backseat to the set pieces films where the dialogue isn't so cleverly written that it ties itself in endless knots of purple prose there are hundreds of films that fit the bill but in my opinion gone in sixty seconds is one of the better ones br br it's an update of the movie that shares its name it also shares that picture's ethos but not quite it's execution whatever was great about the original has been streamlined whatever was streamlined was also amped up thanks to a bigger budget often these kinds of endeavours are recipes for complete disaster see the pug ugly remake of the italian job for one that blew it but here thanks to a cast of mostly excellent actors sixty succeeds br br the plot and much of the dialogue isn't much to write imdb about often you'll have scenes where the same line of dialogue goes back and forth between the actors each of whom will voice it with different inflections a lot of people found this annoying i find it raises a smile each actor gets a chance to show off his or her definition of style here with cage jolie and duvall leading the pack of course and it should be noted that it's also amusing to see mrs pitt not given first billing here the chemistry between good ol' saint nick the stalwart see date of review and angelina leads to a couple of nice moments br br the villain is not even a little scary i've seen chris eccleston play tough guy roles before so i know he can handle them but i think he was deliberately directed to make his role inconsequential as not to distract from the action we know the heroes are going to succeed somehow we're just sitting in the car with them enjoying the ride i think a lot of these scenes were played with tongue so far in cheek that it went over the heads of a lot of people giving this a poor rating in fact i wouldn't have minded some fourth wall breaking winks at the camera it's just that kind of movie br br all this style and not so much substance something that often exhausts my patience if not executed just so would be worthless if the action wasn't there and for the most part it is wonderfully so i've noticed that it seems to be a common trend to be using fast cut extreme close up shots to direct action these days i personally find this kind of thing exhausting i prefer movies like this where the stunts are impressive enough to not need artificial tension ramping by raping tight shots all the time i've been told that cage actually did as many of the car stunts as he could get away with without losing his insurance in real life i mean his character clearly doesn't care and it shows the man can really move a vehicle and this is put to good use in the slow burning climatic finale where he drives a mustang into the ground in the most outlandish and fun way possible br br so yes this movie isn't an epic life affirming post 9 11 picture with obligatory social commentary effort the pacing is uneven some of the scenes could have been cut and not all the actors tow the line but car movies rarely come better than this so if you hate cars why are you even reading these comments br br i'd take it over the numerous iterations of the flaccid and the tedious guess the franchise any day 7 10
<START> hollywood always had trouble coming to terms with a religious picture strange cargo proves to be no exception although utilizing the talents of a superb cast and produced on a top budget with suitably moody photography by robert planck the movie fails dismally on the credibility score perhaps the reason is that the film seems so realistic that the sudden intrusion of fantasy elements upsets the viewer's involvement in the action and with the fate of the characters i found it difficult to sit still through all the contrived metaphors parallels and biblical references and impossible to accept bathed in light ian hunter's smug know it all as a christ figure and the censors in boston detroit and providence at least agreed with me the movie was banned few boston detroit providence moviegoers if any complained or journeyed to other cities because it was obvious from the trailer that gable and crawford had somehow become involved in a message picture it flopped everywhere br br oddly enough the movie has enjoyed something of a revival on tv a home atmosphere appears to make the movie's allegory more receptive to viewers however despite its growing reputation as a strange or unusual film the plot of this strange cargo flows along predictable heavily moralistic lines that will have no one guessing how the principal characters will eventually come to terms with destiny
<START> two adventurous teenagers best friends take a trip to thailand for one last experience before separating and going off to college it seems like a fun time of touring an exotic land until they meet an attractive stranger who seduces them into taking a trip to hong kong and puts drugs in their luggage they get nabbed by the local police and find that justice in asia is very different from justice in the u s br br this is the main story line for brokedown palace and it was a good one the film does a decent job of portraying the arbitrary and corrupt justice systems of third world nations actually the portrayal was rather mild as the prison conditions are often far worse than depicted it serves as a reminder that no matter how bad we think our justice system is it is pristine by comparison to much of the rest of the world br br unfortunately there were too many contrived situations in the film that hampered the story the whole escape attempt was bogus fantasy to think that friends would be able to smuggle money for a bribe into the prison in a padded bra and not be discovered by the guards who were systematically checking everything brought in from visitors assumes that either the guards or the viewers are utter blockheads br br the story also fails to bring closure to the nagging question of how the drugs got in alice's claire danes backpack did she actually agree to transport the drugs we are left to guess it was intriguing to be kept guessing about the girls' innocence throughout the film but we finish the movie never really knowing if one or both of the girls might be guilty except for this considerable flaw the ending was excellent and the results unexpected br br the acting by claire danes and kate beckinsale was very solid and well done danes who has been oversold and over hyped actually arrived as an actor in this film though her portrayal was frequently immature as was her character she improved as the film progressed and the circumstances became more dire beckinsale in contrast has been flying under the radar her whole brief career and shines as the goody two shoes who suddenly finds herself in prison her's was the best performance in the film br br bill pullman was miscast as the lawyer his wry and diffident style is an asset in films like while you were sleeping but as a lawyer in a third world country on a crusade to free two innocent girls from injustice he had the wrong personality br br the tourist's look at thailand was interesting but it didn't make me want to go there br br overall an entertaining film made implausible in parts by the insertion of some ridiculous scenes i gave it a 7 10
<START> of course he did have to invent everything about cinematography film directing etc before he could make classics like the gardner so i suppose he may be forgiven this initial excursion into mere sociological documentary today we call them home movies and they are just as boring now as this one is
<START> this isn't the first time stanley blurred the distinction between genres to such great effect either in dr strangelove you had a comedy about a horrific situation and here the basis is a terrifying scenario which actually yields some very funny moments slow burning madness and attempting to kill one's family isn't hilarious of course but the dialogue is very knowing five months of peace is just what i want and there is a terrific drinking scene which would be riotous if you included just one type of spirit but is spine chilling when you factor in the other br br i disagree with those who say that the hotel has a negligible effect on jack torrance in the filmed version the cues nicholson provides the audience as an actor merely hint at the potential for madness which is only reinforced when we learn that the head of the family has struggled with alcoholism and is emotionally distant from his wife and son the environment that he is in however then absorbs those personality defects and unleashes them upon his consciousness in much the same way as buildings are sometimes thought to soak up events that happen there the hotel feeds on the frailties of a troubled but sane man and uses his weaknesses against him to eventually take him beyond the point of no return he may have dormant flaws in his personality before he arrives but to me the overlook itself is the trigger that sets them off br br kubrick's cold and detached approach to directing works splendidly for a chilly horror film and the unpredictable force of nature that is jack nicholson teeters all the time between making you giggle and scaring the wits out of you when he explodes you won't be sure how far he can go together they made a great team and with a blend of their talents gave us a classic if you want a great viewing experience then this is an example that well and truly shines
<START> twenty years ago the five years old boy michael hawthorne witnessed his father killing his mother with an axe in an empty road and committing suicide later on the present days michael gordon currie invites his girlfriend peg stacy grant and his best friends chris myc agnew jennifer emmanuelle vaugier lisa ann kelly benson ned brendon beiser mitch maldive phillip rhys and trish rachel hayward to spend the halloween in the country with his grandparents in their farm he asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest innermost fear and together with his indian friend crow byron chief moon they would perform an ancient indian celebration using the carved wooden dummy morty jon fedele that would eliminate their fears forever the greatest fear of michael is to become a serial killer like his father but something goes wrong and morty turns into his father killing his friends br br the fear resurrection is a disappointing and pointless slash movie that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the greatest innermost fear of each friend before it grows but in a messy screenplay full of clichÃ©s there are some exaggerated performances like for example ms betsy palmer others very weak but in general the acting is good unfortunately there is no explanation why the dummy is brought to live further in spite of being surrounded by close friends the group does not feel pain or sorrow when each one of them dies the low pace along more than fifty minutes could have been used to built a better dramatic situation in the very end michael shows a charm that his father was interested that i have not noticed along the story i do not know whether the previous reference was edited in the dvd released in brazil with 87 minutes running time the special effects are very reasonable for a b movie my vote is four br br title brazil fear 2 uma noite de halloween fear 2 one night of halloween
<START> my first full heston movie the movie that everyone already knows the ending to a sci fi thriller the campy factor everything that goes with this movie was injected in my head when i rented it and on the morning that i watched it it was the perfect movie to watch in the mood that i was in not wanting to move put in player hide in blankets and though i tried to understand what was happening to lead to the ending that will be eternally ruined by pop culture it just really didn't make it everything was all over the place relationships had no backbone the ending had no lead in everything was just kind of there in some freakish way and the watcher has no choice but to leave partially dumbfounded at the ending that it gets to because even though we all know that it's people it's quick answers as to why it's people makes any serious attempt at enjoying the movie for anything other than the silliness thrown out the window
<START> ang lee clearly likes to ease into a film to catch action characters and setting on the hoof as they emerge covering the haphazard endgame of the american civil war via the haphazard actions of a young militia unformed in mind or manhood this is an ideal approach the film turns out to be about the formation of personalities adulthood and relationships lee also shows the beautiful panoramas of the mid south as a silent character enduring the strife like a hardy parent br br james schamus' script is probably the standard bearer for this film close behind it are a number of well appointed performances that carry it admirably jeffrey wright's name alone could carry this film for me he's brilliant here but in a slow burning role instead we are treated to very good if not revelatory performances from a large often recognisable ensemble br br a noble optimistic film one to watch if you don't fancy the harder more bittersweet cold mountain or the claim for example 7 10
<START> oh the sixties there were some interesting films i was more of a movie goer then i now enjoy renting movies and relaxing in my home rather than going to the theater i also saw this short film the legend of the boy and the eagle i have been searching for this film for years it was truly inspiring surprisingly i was finally able to gather more information from your site thank you i'm surprised to find out that this short film was an opening for a disney picture i too did not remember the disney film i did not even remember that it was an opening film for disney i truly wish they would show this on tv sometime i wonder if disey holds the rights to this film is it available on dvd this is a must see for all generations
<START> the endless bounds of our inhumanity to our own kind never fails to stun me this truly astonishing story of a horrifically abused and largely unheard of population is compelling well documented and enraging as an american i am constantly humiliated by my country's behaviour and this is just another in our long catalogue of international debasement we suck this is probably the first john pilger documentary i've seen but it immediately made me want to see what else he's done my only complaint and the reason i gave this film only 8 out of 10 is that pilger shows us this travesty and the appalling collaboration of the us and uk governments demands that we viewers citizens are complicit in our own inaction but makes no suggestion of how to help i don't know about britain but america's made it nearly impossible for the citizenry to take part in their government's doings a gesture in the right direction might help these islanders' cause
<START> in theodore rex poor whoopi goldberg is set up as a tough police cop who gets to work with a pathetic dinosaur on a case the movie tries to be funny and tries to make a story about abductions and more but it never works the movie is far from funny and the story is ridiculous i voted 1 10
<START> i liked how this started out featuring some decent special effects especially for a film 50 years old there was some pretty impressive scenery however the film bogs down fairly early on with some very dumb dialog as the males all try to flirt with anne francis altaira morbius br br viewing this in the '90s after a long absence it was fun to see francis again an actress who has done mostly television shows since this film was released and is still acting it also was interesting to see a young looking leslie nielsen dr john j adams who i wouldn't have recognized had it not been for this voice br br i watched half of this movie before the boredom came almost overwhelming and i had a strong desire to go to sleep i appreciated them re doing this vhs tape in stereo but it was a weak effort this is one those overrated film where elites think is so heavy and thought provoking that's nonsense it only appeared intelligent because the rest of the '50s sci fi films were so stupid br br some if the early scenes would have looked great on wideescreen which i didn't have at the time of this writing perhaps another look this time on the 2 35 1 widescreen transfer would make me change this review
<START> being a giant monster fan me seeing yeti was an absolute must especially after hearing so much about it thanks to the good 'ol bootleg market i was able to find a copy pretty easily and was happily surprised upon watching that this flick was actually dare i say decent br br decent for what it is actually namely a cheesy giant monster flick it kicks in pretty quickly as yeti is found pretty much immediately and we get introduced to various characters they consist of some sleazy ones some good ones and a girl who is pretty much one of the most downright strikingly beautiful girls in any cheesy sci fi film by far br br yeti looks like a long haired guy straight out of the original woodstock concert and really he's not that bad of a dude especially after being introduced to the world in some kind of funky cage like thing godzilla he is not despite his rude awakening he doesn't even rampage actually he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture but kinda just looks puzzled while trying to figure things out yeti seems to understand english pretty nicely my copy was dubbed in english and he knows who the good guys and bad guys are br br however we want to see the giant yeti do his thing and he's pretty much in the whole movie and in typical low budget fashion he seems to change size a lot depending on the scene and there's even a bunch of the fake legs shots of him just standing there br br yes the special effects aren't the greatest but there are definitely some good ones here a scene where yeti smashes through a warehouse is done very well and in another he uses the windows of a building as ladder steps to climb down from the top of it shattering each window with his foot and often shocking the occupants inside in one sequence that really looks much much better than it should in such a bad movie br br yeti never stoops as low as say a p e does actually the only time it even comes close to genuine silliness is when the beautiful girl causes yeti's nipple to become erect and he lifts his eyebrow in an oh yeah baby manner but even this isn't that bad and kinda even gets a laugh out of the viewer br br the movie is pretty long for this kind of thing but surprisingly enough it doesn't get boring the story is actually good and just watching this utterly gorgeous actress on screen will make any male viewer happy br br yeti may not be in the upper echelon of giant monster flicks but it is definitely better than other king kong '76 rip offs like a p e and queen kong by very far
<START> steven seagal appears to be sleepwalking through a dreadful movie shot almost entirely in close up to disguise the complete lack of budget and resources to pick on the technical flaws silver f a 18s and f 14s take of from a carrier for an air strike and miraculously become camouflaged f 16s for the actual strike would give this movie more credibility than it deserves suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the movie is the credit titles which fade on and then disappear in a lightning wipe which presumably is available to all users of final cut pro putting all your creativity into your own credit puts michael keusch in the same category as marcel mandu
<START> i don't know what that other guy was thinking the fact that this movie was independently made makes it no less terrible you can be as big a believer as you want the majority of this film is mindless drivel i feel i have been insulted by having to watch the first 40 minutes of it and that alone was no small feat not only is the acting terrible but the plot is never even close to developed there are countless holes in the story to the point where you can hardly even call it a story anymore i've never read the book so i can't critique on that but this is the first review that i've written here and it's purpose is solely to save all you viewers out there an hour and a half of your life i can't remember the last time i couldn't even finish watching a movie this one really takes the cake
