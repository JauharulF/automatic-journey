<START> shazbot is this embarrassing in fact here's a list of 100 that makes up the embarrassment 1 a failed comeback for christopher lloyd 2 jeff daniels basically playing the same role he played in the live 101 dalmatians remake which wasn't too juicy to begin with he sure has a funny way of promoting his purple rose theatre 3 disnefluff 4 another disappointing reminder that wallace shawn is to disney what jet li was to bob hoskins in unleashed 5 ray walston the original martian from the tv series played a bit part read cameo in this flick and died two years later of lupus coincidence 6 awful special effects seriously awful 7 100 that damn talking farting suit voiced to an annoying degree by wayne knight newman my favorite scene ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha whew good one you you're a joker okay let's wrap up this review with a moment of silence for this franchise's agonizing death and if you would like you can say a quick prayer that disney doesn't forget this travesty and do something silly like a movie adaptation of mork and mindy starring tim allen
<START> i have very fond memories of this film as i saw it with my two younger sisters when it first shown theatrically in 1977 and i was eight years old apparently it was deemed a failure and is now practically forgotten the pan and scan videocassette which never did justice to the picture or it's ambitious panavision compositions is now out of print the film is very stylized shades of yellow submarine and admittedly uneven some of the characters and sequences are exquisite while others are somewhat juvenile and undistinguished the sad discarded blue camel shades of eeyore and his blue song are truly heartwarming joe raposo's songs are for the most part simply beautiful definitely a worthwhile curiousity that will probably sadly fall into total obscurity
<START> i'm watching this on the star world network overseas which buys american and canadian series that last one or two seasons like the jane show i thought of how many female lead comedy shows im actually able to watch on my own there's lucy bewitched i dream of jeanie the one with barbara feldman and then my mind goes kind of blank i cannot think of any others the women are all supporting roles not the lead so for me the jane show is in pretty good company one thing i just thought of though i've watched several things made in canada and i never recall any thing being filmed in a regular tv series that shows snow it's all made at the height of summer lol granted it's a great place to live climate wise in the summer but you would think they would show a little bit of canada in the winter since that's part of the lifestyle there also i mean sctv just for laughs come to mind as two comedy shows that lasted a long time filmed in canada and very little or none is shot with snow present even though they both do a lot of outdoor shots i digress but i kind of chuckle at jane and her obviously liberal ways being accused of racism to her neighbor and i like the bald guy and his craziness i found it on par with a uk series called the it crowd i think another office comedy with a female lead not by any means the best comedy ever but for a guy to say he can watch it alone thats saying something if i was with my wife she might really enjoy it since it addresses sex in the office and stuff like that so might be a good light comedy for couples to watch 7 of 10
<START> the haunting a remake of course the original was a creepy psychological thriller and one that has improved with time compared to this 1999 remake it's a classic there is no character development here only caricatures the slut the authoritative brain the i'm gonna get us outta here fellow the oh so sensitive bookworm but seeing as how the were banking on the special effects being the star i guess characters that you can empathize with are a secondary concern unfortunately the effects are laughable mewing cherubs stretchy doors irritating dead children that can't speak plainly and an idiotically sappy ending that does it's darnedest to give you a new age enema of butterflies and rainbows ill take my skittles orally thank you bruce dern i've liked you since the cowboys stop it
<START> this is supposed to be well researched and based on fact how come therefore that it's so packed with mcgovernisms did the people of derry live in some kind of bizarre philip k dick world in which reality was uncannily like cracker liam priest or is mcgovern an idle hack who just keeps repeating hims
<START> the only reason i elected to give this flick a shot was due to the presence of oscar winner ernest borgnine all i can say is it was the greatest waste of a good actor ever put to film as far as i could tell borgnine was the only actor in it the other performances were so uniformly terrible i am amazed a studio would actually pay the performers to appear couple this level of talent in the acting department with a story so plodding and insipid that i thought my eyes were going to start bleeding by the time the credits rolled and you have a perfect cinematic disaster obviously the movie was made to appeal to an audience of children and to its credit it was better than most of the original programing on the disney channel and similar kid focused networks but honestly that is not saying much
<START> farrah fawcett gives the best performance by an actress on film in this gritty real life attempted rape thriller where she turns the tables gives james russo a taste of his own medicine a must see for any movie fan
<START> a winters day 28th december 1986 two bored 14 year olds hire a movie hmmmm police story looks interesting who is this jackie chan never heard of him two hours later after watching the film in a daze we wanted to know more 16 years later and severely out of pocket from collecting jc movies the film still grabs me like no other ok maybe i have a soft spot for it as it was my first cannonball run doesn't count jc movie but it is an excellent movie it has all the classic jc elements action humour action heart and action some comments say it's dated it was made in 1985 of course it's dated but then so must jaws casablanca singin' in the rain and the godfather without movies like police story where would hollywood action be today ps set standards many a scene has been stolen for use in other movies to really fully appreciate it you must see it in widescreen you miss so much of the movie otherwise yes he really does fall off the bus going round the corner if you haven't already see this movie now br br
<START> possible spoilers ahead br br jason a k a herb evers is a brilliant brain surgeon who along with wife virginia leith is involved in the most lackluster onscreen car crash ever leith is decapitated and the doctor takes her severed noggin back to his mansion and rejuvenates the head in his lab the mansion's exterior was allegedly filmed at tarrytown's lyndhurst estate the lab scenes were apparently shot in somebody's basement the bandaged head is kept alive on lab equipment that's almost cheap looking enough for ed wood some of the library musicÂthe movie's high pointÂlater turned up in andy milligan's the body beneath leith's head has some heavy metaphysical discourses with another of ever's misfires a mutant chained in the closet meanwhile the good doc prowls strip joints looking for a body worthy of his wife's gabby noodle the ending in uncut prints features some ahead of its time splatter and dismemberment when the zucchini headed monster comes out of the closet to bring the movie to a welcome close this thing took three years to be released and then audiences gave it the bad reception it richly deserved between this plan 9 from outer space and a few others 1959 should have been declared the year of the turkey
<START> i'm glad that i saw this film after mr sandler became famous br br it is bad bad bad bad there is no plot it's like watching a painfully dull home movie br br i really enjoy his other films but if you're a fan like me stay away from this one it may change your thoughts on adam you may never recover from the horror that is this film i've had a better time watching old folks play scrabble in a home
<START> well since seeing part's 1 through 3 i can honestly say that they should have never made part 4 everything from the tacky and i do mean tacky score to the really bad acting i dare anyone to watch this and not be bored out of their minds br br i mean parts 1 to 3 kept the vibe strong on the plot of damion but without him around in this one it's just not the same sure by the end of part 3 i was getting a little tired of the continued story line's but it was a good closure at the end of the third one again there was no reason for a part 4 even if there was they could have done a much better job than this sh t i had to sit through lol there goes an hour and a half of my life i'll never see again
<START> when i decided to watch the barbarians starring those twin bodybuilders peter and david paul i thought it couldn't be that bad because the film was directed by ruggero deodato who has a reputation for creating sleazy movies but well made sleazy movies well the barbarians is remarkably trashy action adventure movie that wants to be another conan the barbarian and fails at every level the look of the film is all wrong some scenes were well shot but the tone and the schintzy tacky disco look of the clothes and hair people are adorned with just doesn't make any sense whatsoever even for a low budget flick like this one br br richard lynch looks like an old woman with that ridiculous hairdo and costume he's supposed to be menacing but he comes across as a buffoon and it's funny to see eva larue callahan one of the stars of all my children appear in her first movie walking around in skimpy fur bikini i'm sure she wants this dreck to disappear from the face of the earth the so called barbarian twins are okay as the muscle bound heroes but it's almost impossible to construct a proper critique of their acting because their roles are like everything else in this mess really ill conceived the only way the film tries to differentiate one twin from the other is by having one twin wear a loincloth that covers his ass while the other twin's loincloth barely covers his muscular butt i'm not kidding don't ask me who's who though br br deodato must have been really desperate to agree to make this film and his desperation is reflected perfectly in this trashy flick it's just bad
<START> the only reason i came across this movie was that it's on the little miss marker dvd and i do recommend watching it although you won't like it as well as the better known movie br br we have gary cooper and carole lombard as a con man and his companion the film starts out quite light but becomes more dramatic as coop first plans on using his daughter to extort a sizable amount of cash from his brother in law but upon meeting the girl and seeing the discipline she would be subject to with his brother in law elects to keep her however he has trouble staying on the straight and narrow path and so the drama develops br br cooper and lombard are good and shirley still manages to steal the scenes she's in there's little music in this and shirley only has one song however this is entertaining and worth watching along with little miss marker
<START> i'm irish and i've been living in denmark for a while so i was looking forward to going home last week so i could see intermission and i will go on record as saying br br this film is awful br br it is not quite as bad a something like the most fertile man in ireland but it definitely does not stand up there with other irish films such as the commitments i went down or michael collins br br some aspects of the film are actually quite funny such as colm meaneys american style garda but the film itself is shot completely wrong the bouncing around of the camera and the constant zoom in zoom out tries to give the film an edgy look as if it were a gritty drama but it isn't this is an irish lock stock and two smoking barrels and it should be shot like this it should have smooth movement from one shot to the next the film just looks sloppy and thrown together br br the performances are okay given the awful script a friend of mine said to me like it was like they just followed colin farrell around dublin for a week he gives a decent display as a dublin dirtbag but it no way compares to his performances in minority report tigerland or phone booth the best performance was from dierdre o'kane who plays a sexually frustrated middle aged woman who has just been dumped by her bank manager husband for a younger woman i think she should leave her god awful stand up and focus more on her acting br br all in all its does in no way live up to the expectations put on it by the irish press or deserve to be even considered as one of the best irish films ever br br i'm expecting a backlash from these comments because most people i have spoken to have said it was great but before you reply ask yourself would think so highly of this movie if it was set in england or america
<START> i gave it an 8 star rating the story may have fallen short about 3 4 of the way into the picture but the performances remained strong throughout men of honor was changed from navy diver understandably so anyone who has served in any branch of the armed forces will probably feel that honor is an appropriate word to use in the title
<START> when i first saw a cry in the dark i had no idea what the plot was but when i saw it i was shocked at what it portrayed when i saw it a second time in an australian cinema class i realized a second point communication issues you see when a dingo snatched lindy chamberlain's meryl streep baby she and her husband michael sam neill were grief stricken but didn't show it as seventh day adventists they believed that god willed this to happen and so they couldn't mourn it but when people all over australia saw their lack of sadness everyone started believing that lindy did it herself br br the point is the wrong message got communicated to the public and it turned people against lindy even though this was a pure accident it still happened it may be one of the biggest disasters resulting from the existence of mass media regardless of any media outlet's political views br br as for the performances streep does a very good job with an australian accent no surprise there and sam neill is equally great you will probably get blown away just by what you see here definitely one of fred schepisi's best movies ever
<START> giving credit where it's due only the technicolor costumes and sets deserve any honorable mention br br this is undoubtedly the lowest point in bing crosby's long career at paramount the script is about as clumsy as you could possibly imagine and neither the casual bing nor william bendix nor sir cedric hardwicke can do a thing about repairing it br br bendix looks extremely foolish in a page boy wig and poor rhonda fleming has a stock costume heroine role requiring her to look adoringly at bing and little else except for warbling a couple of uninspired ballads in a voice probably dubbed for the occasion br br just plain awful mark twain's wit is not evident in any of the screenplay only die hard crosby fans can possibly appreciate this mess of a film given uninspired direction even the extras look as though they don't know what they're supposed to be doing br br summing up dull as dishwater not recommended even for children
<START> i have a high tolerance level for crap so i was looking forward to this it did not disappoint apparently based on sheridan le fanu's classic carmilla it follows a father and daughter hunting a female vampire who luckily happens to be travelling with them then we have santa claus or the general as he likes to be called here running over random zombies did i mention there was a zombie outbreak the dead are returning to life but nobody seems too concerned we have construction worker zombies soldier zombies and even st trinian schoolgirl zombies apparently santa claus is looking for his daughter who has been turned into a vampire oh wait there are no vampires the girl is in a lunatic asylum and carmilla is her nurse or is she the zombies are back and santa's mad lesbian sex i like vampires and i like zombies but i especially like lesbian sex nothing like some simulated cunnilingus to get the juices flowing when are we going to see vampires fight zombies is she a vampire or is she a lunatic or both is carmilla a hot sexy lesbian vampire or a nurse more cunnilingus you can never have enough cunnilingus here come the st trinian zombies chainsaw time more lesbian sex then the zombies kill and eat the vampires i guess the zombies won or did they plot who needs a plot when you've got lesbian vampires and schoolgirl zombies and cunnilingus
<START> let me just say i loved the original boogeyman sure it's a flawed clichÃ©d 80s horror movie but hey those types are fun to watch and plus it gave us something a bit different so i gladly bought it and to my surprise this movie came along with it only copy they had actually so i thought eh what the hell and bought it mistake 1 so that night i felt in the mood to watch a movie i actually bought tons that day and figured this was the shortest out of all the ones i bought so i'll just watch this and hit the sack mistake 2 yes i have heard how bad it was but i was willing to take a chance br br so a few minutes into the movie and there's the first flashback i think nothing of it at first then the new footage with the prediction of the chick in the bathtub and i'm kinda liking the direction it's going in then the next flashback which is a bit longer and i'm sitting there thinking yes i've seen the first boogeyman i know what happens so move along then the next one comes up and i figure screw it and fast forward through it then the final one maybe i fast forwarded through the explanation but why was she lying topless on the mirror at least she could've shown them and i decide to fast forward through it and then the climax and the movie was over wtf what happened to the prediction stuff what happened to the long hair dude did he tap that or what and more importantly what kind of weed was the writer and director smoking when making this awful pos and what was the point was annie just having flashbacks of what happened in the first movie or was the stuff from the first movie just happening at the same time as this the latter could make sense because the stabbing of pantyhose face happened in 1978 according to the characters in this movie and it was 15 years later wait a minute no it wouldn't because lacey who the movie questionably renamed nancy is uli too dumb to remember his movie characters' names would be 20 years old since she was 5 when that happened and not only is she married to someone who looks 30ish but also has a kid who looks around 7 and 10 did she get around during middle school and also why would pantyhose be after annie what connection does she even have with the characters of the original movie and a big huge movie mistake i found in this movie is that when the doctor is writing in his notebook does anyone notice that he's just scribbling wow how professional doc so what is the explanation for all of the questions i asked above it's a pointless movie with no thought put into it at all i will try to find a copy of the original movie that comes with just that movie and that's it maybe a couple of extra features any special edition of it yet then i will return this dvd and hopefully this review and all the others will prevent those who haven't seen it from seeing it thus making movie stores get rid of it and this movie may not exist anymore please let that be so sorry this review is so long i'm just angry at this movie i had to vent somehow
<START> jochen hick wrote and directed this little thriller of a suspense film based on the concept that the aids virus was a sheep virus mutated by the government to rid the world of gays and was apparently tested on convicts in the years before the outbreak of the hideous disease were it not for the poignancy of the concept of the film this would fall into the category of the many films about the ruination of the world by a rampant non prejudicial infective organism br br stefan tom wlaschiha journeys from berlin to san francisco to investigate his father's scientific suppositions about the induced sheep virus and its effects of the convicts in whom it was infused he meets with some disdain and resistance to a dead theory but also encounters some folks who know of the theory and support his investigation simultaneously with his visit a series of serial murders takes place each victim killed in a similar manner and each murder apparently accompanied by strains of music from puccini's opera 'turandot' which just happens to be opening at the san francisco opera a police investigator louise tolliver irit levi and her companion cop kalene parker follow the murders while stefan makes the rounds of the sex clubs and bars in san francisco trying to locate men who may have been guinea pigs for his father's theory he encounters a strange lad jeffrey jim thalman with whom he has a cat and mouse attraction and a prominent doctor burroughs richard conti who seems oddly involved in the cast of suspects how this all come to an end is the play of the film a story as much about the search for self identity between stefan and jeffery as it is a case for investigation of murders br br while tom wlaschiha jim thalman and richard conti do well with their roles they are the only three who have any prior acting experience in the film the quality of the film sags considerably by the less than acceptable minimally talented irit levy and kaylene parker when on screen the credibility of the story drops below zero there are some small cameos by other actors that brighten the screen for the moments they inhabit but in all the film is drowned by the incessant replay of 'nessun dorma' as sung by mario del monaco from a recording o the opera and that seems to be the reason for making the film good idea for a film and some good characterizations by the actors but there is no resolution of the initial premise that started the whole thing grady harp february 06
