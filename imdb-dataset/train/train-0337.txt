<START> here in brazil is very rare to see a good brazilian film and brantÂ´s new film is exactly one of these jewel there are some flaws in the film of course but they are very minimal the directing and acting in this film are very good br br canÂ´t wait to see another brantÂ´s new film
<START> red rock west is one of those tight noir thrillers we rarely see anymore it's well paced well acted and doesn't leave us with loose ends or unanswered questions so typical in this genre br br nicolas cage stars as michael an unemployed texas roughneck desperate enough for a job to drive all the way to wyoming for potential employment he is honest to a fault but always on the dark side of fate br br after failing to obtain gainful employment michael stumbles into the red rock bar where the owner wayne j t walsh mistakes him for a contract killer he summoned from dallas hired to do in his lovely but lethal wife suzanne lara flynn boyle br br wayne gives michael the necessary details and a down payment for the hit on the adulterous suzie with no intent on following through michael accepts the money and then sets out to warn suzanne of her impending demise he also mails a letter to the local sheriff exposing the plot and splits br br as fate would dictate michael is not going to be rid of the situation that easy while leaving in a violent rainstorm he runs down suzannes lover of course michael being michael he takes him to the local hospital where it's discovered that he's also been shot br br the sheriff is summoned and as luck would have it wayne is also the local law michael manages to escape while being taken on that last ride and is subsequently picked up by the real lyle from dallas played with murderous glee by the quirky dennis hopper after discovering that they're fellow marines lyle insists that michael join him for a drink at where else the red rock bar there wayne realizes his mistake and soon he and lyle are in hot pursuit of michael who falls willingly into suzannes waiting arms br br as the pace picks up we learn that wayne and suzanne are really wanted armed robbers on the lam for a multi million dollar theft getting the money now becomes the films central focus with a series of betrayals double crosses and murders br br the film was very well cast nicolas cage was typically low key dennis hopper and lara flynn bolye assumed their respective roles with more than ample ability the best performance was by the late j t walsh who was menacing without appearing to be walsh was a great character actor who left us much too soon br br marc reshoskys photography utilized many unique angles which added to the suspense and plot development the film was further enhanced by john dahl's tight directorial style and morris chestnut's rapid fire editing
<START> it was the worst ending i have ever seen if some one can please tell me how and why the last chick goes crazy and eats the old women in the end why dose the movie have all those cheap crappy scares in it in the beginning but yet when the first person dies they kill them all off in 5 minutes most of the people could act but i do give so credit to the porn stars they did their best also it had a couple funny parts and kills like when the care taker gets his organs riped out of his ass and then gets choked with it if this movie had an ending that could make any since i would have given it a 8 out of 10 but the ending made no since the ending sucked but the rest was great
<START> one of the worst movies i ever saw my only thought was how can i get my money back from hollywood video this is no way worth four dollars or any dollars i think it was an attempt to rip off the mexican or vin diesel's movies but it failed miserably to do this br br the acting was terrible i felt sorry for the actors that they couldn't find something better to do with their time the story was ridiculous we were calling out the lines ahead of the actors it was so predictable the mexican accent of the leading lady was insultingly exaggerated worse than a cartoon br br skip it
<START> it's hard to top this movie in several ways everything works really well here the casting acting script and cinematography are all first rate for the moviegoer it's a moving violent story of love and human redemption for the film critic there's plenty of sharp technique and technical merit there are some tactical blunders and as has been discussed on the boards the ending lacks realism if one is rigorously formal with the cia agent training angle however i took the ending as being more moving due to the fact that rather than pursue the cia agent's pragmatic approach creasy basically commends his soul to the ultimate without considering the consequences like jesus himself creasy becomes superhuman through his sacrifice whether it actually makes pragmatic sense or not in any case i appreciated the fact that creasy dispenses with conventional bourgeois morality and just caps the bad guys one by one in his methodical quest for justice which actually results in redemption both for himself and the innocent br br in any case this film is very much worth watching if you're at all attracted to the genre an excellent soundtrack great writing flawless casting and solid performances across the board make this a top 100 or better film
<START> this is one of those movies that made me feel strongly for the need of making movies at all generally speaking i am a fan of movies based on worthy true stories and this one is great besides meryl's performance which has gained a lot of recognition and praise the movie's greatest asset is the story it is based on the riveting tale of a couple who suffer social and legal torture after having undergone enormous emotional pain at the unexpected and brutal death of their infant child is really an eye opening fable that exposes the inhumane side of fellow humans and uncovers the barbarism of a very refined and lawful society it is interesting to see how people who consider themselves as kind and intelligent people the emotional jury ladies in the movie for example are in reality nothing more than selfish dupes who would for their dogmatic beliefs and prejudices shut their brains to any deliberation and contemplation even in the light of all facts pointing very clearly against their opinions the other face of the so called civilized society that the movie exposes is the apathy to the pain of fellow human beings needless to say this is very general even though this specific tale unfolds in australia that goes as far as becoming a true cruelty must see if you are willing to take something serious and perhaps thought provoking
<START> i can only believe that garson kanin must have been two people the one who wrote the brilliant a double life and the funny born yesterday and co wrote such excellent screenplays as adam's rib and pat and mike with his wife ruth gordon and then the one who wrote and or directed such tiresome sad drivel as bachelor mother some kind of a nut and this the cast tries but the script is so tired and clichÃ©d that even the efforts of the always wonderful brenda vaccaro are defeated the script sinks to it's nadir in the truly offensive sequence in which janssen's character tests drivas's character to make sure he's not gay an ugly sequence but sadly one which could easily play in a film today ethnic jokes are now totally verboten but fag jokes are still good clean family fun
<START> jacknife is a war movie that is just about as far removed from the war as war movies get it can hardly be classified as a war film because the only way that any war has an effect on the story or the characters is in their memories of it and even these we are hardly ever shown it poses very interesting questions about life especially in the way that the movie's tagline says that only one of them is really alive and by the way even though the tagline refers only to dave ed harris and megs robert deniro it is talking about all three of the characters in the film dave and megs were friends in the vietnam war and megs has returned to take dave out on a fishing trip that they have been planning for a lot longer than you might have guessed br br deniro provides a perfect performance of the character of megs who we are not really sure if we should like or if he really is as nuts as martha thinks he is dave reminds martha several times that megs is not his friend just someone he knows there is a great scene early in the film where megs has gone out to grab a six pack of beer from his car for breakfast and he is just around the corner of the room when dave says this megs pauses for a moment and then proceeds into the room with a smile and a huge greeting it isn't until later that you realize how megs must have felt when he heard that having been the one to remember what they had planned to do on this day it reminds me of the fakeness of the old sure let's do that ' thing that people so often say to each other never having any plans to do any such thing br br ed harris delivers a wonderful performance as dave who never got over the effects that the war had on him even so many years later he has not managed to get over the death of a friend during the war blaming himself to this day for it and thus drowning his life in alcohol cigarettes and loneliness all he wants he says is for people to leave him alone this is not a man who is living his life the way he wants whether people actually leave him alone or not he is a man trying to forget that he's alive to detach himself from the world of the living as much as possible br br his sister martha reminds me of myself at least in terms of my roommates i have two roommates who are 21 and 24 years old and both act like they still live with their mothers expecting their messes to just go away when they leave the room for a while one on particular the older one sadly enough has absolutely no clue how to care for himself i'm surprised i don't have to wipe his chin while he eats martha has to do much the same for her brother who she waits on hand and foot while he staggers through life from one hangover to the next martha and dave are stuck in a stagnant life and neither of them can get out of it until something major changes and dave is the one that needs to do the changing br br i tend to complain about romance in movies where it just doesn't belong about as much as roger ebert complains about those pathetic little tension devices the red digital readout but in this case i don't think that the romance that develops between megs and martha had any adverse affect on the rest of the movie on the contrary it made it that much more interesting because it was not predictable the problem with the romantic subplots in bruckheimer movies and whatnot is that they are so predictable that you just wait for the obvious end to come and hope that something interesting happens along the way in this case however it's not as obvious that something is going to happen between megs and martha because we don't know enough about megs martha could be right about him that he's one of dave's crazy war buddies and that he's not the kind of man that she should be dating dave certainly encourages this idea br br spoilers a couple years after this movie deniro did cape fear where he plays a deranged criminal out for revenge against the lawyer that landed him in prison a character that in retrospect makes it pretty easy to think that maybe at the end of jacknife martha realizes her mistake gets rid of megs and she and dave make up because he saved her from a horrible relationship and then he decides to clean up his act because he has done something good for her i was half expecting this to happen so i was pleasantly surprised when martha and megs wound up together and even more pleasantly surprised when megs asks dave all the questions about what they had planned to do after the war was over br br at times this is a slow moving drama but jacknife is entertaining along the way and has a huge payoff at the end which amazingly manages to be sappy without being cheesy there is an almost excess of emotion at the end of the film that scarcely fits with the rest of the movie but it is so good that it doesn't dumb down anything that the movie has accomplished up to that point everyone involved gives a wonderful performance and it is one of those rare films that just about makes you want to stand up and shake your fists victoriously in the air
<START> okay i saw the sneak preview of this stupid movie first off the movie is so posed and not real they are all acting they can't sing they are way too full of themselves its awful yes kids like 8 to 10 might enjoy but its really stupid i mean they say their manager is a kid and there record label is fake its stupid don't see it br br as for the set up and directing not so bad it is a cute documentary but it documents a stupid thing br br only see this if you don't really like good music also it's very corny it's not even tasteful i hate to be so mean but this really is a piece of junk
<START> although i live in minnesota i have been studying in france lately and came across this bizarre gem of a film br br this movie was amazing to say the least a creative and unique film the different directors each lent something different to their interpretation of love in the city of light the first instinct is to attempt to fit each one of these little stories into an overall storyline much as can be done with 2003's love actually this attempt however renders the magic of each individual segment obsolete when taken at face value with each of the short segments taken as its own individual film the love stories together tell a beautiful message br br the film is strikingly bizarre at times often to the point of confusion and each individual segment can be hard to follow still to a watcher who pays close attention to each of the segments the short plot lines become clear after a short time the confusion is almost intriguing it keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what will come next it leaves the viewer wondering did that really just happen yet also leaves them satisfied that it did indeed occur it's the kind of movie where the viewer upon leaving the theater can't actually decide whether they loved it or they hated it the initial reaction is to go and watch it again and again just to see these individual lives blend together into a cinematic masterpiece br br the interesting decision to make the movie multilingual adds something to the spectrum of people who can relate it adds to the reality of the film here the american tourists speak english the parisians french and so on the number of people that the film encompasses leads to an understanding of the international language of love br br from sickness to the supernatural the love of parents to the love of husbands this film covers all the bases of romantic storytelling in its beautiful and quirky way each unique event somehow falls into place to tell a story that of all types sizes nationalities and shapes of love
<START> 2 words academy award nuff said this film had everything in it comedy to make me laugh drama to make me cry and one of the greatest dance scenes to rival breakin 2 electric boogaloo the acting was tip top of any independant film jeremy earl was in top form long since seen since his stint on the joan cusack show his lines were executed with dynamite precision and snappy wit last seen in a very young jimmy walker i thought i saw the next emergance of a young denzel washington when the line my bus it's gone that was the true turning point of the movie my grandmother loved it sooo much that i bought her the dvd and recommended it to her friends it will bring tears to your eyes and warmth to your heart as you see the white tony donato and african american nathan davis bond through thick being held up at knife point and thin nathan giving tony tips on women the new dynamic duo has arrived and are out to conquer hollywood
<START> the japenese sense of pacing editing and musical score must be different than american tastes but surely this movie could have been so much more with a little more post production work br br someone in hollywood needs to re make this movie and i think it would be a big hit the story is interesting and creepy there's something about the edges of the city gritty policemen earthquakes sanitariums and mysterious saltwater killings that is enough to be captivating however this story has to make just a little bit of sense and maybe be about 40 minutes shorter br br i do have to say that the sixth sense effect was in full force in this movie and that was evident from the very beginning br br as it stands only the die hard japanese film lovers should bother seeing this oh so boring movie
<START> okay so i went into this movie not really expecting much i figured an action flick similar to the fast and the furious some nice cars some nice girls somewhat of a decent plot unfortunately i would have to say that this was probably the worst movie i have seen this year don't get me wrong the cars were nice and the girls were ok but the way they put the movie together was just plain crappy to put it nicely the story just never made you care about the cast and the movie seemed just pieced together so overall this movie was not the worst thing ever by far but if your looking for a movie to go to this weekend i would pass on this one for now
<START> perfect for families with small children who are looking for lighthearted films that contain no violence and are enthralling for the child and amusing albeit completely corny to adults not a bad film for a low budget job children will be amazed with santa's workshop and the magic that enables him to enter homes through chimneys that appear too small or homes that have no chimneys at all br br kids will thrill over the santa's success at thwarting the nasty devil named pitch complete in classic red outfit with horns and tail they will sympathize with the poor little girl who's greatest wish is to have a little doll to love and the poor little rich boy who only wishes to spend time with his forever absent parents and what child does not know someone at school who are just like the nasty boys that are enlisted by pitch to help capture santa and ruin christmas in the end everyone including the nasty boys get just what they deserve for christmas br br the film will endear children to both santa and the message of love he delivers to people throughout the world br br
<START> 'maladolescenza' has the air of a dark fairy tale with its child protagonists forest setting and the discovery of a castle's ruins yet at its core the film is essentially an unusual psychosexual study of adolescents opening with a dream sequence employing the not so subtle metaphor of fabrizio wrestling with his menacing hound the film details his psychological persecution of laura the girl who has pledged her love to him and his eventual romance with the equally malicious sylvia the film's psychological complexities do give the film merit yet there's no doubting how unnecessarily exploitive the film is in its depiction of nudity and sex the film's look relies more on its gorgeous locations rather than particular cinematographic skill and there's no doubting the film's greatest asset is the creepy children's choir augmented soundtrack with its odd dreamlike quality the film is at best interesting yet pales beside louis malle's surreal and brilliant 'black moon' from the same era certainly deserving of the art versus pornography debate for unlike many banned films pasolini's 'salo' or larry clark's 'ken park' for instance the film is rather unremarkable from an artistic perspective cinema seems to be gradually losing its ability to shock so perhaps 'maladolescenza' should be admired for retaining that power thirty years after its release however shock value is the one reason alone the film is memorable br br the film does have its defenders yet so does nazism
<START> a real classic a shipload of sailors trying to get to the towns daughters while their fathers go to extremes to deter the sailors attempts a maidens cry for aid results in the dispatch of the rape squad a cult film waiting to happen
<START> a director and his crew head out to the isolated beal mansion to make a low budget horror film about the seven mysterious deaths of the beal family that have occurred there in the last century even with warnings by the caretaker the director pays no attention to the supposedly cursed house one of the crew find a book titled tibetan book of the dead and use some of the passages from it for their script but in doing so when red they raise a ghoul from its grave br br boring confusing and tacky all rolled up into one equals this penniless midnight horror production what feels like an eternity it just never seems to get going or demonstrate anything effective from somewhat decent ideas even though director paul harrison's clunky tensionless direction did construct a couple eerie moody and atmospheric set pieces but laziness did set it early the whole film within a film structure takes up most of the movie and in this time little to nothing happens of great interest nor is it fun think of bob clark's children shouldn't play with dead things 1972 and now we've got older actors in the part however i found seven corpses to be inferior the script early on has some cutting wit abound before it ends up being drab predictable and left with many unfulfilled possibilities the cheap foundation involving limited sets didn't help matters either but the mansion's dreary dark appearance had a creepy air to it performances from a recognizable b cast is mainly rigid john carradine in small part mainly lurks about john ireland plays a hot headed director faith domergue's washed up actress demands attention and charles macaulay hams it up the slow grinding premise is crossed between ten little indians and your usual zombie set up however its not all that engaging even with its occult and supernatural edge hell they even throw in some graveyard action with no prevail when the rotting ghoul makes its appearanceÂ finally but a bit late it does get a little better if very baffling just like the inspired opening the ending is deliciously downbeat to bad in between it constantly drags continuity in many scenes comes across non existent and the death scenes are more exciting and bloodier but indeed poorly executed in the movie they're making then what actually happens to them when the zombie appears the generic music score flounders on with its shuddery but frank gothic cues and the camera work is blandly staged with a lack of imagination shoot and frame shoot and frame job done that's a wrap
<START> unfortunately jean eustache 1938 1981 belongs like so many once leading french film makers nowadays to the great unknown ones whose movies are hard to find and are not released on international dvds since we have a good old fashioned video store in tucson i had the chance to watch this 3 1 2 hour marathon masterwork that is not boring for ten seconds br br since we speak here about one of the most discussed and most controversially discussed movies of all times let me tell you my impression that the endless dialogs originally typical for the early nouvelle vague of a jacques rivette or alain resnais appear almost ridiculous in this movie the dialogs are basically monologues mainly the longest ones spoken by jean pierre lÃ©aud the most characteristic feature is that the intersections of the speeches of two people is almost zero lÃ©aud or his character alexandre pleases to tell more about himself than about the topics he is seemingly to speak therefore one can hardly speak about communication in this movie it is well possible that the director had a gargantuan satire in mind against the idle running of the once so hotly discussed political and sociological ideas but the type of man alexandre exists to all times we find him already in petron's satiricon which work has actually great resemblance with the mother and the whore br br alexandre does not only nothing but he has developed an own kind of metaphysics about the absence of acting at least acting in the sense of responsibility toward the society whose part he is he mocks at the people who run to work at 7 c'clock in the morning when he is just busy having his last drink before he goes to bed in the apartment of one of his girlfriends from whose money he lives he is unable to speak one sentence without quoting one of the leading thinkers between nietzsche and bernanos especially sartre who is shown quickly in the french intellectual cafÃ© aux deux magots where alexandre too is sitting all day must serve as excuse for the life style of alexandre and his colleagues because they suffer existential crisis from bourgeois nausea however the intellectual speeches of alexandre seem to be rather pseudo intellectual and the sentences and quips he cites seem to come rather from a dictionary of quotations than from his actual reading of the respective books br br it is true this movie demands an extremely broad european knowledge especially the connoisseurship of french existentialist philosophy and there consequences to the 68 student revolution movement but if you have this knowledge than you will enjoy 215 minutes of your life by staring amazed into the tv and crying out with laughing like you have probably not done it since a long time
<START> space camp which had the unfortunate luck to be planned around the time of the challenger accident deserves such luck the stars make a mockery of acting lea thomson actually being turned sideways when asked for more than her usual wide eyed innocent smile presumably to mask her risible attempts the movie is at times hilarious when it begins to ask far too much of you a small boy keeps a multi million dollar robot in his closet which breaks when given too many commands by the hordes of cliched dorm mates this hackneyed and unlovable machine jinx is a major player in the ridiculous premise of the movie which seems part short circuit part 2001 by the airplane team i shan't bore you with this suffice it to say you can only laugh when faced with it having said all of this it is enjoyable to watch in a seaquest saved by the bell kind of way the romance and technology beware are as unbelievable as each other also if you're an eighties freak its unmissable for the amusing performances of kate capshaw willie from temple of doom and obviously lea thompson also joaquin phoenix puts in a dodgy turn as a sort of wannabe goonie who befriends jinx do not go near this movie if you are not a fan of trash
<START> trick or treat quickie review this zany romp of a film revolves around the 80's culture of heavy metal and horror movies two things which i love dearly so as you can imagine this movie appealed to me pretty easily plus for no apparent reason ozzy osbourne plays a preacher br br this film is about an unpopular high school youth who like all us losers ended up drenched in a world of evil heavy metal his favorite metaldude dies and of course is miraculously resurrected by playing his latest unreleased album backwards this allows the corpsified singer to go around killing people with demons and sh t helping out br br okay it's pretty cheesy at times but you know what it's got a surprising number of good qualities decent acting including gene simmons as a radio dj pretty good special effects very brief nudity decent atmosphere all in all it's actually a decent horror film but what really sucks is the music ironic huh well this uber evil metal guy is one of the most obnoxious high pitched wailing motley crue rejects on the planet and the metal is little more than putrid 80's pop hair metal he hits all the clichÃ©'s here from prancing around like a gay fairy to looking mean to screaming rock and roll in a pitch high enough to make king diamond retch aside from that atrocious musical representation it's actually pretty good 7 10 br br www residenthazard com
