<START> i saw this at the edinburgh film festival it was awful every clichÃ©d violent rich boy fantasy was on display you just knew how it was going to end especially with all the shots of the chef's wife and the rape of the first girl br br the worst part was the q a with the director writer and writer producer they tried to come across as intellectuals but you could tell they're the types that get off on violence i bet anything they frequent brothels and do drugs br br don't waste your time i had to keep my boyfriend from walking out of it
<START> please don't rent or even think about buying this movie they don't even have it available at the red box to rent which would cost a 1 i think its worth less than that the main reason why i rented this d movie was because jenna jameson is in the movie lol between 2 5 min i will give credit that the movie had hot chicks and quite a bit of nudity but other than that you might as well buy another d horror movie that has the same thing with nobody you know ginger lynn has more acting time in this movie than jenna she's not even on the front cover of the movie nor her name i recommend people to watch zombie strippers because you see jenna almost throughout the whole movie nude most of the time this movie is a big disappointment such a huge waste of time
<START> i found this movie to be a great idea that didn't deliver it seems they found a way to build suspense but couldn't stage their payoffs very well in one case the police are on the clock to find the hideout of the kidnappers they painstakingly go from dentist to dentist to match a dental record at the same time the kidnapped man mason escapes through the elevator shaft after all the build up the police arrive at the same time he gets free which is very anti climatic to say the least there are also large narration scenes that take us inside the thinking of the terrorized husband and wife which detracts from the suspense rather than adds to it we are fully aware of their tension and the voice over is an insult and robs the viewer of any chance of a personal experience with the fear as hitchcock proved time and again is far more effective the greatest disappointment is to sit through the whole movie and the get the quick rather bland ending i mean it just ends in a snore
<START> the sea is watching was an interesting film experience first of all the overall feel was intense internalized claustrophobic and small each frame seemed to be a photograph of something inside something very focused and not part of a bigger picture it was obvious what we were to look at in each frame the physicality of the set itself contributed to that feeling of smallness and intensity the lights along the middle of the road cut the road in half and the tiny gate to the tiny settlement followed by the tiny and few cubbyholes that served as the establishments that made up what seemed to be the entire town even the view of the ocean was framed by a tiny landing on which one can count the number of longer grass swaying in the wind no panoramic views in fact it reminded me of the montmarte sequence of moulin rouge where the camera sweepingly focuses in to the windmill creating again a feeling of a small area where everything is happening br br while the acting was passable considering i really could not discern how the lines were truly delivered i felt that the actions were overly melodramatic and nonsensical why kikuno would continue carrying on the way she did when fusanosuke announced his impending marriage really didn't seem true Â people hadn't really changed that much and the character kikuno was so strong and resilient that even if they were busy taking on o shin's business for naught the reaction seemed out of character and unnecessary and distracting another example of odd acting was when the drunk boyfriend of kikuno showed up and ryosuke decided to intervene and was pushed down the stairs the way in which he got up and menacingly came up the stairs and the ensuing fight outside among the reeds was simply unsatisfying it wasn't that i like fight scenes Â au contraire Â but it seemed a little stilted and again overly dramatic br br otherwise while not a beautiful movie to watch it provided an interesting glimpse into the darker side of prostitution as opposed to the geisha unfortunately perhaps it fed into our expectations of wanton women the honey Â i'll give you a deal comments supported by the over stretched actions and seriously caused me to doubt whether indeed 19th century prostitutes really acted in that way but once inside the house the inner workings became most interesting vivid and real and provided a scenario i never anticipated or imagined in my romantic view of japan in the 19th century
<START> i'm probably one of the biggest nancy drew fans out there i've read every book three times over and i've played a lot of the nancy drew games i loved this movie it kept you entertained the whole time you watched it i went with about 10 of my friends and everyone loved it there were three woman sitting behind us who appeared to be in their late 30's to early 40's and i asked them how they liked it they said they loved it so you see it will be an entertainment to all ages you just have to give it a chance and it teaches a lesson too just be yourself even if everyone around you is exactly alike so overall this move was great i'm going to see it a second time now so stop bashing it please its a really good movie
<START> dressed to kill understandably made a bit of a ruckus when first released in 1980 you had police girl in a role that was mega erotic as angie dicknson played a sexually frustrated housewife looking for good times in all the wrong museums and there into apartment elevators plus nancy allen as a call girl michael caine as norman bates's sophisticated new york cousin and enough lurid imagery to last two movies of the period today it's slightly less incriminating by standards and such though the unrated version has some of the most hot content of any of de palma's films at least in his quasi auteur period of the 70s and early 80s where he seemed to repeat themes over and over ideas taken right off the film reels of hitchcock classics and given a tawdry uplift it's a simple tale that one partly already saw in sisters and then again to an extent in body double and also in blow out cutie allen plays call girl liz blake who has to clear her name of suspicion of killing kate dickinson in full blown 'milf' mode after being found with a razor the murder weapon from dr elliott's office michael caine stone cold performance most of the way br br from the start which de palma seems to do as a way of setting up a dangerous sexual fantasy scene as a way of topping the opening scene of carrie which perhaps he does just in editing terms we get a series of technical knock out turns through the point of view of style itself the tracking shots in the museum meant to stir up more of a fascination with the process itself of following and wanting to be followed than any kind of tension the chase through the subway a precursor to carlito's way is done with a precise level of suspense meanwhile with a slightly exploitation bit thrown in with the black gang the character of peter kate's son keith gordon who plays what is essentially a younger version of the real life de palma as a kid science geek obsessed with hitchcock and voyeurism and it's all entertaining and entrancing as hell as something that comes close to a real synthesis of what makes de palma's thrillers so unique while being so self consciously untainted by a fearless attitude of film making br br on the other hand that same self consciousness ended up coming back to bite the director in the butt a few times in recent years and somehow in dressed to kill it starts to become very erratic and disappointing as the story has to wrap itself up as the psycho themes come together even more apparently man who wants a sex change doesn't even think he's killing as it is she who is doing it there is an expository scene in the police station that makes the aforementioned hitch film look like an astonishing psychological revelation and the final scenes at peter's house also calling painfully into recollection a much more accomplished sequence in carrie are meant for a manipulation that even for de palma is asking for it the final shot especially albeit a master's class in how to copy yourself yet there is a very deranged and within itself perfect scene at the mental hospital amid this confused denouement where the doctor does some work on a nurse to which all the other inmates act like animals in a zoo and an over head shot going up and up over the scene is one of the best shots of sexual general perversion ever captured on film br br a shame then that the film ends on such a strange and unsettling manner where up until then it is a remarkable piece of pulp cinema where class is all around in the technical aspects soft lighting intricate camera movements seemingly so simple amid subject matter that should be found in the mix of paperbacks for 25 cents it's no masterpiece but i'd certainly take it over most of the director's recent thrillers any day
<START> spoilers in first paragraph this movie's anti german sentiment seems painfully dated now but it's a brilliant example of great war time propaganda it was made back when cecil b demille was still a great director ignore all his later best picture academy awards he never made a very good sound film this movie lacks the comedy of most of pickford's other films and really it was demille's movie not pickford's the vilification of the germans can be compared to the way the patriot of 2000 did the same to the british the only good german in the film was a reluctant villain who had the ironic name of austreheim they even had pickford take an ill fated trip on a luxury ship that gets torpedoed by a german submarine so what'll get the americans more stirred up to war the sinking of the lusitania or watching america's favorite canadian import sinking in it all throughout the film demille runs his protagonist from one kind of horrible calamity to another barely escaping death hypothermia depravity rape execution and explosions that go off in just the right place to keep her unharmed the way she is saved from a firing squad is no more believable than the way the humans in jurassic park were ultimately rescued from the velociraptors if i was any more gullible to such propaganda i would punish myself for having a part german ancestry br br was it a good film aside from a humorous running gag about americans abroad thinking they're untouchable Â that was apparently a joke even back then Â you might not be entertained you'll find it more than a little melodramatic and obviously one sided but the first thing that came to my mind after watching it is that it was years before potemkin's false portrayal of a massacre revolutionized the language of cinema as well as a movie's potential for propaganda it made me wonder what became of cecil b demille somewhere between the advent of sound and the greatest show on earth he seemed to lose his ambition ben hur looked expensive but not ambitious in a sentence this movie is for 1 film historians 2 silent film buffs 3 mary pickford fans or 4 demille fans if such a person exists
<START> herbet clutter wife bonnie and their teenage children kenyon and nancy were much liked and respected in their tiny town of holcomb kansas but in the early hours of 14 november 1959 all four were brutally murdered rather unexpectedly the crime made an impression on author truman capote who rushed to the scene and followed the course of the case to its conclusion the result was the book in cold blood controversial shocking and exceptionally well written it became an international best seller and it remains a touchstone for crime writers to this day br br the 1967 film version of capote's work is almost as remarkable as the book itself filmed in black and white in many of the real life locations it has a slightly documentary quality icy and detached and the overall cast is exceptional this is the film on which robert blake's reputation as an actor rests and deservedly so as killer perry smith blake traps you between a profound distaste and the shock of unexpected sympathy it is a masterful performance from start to finish as richard hickock scott wilson is no less fine br br like capote's book the film opens with smith and hickock as they travel to kansas and brings them to the clutter home only to suddenly flash past the crime to detail the investigation that finally resulted in their arrest and conviction the centerpiece of the film has always been the moment at which we at last see what occurred in the clutter home actually filmed in the clutter house itself it is a spinechilling sequence horrific and deeply disturbing br br director and writer richard brooks guides the film with a very powerful sense of deliberation erring only in the sense that he allows the film to become slightly preachy given the overall power of the film however this becomes a trivial annoyance strong stuff and recommended br br gft amazon reviewer
<START> i wasn't expecting much and to be honest i didn't like this film the first time around but watching it again and i realised that it's kinda cool sure it's a one joke film but it's a funny gag br br someone posted that it could be better written and it could be i think this film had the potential to be a over the top my cousin vinny but with a horror host instead of a lawyer sadly it's a wasted opportunity with just a bit more writing it could be a classic the kids are underused there's no reason why they should latch on to elvira apart from the obvious reasons it would have been great to see their relationship flourish i know it's a comedy but it's little differences that separate the good films from the brilliant br br elvira herself is always fun and engaging not to mention flirty every time she smiles you will too it's hard to knock a film when the main character is so charming and it really is her charm don't let her looks fool you into thinking that she's some sort of tart well she is but she's a nice one the sort of person you'd let look after your kids wouldn't let her cook for them though br br i'd recommend giving it a go br br just don't expect too much br br she's more than just a great set of boobs she's also an incredible pair of legs
<START> if you're a fan of film noir and think they don't make 'em like they used to here is your answer they just don't make 'em in hollywood anymore we must turn to the french to remember how satisfying subtle and terrific a well made film from that genre can be read my lips is a wonderfully nasty little gift to the faithful from director jacques audiard featuring sharp storytelling and fine performances from emmanuelle devos and vincent cassel br br the basic plot could have been written in the 40's dumb but appealing ex con and a smart but dowdy femme fatale who turns out to be ruthlessly ambitious discover each other while living lives of bleak desperation and longing manipulate each other to meet their own ends develop complex love hate relationship cook up criminal scheme involving heist double crosses close calls and lots of money all action takes place in depressing seedy and or poorly lit locations br br audiard has fashioned some modern twists of course the femme fatale is an underappreciated office worker who happens to be nearly deaf and uses her lip reading ability to take revenge on those who marginalize her and where you might expect steamy love scenes you discover that both characters are sexually awkward and immature add in a bit of modern technology and music and it seems like a contemporary film but make no mistake this is old school film noir it's as good as any film from the genre and easily one of the best films i've seen all year
<START> a stunning realization occurs when some sort of phenomenon takes place be it firecrackers going off witnessing a robbery a hurricane nonchalantly devastating everything in it's path or for that matter any other spectacular occurrence in the case of the maclean family however reveille was something which was no more complex than their day to day lives montana in the early twentieth century was an environment which was rough and tumble the maclean family was comprised of four people the father a minister who was ideologically driven to raise his family properly his wife was god fearing and dutiful the two boys were well boys what else can you say brad pitt starred in this film before he was really the brad pitt and his acting performance in this film was to say the least remarkable his brother norman was the cerebral type he was touched by emotions that were genuine and motivated by a set of values that missoula montana concurred with paul brad pitt was a misfit from the offset and lived on the edge you would think that montana in the 1920's had no such thing yet somehow gambling drinking and violent confrontations were as much a part of paul as was his fly fishing rod fly fishing did i say that parenthetically this was the core of this movie's theme the recreation of fly fishing served as the cohesive bond which homogenized the kindred spirits of the maclean brothers and to a lesser degree the father i would describe the acting in this film as incredibly believable and the cinematography went beyond sensational put it this way anyone who sees this film will want to live in montana breathtaking filmography of bluer than blue mountains and streams captured the youth and effervescence that the maclean brothers had for life seldom in a film do you witness whereby feelings immediately invoke a dogged tenacity to accomplish whatever it may be that someone wishes to accomplish the maclean brothers lived life to the fullest and for better or worse the father knew that this was going to be the only way the two of them could become men robert redford directs this film and tells the story of the maclean's through the perspective of the older brother norman norman gets offered a position at the university of chicago at age 26 and marries the woman he will always be in love with what this film also points out is that the younger brother paul has attained an accomplishment of his own by being the epitome of a remarkable fly fisherman the seedier side of life prevails in the younger brother's existence and exerts an insidious form of consternation for the maclean family as most human shortcomings go the maclean family made light of turbulent waters literally and thus established unity as a family by putting necessary blinders on br br the end of the movie river runs through it presents an epigram of life through the eyes of the older brother for norman maclean stoicism is a prerequisite to perseverance in his emeritus years such a fate is largely due to the fact that reflecting on his life is tantamount to yearning for people who have passed away the fond memories of his brother his wife his mother and his father must now be viewed philosophically for norman his life has been relegated to stubborn facts that have determined his dubious outlook and precarious resolve something as simple as the statement this was your life and that is how you lived it is a somber recollection of the joy the sorrow the regrets and the love he gave as well as was the recipient of best put in the last sermon he heard his father give his father said we can completely love someone without completely understanding them whether you agree with what has happened in your life or not it happened nonetheless norman maclean must come to grips with the fact that his life has been fragmented by misunderstandings norman maclean has become a decrepit octogenarian who is polarized by virtual conclusions to his life the murky waters of montana's picturesque rivers serve as a vicious and desultory finalization to his years on earth without question the very prolific statement of what seems complicated is really very simple purveys a very acrimonious message in this movie more simply put the people and places which were important in norman's life are now only a bittersweet memory merely a painfully intellectual rumination of events which are aggravated by the haunted waters of montana's beautiful streams and rivers to which for the entire maclean family all things merge into one and a river runs through it
<START> this movie isn't worth the film it was photographed on the dialog is flat filled with clichÃ© overused lines and delivered by amateur actors who sound like their reading a script for the first time the choppy shaky film style is a cheap imitation of the the ring style visual effects the characters do not even act like a normal person would for example the character who is looking for her twin sister at her home forces her way through the front door creeps around the house all frightened and sobbing and she doesn't even once call out her sister's name to see if she is home what you would think she had just buried her sister instead of searching for her way too many flashbacks to her childhood too many unnecessary flashbacks is a typical sign of an amateur director it is actually funny watching the numerous shots of the woman driving her car down the street up the driveway around this corner over here over there oh a side view now a front view enough already you would think you are watching a tv commercial for the solaris terrible movie 0 out of 100 i really pity anybody who spent money making this film or to watch it
<START> some not so spoily spoilers ahead br br why do people when they are disoriented or sick or scared at a club cut through the middle of the crowded dance floor on their way to the bathroom br br who in their right mind would hide under a bed when someone breaks into their room br br how often do you knock on a stranger's door and when they don't immediately answer you open the door walk in shout a few hello's and then start going through their stuff br br if you were being pursued by someone you just discovered was a murderer what would you do quietly sneak off and hide under a wooden platform or among metal implements run quietly of course to a ratty old barn or other decrepit structure br br i could be talking about almost any thriller that's come out in the last few years but since this is the the return page obviously i'm talking about the return i saw it free because i work at a movie theater and make a point of screening all the scary movies i thought this one was tolerable aside from the well worn clichÃ©s sarah michelle gellar is really drab and looks kind of huh through most of the film the details of the plot are slowly given out as the movie progresses and it's almost enough to make it interesting except there wasn't enough explanation as it moved on and so i was almost lost until the last 2 3 of it br br if you're a die hard thriller fan it's worth seeing at least once if there's nothing better at the theater and you really want to watch a movie eh i guess it's worth a matinÃ©e ticket if you thought the trailer made it look like an interesting movie and you can't wait wait
<START> amazing effects for a movie of this time a primer of the uselessness of war and how war becomes a nurturer of itself br br a wonderful thing about this movie is it is now public domain and available at archive org no charge no sign up necessary watch it in one sitting and you will be propelled br br i plan to share this flick with as many people as possible as i had never heard of it before and i am a hard core sci fi fan br br i would like to see how others react to this movie br br watch it br br rate it br br tell us what you think
<START> robert altman shouldn't make a movie like this but the fact that he did and that it turns out to be a reasonably good and tightly wound thriller in that paperback tradition of grisham thrillers shows a versatility that is commendable in the gingerbread man he actually has to work with something that unfortunately he isn't always very successful at or at least it's not the first thing on his checklist as director plot there's one of those big juicy almost pot boiler plots where a sleazy lawyer gets caught up with a desperate low class woman and then a nefarious figure whom the woman is related with enters their lives in the most staggering ways twists and plot ensues yada yada and it's surprising that altman would really want to take on one of these i saw that coming from back there endings or just a such a semi conventional thriller br br but it's a surprise that pays off because oddly enough altman is able to catch some of that very fine behavior or rather is able to unintentionally coax it out of a very well cast ensemble of a small town georgian environment the film drips with atmosphere if not total superlative craftsmanship sometimes it's good and sometimes just decent for altman as savannah is possibly going to be hit by a big hurricane and the swamp and marshes and rain keep things soaked and muggy and humid so the atmosphere is really potent but so are performances from sometimes hysterical kenneth branaugh embeth davitz as the 'woman' who lawyer branaugh gets caught up with and robert downey jr when is he not good as the private detective in branaugh's employ did i neglect robert duvall who in just five minutes of screen time makes such an indelible impression to hang the bad vibes of the picture on br br as said some of the plot is a little weak or just kind of standard lawyer is divorced bitter custody battle looms innocent and goofy kids but at the same time i think altman saw something captivating in the material something darker than some of the other grisham works that has this standing out somehow if it's not entirely masterful it still works on its limited terms as a what will happen next mystery southern noir
<START> tim robbins is oddly benign here cast as a garage mechanic in 1950s new jersey who falls in love with a perky blonde who turns out to be albert einstein's niece although he's on screen much of the time robbins cancels out the inner workings of his intense persona and fades into the background it's easy to forget he's even in the picture lumpy romantic comedy with a gimmick that being walter matthau playing einstein who does what he can with a cartoonishly conceived character otherwise it's sugary and sunny directed rather drowsily by fred schepisi who shows heart but no wit or brains meg ryan is her usual affable self and the chemistry between she and robbins is charming like that of an affectionate sister and her big brother from

<START> as always this is an inaccurate picture of the homeless tv told a lot of lies about panhandlers in the early 1990s and made everyone look bad and claimed we all made over 100 a day when 20 40 a day was much closer to reality when someone drove by where i held up a sign offering to work and offered me work i actually went and took the work if i was physically able and if i would been offered the 100 000 id damned sure invested in in apt prepaid for at least 2 years and kept most in the bank and still left myself 10 20000 for nl 1 2 and 2 5 cash games at the casinos i usually always win and could win decent if i just had a bankroll instead i win about 1000 a month is all playing in always minimum buying in due to not wanting to risk losing it all i was only homeless cause i didn't wanna risk spending all my money and going broke sometimes i had over 1000 2000 in my sock while i slept outside anyone wanting to talk contact sevencard2003 on yahoo messenger i admit i was different than most homeless people though due to the fact i never drank smoke or took drugs im no longer homeless am now in govt housing for 177 a month and getting ssi and spend most of my time winning at online poker mom and sunflower diversified worked hard to get me ssi glad my days of hiding in under the stage in the convention center of the casino at night sleeping worrying about getting caught by security are finally over had this tv crew picked me theyd been over a lot sooner its a shame how they don't better select who they pick

<START> in the early 1970s many of us who had embraced hippy acid alternative culture wholeheartedly had realised that mainstream society was not going to change in the way we thought it would for me this film defined the tension of now what that many of the people i knew felt at that time do we head for the commune and create our own vision of utopia or do we radicalize and push for change br br from the futile gestures to police the radical rhetoric the music of pink floyd to the love making and the explosive images in the desert so much is in there it captures well a significant moment in time
