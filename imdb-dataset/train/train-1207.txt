<START> an absurdly hilarious and strikingly human tale of the jealousies and infidelities surrounding a beetle marriage russian animation pioneer wladyslaw starewicz's mest kinematograficheskogo operatora the cameraman's revenge or the revenge of a kinematograph cameraman is a delight of early animation brimming with highly effective stop motion puppetry and no shortage of imagination br br mr and mrs beetle have a completely uneventful marriage and both yearn for more excitement in their lives mr beetle's desires can only be satisfied by the beautiful exotic dancer at the gay dragonfly night club whom he visits whenever he takes a business trip to the city she is the only one who understands him a fellow admirer of this dancer an aggressive grasshopper is jealous that mr beetle has stolen his lady and as fate would have it he is also a movie cameraman the devious grasshopper follows mr beetle and his acquaintance to a hotel room where he films their exploits through the keyhole br br meanwhile mrs beetle has likewise acquired a friend to add excitement to her life he is an artist and he brings her a painting for a present before they both settle down on the couch for some intimacy at that moment however mr beetle returns home and witnesses the entire spectacle as mr beetle bashes through the front door the artist friend clambers up the chimney but he doesn't escape without mr beetle first venting his anger and frustration upon him br br there is a certain irony in the statement that follows mr beetle is generous he forgives his wife and takes her to a movie he is generous enough to forgive her and yet he had been equally unfaithful just minutes earlier at this point in time however we still haven't forgotten the jealous movie cameraman who had been plotting his revenge and it is no surprise when he turns out to be the projectionist for the film mr and mrs beetle are attending suddenly intercut into the film they are enjoying is the footage of mr beetle's disloyalty and the angry wife hits him across the head with an umbrella before the frightened and angry husband dives through the theatre screen in search of the grasshopper br br in the final scene both mr and mrs beetle now somewhat more appreciative of each other are serving time in prison for the fire that broke out when mr beetle sought his final revenge we do indeed hope that the home life of the beetles will be less exciting in the futureÂ this film may appear to be a mere story of the comings and goings of a miniscule insect species but starewicz is communicating so much more than that this isn't a story about beetles Â it is a story about us and it's startlingly accurate isn't it
<START> this sci fi masterpiece has too many flaws after the editors had butchered it after its opening in 1936 visually it is a wonder to behold but the script allows too many intellectual speeches about war and progress this gets very corny when the actors are given to recite a lot of high minded messages at all times raymond massey and cedric hardwicke both great actors come off as quite a pair of fanatics ralph richardson is very good as the the boss a megalomaniac warlord the prediction of world war ii was very eerie considering that the world was on the brink of the most devastating conflict in human history at the time i'm sure glad that war didn't turn out as it did in the movie there are some visually stunning montage sequences bridging the leaps of time between the movie's different episodes although its not as entertaining as i hoped it would be this movie sticks in your mind long after you've seen it
<START> the saddest part of this is the fact that these are 87 minutes i'll never get back i knew this was terrible from the get go with the guy dressed as a lunatic indian chief on top of the roof see if they could get away with that in 2008 my 10 year old boy is really into baseball right now so we decided to rent it on a rainy day even though he seemed to enjoy parts of it i had to cringe when i heard all the needless foul language bad bad movie this was an awful ripoff of bad news bears completely shameless and completely predictable i don't mind a predictable movie if it's done well but this one absolutely was not
<START> soldier isn't a great movie and everyone that hated it has plenty of good reasons but i liked soldier alot partly because my expectations were so low that what i saw surprised me br br first the art direction is tight and well executed as far as science fiction backdrops go soldier was doing things with more design then 90 the genre the sets costumes and props were all consistent and competently executed i didn't love all of their future military style but i was impressed with the effort for me this made the movie worth the time it took to watch br br second i'm a kurt russell fan i grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable movies of my youth the barefoot executive and his john carpenter films soldier is essentially an action movie and the role of sergeant todd is an essential action hero it's not an award winning role but kurt musters up convincing emotion with very little dialog br br third the fight scenes and battles are well choreographed this isn't iron monkey or even the matrix but once again it far exceeds the average level of quality in the genre br br if you haven't seen it and you like sci fi action films pick it up if you pass at your rental depot of choice just don't expect the next bladerunner
<START> don't let the name of this film deceive you in reality jake speed the character is quite possibly the laziest action hero ever known to film when jake speed is not saving virgin girls from evil madmen which he is often not he's seriously relaxing perhaps this adds to his charm but in my opinion an action hero is not suppose to chill out whenever he gets the chance furthermore unlike other daring heros who usually have an impressive list of talents this man has none unless of course you call sleeping a talent anyhow this movie is basically worthless the writing is sub par and the action when there is some is very lame the machine guns on the jeep weren't bad but that's about it so if you're in the mood to watch a movie that is a cure for insomnia then this piece is perfect for you it has a hero that not only puts himself to sleep but also his audience
<START> the legendary boris karloff ended his illustrious career by making four cheapie fright flick clunkers in mexico this is the token moody period gothic horror entry from the bunch karloff gives a typically spry and dignified performance as matthias morteval an elderly eccentric patriarch who invites several of his petty greedy and backbiting no count relatives to his creepy rundown castle for the reading of a will pretty soon the hateful guests are getting bumped off by lethal life sized toy people who populate the place onetime mexican sex symbol andres garcia of tintorera infamy portrays the dashing police officer hero and julissa looks absolutely ravishing as the sole likable female character the clunky plodding non direction trite by the numbers script ugly washed out cinematography ridiculous murder set pieces a gross fat slob gets blasted right in the face by a miniature cannon overwrought string score morbid gloom doom atmosphere largely lousy acting karloff notably excepted cheesy mild gore poor dubbing and rousing fiery conclusion all lend this enjoyably awful lemon a certain endearingly cruddy and hence oddly amusing ratty charm a real campy hoot
<START> i just rented this today heard lots of good reviews beforehand wow what a pile of steaming poo this movie is does anyone know the address of the director so i can get my five dollars back finally someone bumped stop loss from the 'worst iraq war movie ever' number one spot to be fair i don't think there are any good iraq war movies anyway but this was really bad br br i won't get into any technical inaccuracies there's a hundred reviews from other gwot vets that detail them all if the director bothered to consult even the lowliest e nothing about technical accuracy however they could've made the movie somewhat realistic maybe i guess the writer should be given the credit for this waste of a film he or she obviously hatched the plot for this movie from some vivid imagination not afflicted with the restraints of reality does anybody but me wonder what the point of this movie was was there a message seriously though wtf br br i'm pretty amazed at all the positive reviews really this film is hard to watch as a vet because of all the glaring inaccuracies but even if one could overlook that the plot sucks characters are shallow to say the least and the acting is poor at best it's ironic i suppose that this movie is supposed to be about explosive ordinance disposal because it's the biggest bomb i've seen this year
<START> rock solid giallo from a master filmmaker of the genre sergio martino fashioned from a marvelous screenplay by ernesto gestaldi this shocking mystery often develops fascinating twists until the terrific finale which most might not see coming throughout the film it's when everything has fallen into place that we can go ahh the film revolves around the death of a husband in an airplane explosion and the million dollars the wife receives from it there are those with great interest in that money one in particular being the dead man's mistress the wife is lisa ida galli and the mistress demanding half the money is lara janine reynaud she tells lisa she knows that the death was arranged by her to get the insurance money lara says she'll use her lawyer sharif luis barboo to get that money so already the film produces two possible suspects in the later murder of lisa who awaiting someone in tokyo george hilton portrays peter lynch peter works for a company that investigates those who gain inheritance to see if the pay day was gathered under suspicious means when on his watch lisa is killed by a man dressed from head to toe in black in her hotel room he is a possible suspect he decides to do a little investigating himself while also assisting inspector stavros luigi pistilli and interpol agent benton tom felleghy on their quest to find a killer the killer strikes several times eliminating anyone revolving around the missing million dollars confiscated by the one responsible for the murder of lisa soon the film follows a journalist clÃ©o dupont the delicious luscious anita strindberg as she and peter meet for a dinner where she could try and sniff out anything that might break a story for her soon they fall deeply in love but it seems like anyone who is near peter is killed soon someone attacks clÃ©o with an intent to kill which pushes the investigation further into uncharted territory why would anyone wish to harm a journalist with no real facts to damage the one killing off people br br this giallo is quite clever and exciting to follow the film never lulls which is quite remarkable since so much happens leaving open the question of the identity of the killer this film follows the path of gialli with knife slashings because of a certain pattern the killer has taken the throat and lower torso the film's conclusion wraps up all the complex loose ends and is quite satisfying the film has some unique camera angles but delivers the goods in terms of driving the plot and the execution of the mystery
<START> now i hired this movie because brad dourif was in it he is an excellent actor brilliant in everything except this movie and i think that was only because he realized how stupid this movie was and didn't bother with a good performance this movie is a unintentional comedy some of the lines just crack me up and them there are some lines that make no sense and it seems like tobe hooper just throw lines in without thinking about the plot oh btw the plot is bad but it one of those films that is taht bad that its actually painful to watch i recommend this only for big brad dourif fans or fans of any of the other actors because the plot is pathetic
<START> david chase's the sopranos is perhaps the most over praised television show in recent memory not only is the series devoid of intellect and passion it's devoid of a soul as anyone reading likely knows already james gandolfini is tony soprano a big fat a hole of a mob boss with a spoiled b tch of a wife and two bratty sh t brained kids living in you guessed it the armpit of america that's new jersey by the way not only is tony a womanizing adulterer he's also an unrepentant murdering scumbag with a crew of saturday night live skit worthy caricatures for subordinates it's not the fact that tony is a piece of sh t mobster that offends me and apparently only me allowing characters to be who and what they are without judgment is something american tv hardly allows but chase and his entourage of money gorged emmy gored writers have not simply allowed us to observe tony and his crew as they behave nor have they even attempted to provide any insight into the action reaction reality of even obviously fictionalized organized crime a la the godfather instead chase glorifies and endorses his characters' greedy violent and corrupt lifestyle in the same way that tony his wife and even his hair brained psychologist do week after week or should i say month after month or is it year after year it seems like the show's paltry 13 episode seasons come out with the same regularity as a lunar eclipse much has been made of the series' refusal to adhere to network structure with plot lines that go nowhere and characters that pop up and disappear like backyard vermin but if the show is so brilliant in its lack of structure why does it always feel like i'm watching a soap opera tired mob clichÃ©s bored housewives self serving irredeemable characters and plots that go nowhere more than ever i can see why so many americans of italian heritage are p ssed at this show it's enough to make you want to curl up with a good book dantÃ©'s inferno springs to mind br br people on imdb love to claim that there's nothing good on television and therefore the sopranos is a breath of fresh air are these same people too busy paying their cable bills to watch the shield it's included in basic ya know how about the still good the west wing or the brilliantly acted if erratically written boston legal what about possibly the best comedy of the last few decades arrested development and lest we forget that we live in an age of dvds nobody has to watch anything new i'd much rather shell out 40 for an over priced boxed set of well pretty much anything than give hbo 10 a month or 80 a dvd set to continue to prove how much of a hack factory it can be br br you want good television watch homicide life on the street or murder one or picket fences or even chase's prior show northern exposure if you're already among the sopranos 's legion of brain washed fans and critics it's too late for you but if not leave tony and his worthless kin where they all belong rotting with the fishes sleeping would be way too kind
<START> i saw this movie the other night i can't even begin to express how much this movie sucked the writing the voice acting even the claymation terrible terrible terrible it's like watching 24 hours of c span for the sake of comedy it just doesn't work it literally falls flat at about every spot possible br br also the movie's animation is very poor quality i know that this is an movie made by one person but to think that he could make 97 minutes worth of crap maybe he could at least make 1 second worth of funny br br this show may take the cake for being the worst film of all time yikes it really was that bad if you're looking for a movie that will make you laugh steer clear from this abomination my advice don't even buy it or look it up for that matter your brain will than you
<START> i don't know what else to say about this horrible movie that hasn't already been said honestly i have only myself to be angry with i should have know better when i saw the title of this movie that it would be a horrible piece of crap but i loved war games so i indulged my whim i will live to regret that decision the rest of my life from the very start when the government people explained that their super computer could determine who a terrorist was just by how well they played a video game i knew i was in for a ride though the land that good writing forgot the list of very very very bad plot lines dialog and acting is so long i would crash imdb if i tried to post it to those people who said that they have seen worst movies than this one please tell me i am actually curious to see something that could top this steaming pile of horse dung
<START> when this movie was first shown on television i had high hopes that we would finally have a decent movie about world war i as experienced by american soldiers unfortunately this is not it br br it should have been a good movie about wwi even though it was made for television it is obvious that a real effort was made to use appropriate equipment and props but the writing and directing are badly lacking even though the makers of this movie obviously borrowed freely from quite a few well made war movies war movie clichÃ©s abound such as the arrogant general who apparently does not care a flip about the lives of his men when will hollywood realize that even though there have been plenty of bad generals most combat unit generals have seen plenty of combat themselves and are not naive about what the average grunt experiences the first part of this movie appeared to be paths of glory with american uniforms except that paths of glory was emotionally gripping later on there was chamberlain's charge except uphill from gettysburg and even the capture of the american soldier by a ring of enemy soldiers from the thin red line but in the thin red line the soldier was alone when captured in this movie a ring forms around the new prisoner in the middle of a battle br br if this movie used a military adviser they ignored him even though the actors and i never could forget they were actors while watching mouthed military tactics i didn't see very much of it the american soldiers would stand up to be shot while the germans attacked and the infamous storm troopers who were apparently blind appeared to use no tactics whatsoever in their attack in the real war the tactics were what made storm troopers so effective but the silliest scene was the attack of the german flamethrowers in this scene the german flamethrower operators walked in a broad line towards the defending americans if that had been real they would never have gotten close enough to use their flamethrowers before they had all been dropped by the defender's bullets br br okay so most war movies are unrealistic when it comes to the tactics shown but it is still disappointing but what really turned me off to this flick was the typical anti war anti military angle that movie makers seem to think is important true war is hell but most american soldiers even though they grumble and gripe tend to believe in what they are doing and can be rather gung ho about it my grandfather served in world war i and even though he died four years before i was born i have been told how proud he was of his service
<START> i came into this movie really wanting to line it i thought the premise had a lot of potential and was ripe for an interesting movie don't get me wrong here i wasn't expecting citizen kane i was taking this for the b movie that it is that said it still fell short of the expectation the historical aspect of the story is glazed over and the ending left me a bit cold the acting in the movie was very wooden all in all i give it 4 for a great idea but the movie could have scored much higher with a bit more attention to movie making fundamentals is it worth seeing i didn't wish for my two hours back but i don't know that i'd recommend it to others
<START> i was forced to see this because a i have an 11 year old girl and b we had shown her the bonita granville nacy drew movies from the 1930s which she thoroughly enjoyed personally i didn't think it was as humorous as the 1930s flicks but on the other hand it wasn't the nauseating piece of intelligence insulting fluff i feared it would be it was an inoffensive mildly entertaining movie although i'm pleased that they didn't try to upgrade nancy to 21st century hipness veronica mars holds the title as the modern nancy drew i do think that they made her a little too bland that they didn't do enough to develop nancy drew the movie could have been titled jane doe girl detective i have to blame the script i think each actor did a good job with what they had to work with i liked emma roberts in this role but they gave her a made for tv not theatrical release script
<START> i'm so glad i happened to see this video at the store i was looking for some happy movies and this one turned out to be a true gem i loved that the movie a love story of sorts wasn't about some beautiful twenty somethings rather it's a story of some beautiful sixty somethings who used used to be twenty somethings it's a good well written and wonderfully acted story with fabulous wwii band music thrown in as well it's also got a delightful surprise in it for scottish castle lovers it left me smiling and ready to watch it again which i did a couple more times before i turned it in i highly recommend it
<START> i guess i've seen worse films but that may be becuz i'm so jaded by how standard these bad horror movies are the killer monster thing is really really bad basically its a guy in some kind of green body suit there is much worse acting as far as b movie go but don't think for a second this was anything stellar hell no it actually did have a plot with substance but was still pretty stupid basically its just a bad low budget horror movie but at least its not as bad as titanic that movie sucks balls this one just sucks the blood looks really fake in this movie thats one complaint i have about all the horror of the new millinium low grade gore looks stupid a good gruesome death scene with really fake blood is so stupid at least there was a nice shower scene
<START> first of all i became dissy after watching this movie for five minutes cause of the bas screenplay i don't think this movie has any purpose it's boring from the first minute to the last i don't understand why this movie scores so high i gave it 1 10 but actually it's not more wurth then 0 10
<START> take br br 1 a famous play br br 2 a director with now ideas of his own who is using br br 3 a copy of the stage design of a popular theatre production of the play mentioned in 1 br br 4 an actor for the lead who has no feeling for the part he's playing and you'll get hamlet prinz von dÃ¤nemark br br i listened to the radio play of hamlet with maximilian schell as hamlet and i was so disappointed i hoped that the filmed version would be better that schell would at least have a body language to underline what he's saying nothing then the set the minimalistic design is not everyone's taste but usually i like it when there's just enough on the stage to make clear what's the setting and nothing more alas that's on a stage in a theatre it won't work in a film based on a play that actually has believable settings that the idea for the set was copied from the theatre production in which schell played the hamlet already let's say if that was the only thing to complain about i ask myself how schell could get the part of hamlet anywhere in first place and how anybody could allow him to play hamlet a second time if you've got the choice to view any of the about sixty films based on hamlet don't watch this one unless you're a masochist or really hardcore or like to poke fun on untalented actors
<START> jack london's life was certainly colorful enough for a dozen films about different aspects of him sad to say though that what his life was used for in film was some wartime propaganda that put the best face on some of the least attractive parts of his character br br jack london who barely saw the age of 40 when he died wrote some of the best stories around he wrote on what he knew but he also wrote as does everyone else bringing the baggage of his own life experience with him some of that experience in another day and time would have been condemned as racism but this was world war ii and london was a big believer in the 'yellow peril' as it was called back in the day br br two thirds of the film covers his life as author we see his years as a seaman from where he got the inspiration for the sea wolf we see him up in the yukon in a miner's cabin with a dog that was no doubt his inspiration for the call of the wild london was able to capture the spirit of adventure that his own life was all about right on paper for the world to enjoy ever since br br the final third dealt with his time as a war correspondent covering the russo japanese war london was a socialist but his socialism did not encompass folks who were oriental like a few million others he saw the rising immigration of the chinese and japanese to our pacific coast as a threat to jobs for the white people he advocated strict immigration policies for orientals br br the film puts the cart before the horse london is presented as a man who saw because he was on hand at the russo japanese war what japan's ambitions were and for that reason was as xenophobic as he was actually the kind of atrocities present in world war ii were not existent during the russo japanese conflict japan had her imperial ambitions but so did everyone else including the usa at that time but our immigration policies caused by pressure from our west coast politicians was a big contributing factor to the deterioration of relations with japan over a couple of generations london was part of the cause not a prophet crying in the wilderness br br this film was the first independent production of samuel bronston who later did some films with a bit more budget than jack london had he a bit more money bronston might have gotten james cagney or spencer tracy both who would have been right for the role instead they got michael o'shea who was making his second film after lady of burlesque o'shea is fine in the part but certainly was no box office br br as london is covering the war he meets up with a captain tanaka who is played by leonard strong an actor who specialized in orientals and played a ton of them in world war ii from the vantage point in 1905 strong outlines in the best fu manchu tradition japan's imperial aims right up to taking on the usa eventually must have gone over great with the swing shift crowd br br a lot of course is left out of london's life including a first wife playing the second and only wife in this film is susan hayward who only comes into the movie when it's half over i wish we'd have seen more of her charmian kittredge london survived her husband by almost 40 years dying in 1955 br br o'shea in fact met and married the leading lady of his life in jack london virginia mayo has a small role in jack london and they married for 30 years until o'shea died in 1973 br br maybe one day we'll get a view of jack london that will be a lot better than this one
