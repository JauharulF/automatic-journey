<START> it begins on a nice note only to falter quickly and let down expectations br br mac akshay kumar and sam's john abraham characters are not properly built before mac's boss decides to hitch him with three air hostess rest of the drama is about how mac sam and uncle mambo paresh rawal deal with situations which at times seem forced br br about the cast paresh rawal is a very talented actor i thought was wasted in the role of a moody cook akshay kumar is tolerable john abraham is very bad keeps stumbling over furniture rajpal yadav is the only saving grace in the movie br br the second half of the movie is funny at times but in all a dud songs are boring and a major let down if you are hoping for some wholesome entertainment and comedy
<START> this wonderful little film has all of the elements that made the spaghetti western so exciting and fun great music by one of the few if not the only female composer to work in the genre nora orlandi exciting action sequences and very vicious ones for the day and beautiful scenery and sets all in almeria spain of course it also has a very good story with a nice tragic romance edge to it the actors do marvelous jobs with truly standout performances from lawrence dobkin and rosalba neri in the most vital role for a female in a spaghetti western outside of cardinale in leone's once upon a time in the west without posting any spoilers let me just say that this movie contains one of the best endings of any film i have ever seen
<START> i'm writing this because i somehow felt being led to believe dark remains was a good movie whilst it's not the worst i've seen it certainly isn't good br br a weak script weak actors and weak directing even if they can't afford big name cast would it be too much to ask for a more attractive lead actress it was painful to watch a plain actress through out the film with her dull performance the story was a clichÃ© and poorly scripted the special effects were minimal the suspense tricks employed repetitively here were hard to swallow br br to be fair dark remains is no worse than quite some of the masters of horrors' episodes but not quite on par with quality movies yet dark remains is only recommended for the hardcore horror fans who don't want to miss any movie in the genre even if it's a poorly made one as for anyone else time should be spent on something more valuable which should be extremely easy
<START> having watched this film strictly on the strength of reviewers' ratings i was most pleasantly surprised although clearly low budget it bears the signs of clever ingenuity for example when julia wakes in the strange house and looks out the window i found myself thinking that her sense of isolation would be enhanced with an exterior shot focused on her face and then moving backwards to include the house and its isolated location and lo and behold the next scene was exactly that last shot of the house standing lonely on the cliff at the water's edge there are other examples of how a clever director can elevate his film to the level of a very enjoyable thriller savvy viewers will surely spot them but should rest assured they will not be disappointed br br as to the performances george macready is his usual creepy self barely maintaining his composure while suggesting a capacity for unadulterated violence nina foch was surprisingly good as the no nonsense working girl who's not about to submit without a fight but dame may witty oh boy she even had me doubting my own eyes and believing she could get away with her evil schemes br br this a real diamond in the rough and not to be missed
<START> this recreation of the infamous 1959 murders in kansas based on the capote book is starkly filmed by brooks and cinematographer hall in black and white giving it a documentary feel there are good performances from blake and wilson as the killers and forsythe as a cop who pursues them the scenes leading up to the murders filmed at the actual house where the crime occurred with a soundtrack of whistling winds are quite intense and chilling brooks directs with a lot of verve and uses several interesting transitions between scenes the only complaint is that it is a bit overlong with the denouement dragged out and somewhat preachy
<START> at least among those movies with 100 votes or more nominated for best screenplay written directly for the screen brenda blethyn nominated for best actress in a leading role nominated for best picture i always disagree with many of the oscar picks but this movie might very well be the worst movie of all time to be honored by the academy the writing and acting were both horrible blethyn's perfomance in particular was one of the worst i've ever seen and probably the most over rated acting performance of all time awful movie not worthy of the big screen and not worthy of any cable or television channel that has ever played it including hbo where i saw it i am only thankful i didn't actually pay to see one of the most over rated movies of all time
<START> as the faux russian scientist says two thirds of the way into the movie i came for the science this pretty much sums up the reason i watched this movie anything that involves a half man half hammerhead shark definitely deserves a serious empirical investigation on the part of an impartial aspiring scientist or as they say in the biz my girlfriend's brother had the remote and the rest is history to say that the special effects were bad would be a disservice to the field of special effects this is 2005 it is not that hard to film a car scene without a cheesy bluescreen background yeah this was charming and state of the art when hitchcock was filming the birds but in 2005 it just looks low budget spare me the cheap attempt at sci fi and do me the service of actually making an attempt at the willing suspension of disbelief br br however having seriously defamed the overall concept of this film let me tell you again that as sad as it may sound this is probably worth your time if nothing else it is a tour de force of bad sci fi worth the education for the new movie buff and certainly worthy of a refresher course for those who have seen a few movies in their day br br the crazy hunchback mad scientist with a hammerhead transceiver who thinks it is a good idea to spoon canfuls of blood into the nearby water makes me question not only the intelligence of mankind but also the ability of b movie writers to come up with remotely plausible plot lines br br this film also pretty much fulfills one of my longtime bad movie contentions bad guys always wear sunglasses br br if this weren't 2005 i would be deadset on the fact this film was some sort of insanely poor metaphor for the cold war i mean you might as well have khan on the bridge of a klingon bird of prey inserting leaches into chekhov's ear br br one of the most moving lines of the movie is when the chick without the bra insists that the charlton heston lookalike wait for tom as he is trying to lift the escape helicopter off the ground the thing is tom is wasting the bad sunglass guys with his never ending banana clip attached to his kalashnikov or ak 47 in layman's terms br br as the mad scientist says near the end of the film my goal is to evolve the human species suffice it to say that this movie contributed only to a devolution of humankind the faint freudian references uttered by the mad scientist as he prepping the female protagonist to be mated with a hammerhead shark are a simple reminder that even in the worst of science fiction we can all find something to laugh about
<START> if you're a fan of mystery science theater 3k attack of the giant leeches or pinata survival island this movie might be for you br br i live in nashville and i didn't even know of this movie's existence until the day prior to its release when the advertising company panicked and blanketed music row with dozens of fliers and billboards it barely lasted two weeks in theaters anyway br br bad acting bad writing and poor production only begin to describe this embarrassment of a film for starters the names are a bit much bo price angel and dixie eesh br br toby's awkwardly slow delivery of lines makes one wonder what production assistant got stuck holding the cue cards off camera angel's character rapidly transitions from her city slicker ways to a cowgirl slipping into southern slang after two days on the ranch her wardrobe goes from chic to a female version of toby's in fact in the final scene their outfits are identical making one wonder if the wardrobe assistant called in sick br br the audio is inconsistent perhaps the most noticeable example is when toby decides to go for a swim and his voice suddenly sounds like he's shouting in a gymnasium br br there's never quite enough explanation or character development to suffice what happens on screen overacting exasperation grimaces and moodiness best describes the actors' interpretation and direction of the terrible script br br this movie is best enjoyed after consuming a couple of alcoholic beverages and in the company of your wittiest friends but that's not saying much
<START> there's no way to confront 'zabriskie point' from a rational standpoint or attempt to describe it using words and conventions you'd use for other movies this is because it isn't a movie it's an idea and a feeling that the filmmakers have that somehow got turned into an object as mundane as a film what we see are not the unfoldings of a plot but rather a sequence of events that we don't see in films every day but only imagine happening as the background we ourselves will supply when we hear about some tragic event in the news of or from friends we we see is our imagination of people that are abstractions to us no one we know but we've doubtless heard of them in a book or on tv or somewhere so what do we see events we see people arguing driving and inevitably escaping only the escape is from something intangible it is the collective situation and cruelty that the mass of a civilization has allowed to exist though laziness or human nature set in late 1960s los angeles our players act against and in response to the self inflicted miseries of modern existence these creatures are effectively blank slates that can display any trait we can imagine if we desire although the actions taken might be seen as criminal or irresponsible the characters are not themselves criminals they are human beings seeking a return to a familiar non manufactured existence that is beyond the normalcy they experience everyday not that they are ever happy or sad but they achieve a type of self actualization when they move beyond and away from the suicide of modern living they only achieve true life in the natural world even though that is the next victim of modern existence at the end 'zabriski point' is a eulogy of humanities attachment to the natural world as even the most desolate pieces of the earth succumb to our notions of progress we lose our souls on the path to death of the human spirit
<START> yeah this films is tops cant recommend it more gay or strait its a great doco for anyone who likes film very funny sad and interesting never dull great access a film made with passion and interest in the subject matter some of the performances and just amazing if you only find this film on vhs it is still very worth watching great 10 out of 10 i got to see part of this doco years about ten years ago and did not understand what i was watching the interviews are very revealing about egos of the performers who are like heavy weight boxers trying to punch their way out of the ghetto the filmmaker was apparently a first timer so what an achievement cool track it down
<START> i hate this movie it was nothing like the book and just thinking about it makes me mad if you watch the movie before reading the book then yeah it's a good movie but king's book was amazing and this movie was nothing like it i mean the general meaning might be sort of similar but most aspects of the movie are completely different the ending for example so in the book it is extremely intense and danny and wendy escape seconds before the hotel explodes but in this horrible movie version jack like takes them through a stupid maze yeah there is no maze in the book and there is no reason for it another part that made me angry was that jack just kills mr halloran what the heck he is basically the hero of the book and they just kill him off like he wasn't important overall it was just bad that the movie was so extremely off
<START> call me adolescent but i really do think that this is a great series if you haven't had a chance to experience a few episodes of the latest star trek series you should definitely watch this one perhaps more compelling than that of voyager's caretaker which launched the series with cpt janeway archer's adventures are completely different yet strangely familiar the music is catchy too no true sci fi fan can go without seeing at least one star trek episode and these installments make the wait worthwhile
<START> don't see this movie bad acting and stupid gore effects a complete waste of time i was hoping to see a lot of cool murders and hot chicks instead the director depended on animal slaughter videos to shock you the watcher disgusting the murders are pretty lame basically strangulation one woman he stuffs worms in her mouth one he puts raw hamburgers on her face and strangles her btk btk broiler burger king's killer new sandwich ha ha i don't think this movie relied too much on actual facts i mean he real btk killer didn't carry around a bunch of rodents scorpions and worms and oh yeah a slaughtered cow head too go figure
<START> this film was pure pain sitting in the theater for x amount of minutes i was wondering when the film was going to start all the setups were in place typical love story characters have to overcome their short givings villain has to emerge but none of it ever initiated by the time these things happened i was already bored stiff and the devices were completely ineffective in scenes that required immense tension and buildup it felt like necessary frames were cut kid's stuff does not have to be this way children's films can be as riveting and engaging as adult ones the excuse hey its for kids is bull i'll take sword in the stone any day this was terrible i'm getting the feeling that disney will put out anything these days and as for the kids the 10 year i saw this with will agree pure trash
<START> this production of oliver is masterful in showing layers of evil in the human soul what makes the story remarkable is a brilliantly bright unseen character who pierces this darkness as he leads an innocent boy through the gravest dangers safely into the hands of his own relative yea though oliver walks through the valley of the shadow of death he fears no evil a rod and staff are there to comfort him in the end he is saved from the dregs of humanity at the bottom is fagin the most wicked of the lot fagin contemplates repenting of his ways not once but twice yet declines because he is unwilling to pay the price fagin is worse than bill sikes because he raises little pickpockets who become murderers in the middle is oliver his innocence is unsullied but untried as well the best is nancy lacking in judgment she ignores bill sikes' violent nature out of her deep need for love yet unlike fagin at the probable cost of her own life she does repent of her sins by saving oliver from bill things are not as they seem in my opinion this quality is what makes art worthwhile unpredictability i would give this film a 10 but its '70's made for tv soundtrack and ambiance were distracting overall a fine parable and a thoroughly appropriate story for all audiences
<START> hardcastle and mccormick is an excellent tv show br br yes it is predictable much like the dukes of hazzard hunter the a team etc etc etc br br this show is just good clean television the relationship between hardcastle and mccormick is quite amusing they often take jabs at each other several times an episode which adds a great deal of humor to the show it contains several car chases in almost every episode but who doesn't enjoy a good car chase especially with the coyote br br i only wish they made clean television like this today i highly recommend this
<START> being a ni supporter it's hard to objectively review a movie glorifying ulster nationalists characters who are hard to root for typical heavy handed anti violence messages and a predictable 'poetic justice' ending makes this an awkward watch
<START> in the previews the 40 year old virgin boasts the image of another immature sex romp about a 40 ish lonely guy who suddenly feels the urge to do the deed simply because he hasn't too many past bad experiences have dampened his enthusiasm to the point that he avoids women completely and then the unexpected happens he falls in love what's more there's a movie out about it and it's called the 40 year old virgin br br the virgin of the title is andy stitzer steve carell who is indeed 40 works as an employee at an electronics store and collects vintage action figures which are displayed all throughout his nice bachelor pad for all to see he has a lovely home theater system and watches survivor with his two kind elderly neighbors he's a pretty picturesque definition of the lonely guy who needs to go out more and talk to more women br br now here's the real novelty with this picture it does the impossible task of actually dealing with its subject matter in a cute mature fashion this is a movie that could very easily have turned out a lot differently in the hands of a more transparent team of filmmakers it could have descended into endless sex gags and jokes but thankfully this picture never stoops that low sure there are sex jokes here and there and even a few prods are aimed at the gay community which are in no way meant to be taken as gay bashing as two of the characters exchange insults towards each other while playing a video game mortal kombat deception no less the ultimate testosterone driven fightfest for guys br br as someone who is rapidly approaching 20 collects mcfarlane toys action figures and has himself never done the deed i found this film amusing and touching in a way that a similar themed movie could never have been i was able to relate to the character of andy stitzer more than anyone in the theater because i was the only teenager present at this showing everyone else looked like they were all past 40 a bit arrogant i know but would you you is italicized still be able to relate if you were the only teen present at an afternoon screening of the 40 year old virgin br br of course andy has never had sex and wakes up everyday with morning rise don't ask and he's pressured by his buddies to try outlandish methods of gaining the attention of the opposite sex when it's first discovered andy is a virgin at 40 his three buddies and fellow electronics store coworkers david paul rudd jay romany malco and cal seth rogen all at first assume he's gay because he's never been with a woman which couldn't be any further from the truth the truth is andy loves women but past traumatic experiences revealed hilariously one after the other in a flashback sequence have put him on the sidelines for good br br david jay and cal each embark on a mission to get andy laid so help them all but you know that such escapades will only end in disaster as proved by one date with nicky leslie mann who puts andy through the worst drunk driving experience i think anyone would not want to go through and he has a rather creepy encounter with beth elizabeth banks the pretty girl who works in the bookstore and is eventually revealed to be a total sex fiend br br things brighten up for andy when he meets trish catherine keener the friendly woman who works at a store across the street that sells stuff on ebay for people hmmm and with that nice looking collection of action figures you can go figure that in the end a large financial payoff awaits him that is if he can ever do the deed br br at last this is the sex romp we've been waiting for it deals with a very real issue a lot of lonely guys probably go through not that anything is wrong with being a virgin but let's look at the big picture how many of us lonely guys want to be a lonely guy forever the important thing we're taught in this picture is that lonely guy must be himself i don't think he needs to go through body waxing like andy does which is side splitting to be honest and according to this website and various other news articles was in fact real and so was the blood on carell's shirt afterward br br the 40 year old virgin was directed by judd apatow and co written by himself and carell which originated as a skit that starred carell carell is sweet and human as his character is not some layabout who approaches this thing with his eyes shut this is probably one of the most intelligent romps i've ever seen and is not offensive a whole lot because its characters are treated with dignity and respect even carell's buddies who pass off bad advice to cover up their own relationship insecurities can be related to on a fundamental level br br the way the 40 year old virgin plays out is indeed funny in the end but i'll leave that up to you the viewer to observe surely if anyone can go through the things andy does and still have the strength to attract a woman as sexy as catherine keener then it's true it is never too late br br 10 10
<START> this movie was slower then molasses in january in alaska the man who put togeather the preview should get an award for managing to put every one of the 30 seconds that were interisting into the preview i had to wake up the people i was watching it with several times after it was over i felt bad for having woken them up br br most of the film is taken up with hoping something will actually happen but nothing ever does it was easy to loose track of people's motives and the characters were flat and uninteristing by the end of the movie you just hoped everyone would died everyone runs around either being contemptible petty or pitiful and usually all three br br and worse we watched a minute or two of the added features just for kicks and giggles you understand and all that we saw was people being smug about how socially aware they are if they had spend the time on the movie that they did patting themselves on the back it might have been worth watching br br i was brought in expecting the excitement of '24 ' i got a lecture on social awareness through the blery eyes of the sandman
<START> typically terrible trash from director fred olen ray about a female cyborg hunter teagan commissioned by warden jan michael vincent to find and execute escaped alien convict ross hagen who has charted course for earth soon forest ranger john phillip law will have to protect a group of obnoxiously hammy college kids headed by the grating richard wiley who ran over hagen with his rv on a camping trip gone awry soon the cyborg will be blasting away with her arm laser burning one innocent alcoholic doctor robert quarry of count yorga vampire fame proving that no one will stand in it's way of retrieving the hide of the convict whose collar is a tracking device that weakens his body law finds an ally in leo gordon an old vietnam war vet with way too weapons stashed in his cabin br br perhaps intentionally made awful this features what fans of rancid cinema yearn for dreadful special effects acting and premise at least the film has pj soles for some eye candy even in '89 she was quite smokin' that laser gun sure is funny it can incinerate some houses yet when the cyborg shoots at law it barely leaves a mark on the location fired
