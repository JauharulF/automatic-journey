<START> well what can you say about sitcoms there often quite lame morale dedicative and just plain so is this show it got a boring cast although a bynes is okej in her perky way the rest is just stereotypical crap as always we have all seen it before and will probably see it all over again when this show is cancelled cause lets face it its a mediocre and self righteous show as the most sitcoms are br br well in short if you wanna see some good entertainment you can rather take a twenty minute pause in front of the mirror do some faces and move on its more entertaining than this show
<START> i really liked this film all three stars connery fishburne and underwood give credible performances and harris is enjoyably over the top the lighting and shot angles in some of harris' scenes make his face look truly diabolical the surprising turn of plot at the end makes it interesting not a great movie but an enjoyable one i gave it 7 of 10
<START> richard dreyfus is not the star here he has about three 20 second cameos and what is gene barry doing all over this movie no idea the director was probably his brother this is a movie that makes no sense whatsoever the inept writer director same dude butchered up everyone's talent with his horrendous uh work i got the dvd for a penny so can't complain but it's weird and it makes you feel weirded out and in not a good way this was the 70's and looks like the director was on a bad acid trip and wanted everyone to experience what it's like to be inside his head it has a somewhat interesting and controversial concept but like a scratched record it quickly plays foul it has that manson family on acid vibe to it br br i have no idea how the other reviewer got all they did out of this movie maybe they worked in it back when at any rate be prepared to lose 80 min of your life you'll never get back yes it's that awful
<START> the good earth is a great movie that you don't hear much about anymore there are a lot of big disasters and events but it is also a non passionate love story all of this happens in a little over two hours which is short by today's standards the special effects and costumes are very good for the time period br br i am surprised that luise rainer received an oscar for such a limiting role she basically only has three emotions submissive hungry and heart broken br br the performances by the asian and asian american actors are terrific br br
<START> america needs the best man possible to win the game so who do they hire a gymnast oh brother played by kurt thomas who has the necessary skills to win in a game which involves ninjas a village of crazies and richard norton who is told by kurt thomas to keep his hardware in his pants his exact words i missed this in theaters and it's a good reason because i would have probably been kicked out due to the laughing i broke into at regular intervals the first thing that went through my mind was just how lame these ninjas are if a gymnast can kick their ass kurt thomas is like 5 foot 4 and he hardly strikes one as the best man for the job as to the acting talent of kurt thomas well if you can't say something nice in all seriousness though one has to wonder how much cocaine was being used to furnish an idea so stupid only the decision to cast tara reid as a scientist tops the dumbness here for 18 years though this held the title of the dumbest movie i had ever seen not to say i didn't find this unwatchable i was laughing so hard i almost choked to death twice only in the 80's could a movie with such a bad idea get made although for the record it is the only movie to ever feature a hero so wimpy he can't even pull a wedged sword out from the ground this is the wimpiest action movie ever made and one of the most hilarious also br br out of 4 bad
<START> this is one of the weirder movies i have recently watched that's because it seems less like a movie and more like an experimental film kurasawa's experiment was to take a variety of individuals who live at a garbage dump and weave their experiences into a tapestry that offers glimpses of their generally harsh existences not every episode is depressing and harsh but overall this is definitely the tone let's see we have a case of incest rape attempted murder wife swapping alcoholism infidelity death of a little boy after eating tainted fish a man with severe depression he never talks during the movie and looks very scary a hopeless dreamer who would probably be diagnosed with schizophrenia a mentally retarded young man who thinks he is a street car conductor and spends all his waking moments driving his street car through paths among the garbage piles a man married to a total shrew i think i liked her character even less than the incestuous rapist etc etc in fact it is depressing enough that it seemed almost like an ingmar bergman movie set in japan as bergman made many movies that tended to deal with mental illness and the hopelessness of life is it any wonder that after making this film kurasawa tried to kill himself so did i like it no it was not a fun experience but it was a very well made movie that definitely kept my attention and as a result i really wanted to see what happened to these people it was sort of like watching a train wreck you don't want to see all the carnage but you can't help but watch of all the vignettes i think that the older man who tended to look out for everyone and who didn't really seem to fit in he was too well adjusted and wise to be living in a garbage dump was perhaps meant to represent kurasawa himself maybe i dunno br br if you've seen a variety of kurasawa films and have a high tolerance for strange art films give this one a watch however do not make this your first experience watching his movies it's sure to scare away many viewers
<START> this movie is to halloween what the hilarious christmas story is to christmas both are relatively low budget no big name stars type films and both are two of the absolute greatest and funniest movies available both seasonal classics spaced invaders comes galloping out right from the start with warmth and humor and a superb cast of characters all five goofy martians klembecker the realtor russell the deputy vern at the fuel dispensing depot and so many more you just have to see this movie to believe it and like christmas story it just keeps getting better and better with each viewing and you pick up on fun little things each time most definitely a ten
<START> i thought the movie was ok but very disappointed that they didn't capture the true image of his life i was so anticipating to see his mother being an actual jamaican that it's driving me crazy just watching the beginning of the movie told me that the movie was not accurate which i completely lost interest just a matter of seconds from the beginning of the movie i'm very disappointed that's like watching a biography story on mark anthony and having arnold play the part i don't know what the writer was thinking missing a valuable piece of the movie which i'm sure his mother played a huge role in his life i will say the movie was ok besides the major fla
<START> if in the first 10 minutes of this film you don't realize that the main character who writes a life advice column is going to have the tables oh so cleverly turned and learn some valuable life lessons himself then there is probably something wrong with you the set up is so predictable as to ruin the movie even if the rest of the movie was good which it isn't br br there's almost no chemistry between the leads and steve carell's stalker ish behavior is embarrassing not funny it's hard to believe binoche's character would have any interest in him then in the end it's all wrapped up so wonderful and everyone lives happily ever after isn't that great america
<START> i still can't believe how bad this movie was if i wasn't a massochist i don't know if i would have survived the viewing it looks like it cost about 1000 to make but it wasn't the money that brought them down the acting was horrid not just bad 3rd graders could have read the lines better second the only other reason to watch this kind of movie is the skin and that is sorely lacking in this flick we don't even get to see the more attractive chicas in the buff br br ahh well better luck next time eh
<START> it's true that you always remember what you were doing at a point when disaster or tragedy strikes and none more so that september 11 2001 a date which changed the entire global landscape in its fight against terrorism br br no this documentary didn't set out to be dwelling on the events leading to 9 11 rather the filmmakers brothers gÃ©dÃ©on and jules naudet set out to do a documentary on the trials and tribulations of a rookie new york firefighter they had gone to the academy and done some shoots of training and had handpicked their proby probation firefighter to join them in an ny firehouse home to ladder 1 and engine 7 but their production was to develop and contain at that time believed to be the only shot of the first plane slamming into the world trace center br br i was traveling back with a friend on the train from a night of lan gaming and received a call at about 850pm local time from my dad who informed me of the above few minutes later he told me there was another and that the wtc was under attack by the time i arrived home the upper floors of the twin towers were ablaze and in smoke and to my horror they collapsed under an hour br br the filmmakers had two cameras running that day one who had followed a team out on a routine call and which immediately raced to the wtc upon hearing and seeing the plane crash into it we follow what is possible the only filmed sequence of events in the lobby of wtc1 where the first responders of firefighters paramedics and police had to make sense of what happened and to quickly develop a plan of action the other camera held by the other brother was making his way to wtc to look for his sibling and along the journey captured the many expressions of new yorkers as well as the sense of chaos in and around manhatten br br peppered throughout the documentary are numerous interviews with the men from ladder 1 and engine 7 which miraculously did not suffer any casualty but being survivors also brought about its own set of psychological turmoil as they struggle to come to terms with the event through the events that unfold we learn of the strong camaraderie amongst these men who risk live and limb each day on their jobs to save lives br br we began with what the documentary was supposed to be before events of the day totally swung in and became the focus right up to the rescue phase where hopes of finding survivors under the rubble were kept alive by the men who work round the clock in making sense of the collapsed steel structures it's not a film that is fabricated and what you see here cannot be recreated in any other documentary and heavens not sound stages for hollywood blockbusters it's as close as you can get to that day witnessing the event up close from safety br br code 1 dvd contains a separate extra hour of 4 sets of interviews with the men of ladder 1 and engine 7
<START> what a disappointment i hated the mummy but this one was even worse it was very tiring and unbelievable and at a certain point i found myself sighing and yawning all the time i can't believe that people actually liked this movie the role of nicholas cage wasn't very convincing the whole movie felt like a grand tour around america's most wanted buildings the never stopping flow of hints and combinations wasn't very convincing either i stopped paying attention around 30 minutes what was supposed to be a happy night out became a total disappointment what a drag i guess i've just seen too many movies to enjoy national treasure
<START> spoilers contained in order to make a observation br br twenty years on from 1984 this film speaks loads about prince's future in the music industry br br there is a scene that sums up prince's musical output of the last 10 years perfectly which is if you took the best two songs off his last 10 albums you would have one fantastic album br br the scene plays like this prince runs off to his dressing room after playing one song and the owner of the club enters the dressing room to give prince an earful about his fall from grace during the 90's and putting out albums that only the most hardcore fans would be able to tolerate and support his artistry br br club owner you're not packing them like you used to the only person that digs your music is yourself br br spooky huh how about the musical underscore which makes prince even more evil when he smacks apollonia to the ground in two separate scenes it gave me chills that that was not the only scene women where mistreated in this film br br i'm all for the comedy sparring's between morris day and jerome benton as these two stole every scene they were in but what was funny about throwing a woman into a trash can that was plain nasty the other nasty bit was the chalk outline of prince's father on the floor thoughtfully provided by the minnieapolis police which causes prince to go even more loony fantastic br br purple rain is an entertaining film overall as it is the soundtrack of prince songs that boosts it's value by 110 but then again the film gives us another theory on prince and his music as the film tells us that prince's biggest song of the film is written by wendy lisa and princes wife beating musical father br br are prince and the filmmakers trying to tell us that prince stole all his best songs from his father after finding his fathers music sheets of written songs maybe that is why prince started to run out of steam during the 90's because he ran out of his fathers ideas hmmmm
<START> this movie was directed by victor nunez who also wrote the screenplay ulee's gold nice and straightforward writing that was nominated for the independent spirit award looking at ruby's day to day life what we see is a slice in the life of the young woman ruby ashley judd sisters won the independent spirit award best female lead for this role ruby is starting to live on her own and establishing her own identity she explores jobs friendships boy friends sex a typical young adult search the movie won grand jury prize at the sundance film festival as an independent film enthusiast i picked the movie because of sundance i appreciate this type of movie because it does not carry the hollywood baggage br br although the stories are completely different this reminded me of nobody's fool staring paul newman the later movie is a slice of the daily life of a common man i like that the story is very nicely told and all we had to do was sit and enjoy the story the only thing i am not sure about is the title i am sure that there are not that many bugs and flies in paradise as there are in florida as i am allergic to mosquitos florida is no paradise to me i itch all over thinking about florida i turn into a complete red boil i recommend this movie favorite scenes ruby and her friend rochelle bridges played by allison dean walking at the beach of panama city florida indeed the sand is very white i have been there favorite quotes necessity has always been a good excuse all that fuss over finding a man is not at all different now who is going to be and when and why br br
<START> the original 1965 japanese film gamera http pro imdb com title tt0059080 was essentially an updating of the darker less kid oriented gojira godzilla for 1960s sensibilities gamera of course is a giant flying flame throwing turtle who literally consumes energy not quite as big as some versions of godzilla but generally similar in most ways br br this version of the original film was edited and recut by the notorious sandy frank and just like the americanized version of godzilla godzilla king of the monsters gammera the invincible gets more than just the spelling wrong the american scenes are not nearly as ludicrous and annoying as those added to the great gojira but don't really add much to the story either because there is little follow up on them br br the film starts off promising there are a few scenes worth of character development and there are enough personalities to create some tension outside of the main plot once gamera appears however the film begins to descend into a fairly run of the mill kaiju film br br the acting is good enough even the american add ons are ok the directing is pretty good for this period and genre and the special effects are not bad at all for their time all miniatures some of the sets and backdrops are actually very good br br the biggest problem here of course is that there is little to nothing original about this film gamera however develops a much more unique personality in his later films most of which are worth watching if you are a kaiju fan
<START> every once in a while i will rent an action adventure film just as a way to relax and occupy my mind with nothing important this is why i own a copy of charlie's angels 2000 not a quality film but it makes me laugh and allows me to unwind for a while one of these days i will probably buy copies of the princess bride and a few monty python movies for much the same reason br br in any case i rented this film because i wanted to be entertained without being challenged for the most part i got what i wanted the plot was something along the lines of a poorly written xena episode and the kathy long's acting was very community theater not bad for a professional kick boxer and amateur actress there were a few high points on the part of the cyborgs somehow they managed to get some pretty good actors to play the bad guys unfortunately most of them die pretty darned quick br br like most martial arts films the further you get into the movie the more emphasis there is on action and the plot which wasn't strong to begin with deteriorates almost as quickly as the acting however the more kathy long fights the more time the director devotes to her backside by the end of the movie i was seriously considering watching it a second time just to count the number of times kathy long's tight red shorts were center screen br br unfortunately there just wasn't enough meat to this film to make satisfying curiosity worth seeing the film a second time if you are a hard core xena fan in need of something to wile away a few hours by all means go to the grocery store and spend the 50 cents on the rental there are some strong similarities between the show and this movie br br just don't expect anything more than to be mildly amused for a few hours br br unless of course you happen to like kathy long's derriÃ¨re then you might want to purchase a copy
<START> a lot of promise and nothing more an all star cast certainly by hk standards but man oh man is this one a stinker no story that's okay the action will make up for it like most hk action flicks what the action is terrible corny and sparse dragon dynasty's releases up to this point are by and large superb and generally regarded as classics in asian cinema this is a blight they managed to wrangle a couple of actors from infernal affairs but they can't bring life to a disjointed script there are scenes of dialogue where two or three lines are spoken with a cut in between each and no continuity in what the characters are saying you almost feel like they're each giving a running monologue and just ignoring the other characters michael biehn is made of wood really sammo hung uses a stunt double no way yes way stay away
<START> this is an entertaining movie actually might make you uncomfortable since it isn't some undead psychopath or sociopath its your everyday doctor how scary is that got some good actors and actresses in this movie though some where unappreciated like virginya keehne as sarah ken foree who you might recognize from rob zombie's devils rejects and halloween 2007 co stars as our detective on schizoid dr alan feinstone's corbin benson trail short little summary is this dr alan feinstone a guy who has a sexy wife nice house and is a great dentist everyone loves until he catches his wife cheating on him with the pool cleaner then he starts having hallucinations that his patients' teeth are all rotted and that the female patients are his wife as he starts going nuts in this thriller but before that nice guy
<START> absolutely fantastic trash this one has it all nudity good fight scenes gore action explosions etc it also stars the wonderful belinda mayne as ingrid not olga as the other reviewer pointed out although olga turns into ingrid later on in the film you'll have to watch it to see what i mean br br i won't bother to go into the story as it's far too long winded and not very interesting the relationship between ingrid and her brother bo robert ginty is interesting watch the towel stealing scene to see what i mean br br the fight scenes were at once quite good and then spoilt by some really shoddy gore effects that looked like they were done by the team who did city of the walking dead i e strange coloured blood gushing out of neck wounds br br i'd advise fans of low budget trash to check it out if they can track down a copy its pretty rare though and i couldn't ever see anyone bothering to re release it so it'll become all the rarer in a few years br br anyway i'd recommend it solely for belinda mayne's great nude scenes that lady's a fox
<START> although not the best anime i have ever seen but i enjoyed lady death br br i have never read the comic book and just saw this at the video store and decided to give it a chance br br the animation was ok i got the sense of the 80's anime from it which is what set it off for me why everyone else hates that is beyond me br br character development was fine i like how they brought the transition from hope to lady death around for you who don't like it obviously wasn't paying attention lucifer tells you how it happens and she used his words br br creamtor was a nice mentor soldier for her his dark bruiting style was perfect for this kind of movie br br i think everyone here who has bashed this needs to take another look at it and reconsider cause everything people have bashed this can be said about everyones favorite anime vampire hunter d
