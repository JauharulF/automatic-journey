<START> a very enjoyable film providing you know how to watch old musicals mysteries it may not come close to agatha christie or even thin man mysteries as a film noir but it's much more interesting than your typical boy meets girl or let's put on a show backstage musical as a musical it's no busby berkley or freed unit but it can boost the classic coctails for two and the weird sweet marijuana the film runs in real time during a stage show opening night of the vanities where a murder and soon another is discovered backstage is the murderer found out before the curtain falls sure but the search is fun even though somewhat predictable and marred by outbursts of comic relief luckily in the shape of the shapely goddess of the chorus girls toby wing the stupid cop is just a bit too stupid the leading hero is just a bit too likable the leading lady a bit too gracious the bitchy prima donna bit too bitchy and the enamoured waif a bit too self sacrificing but as stereotypes go they are pretty stylish there's a bevy of really gorgeous chorus girls who are chosen even better than the girls for a busby berkley musical of the same period who sometimes tend to be a bit on the plump side yes this film could have been much better than it is and the duke ellington number is an embarrassment but if you enjoy diving into old movies this will prove to be a tremendously tantalizing trip
<START> nothing will ruin a movie as much as the combination of a poor script and poor direction this is the case with the mummy's tomb br br the script is leftover ideas from older better universal horror flicks like dracula and frankenstein the direction is trite and stale the acting is mediocre even chaney's kharis is feeble compared to tom tyler's in the mummy's hand and the producers are foolish enough to add footage from christy cabanne's vastly better prequel and point up the weakness of their own film br br universal realized how bad this movie was and essentially remade it from scratch two years later as the mummy's ghost with a much better script and better director the result was likely the best film in their four film mummy cycle although not anywhere near as good as karl freund's 1932 original br br cabanne's footage raises this film to a 3 the new stuff is a 2 at best dick foran and wallace ford were probably glad to see their characters bumped off so they wouldn't have to appear in dreck like this anymore
<START> this is full of major spoilers so beware br br prix de beaute always suffers in comparison to the two films louise brooks made with g w pabst pandora's box and diary of a lost girl but in some ways prix is the quintessential brooks film here she has a chance to be charming without the dark side of her pabst collaboration what prix has that the pabst films don't is music in this early french film the whole louise brooks mystique is fleshed out powerfully with a conjunction of image song and music the charleston is what seems most associated with brooks she was the first to dance it in europe but the essence of the actress comes across more strongly in the tango the tango also plays a plot point in prix being the music she danced with on her short rise to stardom after becoming miss europe later when she has forsaken her fame in favor of a mundane existence as the wife of jealous husband andre the longing for her forsaken fame becomes apparent when the same tango record is seen on her apartment record player so appropriate is the tango to brooks it is used to accompany the documentary about her life looking for lulu a film narrated by shirley maclaine the brazen and forceful quality of the tango epitomizes louise brooks' strong headed but elegant and erotic individuality br br the song je n'ai qu'un amour c'est toi adds an immense amount of pathos to what is not a great film but a very good one by the way brooks' voice was not dubbed for the film by edith piaf as some have claimed piaf was born in 1915 and wasn't discovered until 1935 the song however is what brooks' character lucienne sings to andre at the beginning of the film to cheer him up and express her deep affection for him and at the climax it is the song she sings for her screen test which she views with the producers and managers who intend to shape her career it continues on screen after husband andre who has followed her to the screening room shoots and kills her in a single shot with lucinenne's dead body in repose at the bottom of the screen while her screen test continues above with the song she once sang to andre the essence of what movies do that other art forms do not is perfectly characterized as andre watches his now dead wife sing to him on screen the murder weapon still smoking he subtly smiles she is now his forever and by association ours br br coincidentally louise brooks real life career crashed and burned after prix de beaute so it was also the death of her final starring roll as well this film really seals the brooks mystique more so than the pabst films which are superior films no doubt it also points out what it is about the movies that create the whole idea of the cult of the movies where people like brooks james dean and marilyn monroe live on more intensely after their death than when they were alive
<START> i am really shocked that a great director like chuck jones started out making some of the most incredibly boring cartoons i've ever seen i did not laugh once throughout this short and it's a bugs bunny cartoon for christ's sake bugs bunny cartoons are always funny not boring alas this short turns out to be good night elmer another incredibly boring jones short with the addition of bugs bunny br br the first warning sign of a dull cartoon is always no gag payoff good night elmer was boring because it dragged on the same two gags forever with predictable payoff this cartoon on the other hand is afflicted with the second warning sign of a dull cartoon there's too much dialogue the cartoon at least has more than two gags up its sleeve but most of them seem longer than they are thanks to the immense padding of the dialogue at one point elmer finishes eating dinner and comments that was weawwy awfuwwy good weg of wamb possibly the most redundant dialogue i've ever heard in a cartoon characters reading text out loud in the later era woody woodpecker cartoons doesn't count in my book even though this cartoon is only 8 minutes long it feels like 20 thanks to redundant dialogue like this br br elmer's pet rabbit was not a fun cartoon for me but if you've sold your soul to chuck jones and are unable to acknowledge that he directed a few clunkers during his career you might enjoy it
<START> i give this marriage 3 years and thats stretching it adrianne curry is fouled mouth spoiled controlling loud and her bi sexual past makes me laugh she tells chris he has an image to protect and must avoid strip clubs he married her chris has low self esteem and from a different time warp i have nothing against adrianne curry but this combination is not gonna have a happy ever after ending her mother said he was an old rooster and thinks this is his last attempt to recapture his youth here 2 very good people who are gonna end up in a nasty divorce i don't think his old brady family is gonna fit into his new life i see them being shut out chris said his friends were more important than his family the supported him and was there for him
<START> what a complete waste of time the movie starts as a clone of the saw series but with even worse acting melissa joan hart is absolutely horrible the ending is ridiculous and the story contains no twists not plot surprises and just a plain bad ending i liked some of the characters and i was hoping for everything to be tied together at the end it just doesn't happen it's a total wrestler ending with none of the good acting i can't believe i spent the time watching this it's not fun as some people put it a guy in a mask kidnaps people who are connected and forces them to figure it out the connection is a stretch and he should have shot the main actress first
<START> 8 simple rules for dating my teenage daughter had an auspicious start the supremely talented tom shadyac was involved in the project this meant that the comedy would be nothing less of spectacular and that's exactly what happened the show remains one of the freshest funniest wittiest shows made in a very long time every line facial expression casting choice scene all wreaked of perfection there was not one episode after which i thought man that wasn't as good as the rest each one was a standout again this is the kind of perfectionism that we've come to expect from tom for those who don't know tom shadyac is the director of ace ventura first movie the nutty professor first one and liar liar quite a rÃ©sumÃ© he's a producer here not a director but his magic touch is felt in every episode the family consists of br br the father paul hennessy john ritter nice slightly neurotic can be a pushover from time to time works as a sports writer john unfortunately passed away in 2003 leaving a fond memory and near sure cancellation contemplations by the suits br br the mother cate katey sagal come on who didn't fall in love with katey when she played peg on married with children al bundy was our hero we viewers gave him the respect and love he never had but without peg's nonchalant parasitic lazy lifestyle al would've probably been just another chicago dad instead of the mess that peg life actually caused him to be katey was a milf back then and still is a brune now instead of a redhead and just as buxom as ever cate is the conservative mom and loving wife i know it sounds boring but comedically she fits perfectly br br the ditzy blonde daughter bridget played to perfection by kaley cuoco almost never has an idiot been played so well aside of gob on arrested development bridget may well be a shoe in for any awards given to this archetype bridget is shallow self centered not very bright and a tad slutty in his look she plays the dumb blonde role better than absolutely anyone imo perfection one of the high points of the show br br the overlooked geeky daughter kerry amy davidson a brune and a geek she gets no love from life or circumstances feels overlooked under appreciated and neglected most of the time she's bridget's younger sister in reality she's older than her and the two's extremely opposite personalities and brains cause endless clashes to much of our amusement br br the son rory martin spanjers was the second funniest character imo before the passing of ritter then john passes new characters come and rory is not the wise cracking verbal trouble maker that he used to that went mostly to david spade's character br br those characters were the main ones at the time of john ritter unfortunately enough the insanely hilarious larry miller one of my favorites did not get lots of screen time he played paul's co worker competitor after an aortic dissection cost ritter his life in 2003 september 11th the show was on hiatus for a while no one thought it could come back but it did later on with a couple of new additions this began the second phase of the show and the new characters were br br the strict confident school principal ed adam arkin i saw adam here and there on talk shows this was the first time that i saw him do anything impressed is the word i use his performance was very impressive sad he wasn't brought in earlier he also plays cate's potential love interest after paul passes the gradual progress towards this point which would've sounded crazy at the beginning earns the creators lots of praise it was done slowly carefully and excellently with constant respect paid to the paul ritter br br the attitude grandpa jim egan james garner a surprisingly welcome addition to the series he was cannon fodder for endless 'old' jokes mainly by br br the 35 year old unemployed wise cracking half brother of the mom cj played to insanely funny heights by david spade i knew spade was funny i just didn't know he was this funny somehow spade's very familiar presence is sensed inside his character as opposed to a separable character which is understandable since he's a comic and he's on a comedy show this eerie feeling is kinda like seeing someone borrow lots of material from david spade's appearances in movies talk shows and functions award shows etc and delivering a superb impersonation of spade's voice and comedy style except that it is spade by that i mean you realize he's not trying to play someone else or a whole new character he's being the goofy funny spade we've come to know and he takes this pleasantly humorous formula to the absolute top every line he uttered every sarcasm he begot all classics literally spade was crazy funny so so funny br br the show's humor and drama were both upped after the show was back but audiences thought john passed it ain't gonna be the same anymore this is understandable considering we are talking about a group of people american viewers who gave 'yes dear' a free ride but caused andy richter controls the universe to be cancelled in no time as the show's quality increased its ratings declined soon it was no more sadly br br and i saved the best for last fans of married with children are in for a treat and boy what a treat it was i still shiver just remembering it it's a surprise so good that it would be crazy for me to spoil it even if i legitimately do it under the spoiler pretext suffice it to say that it's something you'll never forget i know i won't
<START> it's a cooking competition show americanized it's not going to be the japanese version br br the show is great i could care less about cooking but this show is just entertaining to watch from the intensity put into the dishes by the chef to the goofy chairman truly a good way to spend some time watching tv br br you could critique the show for having guests like marc ecko as a judge but meh it's entertaining enough to watch and generally the winner deserves the prize br br oh yeah and i'm bitter john besh isn't the new iron chef br br ala cuisine
<START> i checked this movie out when it still had 6 votes and it said like 7 2 or something but seriously this is a horrible movie lets break it down the first thing you notice about this movie is that it was filmed on a hand held digital camera owned by a freshman at a community college the next thing you'll notice is that the actors are all friends of said freshman he probably met them at the pub the night before third on the list you will notice that the musical editing is horrible and they try to cram many songs into this movie at 30 second intervals also all digital editing is done on said freshman's home pc probably using windows movie maker this movie was horrible pretentious had an undeniably bad script and acting that followed suit i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone i know but i do sentence the writer and director to watch this movie in hell for an eternity
<START> this is a great little film that's very unique and creative with some great plot twists and wonderful performances all the characters are great and the story while bizarre is fascinating and very interesting plus nicole kidman is simply amazing in this it's very hard to describe this movie because it really is quite bizarre it's a comedy romance one minute then it turns into a thriller the next however it was still very entertaining all the same plus nicole's russian accent was fantastic and extremely convincing chaplin and kidman had very good chemistry together and i loved vincent cassel's performance plus some of the plot twists really took me by surprise the ending was very cute and it's unpredictable throughout plus this movie is quite underrated as well you will feel sorry for chaplin and the way that he is scammed and i thought all the characters were really likable plus the finale is especially good this is nicole's movie though and she carries it with her incredibly sexy performance this is a great little film that's very unique and creative with some great plot twists and wonderful performances i highly recommend this one the direction is very good jez butterworth does a very good job here with great camera work solid angles and keeping the film at a fast pace the acting is wonderful nicole kidman is stunningly gorgeous and is amazing as always she is incredibly sexy very likable had one of the coolest accents added a lot of presence had very good chemistry with ben chaplin and had a very mysterious character she was amazing kidman rules ben chaplin is great here he is extremely likable had a cool character had very good chemistry with kidman the only thing i didn't like was him taking out his anger out on kidman even though what she did was wrong and i loved how he got revenge in the end vincent cassel is fantastic as the main villain yes he was ott but he was very intense and quite creepy at times this role was perfect for him mathieu kassovitz is ok here but didn't have much to do rest of the cast are fine overall i highly recommend this one 1 2 out of 5
<START> a friend of mine was in the cast as a feds agent a non speaking part as i recall he brought it over on dvd so i could see it it was interesting but very much felt like an amateur film a well made amateur film though really boring and poorly written it was probably fun to make and be involved in but it definitely didn't deserve any kind of wide release maybe in omaha they'd enjoy it but this california girl was bored and honestly kind of embarrassed for my friend's involvement br br if this film maker has made or makes any more films he really should try to have a really interesting story line and good actors i'm sure this was a great learning tool for them i wish them luck in the future and hope they can improve their film making
<START> it's only 2 episodes into a 5 part drama but i can already state that this is one of the best things i've ever seen that's on tv silver screen or even in real life br br as a writer it's so good it's almost demoralising as a viewer it's so entertaining that i'm annoyed the episodes are over a fortnight instead of monday to friday it's clear that all these negatives are actually positives br br i'm a modern guy who previously turned over from tv dramas in comparison to movies tv dramas always seemed to be dated quite tame and well generally boring five days has really brought tv drama into the 21st century so for me at least it's mind changing go watch it
<START> like too many recent british films this one takes a great cast and gives them a flimsy cliched script to work with the performances save it from total disgrace and it has some charm but it certainly didn't make me laugh where are all the great british writers hiding
<START> i love the movie it brought me back to the best time of my life br br we need that time again now more than ever for me it was a time of freedom learning and finding myself i will always miss it there will never be another time like the 60's unfortunately
<START> for what it is this is a pretty good movie i like both johns stamos full house stockwell christine top gun they both give strong performances the love interest is ok but this is more of a guy's movie than a good date movie i love harleys and i hated seeing them paint over the 14 coats of hand rubbed lacquer with good old army olive drab there is a small history lesson here in that harley davidson motorcycles played a key role in wwii i don't know if the training was quite like this bunches the movie kept my interest all the way through without getting slow anywhere with good riding action sequences i love looking at the demographics of the vote history one 18 year old man gave the movie a 10 true bike lover i guess i wouldn't give it a 10 but i did give it an 8 i do not weigh every movie with the same scale there are movies that were big budget with great actors that you expect to be good so when they fail they fail big star wars episode i is my best example i loved the first three sw movies but i thought episode i was weak in comparison so it gets a lower rating from me than this movie i expect more from george lucas
<START> i can see little girls enjoying this show but calling this a family show is ridiculous i'm amazed how well remembered it is after all these years it's an extremely unfunny and stupid show about widowed father of three living with his dead wife's brother and his stupid friend from school and others as the seasons go on all of the plot lines generally have a really dumb lesson in the middle of each episode somebody is mad at somebody else and each episode they make up and it ends on a light unfunny joke as for the actors i didn't like them either bob saget was painfully unfunny as the dad with the mom responsibilities dave coulier is a one note joke 30 something year old that does cartoon voices and acts like a kid and he's horrid john stamos was the most tolerable character but he was so clichÃ©d it was hard to watch him the oldest girl dj on the show was a genuinely bad actress and showed no emotion ever the middle girl stephanie was too clichÃ©d as the annoying little sister the youngest girl michelle showed what bad actresses the olsen twins were you can always tell when they are switching them off the plot lines to too many story lines were so unrealistically stupid it's cringe worthy this is a family show that tried to replace any good substance with cuteness and love and though those are needed for a show about a family they overdid it way too much this will be remembered as my least favorite sit com from the 80's and 90's br br my rating terrible show tvg 30 mins
<START> every christmas eve i make my kids endure yet another showing of it's a wonderful life i also thoroughly enjoyed bad santa so sue me i admit it i like cheesy schmaltzy movies i like excellent intelligent ones too but as with so many things variety is a good thing what would the christmas season be without the annual cinematic ka ching ka ching of santa in all his guises from edmund gwenn to billy bob thornton fred claus will make no one forget bedford falls but i do not believe a christmas film should have to reach iconic stature to succeed fred is a perfectly ok holiday movie with enough humor for the adults and sufficient charm for the kids my wife and i laughed a lot even if most of the humor was obvious and vince was just being vince paul giamatti was a top notch santa which helped a lot not a great flick and unlikely to become must viewing for anyone's annual christmas traditions but my wife and daughter and i enjoyed it for what it was holiday schmaltz with a small dash of spice there's nothing wrong with that
<START> i've just seen it for those who don't know what it is i suggest to download the entire feature and enjoy viewing it it's kinda amateur made trailer featuring the same producer of the famous short batman dead end but this time besides the black knight there is also superman it would be wonderful if they made the entire movie but i'm afraid that it's almost impossible especially just before the official batman 5 film br br there is no greater crime against peace than the refusal to fight for it br br lorenzo 'purifier'pinto
<START> this last dutch speaking film of verhooven made me laugh good as a film buff looking for all the small details and cross references etc in any movie i can assure anyone interested in film art that this piece amuses all the senses i haven't read gerard reves book on which the film is based but i still believe we get a candid picture of a somewhat self conceited poet writer who gets his in a way no spoiling here an anti hero surrounded by characters that have their ambiguous intentions as has he all this in a superbly packaged cinematography paul verhopven manages to turn the otherwise rather cute gesellich dutch locations into a suspenseful film noir setting impressive work
<START> the film starts to slowly when we got to the cinema we thought it looked quite good but after about 5 mins we were all bored out of our minds and wondering what kind of film we had come to see i don't like this film and wouldn't recommend it to anyone the best part of the night was when the alarm and lights came back on because the project broke down because we thought we could all go home this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen we were all bored out of or minds and most of the people in the cinema actually ran out of the doors at the end because it was so rubbish i am surprised that no one walked out earlier than that if you go and see it make sure you something to keep you busy better still don't go and see it at all
