<START> i didn't mind all the walking people really did walk places back then it loaned an air of authenticity to this period piece and some perspective on the technology of the martians i too was disappointed by the effects in particular the thunderchild scene which i regard as one of the most exciting in the book but i can't praise this film enough for its faithfulness to wells's story it's about time the actors are likable and the performances are charming also this film is very much worth seeing just to hear jamie hall's truly great musical score it was interesting to see the same actor play both the writer and his brother in london
<START> at first i wasn't sure if i wanted to watch this movie when it came up on my guide so i looked it up on imdb and thought the cover looked pretty cool so i thought i would give it a try expecting a movie like elephant br br once i got past the fact that i am supposed to dislike the alicia character played excellently by busy phillips i realized what a good job this movie was doing toward setting up the relationship between alicia and deanna alicia is so mean to deanna played by erika christensen almost throughout the entire movie but we eventually find out that they despite being polar opposites they have one thing in common besides being present at the shooting they share loneliness and to what extent is revealed as the film progresses br br i've just got to say how much i loved this movie and was glad to see all of the positive comments about it i couldn't even get through elephant because it just seemed to be exploiting the columbine tragedy this movie on the other hand was compelling and realistic busy phillips acting is off the chain that is a good thing and i would love to see her progress into some more mature roles
<START> this movie is written by charlie higson who has before this done the legendary fast show and his own show based on one of fast show's characters tony the car sales man he's also written james bond books for kids br br actually i've seen before this only gordon's movies that are based on lovecraft's stories and every one of those is marvelous here gordon tries to do something different the style is totally contemporary which means shaky camera fast and strange cutting cool chillout music in the background it works quite well here i guess but it's still pointless and cheap it makes me often think of the cameraman who's shaking his dv camera in front of the actors actresses and try to make stylish moves in the pictures hoping that something tolerable would come out of it the casting is good and there is a whole atmosphere which is the result of good directing i think the main character the zero young guy is quite interesting in his zeroness the fat guy is also good and the guy who looks like alec baldwin but is not him but pretty soon after the beginning the movie turns out to be something not so interesting in this case i mean an endless line of scenes of sadism and sickness there is not much humanity in this film story it's totally pessimistic and every person in this movie is disgusting and hopeless or soon dead needless to say that there is no humor either it's a 1'40 long vomit without no relief in any moment anyway gordon remains to me one of the most interesting movie makers that are active today and i think of this movie as an experiment and as a failure in that everyone has to experience getting lost sometimes just to learn and to find their way again this might be gordon's most uninteresting and empty work
<START> when i first saw a small scene of it in some announcements i thought the show would be entertaining to watch the little robot guy does look kinda cute the style of animation does look sort of familiar to some classic shows before the show aired i studied it through some sources there i did became slightly dismayed the three children tommy gus and lola are voiced appropriately but robotboy is an exception it would have been a lot nicer if he were to be portrayed by a young lad one good example is robot jones a robot character from whatever happened to robot jones the show isn't bad really but the way robotboy is inappropriately portrayed is my only criticism thus i don't watch it much
<START> i did not expect the performances of gackt and hyde to be as well done as they were nor did i expect them to be cast in such an artistic well developed movie with enough plot to keep you interested and enough diversity to make it original this movie was an unexpected masterpiece for me and i'll be on the lookout for the next movie like it i especially like the fact that it is a vampire movie but it wasn't a cheesy vampire flick nor did it over embellish that fact the characters all had human traits the way it shows the growth of the characters was incredibly tasteful and it makes you actually feel sorry for them throughout their lives i give this movie two thumbs so far up definitely the best movie i have seen in the past five years
<START> if you hate redneck accents you'll hate this movie and to make it worse you see patrick swayze a has been trying to be a redneck i really can't stand redneck accents i like billy bob thornton he was good in slingblade but he was annoying in this movie and what kind of name is lonnie earl how much more hickish can this movie get the storyline was stupid i'm usually not this judgemental of movies but i couldn't stand this movie if you want a good billy bob thornton movie go see slingblade br br my mom found this movie for 5 95 at wal mart figures i think i'll wrap it up and give it to my grandma for christmas it could just be that i can't stand redneck accents usually or that i can't stand patrick swayze maybe if patrick swayze wasn't in it i didn't laugh once in the movie i laugh at anything stupid usually if they had shown someones fingers getting smashed i might have laughed people's fingers getting smashed by accident always makes me laugh
<START> miraculously this is actually quite watchable i mean it's bad it's really bad but whereas the original was so bad it's ruining my life bad this is so bad it's mildly entertaining bad right that's enough faint praise production values are rotten across the board the acting is excruciating and the romero wannabe satire can't make its mind up which side of the ecology fence it's mocking internal logic takes a back seat to heads propelling themselves out of fridges virus incubation times fluctuating as the 'plot' requires bullets working against the zombies or not zombies having the power of speech or not gore is the draw obviously but the framework is so slapdash it's annoying the dialogue sounds like it's been translated by the same computers that mangle instruction manuals and the scale of the zombie infestation is implied with none of the ingenuity of romero's films it's all topped off with a horrendous synth score absolute rubbish
<START> this is a film not porn br br this is a wonderful film full of tender moments and memories a beautiful piece of work excellent for intelligent viewers only br br if you are a film lover a romantic a person who has loved deeply this is your film br br it has a beautiful surreal quality fine acting and directing watching this film made me remember my first love br br thi is a film for those who want to reflect on life love and the meaning of loss br br highly recommended for all film lovers
<START> this movie is so complex that it can be given any description and still roll with it you have a insecure troubled and fascinating main character played by jean pierre lÃ©aud who is trapped between two no three women we listen to his social philosophical and moral idiosyncrasies in interminable monologues we see him working his magic around the three women that he loves this could be the premise for a fowl movie full of rigid cold uninteresting commentaries yet director jean eustache manages to keep it fresh ironic and witty being such a long movie one cannot but burst into laughing when after 2 hours of speaking politely jean pierre lÃ©aud all of a sudden screams on the phone while he remembers a cheesy line from a movie this kind of situations are purely cinematographic and cannot be fully restored in a commentary nor can someone restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue of franÃ§oise lebrun towards the end of the movie 3 and 1 2 hours and worthing every minute
<START> jane eyre is one of the greatest novels in the english language and this screenwriter should of read it i hate it when writers use spark notes for what a novel is all about this movie is unbearable to watch if you have read the book br br the whole 'red room' is so down played that i wonder why they even bother to put it in in the book the 'red room' is foreshadowing for the whole story and the rest of jane's life helen burns is treated so badly in the movie i'm sure she was happy to die and leave early in the book she is one of the most compelling characters and she was not the red head the whole christian theme is missing from her life and the rest of the movie br br do yourself a favor and miss this movie and read the story as charlotte bronte masterfully told it
<START> first i did like this film it was well acted by all br br however i don't understand comments i hear from people about a surprise ending i knew nothing about this movie going in except a few gotta see recommendations but i knew where the plot was going in under ten minutes i won't mention what clued me in so as not to spoil a good film for others still despite it seeming obvious i kept watching it was nice to see how everything played out filling in the details and the character motivations in later scenes br br i don't hate it when i guess the ending early in a film i only hate it when the road to resolution is lined with boring scenery br br will smith's screen persona is just likable even when he's playing such a troubled character he's energetic and believable in everything that i've seen him do seven pounds is another fine performance br br rosario dawson is a solid performer portraying a quirky rather upbeat character despite a terminal heart condition beauty is in the eye of the beholder and with rosario if you don't find her gorgeous you should think about replacing your eyes br br it was nice to see woody harrelson back on the screen i haven't seen him much lately but that could just be me woody didn't have a tremendous amount of screen time but he sold his jolly piano playing blind man character for all it was worth excellent br br a cursory bit of research on the box jellyfish tells me that its venom is cardiotoxic neurotoxic and dermatonecrotic i would think this makes it a questionable choice for both pet and plot br br overall i have to recommend this film not for the plotting but for some very good performances and for the fact that it tends to evoke some of the tragic emotions that we generally try to avoid
<START> i went into this expecting not to like it i figured it would be terribly worthy and earnest and rather plodding and dull br br it's actually far better than that and i found myself really enjoying it i don't know too much about queen victoria beyond what most know married to albert who died young and she mourned him ever after seeing the circumstances she grew up under was fascinating in fact i found myself wishing i'd seen more of the story and i imagine we may see a sequel at some point br br visually the film is stunning the sets and costumes are incredibly lavish without being too gaudy and over the top the acting is top notch from everybody involved br br in a word it was great
<START> the lead characters in this movie fall into two categories smart and stupid simple enough br br jiri machacek standa plays a hapless dopey guy who gets arrested for a crime he did not commit when he tries to get financially reimbursed by his evil former boss the situation gets out of control br br while standa is genuinely but endearingly stupid his buddy ondrej is an absolute blithering idiot who bungles everything and manages to say and do the wrong thing every time without ondrej standa might stand a chance of going through life with some modest degree of success with ondrej life will never be boring but it sure won't be without a lot of headaches br br ivan trojan plays zdenek an evil genius type who degenerates into some hitler esquire delusional tyrant zdenek and his henchmen try to kill standa to keep zdenek's secrets safe br br i am very impressed with the high quality and imagination of czech films for a relatively small country the czech republic certainly has produced more than its share of superb entertainment the best czech movies i have seen are 1 peliÂky and 2 tmavomodrÃ½ svet dark blue world if you see these two movies you have seen the absolute best of czech cinema
<START> i saw this film at the santa barbara film festival and there was not a dry eye in the house it is incredible to see not only what a great person darius is but how admirable the rest of the team is too and at such a young age br br it also made me think how disgusting mtv was and how on being given an opportunity to involve and inspire in a positive way they declined shows you whether they really care about the youth and their viewers at all br br it's a wonderful and heart warming true story take your tissues but it's great to see how caring and inspiring youth of today can be
<START> glacier fox is one of the most heartrending and wonderfully photographed wildlife films ever made br br the film makes you care about each member of this fox family from the blind cub to the strongest their adventures are at times hilarious and also tragic set against an inhospitable countryside the audience's hearts warm to the family members br br the music score and lyrics tell the story intercut with narration about what is happening in general terms br br man remains one of the biggest predators but we are left in no doubt that the foxes are capable of living not just surviving beyond human endeavours
<START> maggie smith and peter ustinov as a very unlikely couple in a very not likable film at all br br the film shows promise for ustinov is released from prison for embezzling he convinces robert morley to go away so that he can assume his identity and begin hacking away at computers at a very fancy firm run by karl malden and bob newhart another unusual duo for films br br morley sounds just as he did in 1938's marie antoinette perhaps he needed to return to that genre br br this film is ridiculous at best hard to believe that the following year maggie smith totally changed her ways and gave a shattering oscar performance in the prime of miss jean brodie br br ms smith is made out here to be an apparent dumb red head but by film's end she is the brains of the outfit too bad the writing didn't go the way with her
<START> i spotted in the guide to films list for the santa barbara film festival where i went when i was in hollywood that this film was in screening basically there is an election for the new chairman of the hong kong triads wo sing society coming up so you can imagine how much violence that is going to occur during this the struggle is between candidates lam lok simon yam and big d tony leung ka fai for control of the oldest and most powerful triad parts of the society also starring louis koo as jimmy lee nick cheung as jet cheung siu fai as mr so lam suet as big head and lam ka tung as kun there are some good realistic corruption themes and moments just about enough action apart from maybe when the cops get involved but a sequel followed so it's a pretty worthwhile crime drama thriller very good
<START> the 1980s tv show updated with fresh female flesh and raunchy language the dukes of hazzard passed me by it was not repeated whenever i was in front of the television in either new york or california or i probably would have watched still from somewhere like the clips accompanying this film's updated 2005 release i knew it was about a fast orange dodge charger and the general lee is still good to go br br hunky cousins seann william scott and johnny knoxville as bo and luke duke are the new riders of the orange sage beautiful jessica simpson as daisy fills her skimpy short well but even her arousing pink bikini can't beat off the competition from a dormitory full of bouncing topless coeds the too stupid plot involves a graying burt reynolds as boss hogg threatening to turn hazzard county into a strip mine br br the dukes of hazzard 7 27 05 jay chandrasekhar seann william scott johnny knoxville jessica simpson burt reynolds
<START> when i was in school i made a film about a couple roaming around in the trees and talking and i realized halfway through editing that this was not just a failing aesthetic strategy but a clichÃ© of canadian cinema sodden lyricism married to vacant metaphor burdened stabs at social commentary but whatever my own film's failings i feel much better after seeing this this thing for one thing mine ran 20 minutes not 85 and had more content at that every pointless bit of business here is fawned over for four five six relentless minutes the male lead is just incredible a brow beating loudmouthed creep given to outbursts of drama class improv in between philosophical insights culled from the u of t pub and he is given lots and lots of space to make us hate him admittedly if he weren't such an a hole then the third act would make even less sense as a couple snarky dudes show up to provide distant and thoroughly unhelpful echoes of 'exploitation' values but it doesn't make it any easier to watch the caged creep whimper please in closeup until the magazine runs out i take back what i said about autumn born which at least had the courage of its own misbegotten lechery this cinematic crater is and will remain the very worst canadian movie of all time at least i really really hope so
<START> i'm basing this on my observations of one episode i saw last night 9 27 06 i don't think i'll be watching again the acting was totally wooden the plot completely predictable the ending totally unrealistic i mean who would believe a 30 million dollar judgment for the death of a recovering drug addict with terminal cancer the lead actor victor garber seemed so uncomfortable almost embarrassed in his role perhaps he realized how bad the writing was i fully realize that the drama offered this season is pretty poor but they can surely find better writers maybe they are outsourcing the writing to india or china i'll bet we won't be seeing this one next season
