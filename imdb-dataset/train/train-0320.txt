<START> i've been watching dick tracy for years and as a result it's become a vital part of my life it was with me throughout childhood and i used to see it quite often seeing it now as an adult it's still a very good movie dark satiric and incredibly misunderstood about the only thing that can be said is the oscar nomination pacino received other than that it is rarely discussed and didn't make much of a fuss when it came out br br pacino is over the top but to good effect as he's clearly having loads of fun beatty is great as dick tracy and behind the camera manages to capture the atmosphere of a film noir comic book better than any other film possibly i have ever seen just taking a look at one scene from the film is breathtaking the lighting velvet overtones and smog smoke combine to create a great effect br br there are some really funny cameos including one by dustin hoffman as mumbles and i don't think there are any flaws at all in terms of acting even the mandatory kid character is far better than expected br br overall a really fine movie that has become misunderstood over the years since its release and is incredibly underrated with only 5 7 10 average on imdb the critics' reviews are very positive check out rottentomatoes com and after seeing the film once again it's not hard to see why this is a perfect example of capturing the essence of a comic book from style to eccentricity br br highly recommended 4 5 5 stars
<START> a woman mujar marta belengur enters a restaurant one morning at 35 unaware that a terrorist has kidnapped the people in said restaurant is making them act out a musical number in this strange yet fascinating short film which i only saw by finding it on the dvd of the director writer's equally fascinating timecrimes it had a fairly catchy song it somehow brought a smile to my face despite the somber overall plot to the short i'm glad that i stumbled across it wasn't aware it would be an extra when i rented the dvd and wouldn't hesitate at all to recommend it to all of my friends br br my grade a
<START> bedknobs broomsticks is another one of disney's masterpieces it was filmed with sequences of animation and the actors and actresses interacting with the animations a similar concept was used in mary poppins when the children and mary disappear into the sidewalk art i am mainly rating this film through child's eyes because i have not seen it in years back then it was one of my favourite films it was magical and mystical and the last scenes the conflict beginning with the ghostly armour walking into battle were my favourites there was also a lot of stop animation used with the spells ie people turning into rabbits which may be a little dated and silly now also i believe that the film starts off slowly through the eyes of a child this is a fun film and it is easy for children to put themselves into the places of the children in the film it is an imaginative film which is sadly largely forgotten today
<START> whenever i hear a movie being touted because it has no sex violence bad language special effects and so on my b s detector goes off usually a movie like that is sentimental hogwash which panders to people who don't want anything to surprise them but to affirm how superior they are to us craven folk so when david lynch's the straight story began getting those kinds of reviews i was apprehensive especially since i was not a fan of his other uplifting story the elephant man for all the stunning images and the good acting in that film it seemed more interested in preaching to us than inspiring us br br i needn't have worried the straight story is an honest movie rather than a saccharine one most of that is due to the fact that lynch and writers john roach and mary sweeney tell it straight and simple for the most part there are a couple of homilies by straight i could have done without and the shots of grain being harvested are repeated a little too much but those are only quibbles there's no heavy handed message no sentimental strings to jerk our emotions and no condescension towards us and its characters instead they depend on the story to build its own power and it does so by the final scene we are genuinely moved br br of course casting richard farnsworth adds realism to the part he really is someone who looks like he's lived through a lot but still perseveres and except for those homilies the desire he has to get back together with his brother doesn't seem overly sentimental because you can sense here is someone who's lived too long and seen too much to be driven by anger for long and he knows his time is running out so he wants to make some peace not only with his brother but with his life sissy spacek also does fine unmannered work as straight's daughter and although i am a city and suburban boy the iowa and wisconsin landscape are beautifully shot making me want at least to visit some day
<START> i noticed with some amusement that in the end credits the detroit pd is thanked for their participation the chief of police even has one speaking line playing himself and boy can you tell he can't act the reason for the amusement is that in this movie the police shoot first and ask questions later not the kind of pr i would think a police force would want other than that this is your standard cops and robbers film dressed up for the '70's with a racial angle alex rocco is given a thankless role of a lifer cop that can't get ahead and is saddled with a mentally ill wife he makes up for this by hanging out at the local whorehouse hari rhodes is his dashing partner that has a groovy wardrobe and likes to chase after suspects while wearing a trenchcoat the movie moves along until the penultimate shootout that makes absolutely no sense why do people that are only guilty of a robbery take on a whole police force not only do we see one shootout but since there are four bad guys we get to see four then there is a twist ending that is supposed to leave one guessing what really would have happened but only left me thinking how stupid it was seeing that director arthur marks was also behind the braindead friday foster and bucktown i shouldn't have wondered
<START> i saw this movie in 1969 when it was first released at the cameo theater on south beach now the famous crowbar night club it was the last year of the wild 60s and this movie really hit home it's got everything the generation gap the sexual revolution the quest for success and the conflict between following one's family traditions to those of seeking ones own way through life br br it was a fast paced highly enjoyable movie vegas was at it's hippiest peak sin city in all it's glory beautiful women famous cameos laughs conflict romance and even a happy ending a very enjoyable time over all br br the poster from this film rests on my bedroom wall i look at it and i go back in time a time of my youth and my times with my dad a great time in my life
<START> i've always liked this john frankenheimer film good script by elmore leonard and the main reason this wasn't just another thriller is because of frankenheimer his taut direction and attention to little details make all the difference he even hired porn star ron jeremy as a consultant you can make a case that its the last good film roy scheider made i've always said that robert trebor gave just a terrific performance clarence williams iii got all the publicity with his scary performance and he's excellent also but i really thought trebor stood out frankenheimer may not be as proud of this film as others but it is an effective thriller full of blackmail murder sex drugs and real porno actors appear in sleazy parts what can you say about a film that has ann margaret being shot up with drugs and raped a guilty pleasure to say the least vanity has a real sleazy role and a very young kelly preston makes an early appearance a classic exploitive thriller that shouldn't be forgotten
<START> i saw this film on true movies which automatically made me sceptical but actually it was good why not because of the amazing plot twists or breathtaking dialogue of which there is little but because actually despite what people say i thought the film was accurate in it's depiction of teenagers dealing with pregnancy br br it's not dawson's creek they're not graceful cool witty characters who breeze through sexuality with effortless knowledge they're kids and they act like kids would br br they're blunt awkward and annoyingly confused about everything yes this could be by accident and they could just be bad actors but i don't think so dermot mulroney gives when not trying to be cool a very believable performance and i loved him for it patricia arquette is whiny and annoying but she was pregnant and a teenagers the combination of the two isn't exactly lavender on your pillow the plot was very predictable and but so what i believed them his stress and inability to cope her brave yet slightly misguided attempts to bring them closer together i think the characters acted by anyone else would indeed have been annoying and unbelievable but they weren't it reflects the surreality of the situation they're in that he's sitting in class and she walks on campus with the baby i felt angry at her for that i felt angry at him for being such a child and for blaming her i felt it all br br in the end i loved it and would recommend it br br watch out for the scene where dermot mulroney runs from the disastrous counselling session career performance
<START> very bad very very bad as a fellow who aspires to make be in or at least sniff the catering table at a movie set i find it hard to criticize independents who actually got a movie of any sort made however this movie oh dear br br realizing frightworld doesn't aspire to anything more than crude exploitation an honorable thing in itself and to try to make it conform to more mainstream standards is a mistake and to be fair it is more entertaining than say red zone cuba but not by much so i won't try to critique just let me ask throw out some observations br br 1 if gore is the point of the movie shouldn't you be able to see it br br 2 if you have hire three sound men make sure at least one knows how to operate the equipment br br 3 in a horror movie your lead maniac must be scarier than a smurf doll difficult i know but really br br 4 there is a lot of talented videographers in the buffalo rochester area most you can hire really cheap get one who knows how to frame a scene br br 5 just because you have someone who knows how to use after effects and other cool programs doesn't mean he should do so every two seconds br br 6 kudos for getting the girls to take off their tops but next time get girls who's tops we want to see taken off br br 7 editing should help tell the story or set a mood at the least in this sort of movie editing should sell the gore gags a chainsaw suddenly appearing in a characters stomach is not scary it's sloppy br br some good things not all the acting was bad jack was pretty good and i liked acid once she started fighting back there was some neat imagery unfortunately it was thrown up on the screen without rhyme or reason acid poptart is a name that deserves a better movie i like the moxie of frightworld too next time now that they have a movie of sorts under their belts i hope all involve aspire to something better than colman francis upgrade at least ed wood
<START> i saw this film tonight in nyc at the landmark sunshine i didn't know what to expect i'd not read much about it as i knew i would see it no matter what all in all it is very well done it doesn't focus on the generalization of anti war statements which to me left the politics out of it the soldiers mainly spoke of their awareness of toxicity in their training in boot camp and how hard it was once they returned to civilian life it was really good to see paul rieckhoff and camilo mejia tell about the difficulty in surviving not only the war but refusing the command to go back when it was against personal morals make no mistake this is not an anti war film anyone who says it is hasn't seen it or is not living with the scars of war on their souls
<START> there was not one original idea in this story themes were pulled from various sources a few being the ninth gate in the mouth of madness another carpenter film and the ring it even went as far as featuring the same damn glowing circle from the ring and using it as the film's namesake the soundtrack by cody carpenter was all but lifted from suspiria hopefully no one will oppose this comment by spewing the word homage around yes i saw that the theater was playing argento's deep red claiming an homage would be a bullshit cop out this was bottom of the barrel throwing gore and disturbing imagery into the pot does not make a good horror film carpenter used to know that he should fade into obscurity or acquire a time machine
<START> ok as far as the 2 versions of this movie there were 2 people involved in the making john korty and bill couterie george was just the producer he really didn't have any kind of say so in the film just helped with money the 'adult' version was made possible by bill couterie john korty didn't like or approve this version as it was done behind his back thanks to ladd films going under they didn't advertise this movie and threw all their advertising cash for the right stuff hoping it would pull them through and it didn't so this movie never really had a chance when twice made it to cable hbo they showed the reels with bill's version and john threatened to sue if it was shown anymore did you notice how the 'adult' version wasn't on for very long showtime got the 'clean' version the version on the videotape and laser disc is the version approved by john who holds more power than bill it's a pity really as the 'adult' version is actually better and does make more sense but it's very doubtful that it will ever be released in that version onto dvd or any other format short of bootleg sorry to disappoint everyone i know all this info as i used to be the president of the twice upon a time fan club still have numerous items from the movie used to own a letter boxed version of the 'adult' version but it was stolen only have a partial hbo copy of it now 8 stars to the 'adult' version 5 to the 'clean' version any other questions just ask
<START> we see a body of dead girl in a morgue with the coroner trying to close the eyes of the girl but whatever he tries they won't stay open after this we move into the future and we follow a group of former school friends who hide a terrible secret but suddenly they start getting picked off one by one in many grisly ways through flashbacks we learn of this awful suicide of a shy girl who was trying to be one of the group but she was shut out by them because they dug up her past and found out some weird occurrences so is she back from the grave seeking revenge br br oh what a great and always spooky story well that's what i hoping i could say and 'hoping' was as good as it got this is an forgettable so so supernatural horror flick that i actually watched before but i went in thinking it was my first viewing so to my surprise it hit me when i started picking up on certain things but like i said it's quite a forgettable mix that it felt like a first viewing again nightmare' is just another type of it's field that adds a 'few' changes to the gruel oh please give me something that's a bit more fresh it doesn't have to be entirely original but this is one formulaic and at times quite tired j horror flick even though it strings along the usual ghost story involving you guessed rightÂ an evil looking vengeful chick spirit br br but in spite of my negativity of it being the same old same old story and jolts this one kind of entertains when its being grisly and popping in some creepy visuals the deaths are vividly displayed with bite and some originality while the gloomy atmosphere alienates the audience with it's murky lighting the first scene involving the spirit terrorising one of the girls is one blood curdling experience but really when it's not trying to shock you i found it rather coma inducing and i thought about getting some shut eye that might be harsh but it just didn't go anywhere of any interest between those shock moments you could say that because the supposed mystery is really not much of one the unsure story is just simply flat and the characters are a self centred bunch that you don't really care what happens to them the disjointed story should have focused more on the spirit than that of these bland characters who have one unconvincing group relationship it just overplayed its cards by becoming overly muddled and taking too long to get going that when it comes to the climax it's just plain ludicrous the film's haunting ending is a high point though br br the film looks fine although it could have done without the snazzy quick fire editing and the music score was a bit overbearing in playing up the mood the performances tread a fine line but gyu ri kim is strong in the lead role br br it's nothing new and it shamelessly steals ideas but if you can look past that it delivers some nasty thrills although i found the handling of it rather lethargic despite the odd effective chills a standard effort all round i guess but still it's equally missable
<START> warning spoilers ahead br br this short is part one of two that expound upon the brief portion of the matrix in which morpheus explains how the matrix came to be because we already know the story the plot itself is no surprise and the short isn't so much entertaining as informative but that's how it is presented as a file in the historical archives the visuals are better than average and the generally cold colors aid the purpose of the short br br a couple problems the violence of the tale is a little gratuitous and combined with the occasional dose of political correctness un scenes detracts from the straight narrative of the short plus it needs to be seen with part two to be complete br br the animatrix concept is brilliant and despite a few issues this short still fulfills its purpose it would not have fit in the original movie in style content or flow this is the perfect method to reveal the history br br bottom line good information could have been told a little better but still a solid 7 of 10
<START> julia roberts obviously makes a concerted effort to shake off her cotton wool pretty woman persona with this spurious spousal abuse thriller but it's hard to imagine she'd end up putting in a performance as powerful and convincing and oscar winning as she did in erin brokovich based on the back of this rubbish and make no bones about it it's nothing more than a julia roberts vehicle but unfortunately her performance is not the most lacklustre thing about it br br the plot has all the markings of a late night made for cable and don't be under the impression that it will offer any insight into the dark world of domestic abuse because non of the characters are sketched out enough for you to really care br br ultimately disappointing and unsatisfying without roberts' name above the title i'm sure it would have totally flopped deservedly
<START> this review is mostly all spoilers if you plan on enjoying this film don't read this review br br that's the problem with kids tv nowadays it's all so patronizing and condescending wow that was fun wasn't it ' no it wasn't and unfortunately it seems to have permeated into children films as well and that is what 'flight of the reindeer' is all about admittedly i haven't seen 'flight of the reindeer' in a few years so i might be hazy on some points but i remember being thoroughly unimpressed with it at the time br br essentially the story follows a lecturer who is given a book for christmas now the lecturer is an esteemed scientist on the flying habits of some animal i think it was bullfrogs anyway through this book mr lecturer family man learns that reindeer can fly in exactly the same way as bullfrogs apparently this book was written by a scientist many hundreds of years ago who disappeared in the north pole now if it were me i would have thrown the book out the nearest window flying bullfrogs are a naturally occurring phenomenon but flying reindeer is a fantastic and wholly unrealistic concept but mr lecturer isn't me so i guess that explains why he decides to fly to the north pole leaving his wife and kid at home with no idea where he's gone of course things go awry and before he knows it a flying reindeer has crashed into his private plane and he's stranded at the north pole br br are you still following this good br br his family of course are devastated i would be too i mean what a suck tacular christmas elsewhere mr lecturer finds himself in a hidden town at the north pole inhabited by midgets and one tyrannical figure who dresses only in red and white rather than try to escape immediately as i would have done he greets everyone there with open arms this hidden civilization of midget monsters and he greets them with open arms oooo kayyyy they feed him this story that they are the elves of santa claus and they spend all year round making toys for kids they have no idea exist and mr lecturer accepts all this he even accepts that santa claus is in fact the scientist who disappeared two hundred years ago or whatever there's just one problem they don't want him to leave the world can't know of their secret existence after all before they'd know it there'd be a mcdonalds and a starbucks on every street corner br br still with me br br now mr nice guy's family find the book and assume he's gone to the north pole boy wouldn't they be embarrassed if they found out he'd just gone for a brisk walk before the audience knows it they're jetting off to spend a christmas in the most authentic winter wonderland on the planet meanwhile mr lecturer gets sick of all the uppity midgets and decides to leave i can't remember exactly but i do recall him holding santa claus to gunpoint a fire fight ensues when the midgets attack and he manages to escape via santa's sleigh with santa hot on his heels and with bloodlust in his eyes mr whatever through some marvellous co incidence finds himself flying alongside his family's plane that is looking for him so he jumps on to their plane the planes flies back and everyone lives happily ever after br br the fact is there have been some shocking films made in the name of christmas over the years but because they feature that festive charm they get away with it and it's that charm that is utterly devoid from 'flight of the reindeer' there isn't much wrong with it nothing which insults the intelligence well obviously there is but it's a kids film and thus can get away with such things or anything particularly offensive but the problem is there is nothing much right about it either it just doesn't feel christmassy and for a film that is all about christmas that it a pretty major flaw but hey i don't think 'flight of the reindeer's target audience mind about that why should they they're all so doped up on sedatives they probably couldn't spell christmas' br br i give it three out of ten if it was a tv movie then i'd add another two stars onto it we all know how bad they can get
<START> shannon lee the daughter of bruce lee delivers high kicking martial arts action in spades in this exhilarating hong kong movie and proves that like her late brother brandon she is a real chip off the old block there is high tech stuntwork to die for in this fast paced flick and the makers of the bond movies should give it a look if they want to spice up the action quotient of the next 007 adventure as there is much innovative stuff here with some fresh and original second unit work to bolster up the already high action content of and now you're dead when you watch a movie as fast paced and entertaining as this you begin to wonder how cinema itself was able to survive before the martial arts genre was created i genuinely believe that movies in general and action movies in particular were just marking time until the first kung fu movies made their debut bruce lee was the father of modern action cinema and his legitimate surviving offspring shannon does not let the family name down here although there are several pleasing performances in this movie michel wong for one it is shannon lee whom you will remember for a genuinely spectacular performance as mandy the hitgirl supreme hell you may well come away whistling her fights
<START> basically a typical propaganda film for the last good war but there were a couple things that struck me first was the use of mouthed epithets in two cases the scott character mouths one once at the beginning when he drops his bomb off target during the bomb off dammit and once when he is trying to sway a bombardier into being a pilot s t i could be wrong about the second instance but i replayed it several times and that's what it looks like to me the third case is when the anne shirley character wishes the o'brien character goodbye and good luck give 'em hell over the roar of the engines she must have thought that was too unladylike because she clearly says heck i also found interesting the character that has moral problems with bombing specifically bombing civilians the avuncular superior officer assures him that only military targets will be hit due to the precision of the bombsight used given what we know about the lemay's later strategy of firebombing japanese cities into oblivion this scene plays with not a little irony i remember mcnamara's quoting of lemay in the fog of war something to the effect that if the us did not win the conflict he would be tried as a war criminal the ending is way overwrought in keeping with the movie it reminded me a bit of the end of white heat i'm not comparing the films just the ending maybe it's just 'cause he gets blowed up blowed up real good
<START> domini enfilren marlene dietrich has spent most of her life caring for her father now that he has died she is free but doesn't know what she wants boris androvsky charles boyer is a monk who has fled a monastery to taste more of life they meet accidentally in algiers fall in love and get married but he can't leave his past behind and she can't live without him br br way overdone romance full of hysterically bad dialogue and situations dietrich and boyer do their best to give good performances but nobody could get away with some of their lines still in a way it is a classic it's shot in gorgeous technicolor try to see it on dvd where every frame is breath takingly beautiful dietrich is always dressed to the 9s even in the middle of the desert and strikes hysterical poses to show off the clothes and her body boyer just walks around looking stricken no shock there still i was never bored it was wonderful to look at and the non stop stupid dialogue kept me in stitches the end almost had me falling out of my chair because i was laughing so hard now i love corny romances and give them plenty of space but really this is unbelievable it also runs a very short 80 minutes br br as a camp classic i give this an 8 as a serious movie a 1
<START> orca starts as crusty irish sea captain nolan richard harris his crew are trying to capture a great white shark so they can sell it for big bucks unfortunately when a hapless marine biologist called ken robert carradine comes under attack from it the shark is killed by a killer whale this raises nolan's interest in killer whales decides he want's to catch one of them instead however while trying to do so he catches a pregnant female injuries it to the extent she aborts her unborn foetus on deck which makes a mess enrages her mate nolan orders the whale be dumped back in the sea which is what happens the male killer whale is annoyed to say the least kills one of nolan's crew before they reach the dry land of newfoundland in canada once there the killer whale conducts a series of attacks on the town it's people in an effort to lure nolan back out to sea for a fight to the death br br directed by michael anderson i thought this blatant rip off was terrible i'm sorry but i thought it was just plain ridiculous utterly dull even at a modest 90 odd minutes the script by producer luciano vincenzoni sergio donati is so stupid i'm lost for words the fact that it seems to take itself very seriously doesn't help if i have to listen to charlotte rampling go on about how intelligent killer whale's are just one more time i'll scream i'm sorry but i simply don't believe a killer whale is intelligent enough to know who any particular boat belongs to sink it i don't believe a killer whale can cause a huge explosion including knocking an oil lantern from a wall on the opposite side it hits as there is no way on earth it could know it was there i don't believe a killer whale can identify someone's house know someone is in there then wreck it on purpose i don't believe a killer whale can move icebergs around in order to trap a boat i don't believe killer whales can physically recognise people i don't believe it has any revenge instincts or at least none that are as strong as this dumb film makes out maybe i'm being a bit harsh i mean it's only a film after all but it's a film which is trying to be serious things just got so ridiculous that i was half expecting the killer whale to write a letter to nolan to tell him his plan hand or should that be fin deliver it the thing seemed intelligent enough to do just about anything else they should have asked it to come up with a cure for the common cold seriously that's a statement that's no more far fetched than anything else in this film i found the film very boring totally dull had awful character's with no on screen presence at all it goes without saying this is a jaws 1975 rip off which doesn't even come close to spielberg's classic br br director anderson is no spielberg that's for sure this rubbishy film has absolutely no suspense scares tension or atmosphere at all all the attack scenes are as dull as dishwater totally forgettable there's no build up to them virtually no pay off either as orca doesn't get to eat a single person then there's the scenes which literally had me laughing the shots of the killer whale appearing to cry are pure comedy the opening scenes of the two killer whales i suspect tried to show them as a 'loving' 'caring' couple but i couldn't help but think that this is the closest we'll ever get to killer whale porn hilarious stuff the footage of the killer whales themselves is bland boring instead of footage which matches enhances the scenes around it it just looks like dreary wildlife documentary footage that has little connection to anything else do you get the impression that i don't like this film good forget about any gore or decent deaths either there's a brief scene when bo derek has her legs bitten off but blink and you'll miss it br br this probably had quite a big budget it still sucks there's nothing outstanding about orca it's well made i suppose but flat bland totally forgettable the cinematography is quite nice though the acting is bad rampling is awful the late harris' irish accent is embarrassing br br orca is a lame jaws rip off which completely ignores or messes up everything that made spielberg's film so good this is one for bad movie lovers everywhere definitely not recommended although not quite as bad as jaws the revenge 1987
