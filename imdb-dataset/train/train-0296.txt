<START> i went to see this movie simply to see what all the hype is about and i was as disappointed as surprised about how it got 6 oscars and 7 9 rating on imdb as of today br br kathryn bigelow should be the luckiest director ever to win the best picture and best direction oscar for this sort of a really really bad movie and i wonder why did the totally unrealistic 'cowboy' bomb disposal man storyline mean anything to somebody that i failed see why did i keep getting the mental image that this movie was a remake of some old bad western movie about a cowboy doing 'brave deeds' in the wild wild west infected with 'evil' red indians but just that it was set in a different background this time was it given the oscars because the director being ex of james cameron and made it a nice underdog gossipy story for day time tv shows to munch on or was it some sort of emperor's clothes syndrome where most people realized it was junk but just couldn't say so because others didn't seem to be saying it out aloud br br and finally what was with that sniper scene where they showed the shell casing dropping in high resolution super slow mo as if to convey a 'deep message' or something something in the lines of 'eod guys make good snipers all of a sudden and they will get the filthy terrorists all the time' was it just me who felt like there were so many bits and pieces here and there in the movie squeezed in for no apparent reason and you can get the oscars for editing and directing for that br br if you haven't seen this yet don't waste your money on tickets wait till they run it on tv in a few years you are not going to miss much
<START> here we have a movie which fails in pretty much every way it is possible for a movie to fail terrible script lousy acting amateurish directing laughable special effects it's just an utterly awful movie not to mention the fact that when you get to the end you'll realize the whole thing doesn't make a lick of sense after spending the whole movie wondering what in the world is going on here when things are finally explained you realize the story has been built on a foundation which is ludicrously impossible in one of those hideous villain explains the whole movie sequences we are told that our villain has done something which quite simply can't be done and which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever oh and after that we see that there also appears to be some kind of jell o monster involved i'm sure drew barrymore would very much like to pretend this movie never happened if for some ungodly reason you are ever tempted to sit down and watch this movie may i suggest instead taking that time to bang your head against a wall for 104 minutes that would prove to be a much more pleasurable experience than sitting through this garbage
<START> william powell is philo vance in the kennel murder case a 1933 film also starring mary astor paul cavanagh eugene palette helen vinson and ralph morgan a dog show in which philo has entered his scottish terrier captain serves as the background for a locked room mystery with too many suspects the mystery is very clever and the denouement both complicated and interesting since the talkies are still quite young the camera work is a little static but michael curtiz does a good job directing the action br br the supporting cast is excellent the entire cast brings the film up a notch lots of actors have played philo vance including paul lukas basil rathbone wilford hyde white edmund lowe james stephenson alan curtis warren william and others powell played it the most five times and is the best fit for the role very relaxed but serious at the same time this was made before the thin man catapulted him to big stardom he had spent about 12 years in film by then beginning his career on stage in 1912 at the age of 20 a remarkable man a remarkable screen presence and a remarkable actor who lived to be nearly 92 we're so lucky to have his films available on dvd and on tcm today the kennel murder case is a great story and a fun film don't miss it
<START> in the seemingly endless quest to find well made well acted horror films it is all too rare to find one that even comes remotely close to hitting the mark needless to say i was very pleasantly surprised when i stumbled across burned at the stake on a u s cable network while i was flipping channels the premise is reasonably simple in 1692 young ann putnam swift is the most vocal witness against alleged witches leveling baseless charges against anyone who earns her displeasure manipulating her for his own ends is reverend parris peters who also serves as the court's guide on matters pertaining to witchcraft and satanism things get complicated when ann starts accusing members of the goode family of witchcraft salem of 1980 or so loreen graham also played by swift begins having unusual visions shortly before she visits the salem witch museum a strange man in seventeenth century garb tries to accost her there and the building he continues to stalk her while strange phenomena begin to involve her more and more soon it appears that she is becoming possessed by the spirit of ann putnam unfortunately further description gets rather involved and would give too much away though the film is not action oriented and would likely be of little interest to many viewers the performances are good and the seventeenth century dialogue used in the film's many flashbacks sounds very convincing the production values are solid with the possible exception of some of the special effects in a side note the film's technical advisor was laurie cabot salem's official witch viewers who appreciate a well made atmospheric but understated horror film may appreciate this the writer director bert i gordon has had a long career in horror and science fiction filmmaking and is best known for his work on a number of big bug films and similar works years earlier
<START> this ranks way up there on my top list of worst movies i've seen so far on starz on demand they seem to pick up every straight to dvd crap fest they can find and put it on here br br why who knows apparently anyone with a digital camera and a shoestring budget can come up with a horror movie and get it put on tv to be honest this looked terrible from the moment i saw the trailer but i did give it a real chance br br i always try to have an open mind about low budget movies some of the best movies i've ever seen were films that worked around their low budget or in other cases only required that low budget to be great br br this is not one of those movies br br you know the plot by now i'm sure if you're reading this either you heard about it on starz on demand or for whatever reason you ended up on this page out of boredom it's about a pathetic and whiny girl we get to know for all of 3 minutes in an incredibly bad heavy metal music video whoever put it together must have thought it looked really interesting but it really really doesn't anyway she kills herself then she possesses someone then some killing starts it's really unmemorable and as completely average and boring as possible when the first gunshot goes off in her apartment it quite seriously sounds like a piece of popcorn popping was that the best sound effect they could come up with i could find a better sound effect to use for free with no copyright on the internet right now br br don't let the other reviews claiming this is a 10 star movie fool you they are obviously either distributors of the film or maybe even the director trying to con you into thinking this piece of junk is worth buying br br laughable
<START> i did not know for some time in my youth all that could in general be known about this film however the ways of making a film was not what in fact drew my attention what made this motion picture one the most liked films even to this very day that i have ever seen was of the heroism bravery and the honor to have served in her majestys service this film is not always what it seems and that is perhaps as it should be however i cant say enough for the courage exhibited by sgt cutter in defense of the uniform that he too would of sacrificed his life to save from peril of the sort that they and the troop were threatened with the emergence of this thugee group br br to be certain sgt cutter is the kind of individual you might suggest something about and then you watch this unequivocal belief not only in each other but in her majesty the queen of england i think for all of his lust for money and the such that that character was great a reckless brave courageous soldier who did not know fear i think grant was excellent in this role truly a very capable rendering made compelling by the uniform that he wore i never felt ballantine was a shoe in in fact there was so much confidence in there assumptions that you might be well not to look to close because it is still only a picture what do i mean this picture is still only a motion picture and like the times in which these events take place as well as when the picture was actually made provide a look at how things were done then and what or why there are so many different opinions as to this motion picture will distract your attention both ballantine and machesney are equal in there dedication with both men from time to time providing a unflinching daring as to there jobs as men in the service of her majesty these three seem to bring things off rather well and i believe it is a useful even enjoyable interlude when ballantine has a date with destiny or so it would seem only to have fate as you would have it intervene is it believable i don't know i think it is very fitting when the company having escaped the clutches of death in tantrapur and they are dragging there tails as they are approaching the main gates to the regiments post when ballantine allows the other two to know that he is leaving the service and getting married and going into the tea business machesney says he could sign up for another 9 years it will make a man out of him i like that sentiment br br i don't think there is any doubt as to just what it means to have brave dependable courageous soldiers representing your very best interests where does this end in fact it may never end those interests are so well placed as to what is important in this world that i enjoy this picture today as much as perhaps i enjoyed the picture when i was ten years old i had never known about the truthfulness of this film up to recently when i went into history and found the information about kali there is quite a good deal to learn however once all is said and done about the historical significance of the goddess of kali this motion picture takes on a quality that i refer to as intelligence this is a very honest attempt to convey a belief in what is being attempted i think this is an excellent film george stevens directed br br there is a few items to be aware of i don't think all the information will jive with history however when the journalist is addressed as mr kipling things can get very emotional because all the rest are characters but this is rudyard kipling george stevens went over the top to convey a time and a time before when these events actually occurred the information is honest compelling and it will not only draw you in but you will need to understand about why we so love gunga din there is in the distance the black watch is out in front and they are approaching a most certain peril and possible defeat unless the troop can be warned sgt cutter is seriously wounded and ballantine as well as machesney are restrained din having a deep wound at the base of his back as the result of a bayonet thrust deeply into his body from behind is up to the demand of having to warn the colonel of impending peril with a effort worthy of our most sincerest desires in this life time din slowly climbs and manages to scale the steeple which rests as the top of the tuggee temple the sound of gunga dins horn allows the approaching army to be forewarned a very large scale battle ensues and the enemy is nullified it is so dramatic and tense filled position that as gunga din lay dead on a pile of rocks which his bullet riddled body now shows sgt cutter says good work soldier i don't know of any more dramatic moment nor one where we learn what sacrifice means then when the troop is forewarned of the impending peril br br the end is far from being anti climatic it is the telling of who gunga din is and what he means now to the honored men in uniform for whom he willing sacrificed ballantine knows his heart and asks the colonel to take care of his enlistment papers and this makes machesney quite pleased with the colonel being honest places the enlistment papers in his pocket to be dealt with at perhaps at a more appropriate time the colonel says at the place where now all are gathered that we have all done enough soldiering for one long day and further comments on how pleased there efforts were in defense machesney says he would rather here that from the colonel than get a bloomin medal this is a very sober point and then he comes to din now here is a man who has no actually status so i am going to appoint him a corporal and his name shall be written on the rolls of our honored dead the poem is read as though it was just penned by kipling himself who stands by the gravesite with the colonel and the rest of the men gunga din bravo
<START> i picked this film up at my local library having met the director at a film festival late last year i was curious to check out his work i was pleasantly surprised br br the film takes a fresh look at familiar subjects love infidelity friendships jealousy it can be a bit 'talky' at times but never so much as to completely sink the film i enjoyed watching a love story with characters that clearly belong together and watching them make conscious decisions rather than haphazardly falling into something as important as love br br the contrast between this film and the average low budget shoot em' up black film is quite distinct check it out if you're lucky your copy will come with a copy of the soundtrack like mine did good stuff
<START> sergio leone spins in his grave if there was any film that tramples upon a man's life work its this one the lead character's lone wolf bravado is uninspiring and lame and the script was apparently written by a monkey with an eight grade education whoever's idea this was should be horse whipped the only reason i'm spending time trashing it is because there's a 10 line minimum sergio leone's family should sue not because its crap but because now it's immortalized as crap by mst 3000 shame disgust i blame hollywood at least gary busey makes crap that wont offend anyone but cocaine users and weapon experts this film is pure blasphemy
<START> really really bad how does a film this bad get made i kept waiting for some redeeming plot point interesting camera work or at least some gratuitous nudity but i got nothing i had just watched cabin fever and i thought it was an train wreck except for the nudity and pancakes but it looks like genius compared to this dreck the best script doctor in the world couldn't have saved this putrid pile of of stinking poo br br the only thing going for this film is that it ended br br i've got a headache just thinking about this movie and trying to write something ugh i'm glad i only paid 5 for it and it will soon end up in a landfill
<START> revenge is one of my favorite themes in film moreso the futility of revenge is one of my favorite themes in film having seen gaspar noe's irreversible 2002 i was expecting an even more relevant expression of this theme instead this film is a weak half hearted attempt which expressed nothing but the film's lack of conviction and focus br br spoilers the end scene a gratuitous male on male rape torture scene came across as nothing less than a female revenge rape fantasy however the film doesn't even follow through with this instead the drawn out scene which far exceeds the brutality of the initial rape both in the degree to which it was graphic and to which it was ritualized is crowned with a shot of dawson's face in an expression of either regret or this didn't fix anything while the rape of her rapist is heard continuing in the background br br my problem with the scene wasn't one of shock but one of confusion as to what such a graphic scene was trying to get across to the audience i mean do we feel bad for the rapist do we rejoice in dawson's revenge are we disgusted by the brutality of it all do we feel dawson's moment of regretful clarity aside from this failing the film is really sort of awkwardly paced with more style than substance character's are thin dialog is monotonous etc br br normally i try to take films on their own terms but descent didn't really seem to know what those were thumbs down
<START> i will give it a 3 just because it showed history that we need to know about to prevent it from happening again i agree with the comments from the gentleman from uk the movie was pretty terrible all clichÃ© no real plot historical and technical inaccuracies abound look up the technical specs on de 529 or any everts class destroyer escort and you will see what i mean i now its black history month in the us and im going to be called a racist just for saying this but the history of this ship is not that great they did some escort work chased a submarine that turned out to be a hulk that they rammed sorry but black people did a lot more in wwii then this silly movie gives them credit for this movie makes them look like whiners let the name calling commence i can handle it
<START> usually when we use the word escapist we mean it negatively warren beatty's big screen version of dick tracy proves that escapist can be good this is truly one entertaining movie as the eponymous yellow clad fearless title character beatty creates a detective to whom we can all relate ready for action but not without his weaknesses br br from there the rest of characters are almost a world unto themselves tess truehart glenne headly is as glamorous as one would expect the hubby of any crime fighter to be breathless mahoney madonna is possibly the most perplexing person imaginable big boy caprice al pacino is the average villain ruthless but cool other characters include the speech challenged mumbles dustin hoffman the over musical 88 keys mandy patinkin and the kid charlie korsmo charles durning james caan dick van dyke estelle parsons catherine o'hara seymour cassel paul sorvino and kathy bates also star br br oh wait a minute i haven't even explained the plot the plot involves tracy trying and failing so far to find some way to nab big boy simultaneously some very bizarre events have been going on in town the answers to which may or may not be closer than everyone thinks br br of course the main thing about this movie is that it's fun to watch if warren beatty was having trouble acting his age then he made good use of that here dick tracy is one cool movie
<START> ok honestly i dont see why everybody thinks this is so great its really not there were two good things that came out of this movie 1 jack's performance he was very good i can tip my hat for him 2 danny's performance he was good no other then that it got pretty stupid and what was stanley kubrick thinking drafting shelly as the wendy she was so bad she looked the same every time she got scared the problem with this movie was the ending i would have had more respect for it if kubrick would have ended it differently and the over all movie was just stupid the problem with the movie is that the book was so much better so dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off 3 10
<START> i saw this film at a pre release screening at the writers guild theater in beverly hills as i recall the film's producers and director were in attendance presumably to gage our reaction br br many scenes evoked gales of laughter from the audience which would have been fine if it had been a comedy but it was supposed to be a horror film br br if the audience wasn't scared it seems the filmmakers were they delayed release for over a year out of curiosity i saw it again to see if they'd re cut it as far as i can tell they hadn't it was the same lousy movie just a year older br br it almost qualifies as so bad it's good but it's slow paced and boring
<START> warning mild spoilers ahead br br yes i realize it's tough to spoil an historical documentary but i do reveal some of the backstory and methods br br this is an exceptional documentary not just because of the remarkable footage but also due to the story behind it because the naudets did not set out to tell the story of 9 11 but rather that of a rookie firefighter the men's emotions and the viewer's connection with them are more real and powerful than they would be in a standard retrospective br br in a filmmaking sense 9 11 is textbook if the events were an actual script they would be superb as the characters are established then thrown a curve to which they must react this is all the more amazing considering the pain and emotion of the raw footage that the directors had to wade through to piece this story together br br the first portion of the film provides a glimpse of life inside a fire station specifically how a rookie assimilates himself into a crew of veterans that part alone is quite good and had the documentary been allowed to run its intended course it probably would have been solid the brothers appear to realistically portray the process of becoming a nyc firefighter br br then of course all hell breaks loose the chaos following the wtc attacks is vividly seen as various characters that we have gotten to know are thrust into terrifying situations seeing not only the attacks but also the first hand reactions is a very moving picture of extreme human emotion br br the aftermath in which firefighters are discovered to be lost and found is human drama at its peak life and death hang in the balance unlike many movies the viewer not only doesn't know who will live and die but genuinely cares about them br br the only negative thing i have to say about this is that the robert deniro whom i like blurbs were uninformative unnecessary and didn't advance the story at all they were probably added just to attract more television viewers br br bottom line the best documentary i've ever seen nonpareil portrayals of raw human emotion and drama 9 5 out of 10
<START> this movie is amazing the plot was just wow br br i was very surprised by gackt's and hyde's performance after growing up in the american world of the actors who can't sing and singers who can't act br br in this movie a young sho gackt comes across a vampire kei hyde over time they form an unlikely friendship kei is suffering because of how he is forced to live off others the half life of a vampire br br it's a sad movie but not sappy the plot was very unique and contrary to your typical vampire flick the storyline was thick with twists and turns and very entrancing br br the only fault i would say the movie had despite it's lack of a happy albeit peacefulÂending would be it's multiple languages i had the unsubdued version i'm lucky that i understood it all save some of the cantonese so i would recommend getting something with subtitles br br all in all the movie was just awesome
<START> marilyn miller made only three films before her untimely death the marvelous sally 1929 the comedy her majesty love 1931 and this trifle sunny 1930 it is quite poor both as an early talkie and as an attempt at a musical although she has four dance numbers she only sings two songs who and one man alone the rest of the score including the spritely title tune are jettisoned although we can hear the latter in the background scoring miller looks overweight and amateurish here no star quality at all even her dancing is cloutish the film is very badly written stock full of stale and unfunny jokes and stupid situations if you're interested in miller as a performer by all means check it out but for general entertainment stay away
<START> exceedingly complicated and drab i'm a bright guy but this was just too much for a tired brain it would really benefit from a few early clues as to who these people are and what they are doing probably better for the us market gc himself hinted that this alone did not supply his oscar and you can see why br br still the sand dunes are pretty the nail pulling is nasty the attorneys drunk dad is a mystery the cricket is good to see br br very difficult to write the required ten lines on this despite it being over 2 hours long thank heavens they shortened it admittedly we don't get to the pictures much but the last film we saw walk the line was 10 times better and i don't really like johnny cash my wife says george still looks good with the beard and a few extra pounds so there's that am i nearly there yet br br how about now
<START> one of the best true crime movies ever made and very faithful to truman capote's book which invented the true crime novel genre haunting quincy jones musical score and terrific acting by scott wilson and robert blake as dick and perry the killers why wilson didn't go on to be a big star after this movie is a mystery to me br br the black and white cinematography and editing in this movie are top notch the re creation of the murders is frightening and since it leaves the actual murders to your imagination even more scary than if they had shown the shotgun going off the movie was filmed in the actual clutter house which had been sold to another person after the murders the movie has a very documentary feel besides the scenes at the actual clutter home other scenes were filmed at the gas stations and stores the killers actually went to nancy clutter's beloved horse babe is even in the movie will geer has a great turn as the prosecutor in the short trial scene which is not only filmed in the actual courtroom but has several of the real clutter murder jurors portraying themselves as the jury for the movie br br this is a solid movie scary every time you see it
<START> first of all this movie starts out on a really dumb note a 10 year old girl playing around in a moving vehicle decides it would be funny to cover up her mom's eyes with her hands and then causes a horrific accident which kills the mom duh i am sorry there is positively no 10 year old that dumb the rest of the movie does not get much better after the death of the mother by the apparent dumbest 10 year old on the planet the dad moves the family to genova italy where he is to teach at a local university but here is the clincher he does not speak a word of italian then the little girl has visions of mommy who she killed and often subsequent night terrors which always always end by the father holding and coddling her then we are forced to watch this family continually get lost and then found and then hug and then cry and lost and then found followed by of course more hugging and crying to the point that i was actually wishing for some sort of natural disaster to just wipe all of these vapid ignorant people off the planet do not get me wrong because i love indies but an indie about dumb people and i mean really dumb is simply ridiculous and pointless it is really a shame that this movie was based on such insipid characters wallowing in such retarded scenarios because the locale was interesting
