<START> an older man touches a flower in his wife's greenhouse that seems to be wilting he gets pricked by it or bitten by something on it he quickly becomes ill and at the hospital spits out a large writhing white larva of some kind a later attempt to resuscitate him with paddles results in a splatter of blood br br a cop is at the hospital because his partner got badly hurt in a shoot out somehow the cop gets paired up with one of the female doctors as well as an entomologist who is brought in there are several young kids wandering around the hospital who i suppose we're supposed to find adorable but who are extremely annoying little brats they happen to wander into the room where the specimen is being kept and happen to dump a growth hormone on it horror movie logic would say they deserve to die for this but they're never even in any danger br br the critter grows and starts breeding people run away from it and sometimes towards it for some reason the hospital gets surrounded by military who are prepared to destroy everything if need be br br there are no really compelling characters in the movie and most of the time it seems like people are searching around for the monster it was fairly boring clearly it owes something to the alien movies with the monster being born inside a human and having several stages of its growth there's also a character named bishop and the lead actress has sigourney weaver's hair
<START> the sopranos stands out as an airtight dynamic exploration of american life and how the american experience is shaped and defined by money by setting the story in the milieu of the underworld david chase eliminates all barriers to a grunt low to the ground and outright mean deconstruction of the post modern era br br every character represents a facet of american industry tony soprano exemplifies the beleaguered working stiff torn between familial duty and a need to keep his business on an even keel the convergence of these two things is the imperative that keeps the story moving forward the characters of christopher paulie and bobby reflect the loyal but self serving underlings present in every enterprise who are trusted out of necessity rather than merit with the character of ralph joe pantoliano essays a brilliant interpretation of the charismatic psychopath a twisted businessman who's flourishes of violence are tragically outweighed by his stunning earning power and dominic chianese is the ultimate symbol of the antiquated old guard which maintains power through established relationships and the need of the up and comers to deflect blame br br though abrasive and occasionally disturbing the sopranos has earned its place as the ultimate tv drama br br ps a good companion piece to chase's series would be the shield another violent drama that manages to make the ugliest of characters interesting
<START> stifler has finished running his naked mile and is now attending beta house crazy stuff happens people run around naked and nerds are made fun of and this series is dead in the water the naked mile was a crap film but i found it to be significantly better then band camp it seems they've gone back to what didn't work for them and it shows that they don't care either you can tell where the target audience is and they nailed it perfectly young teenage boys who like to see naked women crude humour and beer drinking will love beta house everyone else can pretty much look away br br star wars became a massive success that stunned audiences with it's ahead of its time special effects lord of the rings created an entire world of mythical creatures and massive battles that dazzled the eye the matrix changed the way action and sci fi films were made specifically with the cutting edge special effects with all the advancement in technology we eagerly await the next big thing that will have our jaws dropped to the floor then comes american pie beta house which pushes the boundaries of what technology can do when people have created spaceships landscapes and creatures using cgi beta house decides to use this technology to create semen yes the thing that creates life the thing you see so many times in pornography films is created and time slows down to show us the white residue shoot across the room onto a teddy bear is this funny disgusting neither beta house shows more nudity then the naked mile which is surprising considering the previous installments title does the film need it of course not does it ever advance the plot does it ever does it ever get a laugh does it ever get young boys aroused yes the women are beautiful but if i am the one who thinks there is too much nudity then you might as well just have made a porno br br the female who catches the affections of our main character is pretty and doesn't annoy the viewer like previous girls have done in the series but not once did i ever believe this character would ever do what she does i'm pretty sure every action from the characters in this film are far from realistic the american pie series has fallen from a realm of reality into a fantasy world none of the events in this film would ever happen if they ever did then i need to attend this school immediately is this film suppose to make people feel like they are having a good time well it doesn't we are watching them have a good time by the end of the film we hate them for all the fun they are having br br there is a deer hunter scene in the film but to make it funny for today's audience they decided to substitute bullets wit horse semen are you laughing yet instead of shooting themselves with said semen in the head or face they place the gun in their mouths are you on the floor laughing yet the first time we are introduced to stifler's roommate he's having sex with his girlfriend are you cheering at the nudity yet the film at first seems like it will be about the boys trying to get into the frat house but then it shifts to them already being in the frat house but needing to perform certain tasks then it shifts to a competition between nerds and the boys it goes a little revenge of the nerds on us for a bit and it seems out of place i honestly do not know what these film is about because it goes all over the place br br most of the comedy seems forced for shock value even at the beginning with the dad showing his son the list of people he has had sex with the joke is in there somewhere i think it might be the fact that his wife is not the last name on the list or it could have been that one of his son's friend's mother was on the list either one it doesn't work br br i guess if you haven't guessed it yet this film is not funny nor does it seem to be focused the story is pathetic and the so called crude humour that the series has been known for doesn't shock skip this lame installment and any future ones as well i do not know why i have seen all the entries in the series but for some unknown reason they seem to have found their way to my eyes
<START> this cannon movie tale is the worst of the lot and is positive proof that a five minute fable does not a full length film make poor sid caesar as the vain emperor is made to look so stupid it's hard to watch him as the sly tailor robert morse hasn't an ounce of charm neither does his hapless nephew jason carter the songs are dreadful and only slow what there is of the plot down the direction is practically nonexistent and the supporting characters add very little lysette anthony is pretty as the emperor's daughter but her voice has obviously been dubbed for some reason a fate shared by many of the minor players and the film crawls at a snails pace hans christian andersen must have been turning somersaults in his grave when this appeared it can honestly be said at least of this movie tale it's no surprise that it went straight to video oblivion
<START> and finally old old michael corleone falls over and goes 'thump ' who really did the writing for this last installment of the godfather saga probably the same staff who does as the world turns this flick doesn't deserve the title godfather at all let's call this one the cosas of our nostras or all my capos as someone who's encountered a number of mafia people in my business life i can say without exception that i've never met any mobster as inwardly conflicted and contemplative as michael corleone let's face it these guys are in the mafia solely because they're greedy nothing more in this film don corleone spends lots of time pondering his past deeds and his bleak future perhaps even the afterlife then recovers remarkably fast in order to pull off some fantastic business deal or order the death of this one or that one like the big time operator he is deep down then there's his failed marriage after the break up scenes in g2 we may hope that michael kay will reunite as man and wife but here they seem to just become very good platonic friends who can laugh cry share intimate thoughts about their lives it's as if the screenwriters try to make michael into a woman it's bizarre behavior for two people who shared the passion of the marriage bed for 9 years there's some miscasting here and there or perhaps they're sins of authorship poor old country beautiful sophia coppola is saddled with a hopeless role with too many short lines in the film that don't fit what a young woman would say in casual conversations was given remarks rather than lines to emote her 'passionate' lovemaking scene with andy garcia looks like something from a bad teen sex comedy as they chew their open mouthed kisses and fondle each others backsides on the kitchen drainboard like marionettes scullery sex was brought off wonderfully by glenn close and michael douglas but it's just laughable here then there's andy's character vinnie mancini who's also given a difficult thankless role to play he's expected i guess to be the new new don corleone but he's almost handed the job on a silver platter and has to do little to strengthen his position unlike michael's simultaneous hits on all 5 families in g1 this hand me down process may be an authentic way of transferring power in a mafia family but why is so much made of this boring routine certainly don vincent may earn the respect of his fellow gangsters someday but there's little character revelations in the script to give us a portrait of this young man sadly puzo did such a fine job of quickly concisely developing michael's character in g1 but g3 has no economy in it's story telling and we suffer through drawn out expositories until we just want to take a snooze thirdly george hamilton was also handed a thankless task in taking over as family lawyer after robt duvall reportedly turned down a 3rd installment as tom hagen george wisely underplayed his role so it came off without damage to the actor the development of connie corleone's character is interesting but it goes too far when she takes murderous matters into her own hands she could well end up sleeping with the fredos if this were the real world but it's not all bad the assassination scene in the hotel penthouse is nifty also they keep pulling me back in or words to that effect is a great line and we recover some old country feel as we get to go back to sicily even if it's all done in 1989 and they've got modern cars haircuts the plot lines involving the corrupt hierarchy of the catholic church are pretty interesting since it's based on some actual financial shenanigans at banco vaticani in the 1980's but it's brought too far again with the too spectacular death scenes etc the grand opera scenes are very dramatic and well photographed but the death scene of mary toward the end is an unbalanced attempt of emotional manipulation at best all screenwriters need to learn that we don't always need more and more death in order to bring a mafia movie to a successful conclusion you feel sorry for kay that her daughter is dead she plays her grief so well but michael's reaction is hammy hammy hammy then michael dies sometime in the 21st century in sicily alone on a grand estate of heart failure no grandson to play with before his demise no wife to grieve for him what should have happened in the last 1 2 of this movie is michael being tracked down by someone like rudy guilliani put on trial all his dirty family's sleazy little enterprises and bloodthirsty indulgences brought into the light of day michael then convicted under rico statutes and sent to federal prison for life then he can keel over dead from heart failure while mopping a floor in leavenworth that's how mafia dons were ending their careers in the late 80's and early 90's and they got much better treatment than what they deserved
<START> i have seen the short movie a few years ago after that i watch all sequels the first one is really not the best but it's the most popular one i've already watch the making of guinea pig 1 it's really great what these guys did also the sequels are excellent in the special effects take your chance to watch it
<START> well it was a nice surprise after all its trailer did not predict a good film at all it was even a bit misleading especially the part of jeff bridges was a positive surprise well written sardonic and funny less real though i do not think a guy who got where he got would show signs of such irreverence towards everything that his current company stands for one does not become a top suit just to doubt it all suddenly again the ending of the film during the showing of dolce vita was too corny clichÃ© and quite disappointing and of course a guy like pegg's character would not last past his first week in a blitz new york magazine like this i hope one day i will see a decent role written for megan fox here she looked a poor actress playing a bimbo and by the way i do not see why she is the sex symbol of the year i see hotter girls on nearly every cover of every magazine
<START> and the series lets you forget all that i am about three years older than the kids portrayed in the series born in 1958 i learned to drive during the first gas shortage and got my first post college graduation job during the second gas shortage in 1979 the 70's were a truly dreadful time to be young inflation competing for after school minimum wage jobs with laid off thirty somethings dreadful music worse clothes br br the funny thing is this series doesn't ignore any of that and still manages to make the 70's look fun even for those of us old enough to know better it manages to look the 70's directly in the face complete with time authentic clothing and yet fill the show with the hopefulness of youth and the things that make the high school and college years both the best of times and the worst of times then there are the parents the two young lovers in the show eric forman and donna pinciotti truly have dreadful parents with the best of intentions eric's parents red and kitty are not exactly june and ward although they are conventional for the decade they represent what happened when the 60's finally reached the suburbs during the 1970's donna's parents are two people who have been waiting for the 1960's to show up their whole lives in order to give their weirdness legitimacy eric's friends fez kelso and jackie round out the group representing nerdiness well meaning incompetence and snobbishness respectively hyde is an unusual teenager for a show about the suburbs but he largely represents someone who has to play the cards he was dealt even when those cards are dealt by largely absentee and negligent parents i highly recommend all eight seasons even though season eight does lag a bit due to the absence of eric
<START> i liked this movie because it told a very interesting story about living in a totally different world at the south pole susan sarandon is such a good actor that she made an interesting strong character out of mediocre writing the true story displays a devastating situation for her character to overcome
<START> slaughter high is intrinsically your emblematic 80s slasher flick a prank goes out of hand leaving a geeky guy horribly burnt a few years later the geeky guy returns and starts killing the people who hurt him now the story might sound intriguing and very entertaining but what makes this horrible film so different from the rest of the 80s slasher flicks is that it has some humorless flaws and continuation errors br br the acting is horrendous however actually not as bad as one would suspect though it doesn't help that every character in the film are so grody and unlikable the lead carol manning caroline munro is the easily the biggest tormentor of them all and she's the one that we are ostensibly supposed to share compassion and root for not to mention the geeky guy is almost too geeky and i think that even stereotypical geeks themselves would be rudely maddened and just downright antagonized by how geeky he his so when he gets mauled does anyone really care br br there is much unintentional laughter potential munro's lack of acting talent is quite apparent which puts her down at the same level as the rest of the awful cast however the most amusement is easily when the film poorly attempts to pose munro who is in her mid 30s at the time as a teenager amongst a cast of teenagers and then when it comes to later life and munro is playing around her real age the rest of the cast do not pass as adults this all goes well with a theme song that is a hilariously pose of heavy metal thrash accompanied by maniacal laughter and a voice shrieking i'll get you with that being said slaughter high really isn't a very good slasher flick but it does have a bad cheesy entertainment value to it perhaps an essential for hardcore slasher fans but don't expect dilemma suspense or any credibility from it horrible
<START> this is not a commentary on the actual movie but on the ruscico dvd release for north america i don't know if there have been different releases and updates but the disks we rented had a 2000 copyright on them if that means anything anyway the sound mixing on these dvd's was absolutely horrible the levels often yo yo ed up and down when the scene cut to a battlefield panorama the orchestral track would thunder so loudly that i didn't know which would blow out first my eardrums or my speakers when it was time for dialog the volume would usually drop to something barely audible occasionally the orchestra and foley work would stay loud while the dialog was superimposed at a much lesser level my wife and i found that the only way we could watch this movie at all from these dvd's was if one of us kept a hand on the remote to continuously modulate the volume and like another user has already commented when we selected english audio the dialog kept switching back and forth between russian and english and occasionally when the characters spoke in french on the native track the dubbing was in russian so you're sol if you understand neither ultimately we gave up watching after the first disk before you fork out 50 for this movie on dvd for your own library i'd heartily recommend getting your hands on a rental copy to see whether you can really enjoy this epic flick when burdened by such bad sound particularly if you've never read the book and really want to understand the storyline
<START> if one would see a renÃ© clair film with the kind of distracted semi attention which is the rule in tv watching one might be better off doing something different br br watching le million with all attention focused upon what takes place before eyes and ears will reveal a wealth of delightful details which keep this musical comedy going from the beginning to the end with its explosion of joy br br in the danish newspaper berlingske tidende a journalist once wrote in my younger days i saw a film which made me feel like dancing all the way home from the cinema this film is on tv tonight see it
<START> i showed this to my 6th grade class about 17 years ago and the students loved it i loved it too the story of the termites and their interaction with their environment is amazing the cast of creatures is deep and they all play their parts well the battle between the two cold blooded titans is truly classic footage br br alan root has done some incredible camera work and this should have won the best documentary oscar the copy i have doesn't have orson welles narrating it derek jacobi and it isn't called the mysterious castles of clay just castles of clay this makes me think that it must have been done with welles added for star power and an oscar push br br i was lucky enough to find this vhs just recently and it is now my children's favorite movie they brought it to the latest family gathering instead of a disney movie if you can find this movie you are indeed lucky
<START> the acting is some of the worst i've ever seen the characters are totally unconvincing this could be overlooked to some extent if the plot was interesting which the plot to the prodigy was not it's sort of a bad mix between fresh and animal house except that both of those movies were good
<START> first of all this was not a three hour movie two hours ten minutes last time i checked commercials aren't actually part of a movie perhaps though it should've been a two parter for a total of about 3 hours yeah would have gotten more in been able to explore some more emotion overall though it was an interesting look into the lives of lucy and desi i watch i love lucy from time to time and love it but never have i read or seen a biography never knew anything about their lives off the screen because of this movie i do now but i'm not so sure that's a good thing everything here no one really needed to know this was essentially a movie that didn't need to be made but it was made and the reason is because lucy desi are still such huge stars and certain people in american society feel that the rest of society needs to know all about our tv and movie stars that is definitely so not true and very very sad br br anyway what was shown here in lucy was pretty good two complaints the actress who played viv vance not great casting at all and the switch from madeline zima to rachel york uhhh like lucy had plastic surgery and all of a sudden she's a whole new person that wasn't too great but the story went on and focused on the rocky relationship between lucy desi no the kids were not shown very much at all and that wasn't necessarily a drawback to this movie because like i said this focused mainly just on lucy desi had there been more time had the story been more about lucy's entire life then maybe the kids woulda been there more but they weren't so we got to see the likes of gable lombard red skelton and buster keaton very briefly instead wow that was one thing about this story that i thought was really cool his presence and influence in lucy's life really neat and it's too bad that wasn't explored more oh well what was explored was done well for the most part honestly i don't think i'll ever watch this again and i don't think this movie'll be that memorable for someone who digs i love lucy but isn't an enormous lucille ball fan this should be an interesting watch my grade for this b
<START> parsifal 1982 starring michael kutter armin jordan robert lloyd martin sperr edith clever aage haugland and the voices of reiner goldberg yvonne minton wolfgang schone director hans jurgen syberberg br br straight out of the german school of film the kind that favored tons of symbolism and ingmar bergmanesque surrealism came this 1982 film of wagner's final masterpiece parsifal written to correspond with good friday easter and the consecration of the bayreuth opera house this film follows the musical score and plot accurately but the manner in which it was filmed and performed is bold and avant garde and no other parsifal takes the crown in its bizarre cinematography syberberg is known for controversial films prior to this film he had released films about hitler and nazism richard wagner and his personal anti semitism and a documentary about winifred wagner one of his grand daughters this film is possibly disturbing in many aspects parsifal sung by reiner goldberg but acted by michael kutter is a male throughout the first part of the film and then after the enchantment of kundry's kiss is transformed into a female this gender bending element displays the feminine masculine ying yang nature of the quest for the holy grail which serves all mankind and redeems it through christ's blood in the pagan sorcerer klingsor's fortress there are photographs of such notoriously sinister figures as hitler nietzche cosima wagner and wagner's mistress matilde wesendock the swaztika flag hangs outside the fortress parsifal journeys into the 19th and 20th century throughout the film the tempting flower maidens are in the nude kundry is portrayed as a sort of beautiful but corrupt mary magdalene or eve from genesis played by edith clever but beautifully sung by mezzo soprano yvonne minton ultimately this film is for fans of this type of bizarre germanic european symbolic metafiction and for intellectuals who appreciate the symbolism the history and lovers of wagner opera indeed the singing is grand and compelling reiner goldberg's parsifal is a focused and intense voice but it lacks the depth and overall greatness of the greater parsifals of the stage james king wolfgang windgassen rene kollo and today's own placido domingo yvone minton is a sensual voiced dramatic and exciting kundry delving into her tormented state perfectly while the production is certainly unorthodox and as un wagnerian as it can possibly get wagner's concept was christian ceremonial pomp with grails spears castles knights and wounded kings a dark sorcerer darkness turning into light etc typical wagnerian themes it is still an enjoyable art house film
<START> the storyline was okay akshay kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie kareena kapoor looked bad there was so hue and cry over her size zero but she did not looked good leaner i don't know why the hell did anil kapoor accepted such a bad role there was nothing much to do for him in the movie just because it is a yashraj film does not means that an actor should accept the role however bad it is said ali khan was alright i think that it is high time that indian directors and producers start thinking of indian customers as intelligent lot what are we fools what do they think they will show 2 men taking on a swat squad to teeters and we will believe them is the indian police so stupid that they are trying to nab some criminals they take an entire squad of 100 policemen and no one was there to surround the palace the action was crap and i have never seen such bad action akshay kumar was between a circle of 30 40 policemen all shooting at him and he shooting back at them none of the policemen's bullet touched him but he killed all the policemen crap crap br br i think the fight director who thought of this scene should take retirement br br i strongly recommend not to see this movie
<START> i saw this move several years ago at the central florida film festival if i recall i liked it it showed great potential i guess most people here are blasting this film because the film did seem hobbled together by the filmmaker's own admission on the official site the short was exhibited as a rough cut br br but nonetheless it was an easy going comedy i think many people try to read far too much into a comedy all they are supposed to do is make you laugh that's all i did just that at its showing so it succeeded on that level just my 2 cents anyway
<START> this movie bewilders me it may be that i'm just a stupid american but i really just don't get 400 blows everything i've read about this movie has been a total rave but i just couldn't stay interested i'm sure that it was as revolutionary in film making as all the critics say but when it boils right down to it it's just really really boring maybe it's the language barrier may i'm just not sensitive or artsy enough but whatever the case is i hated this movie the story itself isn't bad it's about a young french boy who is treated unfairly by his parents and his teachers and eventually he ends up in a juvenile facility that in itself ought to be interesting and it was at first there was nothing wrong with the dialogue but then again it's hard to say because half of the conversations weren't subtitled and for no apparent reason so i didn't always know what was going on but for the dialogue we could understand it made enough sense the actors were believable enough but it's hard to say what a real person would do in these situations so you feel for the main character but only in the sense that when he gets into trouble you think well that sucks the plot isn't even your typical plot each time he gets in trouble he gets into more trouble than the last time but the reasons never vary too much and through the entire film you realize that there's nothing the main character can really do about it so it's more like just waiting to see how it ends the ending by the way was completely over my head it's way too artsy for me and i just didn't get it leading up to the end was easy enough to follow the structure was certainly there and it made sense as well but everything was really drawn out for the amount of dialogue and significant moments the movie could have been an hour shorter it just didn't end part of it was the unnecessarily long shots none of which were especially memorable for example the ending was a clip of the main character running down a country road that lasted a good thirty seconds now i'm sure that had some deeper meaning in it somewhere but for the average viewer i'd rather have gotten up to get some more food during that time or at least done something a little more useful than sit and watch this boy running like doing my laundry or taking a nap br br final verdict br br the feeling throughout the whole movie was that this probably would be very moving and just amazing and that it would teach me some great life lesson if i could only get what the director was trying to say by hisÂ unique decisions as it was i just felt cheated out of a good two hours of my life
<START> although robert knox benfer has his fans i'm not one of them his films are asinine and amateurish and and just not very funny unless you're a 14 year old with an underdeveloped sense of humor br br he's certainly not famous as him immature fans would like you to believe by harassing people at wikipedia or stuffing the ratings votes here at the imdb he's certainly not been profiled by any major media outlets which speaks volumes about his and his creation's fame br br benfer does have some slight skill at limited animation but he needs to get away from his young sycophants and learn to write some actual funny material before he'll be taken seriously as a real entertainer as of this moment though he's just a kid with a camera and it shows
