<START> spoiler bunch of passive aggressive people having family reunion the script has them saying and doing things people would never do at least anyone with a shred of decency the hero falls for a woman he sees as his soul mate at a bookstore the day of the reunion unaware she will show up as his brother's girlfriend at the reunion he tries to defer to his brother's claim but she knowing our hero is clearly infatuated with her teases him mercilessly by wearing sexy clothing and behaving like a stripper rubbing all over the brother in a ruse excuse that she is showing him how to stretch at one point she actually disrobes and gets into a shower with him he tries to cover his eyes his heart is breaking she thinks it's funny until she suddenly decides she doesn't want the brother and leaves the reunion br br the movie really drags the audience coughed and fidgeted its way through the long haul the writing is unintelligent and unbelievable we almost walked out but kept thinking surely something would happen that would perk things up but nooooo all the lovely reviews must have been written by paid shills out to dupe poor suckers like me into seeing crap like this comparing it to little miss sunshine jeez shame on them the writers the actors the producers and the theaters for letting anything this bad make it to the screen
<START> the most moving and truly eye opening documentary ever created i cried the whole way through from start to end watching the show you are immediately captured by a man's struggle to live without pain to live a life we would take for granted the first time i heard the title i was almost scared to see the program it was hard for me to comprehend living in agony every day of every year of my life i truly felt for him the saddest part of the documentary is when jonny picks out his coffin could you imagine doing that even more so even though he was in excruciating and unbearable pain he still opened up his own charity debra jonny is one of the only people that deserves true respect and admiration he is the definition of a role model what a true and undeniable hero he was
<START> this film is about a male escort getting involved in a murder investigation that happened in the circle of powerful men's wives br br i thought the walker would be thrilling and engaging but i was so wrong the pacing is painfully and excruciatingly slow that even after 40 minutes of the film nothing happens much seriously the first hour could be condensed into ten minutes that's how slow it is br br the fact that it lacks any thrills or action scenes aggravates the boredom it's almost shocking that even argument scenes are so plain and devoid of emotion maybe it is because of the stiff upper lip of the higher social class br br it's sad that the walker becomes such a boring mess despite such a strong cast blame it on the poor plot and even worse pacing
<START> although i gave a rating of 9 my expectations were higher than what the film delivered i would have been happier had there been more deep diving since i am a diver myself but it was supposed to portray the life of carl brashear and that's what it was about this film made me angry in the beginning but happy in the end
<START> i'm a big fan of the tv series largo winch this movie was pain for me i had to use fast forward not to fell to sleep it was boring how can somebody ruin this title so much the story was the only good thing actors were sh t they can't live the role the main actor tom is a null watch the other roles of this actor the fighting scenes were unbelievable boring and not to followable somehow they were not to follow the situation like other reviewer said low budget film with bad actors maybe next time somebody else can do better thing out of this title french can't do right thing with big films like alien 4 that was bit brrr after alien 1 2 3
<START> i cannot vote on this because i wouldn't watch garbage from these people they got my money with another movie mr jingles and i swore it would never happen again i feel it's my civic duty to help people stay away from this trash go to the forums on this film and read where cast members try to act like they are seeing the movie for the first time one guy even responds to himself using the same name there are shills in the forum that say it's as good as shawshank redemption and citizen kane not even close by no means if this is the company's 2nd movie it should be better than the first that means the 3rd movie should be a lot better not so i've seen it all i want to know is how you distribute this trash using the same names all the time having fun with friends and making a movie over the weekend is fine but don't try to market that trash
<START> this excellent drama had me in suspense the whole time i could not take my eyes off the screen for one second because every word kept connecting the pieces to this puzzling murder this movie really touched me because it showed how sad and hard life can be i really did cry in the end which i don't want to give away it also let me realize how cruel and sickening people can be when it comes to murder br br the cast was also very good the only bad cast member was the actress who played anne marie the actress did a great job but the director didn't i say this because he found someone who didn't look a single bit like anne marie fahey herself
<START> i saw this film a while back and it's still at the top of my 'favorite movies' list it is amazingly put together and what really makes the film are the detailed tid bits such as the 'cafe bustelo' coffee crate being reused as a cup to wash her grandsons hair that people aren't seeing because you will not understand this movie unless you are hispanic this is just one of those films that is very culturally specific and particular please do not bash this film if you have no prior knowledge of what foundation it's being built upon i completely see what the writer director was going for and he hit the target perfectly this film is highly deserving of a better rating
<START> how the grinch stole christmas instantly stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from my very first viewing now eight viewings later it still has the same impact on me as it did the first time i saw it br br screenwriters jeffery price peter s seaman of who framed roger rabbit fame do a fantastic job of adapting the story of the grinch to the screen ron howard's direction brought the story to full life and jim carrey's typically energetic performance as the grinch steals the show br br some detractors of the film have claimed that it is not true to the spirit or principles of the original story having read the original story i must say i cannot agree the movie makes the very same point about christmas and its true meaning as the original story indeed it enhances the impact of the story by making it more personal by showing us how and why the grinch became what he was br br mild spoilers they probably wouldn't ruin the movie for you but if you haven't seen it yet and you're one of those who wants to know nothing about a story until you've seen it you should skip the next two paragraphs br br i think just about everyone can relate to the grinch's terrible experiences in school i think all of us at one time or another were the unpopular one in school who was always picked on i know i was and that's why i personally had so much sympathy for the grinch and what he went through br br and cindy lou who's naive idealism believing that nobody can be all bad was heart rending when everyone else had turned their backs on the grinch out of fear and ignorance cindy lou was determined to be his friend if only everyone could have such an attitude br br in fact i think the only thing that might've made the film a little better would have been to further tone down the adult humor and content it was already pretty restrained but any of this adult humor like when the grinch slammed nose first into martha may whovier's cleavage just doesn't fit in a story like this br br this one's well on its way to being a christmas classic taking a richly deserved place alongside the book and the chuck jones cartoon as a must see of every christmas season
<START> the original movie dated 19 did not show any monster it just suggested scary things br br this version however shows every aspect of a sick minded ghost including unnecessary special effects br br the mystery as presented in the original movie was the most scary part one simply did not know what was causing the weird things that happened by showing the face of the old man this mister has completely disappeared even worse the special effects crying wooden children faces is ridiculous this is a stupid remake too obviously spectacular to even be close as scary as the original
<START> just cause showcases sean connery as a harvard law prof kate capshaw does she still get work as his wife slight age difference and lawrence fishburne as a racist southern cop and ed harris in a totally over the top rendition of a fundamentalist southern serial killer br br weird casting but the movie plays serious mindf with the audience don't read if you ever intend to seriously watch this film or to ever watch this film seriously due to the spoilers first of all i felt myself rolling my eyes repeatedly at the liberal stereotypes the cops are all sadistic and frame this black guy with no evidence the coroner witnesses and even the lawyer of the accused collaborate against him he is accused of the rape and murder of a young girl because he is black br br connery is a harvard law prof who gives impassioned speeches about the injustices against blacks and against the barbarous death penalty he is approached by the convicted man's grandmother to defend him and re open the trial br br connery is stonewalled yawn by the small town officials and the good il' boys club but finds that the case against blair the alleged killer now on death row was all fabricated the main evidence was his confession which was beaten out of him br br the beating was administered by a black cop who even played russian roulette to get the confession out of him connery finds out that another inmate on death row actually did the murder and after a few tete a tetes with a seriously overacting hannibal lecter like ed harris he finds out where harris hid the murder weapon br br he gets a re trial and blair is freed br br i think film over br br then suddenly it turns out that blair is a psychotic psycho and that he used white guilt to enlist connery he concocted the story with ed harris in return for blair carrying out a few murders for harris br br now blair is on the loose again thanks to connery's deluded pc principles the final 30 min are a weird action movie tacked onto a legal drama connery and fishburne fighting the serial killer in an alligator skinning house on stilts yes you read that right in the everglades br br that was one weird film br br so the whole system is corrupt and inefficient the cops are all just bullies and abu graib type torturers but the criminals are really psychotics and deserve to fry br br truly depressing on every level the system is completely rotten and the pc white guilt types who challenge it are seriously deluded too br br two thumbs down connery obviously had to make a mortgage payment or something
<START> repugnant bronson thriller unfortunately it's technically good and i gave it 4 10 but it's so utterly vile that it would be inconceivable to call it entertainment far more disturbing than a typical slasher film
<START> i was sooooo excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week my 13 year old son was looking forward to it too i rented it and snuggled down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screen br br boy was i disappointed this movie veered off from the book more times than is forgivable george c scott is an excellent actor but in this it seemed that he was fully into character only about 20 of the time the rest of the time he was quite flat br br i realize that this was made in '84 pre cg effects for the most part but it looked to be very b movie quality especially the encounter with jacob marley br br the biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story when the spirit of christmas present takes scrooge on the whirlwind tour of the world observing people in the bleakest of circumstances still having the light and love of christmastime br br i will admit that mr scott did a good job with the reformed scrooge at the end that was a refreshing portrayal br br i wish that bob cratchit had been portrayed as a little more ragged and down trodden and tiny tim oh don't even get me started on bad child actors
<START> there is one really good scene in faat kine the title character gets in an argument with another woman and after being threatened faat kine sprays her in the face the scene works because the act is so unexpected bizarre and rather funny at the same time in that one instance writer director ousmane sembene gives the audience a character that is easy to root for an interesting film character that could be worth watching for two hours in the scene he presents a brave woman who is bold in her actions for the rest of the movie the only other thing he seems to present is conflicting tones br br the tone is all over the place it's true not all movies have to clearly fit within a specific genre but i don't think faat kine fits into any genre supposedly it's a drama though there are moments of such broad comedy the aforementioned spraying in the face that it cannot be taken seriously on the other hand the film is certainly not a comedy with the abundant amount of serious topics sembene has crammed into the picture there is a way to successfully mix comedy and drama together unfortunately semebene doesn't find that balance instead one scene after another just drift into each other without much rhyme or reason leaving two different tones hanging in the wind br br faat kine also has the problem of running two hours long with an extremely drawn out finale the film ends with a big party where all the characters' conflicts are resolved only they aren't resolved quickly the scene lasts longer than any other scene going on for probably twenty minutes because the rest of the scenes up until this point have been meandering the finale is particularly hard to endure with repetition beginning early on in the scene making for a frustrating viewing experience br br perhaps i am being too hard on faat kine i am not the right audience for it i felt nothing towards the characters and had no connection to any part of the story there are people who will probably find something meaningful in the story and see strong characters however i was unable to do so and thus cannot recommend it
<START> well i too had heard read all the breathless reviews and comments about how this movie might deserve the best picture oscar so i went to see it today what a major disappointment 1 if you read the other reviews you will learn from members of the u s military who served in iraq how unlikely the events of this movie are they mirrored my own thoughts as the movie played i a complete civilian kept thinking to myself say what there's no way that would happen like that 2 there's very little that actually happens in terms of plot a new bomb disposal guy shows up to replace one who was killed a death that isn't really clearly explained the new guy gets an adrenaline rush from his work his attitude puts others at risk that's it 3 this movie is nowhere near as suspenseful as claimed if you want suspense try one of the bourne movies if you want to see a war movie that's emotionally powerful try renting go tell the spartans which is about the vietnam war and stars burt lancaster who told me personally in a serendipitous supermarket encounter that it was a film he was immensely proud of and one he viewed as some of his finest work and which he was still upset had been largely ignored in the wake of the over hyped apocalypse now or an old wwii black and white classic sink the bismark which especially for an english film is unbelievably heart wrenching don't waste your time on hurt locker
<START> an updated version of a theme which has been done before while that in and of itself is not bad this movie doesn't reach the ring like the other inherent and pure evil ones do br br predictable ambitious attempt that falls short of the mark not worth sitting through for the tired contrived ending
<START> one more of extremely unprofessional movies about computer programmers br br looks authors of that movie don't know real specific of programmers world br br 20 top programmers in the world program which have own satellites for what program which using satellite freq somebody kill somebody to steal the codes why and much more of stupid moments at this movie br br peoples who not programmers not will see something awful at that movie because not professionals on this but peoples will see not real things br br programmers will find that movie odd and awful because lots of moments inside movie is not related real life why movie not scifi in this case
<START> i enjoyed this movie unlike like some of the pumped up steroid trash that is passed off as action movies playing god is simple and realistic with characters that are believable action that is not over the top and enough twists and turns to keep you interested until the end br br well directed well acted and a good story
<START> in my opinion this is a pretty good celebrity skit show i enjoyed seeing greg kinnear as the host there are many reasons why i said that even though hal sparks was an okay host i sometimes wish that greg kinnear hadn't left if you ask me it seems that nobody stays with a tv show throughout its entire run anymore still i enjoyed seeing the various hosts and other people spoofing celebrities if you ask me that was pretty darn funny before i wrap this up i must say that i kind of miss this show now in conclusion i highly recommend this show to all you die hard sketch show fans you will really enjoy it
<START> i feel like i've just watched a snuff film a beautifully acted taut engrossing and horrible thing a two hour litany of perversion in the most basic and all inclusive sense of the word sexual violence and torture rape decapitation incest corruption live burial and abuse abuse abuse no redemption whatsoever and i was entertained i couldn't stop watching what does this say about me about the people who make and act in this sort of thing and a world that has become so desensitized that eventually real snuff films will be the norm and i'm neither puritanical nor humorless i don't try to hide from the existence of darkness and i definitely have not led a sheltered life but i am ashamed of myself and i'm sorry to see my british cousins dragging the subject matter sewers the way my own tribe does it doesn't have to be cozy but does it have to wallow in vicarious sadism
