<START> it's a difficult movie to classify 10 items or less generally i don't care about defining genres but there's something about this movie that makes you want to put it in a specific category in order to transmit even with only one word your feelings about it i completely recommend this film to anyone and if you truly enjoy cinema and if you enjoy life you'll want to do the same as soon as you've finished watching it br br i recommend this movie and call it beautiful and delightful admitting it's not perfect but it doesn't do anything wrong i don't want to sound like i contradict myself but i believe writer director brad silberling knew exactly what he was getting into when he finished writing this inspiring script i'm sure he wanted to achieve a product that had nothing to do with perfection a product that would be as simple appealing and uncompromising as its title well he's done it br br silberling director of long complex dramatic movies like city of angels and moonlight mile proves with 10 items or less which closes in at just 70 minutes the passion he has for his work and also the faith he has in it to put an actor morgan freeman in front of a woman paz vega in a grocery store and take them exactly to the places ordinary life would take them is what silberling proposes here br br i can't tell you no more because within the apparent simplicity lies a thought provoking background that shouldn't be underestimated because here everyone's exposed the camera focuses directly on the two main characters who share endless conversation in a car ride with stops that's not endless only because life is life and let me express how praise how well silberling handles the situation by saying that he reaches in less time not only in movie duration time but in the single day that the movie develops its events and in a smaller place the kind of connection between two characters that sofia coppola generated in lost in translation br br that movie set in tokyo also encountered an actor and a woman and they also had conversations about the moments they were living in their lives it's in the conversations where we sense the though provoking quality of 10 items or less and just as in coppola's movie the naturalness of every situation is never lost and the images with all music and no words don't seem forced or included in the picture to 'buy time' br br in this aspect the collaboration of silberling and his director of photography phedon papamichael the man who shot the beautiful sceneries in sideways and focused on every emotion in patch adams delights us here with visual passages of true natural beauty br br but the ultimate beauty of 10 items or less can be found in its cast by avy kaufman in its two protagonists they are the ones who transmit this feeling i mentioned at the beginning and i can't specify we feel their connection and we can tell they're having fun and that they may even be improvising stuff academy award winner morgan freeman also an executive producer of the film simply stands there and confirms the status he has today in the movie industry and one that's well deserved a quiet man filled with wisdom that can easily make you cry as he can make you laugh and the beautiful paz vega well i said she was great in spanglish Âhere she proves she's the real deal and hollywood's not small for her
<START> jake speed is a film that lacks one thing Â a charismatic lead unfortunately that's something that really taints the entire movie and it's a shame because at heart it is an enjoyable action movie with a witty enough script and an interesting if derivative premise although it's genesis probably can be traced back to the success of the indiana jones trilogy Â the film actually plays a little more like 'romancing the stone' albeit in reverse it's not an author of romantic adventure fiction being led on an adventure by a character very much like one of her creations it is an adventure fiction character who happens to chronicle his own adventures leading an ordinary woman on one of his adventures br br when a young woman goes missing in paris her sister margaret played by the appealing karin kopins gets embroiled with pulp hero jake speed wayne crawford and his sidekick dennis dennis christopher who both turn out to be real and very flawed individuals in an adventure that takes them into the heart of a civil war torn african state and ultimately into the clutches of two brothers the deliciously evil sid john hurt and his ridiculously camp sibling maurice roy london that's the plot Â it's not labyrinthine and it's not complicated but the story that it tells doesn't require great depth br br the action sequences are appealing to begin with and it's certainly true that the heroic trio are put through their paces whether caught in battles between government and rebel forces or being dropped into a pit full of lions and there are certainly some quite funny lines however the film does seem to struggle to find an ending and unfortunately the action sequences that are quite appealing to begin with go nowhere and ultimately become a bit bland and irksome this however may not have been such an issue if it was possible to like jake speed but due to wayne crawford's performance it becomes harder to really care what happens now i don't know if he was stretching himself a little thin as he was also the producer and writer of the movie or whether he's simply not a good actor as i haven't seen him in much else but he never really convinces as a roguish mixture of doc savage indiana jones and jack colton br br this is a shame because most of the other characters play their roles well Â karen kopins is funny and convincing and her character shares some nice banter with jake unfortunately it never convinces dennis christopher is perfect as the archetypal sidekick and john hurt plays the part with camp relish Â almost as if he were in a sixties episode of batman he strides about his few scenes growling in a ridiculous cockney accent putting in a performance that almost belongs in another film sid is no moriarty he is presented as jake's nemesis from a number of his previous adventures books but he is always fun to watch br br jake speed tries to channel the same fun b movie spirit as 'night of the comet' a film produced by crawford a few years beforehand and almost succeeds but misses Â which is a shame because jake would have been good to watch in a few more adventures and may have been served better by a television series br br i would recommend this out of curiosity appeal but ultimately it leaves a bitter taste because most of the elements were there to make something genuinely good
<START> as an employee of the swedish air force i enjoyed the nice gripen and hkp 9 mbb bo 105 flight scenes in this movie one of the few disappointments was the ews 39 jammer pod in this case an inert rb 75 maverick missile painted black with the letters ews 39 in white along the side real jammer pods definitely do not look like that at least not the ones i've seen br br but apart from that it's an entertaining movie with a very amusing ending the last minute anyone interested in seeing various swedish military units including the now legendary ssg on film should see this one br br
<START> for those who'd like to see this movie i'd say go without the narration it might be a very good movie documentary but the music the narration and some of the implemented story lines make it very hard to watch for a sceptic person like me following several animals their life in several seasons one gets the feeling that it is an animal soap we're watching but the melodramatic point of view just doesn't cut it for me moreover if a predator finally catches up on a prey one exception left there the camera zooms out or skips to another scene i ask myself why that happens if they were to show reality why cut the scenes that a melodramatic fairytale remains i think the moral is important for the mass of the crowd cause after all it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet
<START> this series would have been a lot better if they had just done one simple thing made ian mcshane code name diamond head instead of code name tree diamond head the character needs someone who could handle the role of the lovable rogue which mcshane proved he could do with the lovejoy series roy thinnes the actual diamond head is really only so so in the role mcshane is not really that good as the bad guy tree france nuyen's character tso tsing can't seem to make up her mind as to whether she's the hapless victim or the tough and ready to fight woman she really earned her pay at the end when she had to play the role of diamond head's lover after viewing an episode or two i ended up not caring what happened to anyone tree gives us a lot to hate him but diamond head gives us nothing to like him unfortunately the spy genre in the 1970s was not quite as it was in the 1960's
<START> i could never stand watching happy days after chachi joined the cast so i knew i was in trouble when the best scene in this movie featured scott baio a skateboard chase scene jodie foster in her first grown up role turns in her usual professional performance but that is no excuse for this boring mess two hours out of my life that i'll never get back no noteworthy characters unbelievable storyline questionable editing and horrendous cinematography but worst of all i couldn't have cared less the story of california teens in the 1970's where the kids live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots don't waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie
<START> the movie remains in the gray for far too long very little gets explained as the movie progresses with as a result lots of weird sequences that seem to have a deeper meaning but because of the way of storytelling they become only just weird and not understandable to watch it sort of forces you to watch the movie again but no way i'm going to do that it is that i watched this movie in the morning i'm sure of it that if i watched this movie in the evening i would had fallen asleep to me the movie was like a poor man's blade runner br br the movie leaves far too many questions and improbabilities it makes the movie leave a pointless and non lasting impression br br also the weird look of the movie doesn't help much the movie is halve cgi halve real life but it's not done halve as good impressive spectacular and imaginative as for instance would be the case in later movies such as sin city and 300 they even created halve of the characters of the movie by computer which seemed like a very pointless and odd choice also considering that the character animation isn't too impressive looking sure the futuristic environment is still good looking and the movie obviously wasn't cheap to make but its style over substance and in this case that really isn't a positive thing to say br br some of the lines are also absolutely horrendous and uninteresting the main god of the movie constantly says lines such as 'i'm going to do this but it's none of your concern why i want to do it' than just don't say anything at all mr horus it's irritating and a really easy thing to put in movie if you don't care to explain anything about the plot also the deeper questions and meanings of the movie gets muddled in the drivel of the movie and its script br br the actors still did their very best they seemed like they believed in the project and were sure of it that what they were making would be something special so i can't say anything negative about them br br the story and movie is far from original it rip offs from a lot of classic and semi classic mostly modern science fiction movies it perhaps is also the reason why the movie made a very redundant impression on me br br a failed and uninteresting movie experiment br br 3 10
<START> iq is a wonderfully original romantic comedy that pits the greatest and deepest thinking scientific minds of the 20th century as cupid's helpers the juxtaposition of heart and mind is the central theme of this light hearted yet thoughtful movie you don't quite know how to react because part of the time you are seeing great scientists do silly things to nurture budding love but at other times you hear them discuss some of the deepest puzzles of space time of our age the end result is a fun movie with surprises throughout walter matthau is a perfect einstein meg ryan creates a quirky scatter brained mathematician and tim robbins brings to life the contradictions of a poorly educated working man who is fascinated by science all together they create a farcical trip through love and science mind and heart
<START> the volleyball genre is strangely overlooked by most screenwriters thankfully highly acclaimed director nelson mccormick has brought us the second best volleyball movie of all time rated lower than side out and higher than well umm however don't let the cover of this movie decieve you kill shot stars up and coming star koji as a modern day sherlock holmes using such high tech gadgets as a computer that is less powerful than my gameboy koji is able to aid fbi agents in the tracking of a man who has not committed any obvious crime while there are other actors in the movie including brief cameos by denise richards a gay negro and a preposterously ugly and annoying girl koji carries this movie on his own any fan of movies such as the matrix or hackers will definitely love kill shot
<START> the godfather of television but aside from it's acclaim and mobster characters the two are nothing alike tony soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks his psychiatrist learns that tony is actually part of two families in one family he is a loving father yet not so perfect husband and in the other family he is a ruthless wiseguy after analysis dr melfi concludes that tony's problems actually derive from his mother livia who's suspected to have borderline personality disorder gandolfini is rightfully praised as the main character yet bracco and marchand aren't nearly as recognized for their equally and talented performances as the psychiatrist and mother respectively falco imperioli and dematteo are acclaimed for their brilliant supporting roles van zandt from the e street band plays his first and only role as tony's best friend and is quite convincing and latching chianese the only recurring actor to have actually appeared in a godfather film plays tony's uncle and on and off nemesis many fans also enjoyed characters played by pastore ventimiglia curatola proval pantoliano lip sciorra and buscemi tony's children are okay but not notable with the exception of iler's stunning performance in the third to last episode the second coming sirico and schirripa are unconvincing and over the top but the show is too strong for them to hold it back even as the show continues for over six season it ceases to have a dull or predictable moment br br out of four
<START> you know i went to see the hills have eyes 2 wanting to like it i really enjoyed the original and the remake was fairly entertaining they obviously had more money to throw around than wes craven did on special effects the second time around even though i still prefer the original film the remake was done well and it was kind of a guilty pleasure for me bloody intense and great special effects in short a great popcorn movie for any horror fan br br which brings us to the hills have eyes 2 man where do i start the plot or lack of one is paper thin we are not exactly breaking new ground here the military has decided to monitor the area and all of these people turn up missing so what do we do now let's send in the national guard to investigate in true hollywood fashion we need to make them the dumbest and worst soldiers ever seen gee i've never seen that premise before to make a long story short you have the mutants killing off the moron soldiers one at a time in graphic fashion once again the special effects by nicotero are great but the kills no matter how graphic become boring and predictable honestly it seemed to me that this flick was done just to grab a quick buck it was bloody and graphic but i found it predictable boring and not scary at all for me it would have been nice if this film contained one original thought wes craven and his son shared the writing duties and he has been involved with many of my favorite horror films but sadly this isn't one of them
<START> when it comes to horror movies i am more than willing to suspend disbelief ignore sub par production values and overlook plot holes in the interest of a good scare this movies simply has no good scares to offer it can't even be enjoyed as camp bad dialogue bad acting bad direction the kills were predictable and poorly staged the music was annoying the camera work was wretched even the costumes were bad i felt really bad for the actors who were obviously trying but who had to deal with terrible contrived dialogue and an obvious lack of direction i doubt they got any rehearsal either it's embarrassing to watch and so boring than making it through to the contrived surprise ending requires tremendous endurance it's quite easily one of the worst movies i've ever seen br br i don't normally write reviews but this one was so bad that i felt compelled to warn others this movie is a complete waste of time if you must watch this movie don't miss the making of featurette the writer director seems to be under the impression that making the killer a woman was kind of bold daring move seen it he and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this film as if it's a new age citizen kane it's like listening to a group of third graders take you behind the scenes of their christmas pageant they truly think they've created something of substance it's sad reallyÂ the only reason i gave this movie a 2 is because i think 1 should be reserved for true atrocities like manos hands of fate and space mutiny so american nightmare isn't the worst movie i've ever seen but i'd have to say that it's somewhere in the bottom fifty
<START> a doctor and a policeman in new orleans have only 48 hours to locate a killer infected with pneumonic plague br br an effective and classy little thriller directed by elia kazan that blends documentary realism with a race against time pulpy heartbeat set and filmed in and around new orleans panic in the streets is taken from the story quarantine some like 'em cold by edna and edward anhalt who won an oscar for original story it also boasts a fine ensemble cast that deliver top rate performances for their director in turn richard widmark bringing the method a year before marlon did for kazan in a streetcar named desire paul douglas jack palance as walter jack palance the wonderfully named zero mostel all get sweatily moody as the pursuers chase the pursued to halt the onset of a potential black death epidemic br br where the film scores its main suspense points is with kazan's astute ability to cut back and forth between the protagonists without altering the flow and mood of the piece from widmark's public health doctor with hypodermic needle in hand running around trying to locate the bad guys so he can do good to the bad guys themselves who are bemused as to why there is such a wide scale hunt for them the tension is stacked up to fever breaking point to which thankfully the final thirty minutes becomes a cracking piece of cinema with palance excelling as a nasty villain that ironically puts one in mind of widmark's own tommy udo from kiss of death three years prior br br it's an imaginative and intelligently written story one that cunningly links rats and criminals to being carriers of disease a blight on society as it were it's noirish elements such as paranoia blend nicely with its basic procedural thriller being while some memorable scenes are suitably cloaked by the stifling atmosphere that kazan has created although some of the early character psychologizing threatens to steer the film down some over talky based alleyway this definitely is a film worth staying with to the end not essential film noir and maybe not even essential kazan but certainly a highly recommended film that begs to be discovered by a new generation of film lovers and reappraised by the old guard who may have missed it back in the day 7 5 10
<START> i rented the video of the piano teacher knowing nothing about it other than what was written on the video box i did this with some trepidation because films that win awards at cannes are usually very good or very bad unfortunately this one falls in the latter category about one quarter of the way into it i found myself saying out loud this movie is boring about half way through i was saying to myself where have i seen this before at the three quarters mark i had figured it out br br in spite of its literary origins this film is essentially a remake of robert altman's much earlier 1969 and better that cold day in the park although the details obviously differ and altman's work was more plot driven and less of a character study the two films are thematically identical there is nothing new to be seen in this production every aspect of it has been done before a character spiralling out of control with increasingly self destructive behavior abel ferrara's bad lieutenant 1992 a perverse and doomed 'love' culminating in an operatic near death scene david cronenberg's m butterfly 1993 uncommonly brutal sex scenes david lynch's blue velvet 1986 and so on hence i am bemused by the fact that so many found the film to be shocking shattering etc this highly derivative film seems to have been made for the sole purpose of making viewers feel uncomfortable and clearly succeeded with some however i largely attribute such a reaction to a lack of film viewing experience see enough movies and you really will eventually have seen it all and while it is true that i saw the expurgated 'r rated' version i doubt that the additional scenes would change my overall opinion of the piano teacher br br technically the film is not without merit there is some very good camera work and the lighting is excellent isabelle huppert's creditable performance also helps save it from being a waste of time this is the first of haneke's films that i've seen and if i were to see more i expect i would have the same opinion of him that i have of ferrara an interesting director but not nearly the genius others make him out to be rating 4 10
<START> i am a huge fan of ted v mikels and the original corpse grinders is the main reason why but this is quite possibly the worst film i have ever seen even the brilliant casting of the legendary liz renay desperate living could not save this worthless piece of garbage this film should serve as a lesson to all past present and future film makers when you have a film as successful as the original corpse grinders was you should probably leave sleeping dogs lie and you should definitely not try to revitalize it over twenty years later unless you have the financial backing to pull of a superior sequel such as herschel gordon lewis did with blood feast 2 all u can eat even if you do decide to do this you should probably spend a little bit more money than you did on the original and for god's sake never film a movie onto video why do film makers even attempt to do this when everyone knows the quality is going to turn out hideous i personally have yet to see one film made in this fashion that's even worth the powder to blow it to hell if you can't afford to make a sequel that is better than your original film then sell the rights of the film to someone who can and what was ted v mikels thinking about or smoking when he wrote this god awful script i mean come on dog and cat aliens from another planet a cardboard box painted to look like a devastating machine capable of grinding up human bodies bones and clothes and all if any of these actors aside from liz renay were paid more than five dollars for their hideous performances than they are grossly overpaid avoid this film at all costs and watch the original instead
<START> so thatÂ´s what i called a bad bad film poor acting poor directing terrible writing i just canÂ´t stop laughing at some scenes because the story is meaningless donÂ´t waste your time watching this film well i must recognize it has one or two good ideas but itÂ´s sooooo badly writen
<START> according to imdb as well as to every other website that holds a review this thing doesn't have a director well that would surely explain a lot just a bunch of people that gathered together to shoot some perverted porn sequences and throw in an ultra thin storyline about devil worshiping and women sacrifices inside the walls of a secluded sanitarium hardgore is a prime example of totally demented 70's smut as it's really made with a minimum of production values and scripting inspiration horror movies about satanic cults were hugely popular during the early 70's and pornography as well so why not combine the two here we have a simplistic story about a young nymphomaniac girl who's committed to a mental asylum and from the first night already she's drawn into a network of drugs psychedelic orgies rape torture and dildo action really a lot of dildo action the friendly lesbian nurse tries to warn her but she has her throat slit even the same night the horror aspects are truly poorly elaborated going from laughably un scary satan masks to virulent severed penises attacks the photography and acting performances are almost intolerably amateurish but what do you expect from a film that features footage of sperm firing dildos and talking amputated male reproduction organs leading lady justina lynn is a rather good looking girl with a ravishing body but most of her co stars male female are hideous and excessively haired sleaze balls
<START> no movie with madeleine carroll in its cast could possibly be unwatchable that said i have to add that this british film comes close the story takes place on board the ss atlantic' and it's loosely based on the titanic's' unfinished voyage the word unsinkable' is spoken the liner strikes an iceberg and we hear a heavenly choir sing nearer my god to thee ' the doomed passengers eventually take over the anthem in a clever bit of sound work but the year of the film's release 1929 means that a modern viewer has to accept otherwise primitive sound and many of the acting conventions of silent films and the stage these aren't problems the film's major flaw is pacing and pacing had been well developed in silents however if the dialog were delivered at a realistic speed the movie's running time would be cut in half the intended effect was drama and clarity in a new medium but the result unhappily is tiresome now the film's structure is preposterously illogical and inept paradoxically i found certain details of the editing quite modern in technique fine abrupt cuts from one area of the ship to another sometimes even on sound effects although we're on board the atlantic' from the first shot we were well over 4 minutes into the movie before i discovered that fact there are long intrusive musical passages by the ship's dance orchestra entertaining easy sound personal stories are presented in an utterly uninvolving and unconvincing way don't even think of spectacle the berg is a tiny thing and the exterior damage it does to the ship's hull is a minor dent however the scenes of passengers swarming into the lifeboats clearly staged on a real liner presumably tied up to a dock generate great excitement other than the glorious miss carroll these sequences are the film's only points of excellence as the movie and the ship near their end the screen goes totally black several times when the power generators begin to fail their last eternal blackout is the end of the film with a sunset sunrise tacked on a clumsy symbolic effect atlantic' is a cinema curiosity at best br br
<START> this is a case of a bunch of people thinking they are so clever they have a story that fits the time remember the all around political conspiracies caught on camera in the years leading to the watergate and a little later most movies trying to cash in on made for tv 'o so powerful o so mind numbing' conspiracies were in fact caught in their own navel gazing attitude br br i was never a fan of the conversation which i find as much dated as others conspiracy stints of the time but coppola was true to his main character and hackman was a pretty engaging actor to observe i mean these conspiracy movies are mostly drowning in the character pool of noir heroes lots of questions unanswered lots of dis communication well this takes at least bergman to build a movie about such un visual bases br br the next man is a perfect example of its time one political soup served with an idealistic character and an horrendous conspiracy tightening its web around him neither part is interesting in itself and the whole doesn't get any better in fact you can tell how much it will be bad from the very first sequences piling up 'watcha that' murders without ever advancing any storyline pedestrian directing at its worst as most of the movie is one pompous accumulation of scenes revolving around violence naively brought under the viewer's eyes
<START> i always said that the animated batman movies were much better than the live action films br br i've seen all of the animated films but out of the bunch this is the poorest and it's rather disappointing br br mask of the phantasm would rank as the best then world's finest then sub zero then return of the joker and finally this ranks last br br in this newest animated movie there's a mysterious new batgirl in gotham and batman is intent on discovering whether she's friend or foe as she sets out on a quest for vengeance br br but as bruce gets involved with three young women he begins investigating them and discovers who is the new batgirl br br the tone in this film is unusually light considering most of the films are grim and bleak which was rather disappointing bruce acts strangely out of character most of the time the villains are re used from the last films and while the action scenes are exciting they're really nothing new it also lacks the dramatic impact the other films have especially that of sub zero which was heavy in drama and character development br br everything in the film feels pretty recycled and the supporting characters are charming but no one is actually worth rooting for br br all the while i really enjoyed this i had a blast and the identity of the new batgirl is surprising but this wasn't as exciting as i'd hoped br br half out of
