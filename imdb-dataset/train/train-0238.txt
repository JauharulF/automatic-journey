<START> he glorified himself as a great supporting actor in glory' he proved he was no malcolm in the middle' mediocre actor in malcolm x' he showed his brotherly love for acting in philadelphia' he pulled a slam dunk in he got game' he pulled no punches and rocked us like a hurricane in the hurricane' he provided us effective thespian education in training day' and now he has demonstrated that he could also direct denzel washington's directorial debut antwone fisher' is the most moving film of the year this tearjerker fish'er story is in no relation to the debacle that happened to the miami dolphins in the 4th quarter against the new england patriots in the last game of the 2002 season unlike that dolphin tragedy antwone fisher' possesses an emotional joyous conclusion the movie is based on a true story about a young naval officer who has an anger management problem due to the abhorrent he suffered as a foster child denzel plays the naval psychologist who helps antwone overcome his rage and convinces him to find his natural mother derek luke's debut performance as antwone is the best admirable acting i have seen by a novice actor in some time now i actually saw some of the detailed eccentricities in luke's acting as i have seen in washington's past performances it was like if washington was telling luke la la la luke i am your acting father' ok i will lay off the star wars jokes before my readers send me to a galaxy far far away speaking of the great denzel his work as the psychologist was masterful but what can you expect from the acting master d' himself antwone fisher' was written by no other than antwone fisher himself the emotional pathos he inserted in his storylife's screenplay was of fisher king' material i hail to the chief mr washington' in catching the right bait in antwone fisher' excellent
<START> had i been familiar with the stage production of guys and dolls before seeing the movie i might not be as fond of it as i am although in all fairness i would probably still like the film production better because of my general adoration of both brando for his acting and sinatra for his voice although he is quite the actor as well see the manchurian candidate or from here to eternity br br as for some of the other reviewers' statements about the songs i have the broadway soundtrack and though isabel bingley's voice outshines that of jean simmons it is not more pleasant i find it to have a rather shrill quality jean simmons' voice is much more realistic though admittedly that is not always a huge concern in musicals also the only time i particularly noticed marlon brando's particularly weak vocal register was during his rendition of luck be a lady and only there because i was previously familiar with sinatra's version i also find vivian blaine's voice to be much more pleasing in the movie than it is on broadway and sinatra's voice alone would be able to redeem the failings of all the others if they indeed were in need of redemption they weren't it is infinitely better than sam levene's particularly in my favorite song 'sue me' br br also the complaint that lots of songs were omitted from the movie for inferior songs i beg to differ 'a bushel and a peck' is hardly a gem and the song that replaced it 'pet me poppa and its accompanying performance is more hot box material i personally do not care for 'marry the man today' at all and rejoice that it was not included in the movie i adore 'i've never been in love before' and though it was not sung in the movie the instrumental version can be heard when nathan is in adelaide's dressing room the song 'a woman in love'expresses the same sentiment equally well and probably in a range that both of the stars could more capably reach and the movie wouldn't be the same without the song 'adelaide' not included on broadway in fact if the movie soundtrack were available for sale i'd recommend purchasing it instead of the broadway br br though i have not seen the original production i cannot imagine that the acting would be superior to that of the movie's lead actors br br the important fact is that the story is as charming as ever and the acting and songs do not make it any less so
<START> i enjoyed this show for two reasons 1 richard dean anderson 2 amanda tapping these two performers carried the show with able support from the regulars and recurring actors the replacement of rda in seasons 9 10 was enough to take the heart out of the show br br the chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous you get the feeling that the actors like to pal around after the camera stops rolling this relationship carries over into the program we get to see br br rda gives his 'o'neill' character believable personality he never knows when to give the wiseass in him a rest you watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his utterances still they know that he is the man to have around when the situation is perilous br br there is a lot going on between 'carter' and 'o'neill' under the surface they manage to keep the lid on but often just barely the episode 'solitudes' in season 1 had some of the best drama ever seen on television the love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they faced it together br br 'carter' and 'jackson' often have to smooth over some of the turbulence created by 'o'neill' yet 'o'neill's' tactical instincts always seem sound he understands what to do without having to think about the matter the team has several times been placed in jeopardy by the others not listening to his orders br br the quality declined markedly in seasons 9 and 10 the original story arc was mostly used up and the new villains never really caught my interest ben browder was far inferior to rda in carrying the show he had his rare moments with claudia black but that was all amanda tapping was phoning in her performances these two seasons you could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby she was probably thinking more about the child than the show br br the spin off 'stargate atlantis' has a few moments but is mostly a weaker effort the major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original the villains wraiths are so improbable as to be ludicrous maybe amanda tapping can breathe some life into the program or it won't last beyond the fourth season br br there has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show to have spaceships shaped as pyramids is a design monstrosity seldom equaled in sci fi the use of torches for illumination in these ships is just as bad the campy use of decor from ancient egypt concealing ultra modern technology is just as hard to accept br br i wondered about some of the continuity on the show too in the season 2 opener 'daniel jackson' is shot up and his uniform has a gaping hole where he was wounded he crawls into a sarcophagus and it heals his body and restores his uniform like it just came off the rack in the wardrobe closet the episode 'hathor' has a sarcophagus fall into the hands of the sgc yet it is never mentioned again this device could have been used in several later episodes on 'daniel' 'o'neill' and 'dr frasier'
<START> the dudes at mst3k should see this dog of a film it's basically about a dopey hack actor in hollywood who can't land any acting gigs and he has this strange obsession with the movie taxi driver so what does this dumb actor do he dyes his hair blonde and starts acting like a l a surfer dude in the naive hope this will get him acting roles you'll laugh yer head off at so many of this movie's inadvertently funny scenes like when the actor dude's girlfriend is heart broken and sobbing and saying lines like how could you do this to me and why is she crying cos he dyed his hair blonde and became a surfer dude to get acting gigs this movie makes no sense at all the actor who played the governor on benson is in this too and he plays a stereotypical right wing politician with lotsa dumb funny dialog this movie will crack you up trust me you talking' to me
<START> i'm not tired to say this is one of the best political thrillers ever made the story takes place in a fictional state but obviously it deals with the murder of kennedy a truthful and honest district attorney played by yves montand does not believe that the murder was planned and executed by the single man daslow oswald and though all other officials want to close the case he continuous to investigate with his team br br the screenplay is written tight and fast and holds the tension till the end just the part dealing with the milgram experiment about authorities is though not uninteresting a bit out of place the ending sequence explaining who icarus really is partly shot in slow motion and intensified by a morricone soundtrack is the most powerful sequence i have ever seen in a movie
<START> shakespeare behind bars was the most surprising and delightful film i've seen all year it's about a prison program somewhere in california if i recall correctly where the inmates have rehearsed and performed a different shakespeare play every year for the past 14 years the film follows their production of the tempest from casting through performance and in the process we learn some pretty amazing things about these men who are all in for the most serious of crimes truth is indeed stranger than fiction if anyone tried to adapt this story into a fiction film the audience would never buy it but knowing that it's real makes it breathtaking to watch literally i gasped out loud when i learned of one particularly gifted felon's crime it's like some loopy episode of oz and all the more entertaining because the characters and their bizarre stories are real
<START> this film is the most cult movie on metal there is premise a kid gets a hold of the final recording of his favorite artist sammy curr who recently dies in a hotel fire he plays it backwards and summons him back from the dead to get revenge in the name of heavy metal on those b tardly jocks who torment him any fan of true metal will enjoy this movie and if you are a metal head being tormented by jocks play a sammy curr album backwards no wait he is fictitious well get a hold of this movie and watch it with your fist in the air your head banging and the volume at 11
<START> saw this movie the first time while drunk at a motel in canada while flipping through channels came across the easy lube part my friend kept flipping but i told him to go back something about the name easy lube just didn't sound right watched the rest of the movie it was pretty damn funny jotted down a couple of names from the credits and got home to look it up turned out to be chevy chase's first movie i didn't remember him in it didn't remember much about it so i rented it and gave it a second veiw it's pretty funny and quite graphic it's just like kentucky fried movie except not as funny love the fingers easy lube and i'm da f kin' president parts dealers skit is pretty cool too i give it a 6 5 or 7 out of ten
<START> this was the first sequel i'd seen apart from return of jafar and i honestly thought before watching it that it would be close to the original i was horribly disappointed br br the storyline was basically the first script with a few extra characters and the situation turned around ariel and eric have a daughter melody who isn't satisfied with life on land she wants to become a mermaid however ariel has kept her past from her daughter because she wants to protect her and when melody finds out she's upset and angry and she then decides to run away and she becomes a mermaid so she's happy swimming around and ariel sets out to find her as a mermaid br br the story doesn't sound too bad written down but the clichÃ©s and repeats of situations from the first movie are just too obvious and adding the fact that melody is overall extremely annoying and the movie becomes almost unbearable br br there's also a whole load of other new characters tip and dash being two of them they aren't too bad as characters in themselves just try not to think of timon or pumbaa the songs leave a lot to be desired too they just don't have the same magical energy as the songs from the original did the animation obviously didn't have a whole load of work put into it either in parts it's jumpy and not much imagination is used for the characters movements br br another piece of advice try to forget about ariel's original character while watching this movie the beautiful rebellious curious teenager has 'all grown up' into a bland boring wife and mother and her trademark red hair is all tied up this is much better viewed if you've never seen the original you'll have nothing to compare it to br br however all in all it could have been worse it's not as bad as certain other sequels such as cinderella ii but it's not in the same league as the original but it for your collection if nothing else but if disney go on like this they'll lose all their older fans
<START> i have done quite a few reviews on imdb and this film is unique in that i never saw the entire movie it was so terribly stupid and unfunny that i just couldn't sit through it though i tried br br the biggest problem with this and any mel brooks movie i call the mel quotient in other words the better his movie the less of him you see in the film think about it the producers and young frankenstein were great films and he was barely in them at all but films like life stinks and space balls are chock full of mel and are pretty dopey movies yes i did not like space balls but this isn't the place to talk about that br br second apart from cancer rectal itch and mental retardation i can't think of a less funny topic than homelessness this is just a comedy breaker think about it folks the funniest scene in the movie has mel making whoopee with leslie ann warren in a dumpster and this is funny in what way
<START> one of the worst movies i've ever seen with robert de niro the fan is a pointless clichÃ© of an exercise in slasher flicks it tries to spin or twist the genre with preposterous plot lines of a a crazed fan turned psychotic the movie meanders into nothing spoiler we're to believe that a knife wielding idiot has access to and murders a baseball player in a lavish hotel with no witness security or cameras the movie is nonsense trying to tug at our heart strings through the hoopla of baseball ending up mockingly unsophisticated and gimmicky not sure what all the actors were thinking when they got onboard this razzie this is as big a dud as they come stay far away if you prefer thought in your movies
<START> i am a 11th grader at my high school in my current world affairs class a kid in my class had this video and suggested we watch so we did i am firm believer that we went to the moon being that my father works for nasa even though i think this movie is the biggest piece of crap i have ever watched the guy who created it has some serious balls first of all did he have to show jfk getting shot and how dare he use all those biblical quotes the only good thing about this movie is it sparks debates which is good b c in my class we have weekly debates this movie did nothing to change my mind i think he and michael moore should be working together and make another movie michael moore next movie could be called a funny thing happened on spetember 11th or a funny thing happened on the way to the white house
<START> just kidding br br seeking greener pastures in the form of hustling in new york city jon voight is young optimist cowboy almost forest gump like joe buck from texas it does not take long for the big apple to mercilessly swallow him and his ambitions whole and very soon joe is the target of both the coldness of new yorkers and cons from its street thugs given his pure heart he takes pity on one of these thugs ratso rizzo dustin hoffman and later moves in with him in his wreck of apartment and the two literally struggle to survive br br while midnight comedy is labeled as a drama it is best described as either a tragic comedy or a comedic tragedy in my opinion it is above all a beautiful film that is stylish in capturing the contemporary hippie vibe of the late 1960s with its mandatory dizzying warhol party cinematography and juxtaposing it with ultra urban new york city the film crams cowboy joe buck somewhere in between thereby emphasizing his out of place position we feel for his struggle to fit in but also to merely get enough money to feed ratso rizzo br br midnight cowboy brought tears to my eyes as it is also rich in substance and projects a lot of heart i imagine this film must have inspired both forest gump with its pure hearted and out of place lead character and to an extent the crocodile dundee films as it deals with almost the exact same kind of humour a contrast between country cowboys and slick new york cosmopolitans very compelling and sensationally creative film that i highly recommend br br 8 5 10
<START> going into this movie you know that this is movie has six lab technicians in a sealed lab with an invisible maniac so right away you're guessing who will live and who will die the survivors end up being exactly who you'd expect them to be so no points for plot twists there br br and if you're not sure if this is a b movie or a movie that just happens to take place in a lab with an engaging story william devane plays a part instant b movie status br br the movie is promising in the beginning at the lab we are introduced to the invisible gorilla who is becoming increasingly violent oooh foreboding the best scene in the whole movie is when the lab team makes the gorilla visible again great special effects same thing when they make bacon invisible br br there are a couple of bare breasts a really lame dirty joke and enough out of place swearing to give this movie an r rating that it really didn't need br br for a thriller there weren't really any surprises except when shue makes like macgyver in the freezer which is more of a 'whaaaa ' ok there is one surprise that's when caine bacon comes back one last time in the elevator shaft it was a surprise but only because you're yelling at tv 'noooo you're dead already end the movie ' speaking of yelling at the tv that's all i did for the last 25 minutes or so 'put on your f ing goggles ' instead of putting their infrared goggles on so that they can see him they try every other trick in the book fire extinguishers sprinkler systems br br the story really lost it at the end but the special effects were good that's the only reason i give it a 2 10
<START> i watched this movie on march 21 this year must say disappointment but much better than tridev plot is hackneyed tells about prabhat who lives with his father wife and his little brother the movie opens when he saves a bride anyway azghar jhurhad makes a plot to kill his young brother he makes a plan by sending few man they come to a school pretended to be prabhats friends kill that kid his father throws him out of the house then later comes back he and aakash go to kenya to find him sunny gives a good performance chunky was annoying at best naseerdun is wasted divya did good sonam was wasted jyotsna was wasted but looked cute the kid which played sunnys brother in the movie was cute too sad he had to get his character killed the girl was cute but was annoying the other kid did good alok did good kiran was adequate amrish and gulshan did good the cinematography is excellent in both india and kenya script is weak but has a few good dialogs also drags the movie the music was alright i only liked one song saat samundar the lyrics of that song was good the other songs were forgettable don't watch this rating 3 10
<START> the funky yet strictly second tier british glam rock band strange fruit breaks up at the end of the wild'n'wacky excess ridden 70's the individual band members go their separate ways and uncomfortably settle into lackluster middle age in the dull and uneventful 90's morose keyboardist stephen rea winds up penniless and down on his luck vain neurotic pretentious lead singer bill nighy tries and fails to pursue a floundering solo career paranoid drummer timothy spall resides in obscurity on a remote farm so he can avoid paying a hefty back taxes debt and surly bass player jimmy nail installs roofs for a living former loving groupie turned patient understanding long suffering manager juliet aubrey gets the group back together for an ill advised largely ineffectual and hilariously disastrous twenty years later nostalgic reunion tour of europe our lovably ragged bunch try gamely but fumblingly to reignite a flame that once burned quite brightly back in the day scraggly zonked out roadie billy connelly and cocky eager beaver young guitarist hans matheson tag along for the delightfully bumpy trouble plagued but still ultimately rewarding and enjoyable ride br br director brian gibson shows tremendously infectious respect and adoration for both his amiably screwy characters in particular and loud ringing flamboyantly overblown preening 70's rock in general this imbuing this affectionate little pip with an utterly engaging sense of big hearted charm and tireless verve the astute sharply written script by dick clement and ian la frenais likewise bristles with spot on dry wit and finely observed moments of joyous on the road inanity capturing a certain bittersweetly affecting and frequently uproarious vibe that gives the picture itself an irresistibly luminescent glow ashley rowe's lovely elegant cinematography ensures that the movie always looks quite visually sumptuous while the perfectly catchy and groovy music does the trick with right on rockin' flair and aplomb kudos also to the across the board terrific performances that vividly nail the burnt out soul and tattered but still fiercely beating heart of a past its prime has been ragtag rock outfit desperate to regain its erstwhile evanescent glory in one final bid for big time success all in all this radiant and touching gem rates highly as one of the true seriocomic sleeper treats from the 90's
<START> sometimes they get lucky and have a hit on their hands wayne's world the first one not the second but most often they have duds it's pat comes to mind rather quickly this time out it's tim meadows as the ladies man this movie falls somewhere in between a hit and a dud it was very funny for the first 20 minutes but then as usually happens with snl skits it starts to slow down before finally ending long after it should have br br tim meadows is leon phelps a radio dj with a nightly show called the ladies man he answers any and all questions dealing with sex and relationships usually in the crudest way possible everything seems to ultimately come down to the butt after pushing the buttons of the station manager leon along with his producer julie karyn parsons gets fired and needs to find another job out of the random blue comes a letter from one of his ex ladies the letter offers him wealth and luxury for the rest of his life the only problem being that the letter isn't signed so leon needs to track down all the women he's been with to find the woman of his dreams but sometimes as billy dee williams says in the film the woman of your dreams is standing right in front of you there is also a sub plot about a bunch of guys who's wives girlfriends have all slept with leon and they want to first figure out who he is by a tattoo he has on a part of his anatomy then kill him leading this bunch of guys is surprise will ferrell from snl first off i thought the sub plot was rather lame the singing and dancing stuff was just completely worthless i usually like will ferrell but here he just never clicked for me and the rest of the guys were just schlubs who tagged along and in the end all decided that having their wives girlfriends cheat on them was in fact their fault so back to the main story the story basically centers around leon and sex so what it comes down to is if you don't like the character of leon you won't like the movie his voice his mannerisms his dialogue is what carries the movie i am not a big fan of tim meadows i never thought he was a particularly good actor on snl the only thing i ever really liked of his was his ladies man skits but the best thing about those is that they usually involved the guest host remember the one with cameron diaz and they were short for about 5 minutes they were pretty funny and here for about 20 minutes it's really funny what i thought was good about the character in the movie is that he stayed in character throughout he never wavered from his wanted to just get laid persona until right at the end where there was this transformation and the ever present speech to tie things up other than that it was pretty good at keeping leon as leon and not changing him into something less crude than he was there isn't a lot of substance to this movie if you couldn't guess but like i said earlier the beginning of the movie i found to be very funny some real laugh out loud moments all revolving around sex and his crudeness the problem of course with this movie and most other snl spin offs is that these are characters that are only supposed to be shown for a few minutes at a time stretching the concept into 80 minutes is very difficult that difficulty is obviously why they needed the sub plot because without it this movie would have been a little under an hour when it was good it was good but when it wasn't good it got to be boring br br so overall the ladies man wasn't as bad as other snl films but it wasn't as good as others it had some funny moments the first 20 minutes was pretty good but the rest of it dragged on there was an unnecessary sub plot whose only purpose was to lengthen the film the bottom line is if you like tim meadows and his leon phelps character you'll be able to watch the film if he annoys you don't even bother going unless you just want to see tiffani theissen in some nice revealing clothing br br
<START> i guess there are some out there that remember nicole eggert from her little girl days on such tv shows as t j hooker charles in charge and who's the boss you perverts you maybe you remember her from baywatch when she grew up and got breast implants no matter you will certainly forget her in this supposed comedy about man eating aliens br br there are so many things that do not make sense and are never explained how did she recognize the alien why was the alien hot for paprika and cinnamon why didn't the alien eat her you get the picture br br before the alien eats her boyfriend and assumes his identity you get to see her in the body of alex meneses this mexican ukranian beauty is the only reason to watch this trash stay for the shower scene and the boyfriend and go on about your business
<START> well i don't personally like rap but i still found fear of a black hat hilarious i'm sure i didn't get some inside jokes but some i knew and it was funny enough to make me laugh just after i'd stopped laughing i'm a big fan of spinal tap so naturally i had to check this out it was deriviative from this is spinal tap sometimes blatantly but this film still stood on it's own as an original intelligent and funny satire my personal favorite back in the time of slaves they didn't have hats to protect them from the sun so at the end of the day they were too tired to revolt now we have hats
<START> astronaut steve west alex rebar and his comrades undertake a space mission that sees them flying through the rings of saturn his comrades are killed instantly but it would seem that they are in fact the lucky ones steve returns to earth a constantly oozing mass of humanoid pulp as he turns into a savage killer melting every step of the way he is tracked by his friend dr ted nelson burr debenning br br this is often so uproariously funny with enough absurd lines and situations to go around that it's hard for me to believe that the laughs are all unintentional it seems to me to be kind of a goof on low budget genre efforts from the '50's and 60's and as such it's a marvelously entertaining movie that sequence with the nurse is simply hilarious we're even treated to a split screen sequence that doesn't really add anything but is still a gas to watch br br writer director william sachs deserves credit for coming up with this ingenious idea his ultra slimy character is a memorable one indeed i think his pacing is a little off some scenes like the one with the elderly couple go on a little long but ultimately he delivers solid schlocky b movie goods with a degree of panache the climax is especially fun br br arlon obers' music is enjoyably shuddery yet also amusingly silly during some moments and willy curtis's cinematography creates some really great shots at times that brings me to rick bakers' fantastic and convincing makeup effects which form a highly respectable centerpiece for the movie right down to the ultimate final melt br br rebar is under the heavy makeup for almost the entire movie sachs also gets my praise for having the movie hit the ground running and does what he has to do well enough debenning makes for a rather oafish and silly hero and ann sweeney isn't so hot either as his wife but myron healey michael alldredge and lisle wilson are fine in support it's also worth it to see folk like cheryl rainbeaux smith doing an appreciable topless shot janus blythe of tobe hoopers' eaten alive and wes cravens' the hills have eyes and even director jonathan demme in a bit part br br this is a highly entertaining midnight movie with enough gore chills and laughs to rate it as worth catching for lovers of low grade sci fi horror everywhere br br 8 10
