<START> last year we were treated to two movies about truman capote writing the book from which this film was made capote and infamous br br i cannot imagine a movie like this being made in 1967 a stark powerful and chillingly brutal drama elevated to the status of a film classic by the masterful direction of richard brooks elmer gantry cat on a hot tin roof the professional blackboard jungle br br it is interesting that robert blake who starred in this film has had so many problems of late that may be related to his portrayal of a killer in this film br br this is a film that stays with you after viewing
<START> this movies chronicles the life and times of william castle he made a series of low budget horror films in the 1950s 1960s that he sold with gimmicks in 13 ghosts you need viewers to see the ghosts they were in color the film was in b w the tingler had theatre seats equipped with a buzzer that jolted the audience when a monster escapes into a movie theatre marabre issued a life insurance policy to all members in case they were frightened to death the movies themselves were pretty bad but the gimmicks had people rushing to see them in this doc there are interviews with directors inspired by castle actors in his movies and his daughter it also gets into his home life and the kind of man he was by all accounts he was a great guy the documentary is affectionate very funny and absolutely riveting it's very short under 90 minutes and there's never a dull moment a must see for castle fans and horror movie fans my one complaint there were very few sequences shown from his pictures that aside this is just great
<START> i remember when i first saw this short i was really laughing so hard that like with a lot of other films that i have seen no sound came out curly is really great at singing opera in this one i am surprised that he did not consider a career as a professional singer because he was really good br br if you noticed this was filmed near the end of curly's career as a stooge you could really tell he had changed because he had lost weight and was thinner his voice was deepening his face was getting lined with wrinkles though he still could pull it off he looked like he was fifty at the age of forty this was because he was suffering many minor strokes before his big one that ended his career be he still managed to pull it off in his last ones br br if you don't mind the fact that curly was really getting very ill at this point this is actually one of their funniest shorts i know that i didn't mind the fact that curly was really changing because i still thought that he was great br br 10 10
<START> shakespeare behind bars was a strangely uplifting documentary despite its content convicts at luther luckett correctional complex in lagrange kentucky who have raped murdered etcÂ and surrounded by bad people in an obviously depressing environment find something they genuinely enjoy and can become important popular and celebrated in acting there are paralleled themes to 'shawshank redemption' with their institutionalised natures and search for forgives and redemption for their past lives as we follow a generous non judgemental director who gives up his time each year to direct certain inmates in a chosen play by william shakespeare this time around the 'tempest' that was cleverly portrayed with the inmates who could relate to it so much with its penetrating focus on forgiveness and redemption in which they confide and relate to we are introduced to each actor in formal interviews that are nicely paced with break up footage of them rehearsing each actor has their own story and tell of their regrets and reasons why they are there in emotional fashion with melancholic music over each in a traditional documentary sense the strongest and most respected inmate it would seem is sammie the director appears to immediately realise who the most interesting inmates were in sammie and later hal and allows a longer more in depth observation into the man and his personality his presence is felt on screen and his personal revelations come as a shock to the audience but give him such appeal in his emotional personality and a particular empathy is felt toward him hal is the same at the beginning of the film he has other things that he does to pass the time that's shown as a comfortable hobby as it were in running an on site news broadcast programme again through personal interviews and revelations self admitted by hal and nicely shot cutaways of hal's body language not the close ups of his uncertain hand movement not only observed with him but others as well in particular his heart felt story about being unsure and scared of his true sexuality in a society that purely would not accept him as a homosexual until later on in the film where he is shown to be quite snide and rude to other inmates involved in the play as though he deems himself above all of them in particular to ron who already has a frustrating temperament in his acting the relationship between all of the inmates involved in the play is shown as one of respect and unity to achieve something great for themselves with nice if not clichÃ©d motions of time passing by with titles etcÂ everything seems to go right in the first act and then on the build up to the public performance things predictably go wrong an induction of one of the actors being transferred and his character being replaced by a younger newer inmate gives the narrative a nice subplot into someone who promises big but in the end disappoints all and does not live up to their expectation one inmate in particular big g welcomes the new inmate actor rick with an evident will to nurture him into their beloved practise and hopefully become a good role model the film seems to capture each inmates passion so well with something the audience can relate to especially when rick is put in the 'hole' for getting new tattoos something nicely hinted upon earlier in the film when the warden stops a random inmate in the yard and asks him when he got a tattoo that's on his arm and we learn it's a punishable offence in the facility and big g's disappointment is understood deeply a happy ending it all looks great when they are performing successfully even being invited to perform elsewhere and a sense of real unity echoes around them but in the end the film brings everyone back down to earth that this is short lived and everything they ever had or wanted was and will always be taken away from them it is back to prison to pay for their crimes and no matter what redemption they seek in acting these plays they won't be free men their proud performances and recognition is undermined by the fact that they are the lowest of the low criminals and a nice halt in the uplifting music that plays in a shot of a long corridor that coincides with the lights turning off and doors shutting is a powerful image of their oppression the director seemed to be aware he was watching likable people in the documentary by given additional information at the end of the film into each actors future from the end of the film about where they are and what's happening to them now
<START> there is an excellent reason edison went straight to video it would have landed in theaters with a crumbling thud the movie lasted entirely too long and was perilously boring just a notch above lowbrow thanks to freeman and spacey who obviously had a spare two weeks before their next films the bad guys are as laughable and action as near non existent as justin timberlake's acting i hate to knock the guy but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte the better br br the movie isn't all bad just mostly i like the fact that ll cool j was given what appears to be a shot at being leading man he deserves it and unlike his fellow musician and co star he can act kevin spacey is almost always enjoyable as well you can see him gulp several times as he chews the scenery and freeman has the ability to elevate this flick to three stars out of ten he's not that good br br when all is said and done the ultimate error with this movie is that it is a mundane and tiresome piece of pseudo action poppycock that fails to keep anyone awake it also fails to make anyone give a good crap about any of the characters all in all t's just plain boring that being said rent this when you are suffering from insomnia
<START> first of all the movie is an ingenious work of art movie the plot was filled with surprises a little kid pretends to be a grown up inherits one million dollars and how he spends it i mean how whacked out is this walt disney really outdid themselves this time the comedy is most of the times expected but the other times unexpected i mean was this movie ok or was this movie ok it also teaches a lot about wise youths and i this kid is really wise and a bit time smart pants but also it sucks how the heck could a guy like that kid get a hot police babe and his dad let him go free that's like let a killer get bailed free for ten years if i were to do that i'd get beaten with a 'suble jack' a huge stick that stings when used to bench your butts really hard that kid is really lucky back to the story the movie makers really knew what they were doing when they made this movie but still it's not perfect the acting was good and bad the kid and woman had no chemistry neither did the father but the bros were excellent' the special effects on the other hand was lame plus this movie isn't based on reality i hated and loved it at the same time
<START> this film takes place in the 1950s according to this the dead called zombies have arisen to eat the living however a company has developed a collar that when put around the zombies neck makes them docile and perfect servants the robinsons mom helen carrie anne moss dad bill dylan baker and son timmy k'sun ray hire a zombie because everyone on their block already has one tim names the zombie fido billy connolly and becomes friends with him but his dad hates him and timmy looses control of fido and things go wrong br br as you can see this is among many other things a takeoff on the lassie series with fido being a stand in for lassie timmy was named that for a reason every single of the famous lassie episodes are spun here my favorite is when timmy sends fido off to get help before the zombies eat him also it's a satire of those 1950s douglas sirk films where everything is bright and colorful but dark secrets are tearing people apart the characters wear very bright 1950s clothes moss is always in a dress the furnishings settings and cars especially are all 1950s in hyper bright colors even when the script becomes repetitious there's always something to look at the script is good but there are only so many lassie jokes you can make the melodramatics are kind of silly but the cast pulls it off everyone here is excellent and right on target even connolly as an emotionless zombie does a good job moss is the best playing each line for all its worth but never going overboard br br this isn't for everybody of course the satire may be lost on most people and the gore is pretty tame the gore is done so casually and with happy music playing over it it's hard to take it seriously so for some people this will really work i give it an 8
<START> i think its time for seagal to go quietly into the night what i have just seen makes all his direct to video releases in the last few years look like his early 90's smash hits in comparison br br a secret bio lab is making a new kind of drug that jacks up a human's adrenaline system to the point where they become psychopathic killers or something somehow seagal is supposed to stop the infection or its the end of the world or something seagal also went through hit squads like jellybeans every time i look up he was commanding a new face so it kinda got hard to follow character development as well i know steven's athsma prevent him from yelling at the top of his lungs but even so why is he constantly being dubbed by people who sound nothing like him usually the films plot and action sequences can save it from being a total waste of time but this was not even close like i said it was more of a horror movie with a lot of blood and shank stabbing rather than straight up fighting the problem was it wasn't really scary and seagal looked completely out of place because the infected people were supposed to have speed of light movement yet the 40 year old 280 lb seagal killed them all singlehandedly i guess the lone highlight of the movie was the first 20 minutes where the new recruits ask seagal to come to the strip club with them br br 2 out of 10
<START> this is the first out of the guinea pig series and is one of the more infamous films out of the collection br br it took me a long time to finally man up and get my hands on a copy of this notorious group of films i bought the guinea pig box set and decided to watch the collection in order by release date so i popped this sucker in and sat down br br from what i had read on the internet and realizing the content involved in this film i was expecting to test my nerves in full force this ended up not being the case br br the film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and begin torturing her with the hopes of discovering the human breaking point and how long a human can tolerate pain br br sounds like one sick flick right wrong the film fails to shock this may be because i have become desensitized over the years do to my obsession with horror but i think it is safe to say that any true gorehound could sit through this with ease br br on the other hand an individual who does not have a well knowledge of this type of film will most likely be overwhelmed and disgusted by the images they see on the screen though it failed to shock me the film contains some pretty mean spirited and graphic scenes of violence including the ripping out of fingernails intestines thrown at an unconscious woman and a needle through the eye br br overall i think for majority of the gorehounds on this board that you should just get your hands on a copy of this film for the novelty of it but i suggest that for any new comers to these type of films that you should work your way up to this one
<START> i thought this film was just about perfect the descriptions summaries you'll read about this movie don't do it justice the plot just does not sound very interesting but it is just rent it and you will not be sorry
<START> cassandra peterson originally created elvira as the television hostess of late night horror films and when the character proved unexpectedly popular she suddenly found herself doing everything from beer commercials to spots on the tonight show with johnny carson she reached the peak of her popularity in the late 1980s and the film elvira mistress of the dark was the result br br the plot is flyweight television horror film hostess elvira dreams of success in las vegas when her great aunt dies she travels to new england in hopes that the estate will provide enough money to back a stage show she is disappointed to find she has inherited a rundown house a poodle and an old book it happens that the town is puritanical beyond all description and she provokes righteous indignation everywhere she goes it also happens that her great uncle is secretly an evil warlock and very intent on laying hands on the old book throw in a few teenagers a stud muffin and a hateful woman with falsies and there you go br br no one would accuse it of being a cinematic masterpiece and it does drag now and then but cassandra peterson demonstrates tremendous flair from start to finish squirmy sexy and mixing lowbrow humor with flashes of sharp comedy she dances through the film like a ringmaster in a circus of corny and often self mocking jokes from a flashdance disaster to witchcraft craziness she is never less than wildly entertaining it's a tremendous amount of fun and the film's conclusion even manages to generate considerable suspense will elvira best her evil uncle and save the day well i don't want to give anything away so let's just say you'll have a lot of fun finding out br br dvd quality is okay and there's little in the way of bonus material but if you're in the mood for something silly this one is sure to answer the urge and if you've never seen tassle twirling you're in for a treat recommended br br gft amazon reviewer
<START> released on dvd in the uk as axe the choke is a teen slasher that fails in pretty much every department the story is almost non existent resulting in a film which comprises mostly of people wandering around a dark building with the exception of two characters who are quite obviously destined to be the film's survivors everyone is thoroughly objectionable meaning that the viewer couldn't care less when they get slaughtered the deaths aren't gory enough unless a brief shot of a pound of minced beef covered in fake blood turns your stomach and the gratuitous sex scene features next to no nudity an unforgivable mistake to make in a slasher flick br br the wafer thin plot sees members of a punk band locked inside what appears to be the world's largest nightclub there are endless abandoned corridors and rooms unlike any club i've ever seen where they are picked off by an unseen assailant for a low budget effort the production values are okay and the cast are all seem to be fairly capable actors but with not nearly enough genuine scares a reluctance to get really messy this is a slasher so where's the graphic splatter way too much dreadful dialogue particularly from the not dead soon enough drummer and some ill advised use of tacky video techniques in an attempt to add some style the movie quickly becomes extremely boring
<START> the worlds largest inside joke the world's largest most exclusive inside joke br br emulating the brash and 'everyman' humor of office space this film drives the appeal of this film into the ground by making the humor such that it would only be properly appreciated by legal secretaries writing books the audience is asked to assume the unfamiliar role of a legal secretary and then empathize with the excruciatingly dumb protagonist br br the entire film is centered on the legal secretary finding free time listening to music and writing a novel while working these are his goals you can't imagine the slap in the face it is to the audience when around halfway through they find out he has had a job which fit all three of those criteria but then gives it up the director and screenwriter jacob kornbluth and josh kornbluth completely remove the audience's motivation to empathize or even find entertaining a protagonist that has previously thrown away that which he is complaining about the lack thereof br br apart from that major stumbling block the legal secretary insider humor fails because they must be explained explicitly to the audience each time they happen without these asides the audience wouldn't have noticed anything particularly strange humor is only effective if it doesn't need to be thoroughly explained to the audience what is funny
<START> rex reed once said of a movie julia and julia to be specific that it looked like it was shot through pomegranate juice i was reminded of that as i snored through purple butterfly this one appeared to be shot through gauze br br the story was boring and it was not helped that for large portions of scenes actors' faces were literally out of focus or would only come into focus after extended periods of time br br also everyone looked the same so it was hard to distinguish among the characters i call this the dead poets society syndrome br br there was nobody to care about nobody to become interested in dramatically and the movie shed no historical light on a very interesting period of time and set of circumstances br br a total disappointment
<START> after watching many of the next action star reality tv eps tivo taped this gawd awful tripe for me for some bizarre reason and i only have myself to blame i watched the whole thing hoping that there would be something unique in the entire movie after so much hype about joel silver's midas touch with action flicks he might want to make sure he bones up on his alchemy br br first the only redeeming value of the entire film was billy zane and even he couldn't lift the slipshod writing out of the crapper having said that zane's performance falters about 2 3rds of the way through as he doesn't even seem to know what else to do other than look smug br br can't blame him here though the writing quite frankly sucked let's take ideas from rat race enemy of the state terminator midnight run and any bad gambling film you can think of and simply rehash it and who's brilliant idea was it to have two bridge chase sequences in a row br br sean carrigan the man of the hour of the next action star shows all of the strengths and weaknesses the casting directors mention during the entire run of the series a one note johnny sean plays the dumb good looking jock very well but struggles with shouldering the weight of the film quite frankly we never quite seem to care about whether he lives or dies by about mid way through as carrigan fails to provide a reason for the audience to even like him his dumb but lucky routine gets old as there really isn't anything about the character to root for br br but carrigan is a dream compared to the wooden rigid corinne van ryck de groot did howard fine really tell her to pretend to be a terminator for the first half of the film i don't think so i kept expecting her to quote arnie her character performance can be compared only to the dramatic depths of freddy got fingered though not nearly as well developed the camera loves her in dark shadowy limousines but in the harsh light of day her demeanor sucks all energy off the screen jeanne bauer showed more natural life in her five minute bit part than corinne showed at any part of her screen time br br ultimately sean has the rugged good looks to provide a good lead in an ensemble cast but shouldn't have been left to do this one solo it was simply too big of a task for him next action star colleague jared elliot may or may not have had better luck with some more dynamic characterization but it's hard to tell given jeff welch's lame script someone should take welch's imac away from him before he hurts himself or anyone else and finally van ryck de groot simply was outclassed and way out of her reach even for complete shlock like this br br joel silver should be ashamed
<START> there are a lot of highly talented filmmakers actors in germany now none of them are associated with this movie br br why in the world do producers actually invest money in something like this this you could have made 10 good films with the budget of this garbage it's not entertaining to have seven grown men running around as dwarfs pretending to be funny what is funny though is that the film's producer who happens to be the oldest guy of the bunch is playing the youngest dwarf br br the film is filled with moments that scream for captions saying you're supposed to laugh now it's hard to believe that this crap's supposed to be a comedy br br many people actually stood up and left the cinema 30 minutes into the movie i should have done the same instead of wasting my time br br pain
<START> following the success of the awful gilligan's island tv movie reruns a number of tv movies were made in the 1980's reuniting casts from classic shows most of these movies completely missed the boat as far as recapturing the humor that made the shows so special the munsters revenge is among the most disappointing because it goes for a laurel and hardy type comedy style that really wasn't in the original series yvonne de carlo a wonderful comedienne and essential to the series is completely wasted she has less time here in this 90 minute movie than she did in any single 30 minute episode and since the roles of eddie and marilyn in this movie are nothing more than cameos what was the point of making them younger and recasting them with very little rewriting they could have used butch patrick and pat priest although seeing some of the munsters spooky relatives was a nice touch i didn't enjoy sid caesar as the hammy mad scientist mainly because there's too much of him and not enough of the underused munsters ironically that very year 1981 caesar's old partner in comedy imogene coca was also inappropriately cast in a major part in a tv movie reunion return of the beverly hillbillies another strange inexplicable bit at the beginning of the film has the munster family represented as wax figures at a local horror wax museum why would they be in there when they are supposed to be a typical if strange american family not famous monsters this was the last munsters project featuring the original cast in their roles there was an awful revival of the series in the late 1980's with a completely new cast and a 1990's tv movie which featured decarlo lewis priest and patrick in cameo roles as a family dining
<START> someone should tell goldie hawn that her career as a teen age gamin ended thirty years ago br br this is one of the worst films released in years an unequivocal disaster in which the two leads give themselves over to a frenetic exposition of their trademark tics in an effort to make up for a bad script and bad directing this thing should have been smothered at birth br br i hope john cleese got paid a lot for having his name attached to this disaster he is the only performer who came through this stinking mess more or less unscathed his only fault being a failure to realize that the rest of the cast would sink the picture
<START> i really enjoyed this episode which was a great surprise given the bad reputation it seems to have acquired from a pure writing perspective 'the 16mm shrine' is an absolute treat with fantastic dialogue and character analysis typical of sterling in particular i really enjoyed the philosophical indulgences of the episode tackling themes of existence and reality whilst balancing it with more psychological topics such as denial pride and desire 'the sixteen millimeter shrine' is an episode about how these ideas based around an unwillingness to accept change can seemingly alienate a person from the rest of the ever changing world it is also a fantastic example of cerebral twilight zone one that explores the mind rather than the world outside it these elements all come together very nicely to create a thought provoking and incredibly interesting 25 minutes br br the episode is not without its faults however which mainly lay in lupino and leisen shoes ironically i felt lupino was unconvincing throughout with only a few scenes that could count as memorable this of course being an absolute shame considering how well sterling had written her character furthermore leisen didn't seem to know what to do with most of his characters sometimes having them stand around on set doing next to nothing which probably explains why accepted the poor performances from lupino half the time thankfully balsam does a good job of covering up a lot of weak spots helping redeem the show from an acting perspective at least br br as i said previously however if you're a fan of classic film and cerebral science fiction this shouldn't be as bad as it's sometimes made out to be in addition to the writing that i mentioned above the episode also features some fantastic photography it still amazes me that the show looks this good nearly fifty years later and decent enough set design overall 'the sixteen millimeter shrine is a great episode and above all is certainly one to make you think
<START> anyone who thinks anime is nothing but sex and violence will be silenced forever after watching this movie this is a fine movie that tells about tetsuro's quest to avenge his mother's death but also grows up in the process the journey on the train sort of represents tetsuro's journey from boyhood to manhood the music and visual styles of the movie are a bit dated you can tell it's a 70's movie and the animation is only slightly better than your average star blazers episode but the story and the characters are so strong it really doesn't matter a must see for any animation fan
