<START> broken bow takes us back to where it all began set 150 years in our future and 100 years before kirk spock and mccoy this installment of the star trek franchise is in my opinion the first series since tos to recapture the feelings of wonder danger and excitement of going where no man has gone before scott bakula is perfectly cast as jonathan archer the first captain of the first star ship enterprise he and the entire cast truly show a true reverence for the star trek legacy john billingsley is brilliant as the alien dr phlox and jolene blalock is totally luscious as the tempting but logical vulcan science officer t'pol broken bow is in my opinion the best premier episode of any of the treks and i believe gene roddenberry would surely be proud
<START> when i first saw this film on cable it instantly became one of my favorite movies i'm a big fan of james earl jones and robert duvall the movie paints an accurate picture of the south and the racist attitudes most of the attitudes came from soll an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor soll is what makes the move his funny ramblings give us insights in to the way the south was back then i suppose that if soll lived today he would be diagnosed with alzheimer's disease none the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is complex while he has racist views he's grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black the two convicts he trusts most are jackson mel winkler and ben james earl jones the conversations between ben and soll are the best in the movie they have real chemistry james earl jones and mel winkler both but in great performances as well as hass br br this movie should have gotten more notoriety however it's on dvd and worth the money br br rayvyn
<START> this movie was excellent it details the struggle between a committed detective against the dedicated ignorance of the corrupted communist regime in russia during the 80's i give this movie high marks for it's no holds barred look into the birth and development of forensic investigation in a globally isolated thanks to the regime community this is a graphic movie it presents an unsensationalized picture of violence and it's tragic remains nothing is candy coated with overdone blood or gore to separate us from the cruel reality on the screen this movie is based on russian serial killer andrei chikatilo i'm familiar enough with the true story to have a very deep appreciation for how real they kept the film it's not a comedy but for those who appreciate dry and dark humor this movie is a must see
<START> the case of the scorpion's tail has all the elements that are necessary in order to make an effective giallo movie the story is standard giallo when a man dies in a plane crash his wife ida galli collects a 1 million life insurance policy the widow heads to greece for the payout but a series of gruesome murders follow her there are plenty of suspects including a tenacious investigator george hilton from the insurance agency and the widow's lover director martino keeps the story moving at a fast pace while the viewer tries to guess the identity of the killer anita strindberg also memorable in your vice is a locked room and only i have the key and who saw her die is a stunning looking heroine it's one of martino's best films
<START> how hard is it to write a watchable film with vince vaughn paul giamatti and kevin spacey apparently very difficult for the writers here br br i still have no idea how santa is younger and looks 20 years older than vince who plays the big brother i must have missed that part of the story but in reality it really didn't matter many scenes seemed out of place and contrived the kind of funny notion scenes that are drug out way too far to where any sense of comedy is lost br br the director producer tried to go tear jerker at the end which would have been suitable if anything leading up that point had been worth following br br ugh major disappointment i can see how some people might enjoy this ok since many people will take any garbage they're fed but i would strongly encourage waiting for dvd on this one not worth the 23 978 it takes to get your family to the movies these days
<START> okay that was a pretty damn good episode much better than the credit it receives br br the camera work is splendid best yet i love that final shot the atmosphere is fantastic the costumes are great and the guest cast minus the helpless victims is strong br br what i don't like about this episode is that many things that are left unexplained why does it change sex what's the purpose and they're aliens what kind why were they never shown again in the later mythology br br i'm giving this episode a high three stars one of my favorites yet but the plot holes bother me still not gonna let it ruin my entertainment
<START> actually my vote is a 7 5 anyway the movie was good it has those funny parts that make it deserve to see it don't misunderstand me is not the funniest movie of the world and its not even original because its a idea that we have seen before in other movies but this one has its own taste a friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends i think that not exactly but who cares also there is another movie that show us almost the same topic chris rock appears in it the name is down to earth men that one its a very funny movie see both if you want and i know that you will agree that mr rock won with his movie i would liked that the protagonist male character were given to ashton kutcher however the film is good
<START> im proud to say i've seen all three fast and furious films sure the plots are kinda silly and they might be a little cheesy but i love them car chases and all the beautiful cars and the clandestine midnight races and ill gladly see a fourth one br br wanna know what the difference is between those three and redline decent acting somewhat thought out plot even if they are potboilers and last but not least directors who have a clue all three were made by very competent directors all of them took the films in a different direction equally exciting redline looks like the producer picked out a dozen women he slept with on the casting couch and made them the extras then picked up his leads from hollywood's unemployment line and the script yikes its mystery science theatre 3000 bad this is 70's made for tv movie bad br br yeah the movie had a few cool cars but you don't really get to see that many in action and the action is directed so poorly you cant get excited by the chases and if the cars aren't thrilling you why go to a movie like this br br im in the audience with a bunch of teenagers and i cant stop laughing out loud im getting dirty looks but this was just a debacle br br rent the f f movies go to nascar race go to a karting track and race yourself whatever you do avoid redline like bad cheese
<START> i appreciate the need to hire unknowns for these kind of 'horror' movies but they should at least hire some proper actors the sergeant especially is guilty of using his monotone to bulldozer every single line he has but let's face it the lines aren't really important there isn't really a recognisable plot so most of the writing involves the words f k s t m f r and other assorted bad language in place of proper dialogue br br the 'story' as it is is mostly made up of seemingly random gore and death with a couple of cringe worthy 'surprises' which happen around 10 minutes after you see exactly what's going to happen not only this but there are several glaring plot holes and continuity errors why are they going in there didn't he have a weapon wasn't he dead so it makes the whole film seem as if it has been cut down by the several hours it would take to fix them br br another film which simply relies on blood and gore instead of any real cinematic experience
<START> how did this ever come into existence i generally love sci f bigfoot whatever films etc but i still expect them to be written without quite so much cheese as this the effects were sad the lines were sadder avoid at all costs i only ended up renting it because it was in the wrong case i was looking for the sasquatch film with lance henrikson in it still haven't seen that one the idea of the film is actually a good one there was a lot of potential to make a great little movie here i just don't understand how something like this ends up like this go speak to the film arts english interested students in any high school and you'll find people who can write a better script
<START> what i liked best in this film is that like the films of hitchcock it is a thriller that does not take itself too seriously br br hitchcock understood that people go the the movies to have a good time something that hollywood seems to have forgotten in recent years this is a thriller but it has plenty of laughs and always has one eye winking at the camera br br rachel mcadams is wonderful as always cillian murphy is creepier than he was in batman begins in the old days there were guys who always played the bad guy we don't see much of that these days because i suspect the hollywood agents consider it a bad career move but cillian murphy is really good at being bad br br the directing is surprising stylish the story is good but the dialog could have used some sprucing up br br red eye is a really fun film and people were applauding when the closing credits started rolling if you are in the mood for an enjoyable escapist thriller red eye might be your ticket
<START> this is your typical priyadarshan movie a bunch of loony characters out on some silly mission his signature climax has the entire cast of the film coming together and fighting each other in some crazy moshpit over hidden money whether it is a winning lottery ticket in malamaal weekly black money in hera pheri kodokoo in phir hera pheri etc etc the director is becoming ridiculously predictable don't get me wrong as clich√É¬©d and preposterous his movies may be i usually end up enjoying the comedy however in most his previous movies there has actually been some good humor hungama and hera pheri being noteworthy ones now the hilarity of his films is fading as he is using the same formula over and over again br br songs are good tanushree datta looks awesome rajpal yadav is irritating and tusshar is not a whole lot better kunal khemu is ok and sharman joshi is the best
<START> vincente minnelli directed some of the most celebrated entertainments in cinema history he was among the first hollywood directors to show that a profound love of color motion and music might produce intelligent entertainment br br 'american in paris' is the story of an ex gi who remains in france after the war to study and paint he falls in love with a charming gamine lise bourvier their romantic love affair sparkles as brightly as the city of lights itself the whole movie brings a touch of french elegance where technique artistic style and music all come together in perfect synchronism br br the first musical sequence introduces the exciting personality of leslie caron in her screen debut she is like a diamond a touch of class george guetary describes his fianc√É¬©e ambiguous grace in a montage of different dance styles sweet and shy vivacious and modern graceful and awesome the number leads to an unpretentious bistro where kelly and his very good friends in paris share a gentle parody of viennese waltzes later kelly celebrates a popular tap dancing with a crowd of enthusiastic children singing with him 'i got rhythm ' and at the massive jazz nightclub kelly spots the girl of his dreams he is instantly hit by her sparkling sapphire blue eyes and only one clear thing is in his mind to pull lize onto the dance floor and sing to her it's very clear our love is here to stay br br to the joyful 'tra la la ' kelly provides humor wit and talent all around oscar levant's room and even on the top of his brown piano br br when he meets his pretty cinderella along the seine river kelly is swept away by his happy meeting with caron he expresses all his emotions with 'our love is here to stay ' the piece had a definite nighttime feel as the two lovers were bathed in soft blue smoky light they start an enchanting dance duet juxtaposing differing elements caron dances with her head on his shoulder then tries to run away in a fluid way they move backward away from each other then pause to rush toward each other for a little kiss and a warm hug br br the film's weakest numbers were those that bear little relation to the story in one georges guetary performs an entertaining stage show with showgirls in giant ornaments floating down to the stage in another oscar levant imagines himself conducting a concert and playing not only a piano recital but the other instruments as well he even applauds to himself as members of the audience br br the extravagant climactic super ballet of the film is quite an adventure a breakthrough in taste direction and design it is a blaze of love fury and vividness it is kelly's major fantasy of his lost love and of his feeling about paris as viewed through the huge backdrops of some of france's most impressionist painters br br the number starts at the beaux arts ball after kelly finds himself separated from lise and begins a sketch with a black crayon it gathers the important parts of the film's story through a constantly changing locations all in the style of the painters who have influenced jerry the tour richly attractive and superbly atmospheric includes the place de la concorde fountain the madeleine flower market the place de l'op√É¬©ra to his rendez vous at montmartre with the cancan dancers in a representation of lautrec's moulin rouge br br kelly seems to defy the boundaries of his physical self caron seems to dominate her space and sweeps you away to another time and place br br nina foch appeared very attractive and elegant in her one shouldered white gown in one of the film's most famous lines kelly asks her 'that's quite a dress you almost have on what holds it up nina cleverly replies modesty br br 'an american in paris' garnered six oscars including an honorary award to gene kelly the film gave us a wealth of memories to take home
<START> first off the lead brad dourif is a kook if you're trying to take this movie seriously then i guarantee he's going to ruin it for you if you don't take him too seriously then he's actually kind of fun to watch as with another reviewer i loved the scene where lisa cynthia bain and dourif are declaring their love for each other in between dodging the jets of flame shooting out of his arm in the car another great campy scene was watching john landis as a snotty radio show producer getting toasted and flailing around the room in fact i found the last 15 minutes of the movie to be a non stop laugh riot i'm just not sure if tobe hooper meant it to be that way
<START> clint tollinger arrives in a small town looking for his estranged wife and news of his daughter tho he finds her the chance of any sort of reconciliation is very slim whilst here the sheriff and the important townsfolk learn of tollinger's reputation as a pistol specialist town tamer as they are living in fear of a mysterious landowner who is stripping the town from them bit by bit they hold a meeting that chooses to hire tollinger to rid the town of it's unsavoury elements br br man with the gun seems to be either a forgotten piece or a vastly under seen one at the time of me writing this it has just over 200 votes and a paltry 9 user comments written for it it's a shame on either score because although the production values scream out that this is a b movie western this is a fine entry in the western genre that the piece takes on a rather standard plot theme of an harangued town turning to an avenging dark angel probably hasn't done the film any favours over the years i myself read the synopsis and thought it's just another in the line of similarly themed pictures yet i was pleasantly surprised to find a darkly dramatic picture boasting many enjoyable moments both technically and as a functioning story br br robert mitchum is in the lead as tollinger perfectly cast he strides thru the picture like some brooding menace we often talk about the screen presence that john wayne and charlton heston had justifiably of course mitchum is right up there with the best of them one sequence here sees him standing in the shadows at the back of a room as a meeting takes place we don't see his face but we can feel that piercing brood staring out at us the rest of the cast are also very much in mitchum's shadow so really it's solely with the big man that the films acting credentials are high perhaps it's unfair to single out ted de corsia for a kick but man with the gun's minor failings are with its villains and sadly de corsia is lacking any sort of villainesque menace the score from alex north is excellently layered fans of spartacus will certainly be pricking their ears up and the cinematography from lee garmes is highly impressive when one realises that the majority of this picture was shot on the studio lot directed and co written by first time director richard wilson man with the gun holds few surprises for the genre but it's dark in tone violent and above all else highly watchable 7 5 10
<START> this film is a complete re imagining of romeo and juliet in tel aviv and nablus the lovers are one from tel aviv et the other from nablus there is a border between them and a constant state of war with the israeli army ever present everywhere and the palestinian militants everywhere else with their bombs the situation is bleak enough we can imagine love in that enormous loveless trap but the film goes several light years further by imagining the two lovers are gay noam from tel aviv and ashraf from nablus to be gay is accepted in tel aviv it is off limits in nablus the conflict between the two peoples the two communities is thus doubled with a conflict between two cultures two ethics but this could even be livable if the war did not bring some extra dimension ashraf's sister is going to get married to a militant activist in nablus ashraf finally tells his sister about his being gay she cannot accept it but accepts to speak about it later from the wedding itself the newly married husband sends a commando into tel aviv to set up a bomb attack it takes place in a caf√É¬© in tel aviv and one friend of noam's is severely wounded bad enough the isareli army sends a commando to nablus to arrest the person responsible for this attack but it turns sour and the newly married wife is shot dead in the street the funeral follows the wedding the husband and widower volunteers for a suicide bomb attack ashraf volunteers to take his place the exiled lover comes back to tel aviv to die and kill a few people to avenge his sister he arrives at a diner managed by some friends of noam's but noam sees him and gets out to speak to him ashraf has moved back to the middle of the street and he detonates his bomb when noam reaches him in the street the vengeance reunites the two lovers in death we thus have the dual conflict but we do not have the prince of verona a neutral character that can impose peace or even worse the prince seems to have chosen sides and to be on the side of israel the game is entirely false and death is sure on both sides but the dimension of impossible love is all the stronger because it is redoubled by a play in the film a play that shows love in auschwitz between two prisoners one wearing a yellow star and the other a pink triangle this is both strikingly strong and breathtakingly shocking gay love in auschwitz what comes out of the film is that over there in tel aviv or nablus love is impossible the film is thus a denunciation of the conflict in palestine that cannot but continue though it has no reason to even exist though it has thousands of reasons to go on we should never have let great britain deal with the region a long time ago today we have to find a solution in which no one will be humiliated this will only be able to succeed if everyone comes together in order to find a lasting solution but so far everyone is trying to avoid that general confrontation and discussion preferring bilateral manipulations so suffering will go on and love will be forbidden of course not sex since children are needed for the war to go on so let's procreate more and more little soldiers but love is just an extra terrestrial concept br br dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne
<START> well awful is just the first name this movie is a clich√É¬© ridden piece of junk a high school comedy setup in a military training camp i'm sorry i had to give this 1 star which it did not deserve br br this may contain spoilers br br just about everything is totally forced unconvincing and unrealistic the hepo military police will not come to get you if you don't make your appearance especially not on your wedding day the actors were pretty embarrassed during this scene because the scene didn't work as it was so highly unlikely you can sense it in their voices even if they were not such bad actors they wouldn't have been able to save the scene br br next the guy has to exercise in his wedding suit no there was no time to get him an uniform first man this is great cinematography i will remember this scene for the rest of my life br br there are also girls in the camp exciting one of'em even a model though not looking that great and the baddest actress i've ever seen i doubt in hollywood they would let her say a single line in a b movie br br okay girls in the military now this is getting fun the girls are even placed on the same floor so we can sneak to their room at night in reality they would be placed in a different building a quarter mile away separated by two fences with barbed wire br br there are tanks available we can use for a fun ride in our spare time of which we have plenty no the tanks are not locked and the ignition keys are inserted no one will notice the engine sounds especially not at night br br there is a bunch of sex scenes and references and all are below the waste line we need those so the sexually obsessed germans will like the movie as well switzerland is too small a market for any feature film well done br br one sex scene takes place in the kitchen surely none of those facilities are ever locked the military routines are as sloppy as they can get br br in the end of the brainless flick the mafia hit men are about the take revenge on the poor guy trying to shoot him because he deserted his fianc√É¬©e sure i buy that the italians are that way a jealous bunch not br br the bad guys attempt to do this in open daylight with two dozen eyewitnesses not at night in a dark alley again military training grounds where there is shooting with live ammo are open to the public anyone can freely drive or walk in there there are no such things as guards or fences br br the deed however is prevented by the good captain timely launching a rocket into the italians' car the explosion knocks the hit men and the enraged fianc√É¬©e off their feet no one in 40 feet distance is hurt when the car is blown to smithereens it's a comedy remember br br okay it's a comedy i got that and i can live with that no realism needed filmmakers can easily get way with this if it is hilariously side splitting funny or entertaining interesting challenging unfortunately it is none of those it's just embarrassing a rip off from brainless american comedies the latter are at least done professionally with no amateur actors br br it is pretty boring and predictable a waste of time and energy especially to those sitting through the entire movie as i unfortunately did yawn
<START> i have yesterday seen the second part and i must say it was actually better then the first one at the begin i realized it is actually a sequel not a remake but not a good one i do not like the old movies and series of galactica because the cylons saw like toasters just as it was mentioned in this new movie and were completely harmless for the old galactica this movie turns the sides the humans were harmless but the whole movie was for me completely chaotic and stupid many scenes were unnecessary for instance the story of the computer expert completely a crap if i were a scriptwriter i would leave him die in his house killed by the cylon woman and the evacuation from the planet oh please if it would be bombed by 50 megatons why exactly 50 mt nukes they would be dead killed by the radiation and how is it actually possible that the big fleet of cylon was completely hidden before the attack aha it was possibly this computer virus created by the cylon the script was probably written by ten years old school boy the good side of the movie is that the humans are at last defeated really defeated the population is near the extinction children are dieing two times explicit in the movie 1 a baby maybe one month old and a girl in age of max ten what a violence and the bad asses won and i think it is the first time in such sci fi galaxy fight movie i also appreciate the design of the cylons not only of the humanoid cylon a good job with these ships i like the design of the ships by both of them human an cylons the human ships are a good never version of the old ones and galactica really pretty with these docks i liked that but this is all only the design is not enough the acting was really bad the whole plot was expectable only two things not the human cylon on the ragnardocks and the human cylon at the end the dialogs were trivial and in the slovak dabbing just stupid but that is not fault of the movie the whole movie looked like a pilot film for a series but who would shoot such series what it would be about one star for the design the second one for the near extinction of humanity
<START> well of course not women are overly sensitive and needy on average which is interestingly portrayed from mother to whore though not pseudo artistically extravagantly or blatantly dwelt on unlike many of you i have only seen la maman et la putain twice as many good films i noticed my opinion of it improved after a second viewing all that i know is what i have seen and have yet to delve into further exploits until i myself have acquired the dvd i have yet to figure out precisely why i enjoy this movie so much but really what do i care why though i'm sure i could and will form some wonderful explanation all right so you may disagree perhaps it is a bit boring at times i'm not an expert the blonde reminds me of a lovely grushenka
<START> i thought this movie was hysterical i have watched it many times and recommend it highly mel brooks was excellent the cast was fantastic i don't understand how this movie gets a 2 out of 5 rating i loved it i have seen other movies of his and they were also funny but this one really stick out in my mind because of the humor his i just can't say enough about this movie i look for it to be on periodically but it never on enough for me the people playing the homeless people were by comparison up to the funniest standards also please put this movie on more often i can't see it enough leslie ann warren also was another favorite of mine ever since cinderella i always thought that she wasn't really funny but loved her acting in this movie she was very funny and her and mel did a great job together they should put more of his movies on tv
