<START> i really liked the first 2 seasons because a lot of good characters disappeared later on like most shows are kinda slow at first then get better in later seasons but this is the absolute reverse jenny from the 1st season and valarie from the 2nd season were sabrina's friends i really didn't care for the others jenny and valarie were her coolest friends i think for some reason the producers wanted us to not like her college friends for some reason they were so cruel to sabrina but my favorite episode from season 1 is cat showdown and my favorite episode from season 2 is witch trash that is the funniest episode i also thought it was funny how libby was popular but she was always jealous of sabrina and never seemed to have a real boyfriend but was always wanting to be with harvey i just wished they could have made more better ones i also liked how the first 2 seasons during the opening credits sabrina would say a few words while wearing a costume like in the pilot episode where she's in the witch costume i liked how she said this is so not me and later on she kept trying to change herself to something else is what i think but this is a really cool show it is kinda like the andy griffith show in a way because it good at first but once it turned color and barney fife left it was longer good but i still like to watch it but the only reason i watch later seasons is because of sabrina what i meant about the opening sequence is the opening titles of seasons 1 3 shows sabrina in front of a mirror posing with several different costumes and outfits as the cast members' names quickly flash on the bottom of the screen at the end sabrina would say some sort of pun that related to the outfit she is wearing then disappear the opening sequence of season four includes the characters in bubbles the opening credits of seasons 5 7 features sabrina at various locations around boston
<START> great cgi effects a truly oscar worthy performance by gary sinise as lt dan br br tom hanks is a one trick pony in this movie how he got the best actor oscar that year over morgan freeman was a crime br br this movie is a pandering treacly love letter to the baby boom generation with a barely concealed right wing prejudice beginning from forrest's service in vietnam all the way through to the resolution with jenny at the end br br with that said though it is hugely entertaining and an american movie through and through i found certain parts of this film exceedingly offensive zemeckis dumbs down this movie almost to the level of gump himself maybe that was the point he was trying to make br br watch this film and ask yourself what is robert zemeckis saying about what makes a good american br br forrest seems to have made the right choices and been at the right place at the right time for the last 45 years those who are wrong according to the director's vision seem to pay a heavy price so is zemeckis saying that idiocy disguised as innocence and naivety is a patriotic even american quality
<START> i have seen a lot of movies this is the first one i ever walked out of the theater on don't even bother renting it this is about as boring a soap opera as one can see at least you don't have to pay to watch a soap opera though
<START> this wasn't all that great not terrible or hateful or anything just forgettable br br it had a sort of um hesitant diluted air like it never properly knew whether it wanted to go for laughs or for sweetness or for satire so we were left with weak mix of the three the actors seemed kinda lost br br also the ideas were really tired and recycled almost zombified themselves how many more times do we have to be told the 50's in the states were infected with a banal sense of conformity and that this was perpetuated by aggressive consumerism and that emotional repression in men is a baaaaad thing old hat br br its biggest crime in my eyes though was just how detached from reality it was i know it was a comedy and all but especially in a full movie where you must keep the interest of an audience for a prolonged period you still need some sort of emotional anchor some relatable guide through the story to make it engaging for the 'hero' kid to watch an old woman two fellow school pupils and ultimately his father die painfully at the hands of zombies or whatever and for him to greet it all with a cheery smile and a shrug of the shoulders then i just struggle to deal with that in any sort of positive way the mum was the same if you make your two main characters so inhuman on that level then you risk losing me and that's what happened br br biggest positive i can offer is that i love the look of that sort of apple pie suburbia and this captured it well enough it was a handsome film especially some of those wide angled shots of the street and inside the robinsons' house also the opening newsreel was cute in a been done before but still funny sort of way br br and i thought billy connolly was ok and that comes from someone who isn't a big fan of billy connolly movie star i just had this fear he was going to be hamming it up and trying to steal every scene but he played it pretty low key for him and probably came out the most sympathetic character in the whole film br br all in all not great though
<START> perhaps the biggest waste of production time money and the space on the video store shelf if someone suggests you see this movie run screaming in the other direction unless of course you're into self abuse
<START> this movie was a great disappointment for me i had been waiting for this movie to come out for years and i was a faithful follower of chaos comics until they went bankrupt not only did they cut out half the story line but they altered information the statement that lucifer is hope's father is untrue he did corrupt her father but he himself is not her father the voices also did not suit the characters and once you hear the voice of a beloved character the voice you heard in your mind can never be returned i can not even remember everything about this film that was wrong the bottom line is if you love lady death do not watch this movie it just did not do the comic justice at all
<START> this was the first movie i ever saw ashley judd in and the first film of victor nunez' that i ever say and boy am i glad i did its' quiet tone its' relaxed pace its' realistic depiction of a young woman just starting out in life its' fine depiction of the struggles she has to go through to make her mark in life the decisions she makes based on real things the people she meets there is nothing wrong with this movie it is as close to movie magic as i have ever seen outside of the star wars movies and given what those films are like that means this film deserves a high rating indeed ashley judds' acting mr nunez'writing and its' great simple worthwhile story make this a fine coming of age story and a wonderful movie
<START> great mystery but the film goes down hill from there the beginning is promising with a car wreck and a woman and her daughter being burned alive in front of a police officer edward he is traumatized over this and is seen popping pills a mysterious letter turns up from an old girlfriend asking for help in finding her missing daughter so ed travels to an island commune of mainly woman they don't like outsiders a lot of filler is with ed shown looking around town for the girl that made the movie too long it finally gets a little better toward the end when we learn of the crazy rituals the woman perform and finally of the sinister plan in store for edward br br overall not a well written story and too long br br final verdict i would skip this
<START> the pilot is extremely well done it lays out how the characters bond in future episodes i don't think anyone could have created a better pilot for this show it displays remarkable creativity on the writers part although not everything was straightened out because it was the very first episode a lot of events that happen in future seasons were demonstrated in the pilot an example would be ross and rachels future relationship even though the nervousness of a first episode appeared it was overcome by an amazing plot and outstanding cast choice br br bravo br br a great start to an unbeatable comedy
<START> just finished watching this movie for maybe the 7th or 8th time picked it up one night previously viewed at blockbuster and absolutely loved it i've shown it to 4 people so far and they have enjoyed it as well avoid of all the hollywood glamour special effects and stress on the shock factor this independent film by paul f ryan hits the nail on the head in dealing with the after affects of traumatic situations taking place after a high school shooting two characters alicia busy philipps and deanna erika christensen form an unlikely bond alicia the girl with the stone heart the goth who has a pessimistic attitude to life assists deanna to overcome the issues of life and death and living in the aftermath meanwhile deanna attempts to help alicia to see some of the softness and light in the world again not stressing on the shocking event of the shooting but on the interpersonal relationships amongst those who survived it sets this movie apart despite its low budget and short filming time this movie is far from cheesy ryan pays respect to a situation he has never endured and attempts to delve into the human psyche with an amazing up and coming actress philipps adds the necessary dramatics to the dialogue and overall feel for the film and christensen helps to balance out the doom and gloom feeling this movie may have overall i recommend this movie and if you enjoy the topic of school aggression and violence and learning more about it i also suggest the documentary it's a girls world put out by cbc in 2004 which deals with the topic of social bullying comparing and contrasting two groups of girls one in montreal quebec and the other in victoria british columbia the group of friends and acquaintances of dawn marie wellesley a 14 year old girl who killed herself after being brutally bullied
<START> but the trouble of this production is that it's very far from a good musical br br granted one can't always expect the witty masters like sondheim or bernstein or porter yet the music of this piece makes even andrew lloyd webber look witty it's deadly dull and uninventive with one or two exceptions and just after i watched it i couldn't recall a single significant melody which is rather tragic coming from someone who learned the whole another hundred people from three listenings br br it is also strangely un theatrical it takes place on an incredibly large stage one really has to feel sorry for those people in front rows who broke their necks in order to see something happening 50 meters on the right or 100 meters on the left and does absolutely nothing with it when there's supposed to be one person singing on stage that's just what you get and the rest of the enormeous stage is empty for me as an aspiring theatre director it was almost painful to watch br br the fact remains cole porter seems to have captured the french culture in his works better than these no talents can ever come close to and i'm puzzled by the popularity of this would be legendary musical
<START> some kids are hiking in the mountains and one of them goes into a large tunnel and discovers some old mummified gladiator he puts on the gladiator's helmet and spends the rest of the movie killing all the other hikers br br this thing is just so utterly senseless it's maddening here's a short list of things that don't make any sense br br 1 a guy and a girl are in their tent and they think they hear something outside the guy goes out to investigate and finds another hiker outside then he hears his girlfriend scream so they head back to the tent arriving the next morning he was only 50 feet away br br 2 these two dunderheads then hear another girl scream what 100 feet away but don't investigate because they're afraid they'll get lost br br 3 another guy and a girl are walking around and in about their 10th scene together the girl informs the guy that due to the circumstances protocol no longer requires him to address her as professor i mean what the first off that's just a really stupid thing to say secondly he never called her professor in the first nine scenes they were in together br br 4 a wounded girl attacks demonicus and he stops her telling her that part of his gladiator training taught him how to wound without killing um yeah we kinda noticed she's wounded and not dead because she's up and walking around but thanks for that tidbit of information br br 5 one girl is tied up in demonicus' lair and when someone attempts to free her she instead instructs this person to go and get help um look idiot if she set you free which would take about 5 seconds there would be no need to get help br br and it just goes on and on the whole middle part of the movie is spent with the two idiots getting lost in the woods then they fight then they pitch a tent and ignore the screams of their friends then they wander around some more it's just so damned boring and pointless that i turned the dvd off halfway through br br none of these characters are sympathetic especially the ones that get the majority of the screen time demonicus himself made me laugh out loud every time i saw him he looks like a kid in a halloween costume scrunching his face up to look evil he runs or should i say scampers around like he's gay the special effects are comedic the acting is for the most part awful and nothing makes any sense br br overall maybe this concept could have produced an enjoyably campy film if they put some more time and effort into it getting rid of the ludicrous dialogue creating characters with actual likable personalities having some sort of logical flow to the action and maybe even making demonicus a female character in a sexy gladiator outfit but no instead we get this senseless pile of nonsense that will bore you to death
<START> this time we get a psycho toy maker named joe petto get it who makes living evil toys that kill people he goes after the family who has the bad luck of just simply living in the same house where he and his mutant robot son pino again get it used to live br br easily the worst and hopefully presumably the last in this semi series this one and the previous one look like soft core porn movies but without the sex and nudity it's kind of like a low rent hybrid of halloween iii puppet master dolls and bad home movies supposedly in 2000 they started to do a sixth chapter in the series but it was abandoned and never completed we can all only hope that it stays that way br br 1 2 a star out of br br
<START> when the employees of a theater find an old reel of film they decide to show it at the midnight screening of night of the living dead assuming it's an old preview reel unfortunately it's actually an old nazi mind control experiment that turns the audience into a horde of mindless shuffling zombies br br i can't understand the hate for this movie it is a low budget independent production with a lot of camp but it doesn't deserve a 1 1 here on imdb it is just so much fun it is obvious that the filmmakers have a reasonable knowledge and love of old horror movies and they have created an entertaining tribute to them sprinkled with references and homages to a variety of them it has the feel of such things as night of the living dead in many ways very similar evil dead 2 and army of darkness and various others br br i liked the explanation of how the zombies though really just hypnotized into thinking they are zombies actually come to have the physical attributes of the living dead unbelievable perhaps but i appreciate the effort by the writers to explain it the gore effects were decent for the budget the acting was all right and the story was entertaining br br i liked it
<START> distortion is a disturbing haunting film about life imitating art and art reflecting life haim bouzaglo the director of the film plays the role of haim bouzaglo artistically blocked and sexually impotent playwright who finds inspiration in his suspicions about the subject of his girl friend's documentary as an arab suicide bomber disguised in skullcap and american t shirt wanders through the landscape in search of his target and his nerves haim transcribes his girl friend's life as she films her documentary and incorporates himself and his actors' lives during rehearsals but the bomber has already struck and haim has left the restaurant just minutes earlier despite the manipulation of time and space the story is crystal clear comprehensive and absorbing a brilliant commentary on the distortion of everyday israeli life where the political is intertwined with the personal where everyone lives on the edge and people never know whether they are playing leading roles in their own lives or are merely dispensable bit players in someone else's dramatic narrative br br bouzaglo plays with this notion of everyone being an actor in someone else's production brilliantly we are always voyeurs seeing what the fictional director sees illicitly but also what the real director chooses to reveal to remind us that these glimpses are violations of privacy bouzaglo takes us into the bathroom and the bedroom sometimes the bedroom is the street and rooftop and repeatedly frames his views within tv video or security screens actors play the role of actors who represent the real characters played by actors of course each of the actors is the star of his or her own production only dimly aware of their diminished roles in their fellow actor's personal films the detective hired by the playwright becomes a character in the play the actor hired to play the role of the detective seeks out the detective for tips on how to play the role is caught by the detective on surveillance tapes and they attend a cast party as their real selves br br despite this multiplicity of views there is no mistaking the clear lines of this narrative the playwright searches for subject matter the bomber seeks a target and the detective stalks the filmmaker nor is there any difficulty locating bouzaglo's ultimate targetÂenervated and impotent israel fully conscious of the threatening peril but incapable of meaningful action israel is bouzaglo the impotent fictional playwright cannibalizing his own life for his play israel is also the bankrupt soldier entrepreneur who is the subject of the filmmaker's documentary the cheating actors and actresses and the cuckolded husband they are all israel because they are all helpless caught in inaction or aimless action as the bomber scans the landscape for his best target all the characters can do as another bombing is reported is have sex and keep score of victims br br there is personal triumph vindication perhaps revenge at the end of this play within a story within a film but viewers will be left aching for the state of israel even as they are filled with admiration for bouzaglo's memorable rendition of a nation's plight within the telling of an individual's story
<START> the invisible man is a show everybody s gotta love it reminds me of the old school 80's series a team airwolf knightrider the special effects are small but very effective but what is most important is the fun they had shooting this series it really shows the entire cast fit perfect in there roles and it looks like they can do whatever they want especially paul ben victor and vincent ventresca ventresca really shines in this one for me its unbelievable that an actor with so much sarcasm is his acting style doesn't get a shot in a big movie mr tarantino this was the show you should have directed instead of that major boring grave danger c s i get this show if you can well worth it
<START> mobile suit gundam wing is the fourth series in the continuing gundam chronicles unlike the previous entries which focused on massive wars this one is a little different instead of having an army vs army situation this one is led by five teenage boys due to their ability to blend in more readily than normal adults and their machines called gundams because of the metal alloy used in their construction which leads to problems since gundams are supposed to be destroyed replaced by mobile suits which are piloted less destructive weapon platforms and dolls which are ran on a i and are used as grunt infantry br br the whole point of the series is a metaphysical question that gives gundam wing an edge over a greater portion of the anime that makes it's way here especially since most anime is adapted from popular magazines such as naruto dragonball one piece dragonball z and inuyasha which are all from shonen jump which is now available in america br br mobile suit gundam wing sets itself apart from most anime in the fact that instead of over the top battles between mortals who more resemble gods gundam is very humanistic and seems to revel in the fact that it is dramatic instead of melodramatic and events seem to unfold across the series gracefully normally in anime there are more than few series that think that the best way to go about having a small battle is to have it take a half hour something that would never happen in real life gundam tops this by making sure that everyone knows that characters will die machines will be destroyed and rebuilt battles will be lost and won and it never seems as though it makes the actions themselves satirical br br but the magic of gundam wing is in the details and what this series has that more anime would be grateful for having emotion instead of mythic prophecies magic or overblown martial arts gundam wing is hard line science fiction from a country that hates hard line science fiction note the author would like to state that neon genesis evangelion is not hard line plausible in real life science fiction due to the religious subject matter that is the core of its series they love star wars but hate a i the movie henceforth why gundam wing was and gundam seed is now in production for both japanese and u s releases at the same time with two voice teams american audiences only have to wait two or three weeks after the end of the japanese season to catch the dubbed or subtitled versions or even the edited seed episodes that air on cartoon network br br the emotion is that these two sides that are fighting a war are technically backwards the heroes are those who defend the rights of the more wealthy and aristocratic citizens of earth from the band of terrorists bent on victory at any and all costs that make up the protagonists of mobile suit gundam wing this is not war this is total war every person every building every street is a target for attack both on earth and off br br my only complaint and the reason it didn't get the score of ten is that at about three fourths of the way through it just kind of goes dead for a few episodes and no one really seems to change kind of like a present time flashback which is fine due to what it reveals about the characters but at the same time it drags down what should be the brewing between project meteor and oz but the final two episodes and the overplayed on cartoon network back in 2001 2003 mobile suit gundam wing endless waltz movie more than make up for the slack
<START> my roommate got the no no nanette soundtrack as a dub on a tape and she proceeded to listen to it non stop after it finally totally brainwashed me into submission i found the songs to be irresistible especially the famous i want to be happy but i can't be happy but of coarse from the soundtrack i had no idea what the film was about so the other day i saw a copy of it at the video store and i rented what was supposed to be a long lost version of the film i was thinking that it was going to be amazing because the soundtrack is so cute unfortunately most of the songs that i loved were nowhere to be found in the video i saw now i've never seen the 1930 version of the musical but this version was sadly disappointing because there was very little singing and practically no dancing and beside that the sound was really bad through out and you couldn't really understand what people were saying a lot of the time really the only highlights of this film were the outrageous 1940's fashion nanette wears this crazy hat with two feathers that stick out like rabbit ears and kansas kitty has this bizarre feather muff that she keeps on her fore arm and then has herself wrapped in this net scarf the one dance sequence is a little weird too with nanette doing this weird ballet stuff with pin up girl imagery superimposed on top of her actually one more bright spot of the film was the artist guillespe who dreams of being a fine artist but it currently condemned to drawing pin up girls for money i like how guillespe keeps it old school and disses nanette when his masterpiece the piece that was to make his career is sold by nanette for a paltry 5250 doesn't she realize that that piece was his immortality silly rabbit girl with your feather rabbit ears on your hat when will you learn why doesn't he just pencil in a cigarette before the ad men take the work away
<START> a great bugs bunny cartoon from the earlier years has bugs as a performer in an window display at a local department store after he's done for the day the manager comes in to tell him that he'll be transferring soon bugs is happy to oblige into he figures out that the new job is in taxidermy and that taxidermy has to do with stuffing animals animals like say a certain rabbit this causes a battle of wits between the rascally rabbit and his now former employer i found this short to be delightful and definitely one of the better ones of the early 1940's it still remains as funny nearly 60 years later this animated short can be seen on disc 1 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 2 br br my grade a
<START> i like fulci films i really do and not in some boring ironic way either but i recognise that they appear hopelessly inept and garbled to lots of people br br conquest is where fulci tries his hand at the epic fantasy genre and doesn't really succeed structurally it's like most fulci films you've seen some stuff happens some more stuff happens and occasionally one scene might be tangentially related to another really it's like conan with no sets no script no real actors yes arnold scharzenfartz is hardly an actor either no budget stupid looking dog soldiers and a bunch of gore br br this one was a hard one to get through and i could've lived without the inch of vaseline smeared on the camera to give it that hair metal music video look
