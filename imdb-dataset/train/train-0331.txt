<START> while i watched this movie i tried to figure out why they bothered making it though the main plot of the movie is potentially good there are all sorts of unrelated unnecessary subplots the marketing people in hollywood must have dictated the multiple bad guys perpetual double crosses and the man and woman who get too close and have sex it's odd that we see more of them having sex than we did of the president and his mistress the many plots and subplots make the film too broad and none of the characters are properly developed i really didn't feel like i knew any character except that everyone is corrupt and evil the ending is totally incomplete it left me more than just wanting what might have been but what was supposed to be in the end there is really no explanation of why anyone does what they do except to serve as additional corrupt characters who commit a double cross i'm surprised that so many established and good actors agreed to make such a hollow movie this seemed like a movie made by college students who are working on their 2nd or 3rd project br br don't waste your time unless you are in a film class and want an example of what not to do when making a movie
<START> i wouldn't call it awful but nothing at all shines in this movie and it is encumbered with some seriously unbelievable basic plot development it starts out well but once the main hit is done it devolves into a long subplot around a young girl which is not compelling and some action scenes which are theatre of the absurd unrealistic for example there is a prolonged shootout at the airport in which the lighting is all stroboscopic no explanation for that how credible is it that a airport storage area is going to have lights that flash on and off confusingly and just enough to let snipes do his incredible escape schtick this is one of far too few action scenes punctuated by pointlessly drawn out set ups that just fails to draw one into suspending belief br br in addition the whole premise seems to be that the united states cia team can shoot the place up but get away with it by saying national security to the brits this gimmick relies on a stereotype that is to far afield from reality to be satisfying br br there are a lot better action movies out there better formulated better executed this one is entertaining at times but there is just not enough meat on the bone and after a while it becomes downright boring something that should never happen in a good action movie
<START> a woman's nightmares fuel her fear of being buried alive the cheating husband wants her dead and decides to make good use of her phobia by sticking her in a coffin and leaving her in the basement of course b horror movie queen brinke stevens transforms into hideous ghostly creature the only reason to see this amateurish junk flick is michael berryman in a really small cameo and two sex scenes with delia sheppard and the last twenty minutes of brinke's bloody rampage are quite fun to watch the special effects for example laughable decapitated head are truly awful better watch scalps or alien dead again of course i ain't expecting classy entertainment from fred olen ray but haunting fear is too dull to be enjoyable
<START> if you are the sort of person looking for a realistic film or one with a strong and believable plot then this film is not for you nope you'll hate it however for those who like sweet slightly screwball comedies then you'll have a nice time watching this slight film br br tony randall works for the irs and he investigates a very nice farmer who never realized he needed to file an income tax return however hard he tries to convince them of the seriousness of his visit everyone in the family is thrilled to have company they dote on him and treat him like one of the family and have plans on getting him hitched to their daughter debbie reynolds that's really about all the plot there is but the film gets high marks for a fun script and decent acting a really nice little curio from the late 1950s
<START> sometime in 1998 saban had acquired the rights to produce a brand new ninja turtles live action series naturally being a fan of the tmnt back in the day this obviously peaked my interest so when i started watching the show to say i was disappointed by the end result is an understatement some time later more like recently i got a chance to revisit the series br br first off let's talk about some of the positives they managed to re create the turtles' lair as it was last seen in the movies fairly well given the limited budget they threw in with this there tends to be this darker atmosphere overall in terms of the sets and whatnot and the turtle suits while not the greatest piece of puppetry and whatnot were functional and seemed pretty sturdy for most of the action stuff that would follow in the series br br people tend to complain about getting rid of shredder quickly and replacing him with these original villains who could have easily been used in a power rangers show but you can only have shredder get beat so many times before it gets boring and undermines his worth as a villain and besides most fans don't realize or don't remember or just plain ignore the fact that in the original comic the shredder was offed in the very first issue never mind the countless resurrections that would follow so on a personal standpoint i was sort of glad they got rid of shredder because then the anticipation would build to the point where they would eventually bring him back in a later episode i find that shredder in small quantities work best because then his encounters with the turtles are all the more memorable br br unfortunately they end up replacing him with these original villains who as stated seemed more fit for a power rangers show than a ninja turtles show and with these new magic wielding generics comes a new female magic wielding turtle the infamous venus de milo i'll be honest i never got comfortable with her i'm not against the idea of a female turtle i'm just against the idea of one who uses magic and thus sticks out like a sore sight among a clan of ninja turtles who seem somewhat out of their domain i almost get the impression that this could have easily been the venus de milo show dealing with her make believe enemies and the tmnt are just there to provide the star power or whatever was left considering the timeframe this was released fortunately they all share the spotlight together br br next mutation was canned after a season on the air and the creators were more than happy to ignore it given time and maybe another season i really believe this live iteration of the tmnt could have been something and might have gotten a chance at greatness but while the idea was sound the execution was flawed although there are a couple good episodes in this series as it stands next mutation is one of those oddities in turtledom that is best left buried and forgotten
<START> evidently lots of people really like this but i found it infantilising and reasonably offensive codswallop saved from oblivion by jane russell and a couple of memorable musical numbers especially the opener but there's a marked dip in invention later on i don't get on with monroe she's supposed to be playing a dumb blonde who ain't that dumb but she just comes over as dumb russell can't quite convince when she claims never to have been in a gymnasium but is otherwise rather wonderful the men are staggeringly uninteresting as is the plot by no means atrocious but so patchy that if this is a classic god help us all
<START> a great film the acting from the doctor to the pavement artist to the head prostitute with very few exceptions was wonderful i thought soni razdan mrs noble and vrajesh hirjee saurabh were the best of the lesser known actors even kurush deboo tehmul who might be accused of overacting presented quite a believable and familiar character br br another great thing was the camera work and the way it captured the energy of bombay streets the tranquility of gustad saying his prayers and life within the tiny apartments br br i liked the story of the wall that becomes a shrine and then gets broken down and the artists philosophical take on it br br it's great to see good movies on indian themes
<START> with a title like attack of the killer tomatoes anyone going into this thing would be expecting either a a bad science fiction movie or b a comedy making fun of bad science fiction movies it's supposed to be a mix of both with a dose of parody splashed in unfortunately it falls flat very soon br br you're never supposed to take this movie seriously i realize that but you're supposed to think it's funny right i found only a few of the jokes or situations were funny i e the side by side phone conversations the russian olympic spy eating steroid cereal superman walking by lois etc attack of the killer tomatoes strives to be a cult classic but it doesn't make it a cult classic is a movie that is so different that only a select group of people understand it or a similar description attack of the killer tomatoes could be enjoyed by any 8 year old with a bad sense of humor so therefore it does not qualify as a cult film br br there is one good actress in the entire thing sharon taylor as lois fairchild she is a thin gawky reporter but has an endearing personality loves to overact and is a natural comedienne unfortunately she is put to bad use here br br attack of the killer tomatoes is not as funny as say amazon women on the moon or kentucky fried movie but it does have a few hilarious moments so i would still recommend seeing it once avoid the director's cut it has interruptions by the producer of the movie and some supposedly lost footage dubbed in a pretend african dialect it can be found in english on the out of print tape
<START> how many of us wish that we could throw away social and cultural obligations and be free most of us i suspect shall we dance is not a movie about dancing it is about learning about ourselves recognising what we are looking for in life and having the courage to go in search of it mr sugiyama is a middle aged member of a japanese society where ballroom dancing is viewed as unsuitable behaviour br br one day mr sugiyama sees a beautiful girl leaning out of the window of a dancing acadamy he is fascinated by her and eventually signs up for dancing lessons he is ashamed of his dancing and afraid of ridicule he hides the fact that he is attending dancing classes from his colleagues and family br br there is a hilarious scene in the mensroom at the office when sugiyama and watanabe a workmate who also dances are interrupted practising some dance steps there are many other funny and warm hearted scenes br br the ending is not a fairytale but it leaves the viewer feeling good br br this movie helped me to understand the japanese people a little better it is a warm and very worthwhile film to see
<START> i thought this movie was lol funny it's a fun not to be taken seriously movie about one man's twisted views on life love and well ladies from the lowly bus station skank to the high class dÃ©butante bus station skank tim meadows plays a guy leon phelps who was raised by in a playboy style mansion by a hugh hefner esquire father figure surrounded constantly by beautiful porn models and actresses when his father kicks him out on the street he must learn to fend for himself with nothing but the chauvinistic outlook on life that his youth has taught him that and an unfathomable nearly mystical level of charm and dumb luck and so the hijinx begin if you haven't seen this movie and you enjoy a light hearted semi mindless comedy love story then i highly recommend renting the ladies' man
<START> i don't believe there has ever been a more evil or wicked television program to air in the united states as the 700 club they are today's equivalent to the ku klux klan of the 20th century their hatred of all that is good and sweet and human and pure is beyond all ability to understand their daily constant attacks upon millions and millions of americans as well as billions of humans the world over who don't happen to share their bigoted cruel monstrous and utterly insane view of humanity is beyond anything television has ever seen the lies they spout and the ridiculous lies they try to pass off as truth such as the idea of life after death or god or sin or the devil is so preposterous that they actually seem mentally ill so lost are they in their fantasy sane people know that religion is a drug and shouldn't let themselves get addicted to that type of fantasy however the 700 club is in a class by itself they are truly a cult while i believe in freedom of speech they way they spread hatred lies disinformation and such fantastic ideas is beyond all limits i hope that one day the american psychiatric association will finally take up the study of those people who delude themselves in this way people who let themselves sink so deeply into the fantasy land of religion that they no longer have any real concept of reality at all treatment for such afflicted individuals is sorely needed in this country as so many people have completely lost their minds to the fantasy of religion the 700 club though is even more horrible as it rises to the legal definition of 'cult' but due to the 700 club's vast wealth conned daily from the millions of americans locked in their deceitful grip they are above the law in this country for those of you who have seen the movie the matrix you know that movie was a metaphor for religion on earth the evil ones who are at the top of each of the religions who drain the ones they have trapped and cruelly abuse for their own selfish purposes and those millions who are held in a death sleep and slowly being drained of their life force represent those many people who belong to religions and who have lost all ability to perceive what is really going on around them br br in less civil times the good townsfolk would have run such monsters as those associated with the 700 club out of town with torches and pitchforks but in today's world where people have lost all choice in their choices of television that is presented to them we have no way to rid ourselves of the 700 club plague br br the television ratings system and the v chip on tv's should also have a rating called r for religion so that rational people and concerned parents could easily screen such vile intellectual and brutal emotional rape such as presented by the 700 club every day all over our country from themselves and their children
<START> in arlington heights il we never had a cafeteria in any of the elementary schools 1961 so i rode my bike home from school for lunch and always watched this game true i was 11 but i thought it was the greatest thing on i'd draw hidden pictures on my blackboard and see if my family or friends could find it i also remember winning wonderful cars pontiac or oldsmobile if the contestant got the final hidden picture game i even had the home version br br i wonder why this game lasted so briefly i enjoyed the music and the hidden pictures the only one i could ever get was the lemon hidden as part of a bridge over a garden stream br br really good memories are connected with camouflage
<START> it is only robert de niro film which i really hates it is stupid film with horrible acting of course not de niro for me brian de palma must do his mafia films as always like scarface 1983 or the untouchables 1987 i also loved de palma's mission impossible 1996 de niro worked with palma two different times too greetings and the wedding party i though that the wedding party was ok too i didn't watch greetings br br screenplay is really bad and unfunny there are no any scene where i can smile for even one time film lost a chance to be a funny style even a little bit in a be black baby scene and also i don't like the scene where a guy's sexual organ appeared so it is one of the worst film i have ever seen just worst i hate that
<START> excellent pirate entertainment it has all the good ingredients to keep one's attention an absorbing tale of intrigue a fiery lady pirate named spitfire stevens maureen o'hara who's attracted to the irresistible mr hawke errol flynn who is out on a secret mission of his own they make a fine romantic pair onscreen sigh br br anthony quinn is the mean bad pirate weaving his villainous web of divide and conquer i noticed the very familiar face of mildred natwick playing a supporting role as mrs macgregor the protector of young princess patma alice kelley br br there is beautifully filmed scenery of shorelines ships and the bay lots of action too of sword fighting clashes ship battles daring leaps of errol flynn robin hood on board ship from the flaming redhead herself i once heard in an interview of maureen o'hara that she boasted great command of the bullwhip and could also outdo flynn in sword fighting in those days but there'd be no need to put it to the test here br br very enjoyable movie
<START> dead husbands is a somewhat silly comedy about a bunch of wives conspiring to bump off each others husbands it s by no means embarrassingly bad like some comedies i could mention but it never fufils its potential imagine how good this could have been if we had the farrelly brothers directing ben stiller in the role of carter elson br br oh is carter based on jerry springer just curious because the catch phrase on dr elson s show is look after each other and keep talking
<START> after two long long opening skits one of which my brother saw the conclusion coming of and the other totally joke free we start the fast forward fest that it groove tube proper naturally uber stupid frat boys who still mainline jackass or tom green will find the idea of fecal matter coming out of the some tube sex olympics i really don't need to give you details do i and a clown who basically does the not very endearing clown bit i think i've seen approxiately ninety times now will eat this up like dung beetles well more power to you br br i just want to express that despite what you've heard this movie was in no way a model for the many infinitely funnier movies like kentucky fried movie or what not the skit movie had already been done in and now for something completely different everything you always wanted to know about sex and so on and done way better
<START> i really enjoyed the 60's not being of that generation i'm waiting for the 80's it was interesting to see a unique four hour capsule for that era br br one major problem in the movie however was how unbalanced the film was in the portrayal of the families according to promos i saw for the movie on nbc the story was basically about two families struggling with issues in 1960's america now i may have missed something but i think we learned more about the white family than the african american family br br i really think that the 60's uses music to describe the scenes better than any dialogue that could come out of the mouths of the actors all of which are very talented this is very visible at the end of the first part about two hours in of the mini series br br very good movie
<START> this is an absolutely charming film one of my favourite romantic comedies it's extremely humorous and the cast is wonderful though laurence olivier is mostly associated with his shakespearean work he shows in this film that he is by no means restricted to play only classical theatre he manages the transition from the cynical divorce solicitor who tries to avoid women and their traitorous ways to the lovesick puppy that falls for lady x played by merle oberon effortlessly the dialogue is wonderfully witty and refreshing and the atmosphere enchanting ralph richardson was a delight to watch as well i highly recommend it
<START> only a handful of the segments are engaging here a segment with a garage attendant from nigeria is heartbreaking one with fanny ardent bob hoskins makes its point twist by twist until the final shot overplays things br br the problem with this movie is that only a few of the clips invoke paris the others are so scatter shot in theme tone volition production that you may as well be watching the years best commercials 2006 it's really all over the place it doesn't develop over it's running time and nothing reigns the directors in no construct successfully joins the pieces tedium sets in i'm at the one hour twenty minute point and elijah wood is in some dumb over commercial overproduced vampire shtick it has about as much to do with paris as old ladies knitting in the antartic fantasy shows up i think first in the coen brothers segment uh thanks j e for ruining another movie and then makes way too many appearances the point of being in paris is that you don't need make believe crap to make your days extraordinary why divide it by neighborhood if quartier de la madeleine is equated with vampires for some loser director has there ever been a genre more over represented than the vampire film every three years we get the same lame vampire clichÃ©s br br making things worse is that the switch from segment to segment is pretty artless the transitions get lost this doesn't feel intentional it feels sloppy
<START> forbidden siren is based upon the siren 2 playstation 2 so many 2s game like most video game turned movies i would say the majority don't translate into a different medium really well and that goes for this one too painfully br br there's a pretty long prologue which explains and sets the premise for the story and the mysterious island on which a writer leo morimoto and his children daughter yuki yui ichikawa and son hideo jun nishiyama come to move into the villagers don't look all too friendly and soon enough sound advice is given about the siren on the island to stay indoors once the siren starts wailing br br naturally and slowly things start to go bump and our siblings go on a mission beating around the bush to discover exactly what is happening on this unfriendly island with its strange inhabitants but in truth you will not bother with what's going on as folklore and fairy tales get thrown in to convolute the plot even more what was really pushing it into the realm of bad comedy are its unwittingly ill placed out of the norm moments which just drew pitiful giggles at its sheer stupidity until it's explained much later it's one thing trying to come up and present something smart but another thing doing it convincingly and with loopholes covered br br despite it clocking in under 90 minutes i think it's a horror movie phenomenon to have that as a runtime benchmark it gives that almost two hour feel with its slow buildup to tell what it wants to things begin to pick up toward the last 20 minutes but it's a classic case of too little too late br br what saves the movie is how it changes tack and its revelation at the end again this is a common device used to try and elevate a seemingly simple horror movie into something a little bit extra in the hope of wowing an audience it turned out rather satisfactorily but leaves a bad aftertaste as you'll feel cheated somewhat there are two ways a twist will make you feel it either elevates the movie to a memorable level or provides you with that hokey feeling unfortunately forbidden siren belonged more to the latter br br the saving grace will be its cinematography with its use of light shadows and mirrors but i will be that explicit it's still not worth the time so better to avoid this
