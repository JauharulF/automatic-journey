<START> this is one of those films that explore the culture clash of eastern born people in westernized cultures br br loving on tokyo time is a sad film about the inability of opposites to attract due to major cultural differences ken rock n'roll fanatic marries kyoto a japanese girl so that she can stay in the united states when her visa expires the marriage is only expected to be temporary that is until kyoto gains legal status again but ken who seems to be lost in every relationship takes a liking to kyoto and tries very hard to make things work out this despite his friend's urging that dumping kyoto and getting rid of all commitments to girls is bad for rock n' roll except to inspire some song writing about broken hearts and all of that br br but kyoto comes from a strict traditional japanese upbringing and doesn't expect to be married to ken all that long not only that she is homesick and wants to return to japan it's sad in that this is finally someone ken thinks he can love and be with and all that except the one time he thinks he's found someone to feel that way about the girl isn't expecting to stay that long it's not that she doesn't like ken it's just that she's used to a whole 'nother way of life she says i can't tell him the way i feel in english and ken can't tell me the way he feels in japanese it's a rather sad love story with a killer 80s techno nintendo soundtrack br br i picked up loving on tokyo time because it reminded me of one of my favorite 80s films tokyo pop and for those of you who enjoyed loving on tokyo time check out tokyo pop a new york singer goes to japan and joins a japanese american cover band except it's a movie with a happy ending br br
<START> it's amazing to see how nikhil advani manages to attract people to the theater till the very day of the release i mean look at the cast here the promotion is superb good enough songs and the trailers are fine this makes it a house full on the first day but it's only when people go and see the film they realize that there is no way their money is refundable house full the first day the movie is out the next week br br this film inspired by 'love actually' is what they say didn't manage to handle the whole cast well they tried to put in big stars but ended up by not even managing to bring out even an average performance by any one the stories are hollow and cheesy so the audience can't connect with any single one of them it's a big disappointment to all those who like big stars or for that matter nikhil advani after his big success of 'kal ho na ho'
<START> a wonderful film by powell and pressburger whose work i now want to explore more the film is about what we perceive as real and what is real and how the two can be so difficult to distinguish from one another beautifully shot and acted although david niven doesn't seem to be 27 years old as his character claims to be fun to see a very young richard attenborough this film made me think while i was watching it and afterwards
<START> also known as the big spook war the great yokai war is miike's attempt at a family film and damn fine job he does as well the problem is that i can't imagine many parents wanting to subject their children to this movie the best kids movies are the ones that are scary or have mildly disturbing imagery neverending story and return to oz spring to mind but in the case of the great yokai war miike probably takes things a little too far in fact at the screening i was at the person introducing the movie reiterated to the two families there that it was probably not very suitable br br the film kicks off with the young hero of the piece introducing himself and explaining about his current family problems this brief moment of mundanity is sharply broken as a cow gives birth to a calf with the face of a human whom screams that something horrendous is coming before falling dead like the abomination it is it is quite possible that the sheer hideousness of the creature is some bizarre quato homage br br following an incredible introduction for main baddie kato and his henchwoman agi a surprisingly attractive chiaki kuriyami by way of an apocalyptic army raising the story reverts to normal for a while but it doesn't take long before any and all logic goes down the drain and the young boy teams up with a group of miyazaki rejects to take out the evil sorcerer br br the plot of the movie is fairly basic and surprisingly hackneyed at times the entire chosen one just seems completely out of place in a movie which so regularly breaks clichÃ©s but is aided by a simple awe inspiring vision of a magical world this really is a miyazaki movie made into a live action movie albeit a much seedier and more vicious than usual miyazaki movie br br the film is simply a joy to look at the designs of the yokai is colourful and largely practical while the evil robotic monstrosities while not displaying the best cgi in the world have a practicality and menace to them which gives them far more of a palpable threat than you would imagine br br the cast is uniformly excellent they just make their characters seem perfectly natural which is commendable when you consider that most of them are in full body makeup or latex suits even agi lumbered with a ridiculous beehive comes across as sultry and deadly thanks to surprisingly excellent acting from kuriyami br br while the film does have many elements which put it firmly into family movie territory cute creatures junior heroes a thoroughly evil villain a sense of mischief and adventure and a telling lack of violence there are elements which make you question whether miike should have directed such a movie br br the robot army is a genuinely terrifying menace everyday items warped into monstrous beasts that look like t 101 sans skin and with added chainsaws these beasts rip characters to pieces suck creatures into their blood stained mouths and abduct children from their homes by swiping them right from under their parent's nose before indulging in a little patricide br br the creation of the creature is equally arduous for young minds the yokai essentially the heroes are feed into a giant furnace full of a liquidised form of hate which corrodes the yokai's flesh and forces their angry souls to possess lumps of metal if kids thought smouldering anakin was bad wait til they see a man sized hedgehog burning to death in a vat of molten hatred for a minute before being turned into an abomination of a motorcycle there is also limb severing in one case a severed hand twitches in front of the camera dripping with blood a fair amount of sexual energy agi wears one dress designed specifically for fan service and seems to only have sleeping with kato as motivation while the princess of the rivers wears next to nothing and gets her thighs groped by the young hero in several scenes and general humour which will go right over the heads of those that this technicolour wonder was seemingly designed for br br spoilers an example of this being that the yokai only become interested in the final battle when they think it is a big party the subsequent battle more of a festival than anything complete with beer crowd surfing and moshing also a scene where agi beats the tar out of a cute furry creature seems designed to appeal to the masses jaded by pokemon overkill br br end spoilers at the end of the day the great yokai war is easily on of miike's stronger recent films while it lacks some of the perverse charm of say gozu or ichi it is just continually pushing the audience down a road of general insanity in fact this is easily miike's most deranged movie in that he embraces the sheer magic of the subject so wholeheartedly br br well worth a watch just for the occasional flash of gogo arse
<START> what's in a name if the name is jerry bruckheimer expect it to be filled with action br br in producer bruckheimer's latest film gone in 60 seconds its all about the nomenclature with character monikers like kip sway and the sphinx and cars idealized with names like diane sue and the elusive eleanor it's only the non stop action that keeps you from wanting to just play the name game br br not a deep script by any means but it is a great vehicle for action as nicolas cage as memphis raines along with angelina jolie and robert duvall comes out of car thievery retirement to save his brother's life by stealing a list of 50 exotic cars in one night a remake of the 1974 cult hit this film may not be destined for the same cult status but it is entertaining br br surprisingly it's the action that keeps you watching not the acting although loaded with stars none of them have standout performances including a very weak performance by one of my favorite up and comers giovanni ribisi even jolie coming off her recent oscar win is just a token love interest with hardly any screen time br br can a series of beautiful cars and the car chases they become involved in make a great film i think so the film is a pleasure to look at and although one particular scene takes you into the realm of unbelieveablity the action is non stop and the suspense is compelling just be wary of other drivers fighting for a pole position as you leave the theatre br br 3 1 2 out of 5
<START> one measurement for the greatness of a movie is 'if it came on t v right now would you want to sit there and watch it again ' my answer for the grand canyon is as powerful a yes as it would be for nearly any movie i have ever seen there are just so many powerful moments such an intelligent and moving story such incredible performances br br it perfectly captures the confusion and violence that were so rampant in the early nineties but it also dramatically affirms the capacity of individuals to love think and care in a slight way the movie was of its time it partly portrays society as a balloon about to burst because the country was in a recession and so void of leadership this was true of that time but the movie is also timeless i think it could honestly stand up against any movie that has ever been made and it is the most overlooked film of all time
<START> metamorphosis hold a tiny bit of cult value simply because it was written and directed by george eastman this italian bloke is more or less the personification of male sleaze and starred in pretty much every rancid joe d'amato production during the late 70's early 80's wouldn't it be interesting for avid euro cult purchasers to own the only movie directed by the guy who walked around bare butted in erotic nights of the living dead all the time i thought so now unlike the movies he starred in eastman's own metamorphosis is kind of disappointing in the gore sleaze departments there are a handful of nasty murders cheesy monster effects and naked female bodies a guest appearance by sleaze queen laura gemser on display but it's mainly a talkative movie the handsome eloquent dr houseman is on the verge of a scientific breakthrough with his research on human dna codes when suddenly the university he works for threatens to cancel his funds he developed a theory to decode genes and block the human ageing process but if he doesn't come up with detailed reports any time soon his research will be stopped so dr houseman does what any intelligent scientist would do and injects the untested serum into his own veins needless to say and like the title implies he slowly turns into murderous monster that actually ages much quicker in other words his research sucked like the other reviewers already mentioned this movie borrows a lot of ideas from david cronenberg's the fly Â the dramatic romance sub plot included but doesn't add any originality from its own the big difference is that you constantly feel connected with jeff goldblum's character in the fly whereas dr houseman becomes just another monster that needs to be destroyed as fast as possible the rapid ageing syndrome aspect also reminded me of ruggero deodato's sadly underrated giallo phantom of death only the protagonist in that film inherited the disease and didn't inflict it on himself the physical deterioration of the carriers is very similar in both films though few scares or excitement to discover here instead the movie features loads of bad acting poor lighting lousy editing and a completely retarded climax to boot feel free to skip this one
<START> it was considered to be the swiss answer to the lord of the rings but it is much more than that it isn't an answer to anything it's in itself something new something funny and sometimes it's downright stupid and silly but was monty python any different than silly br br the beginning immediately makes the statement that this film is low budget and not meant to be taken entirely seriously cardboard clouds on strings knock into the airplane in which the main character is seated but to compensate the missing special effects the landscape does the trick it is absolutely beautiful and stunning who needs new zealand switzerland has it all br br what i liked about the film was the simple approach and the obvious passion and energy that went into it it isn't brilliant yet it's got some good humorous parts edward piccin as friedo is absolutely convincing it would be enough to go and see the film because of him there are some good jokes some of them are very lame some of them won't be understood by people outside of switzerland i liked the idea of having urucows instead of uruk hai i loved the scene where friedo decides to take pupsi a telehobbie with him on the journey also very funny is the scene when rackaroll the sword fighting knight decides to show off with his sword and subsequently smashes it into a wall breaking it and there is this one scene where the nazgul ish characters do a wonderfully comic scene that includes a toilet brush i didn't approve of the idea of the ring being used by schleimli the gollum character in order to seduce the ladies that was a bit far fetched the idea of lord sauraus wanting to cover the lands with fondue wasn't that brilliant either original certainly but not brilliant but most of all did i dislike the idea of a gay dragon that really wasn't necessary all in all i recommend to see the film simply because it is so crazy and totally trashy don't expect a lotr parody like spaceballs was for star wars but if you go to the flicks thinking that this is going to be an amusing evening out with absolutely no ambitions then you'll enjoy i am not sure if it works in other languages because it does live from the swiss dialects as well as from the jokes and actors br br all in all hat off to the courage of the swiss crew who did that
<START> the film my name is modesty is based around an episode that takes up about one page in the 10th modesty blaise novel called night of the morningstar it describes an incident in which the young modesty 17 in the book mid twenties in the film asserts her leadership in a war over a casino as this is set before the actual blaise adventures her trusted sidekick willi garvin is not in the film that is one of the main problems as the relationship between blaise and garvin was certainly always one of the fascinating aspects of the novels and the long running comic strip the other problem is that the film is quite simply incredibly boring because it really is just one small episode blown up into a screenplay the casting is okay but alexandra staden is not really convincing as the heroine and actually too old for the role to play the young modesty i get the impression that this film was a quick and dirty solution as not to lose the rights to the blaise franchise
<START> being born in the 1960's i grew up watching the tv movies of the week in the early 70's and loved the creepy movies that were routinely shown including crowhaven farm bad ronald satan's school for girls kolchak the night stalker etc but this one is just plain dumb this is obviously the writer's trying to capitalize on the horrific manson murders from a few years earlier the movie stars dennis weaver of mccloud and duel fame as a father who takes his family camping on a beach the family encounters some hippies who for some reason decide to terrorize the family the reason for this is never explained and weaver's pacifistic stance is hard to swallow for god's sake call the police beat the hell of them or something just don't sit there and whine about it the acting is pretty lame the story unbelievable etc susan dey looks cute in a bikini but that's about it ignore this if it ever airs on tv
<START> good for an evening's entertainment but the plot was unconvincing garrison's affair with the first lady was unreal and passionless the president was a cardboard cut out and who were the real villains anyway nothing was developed or explained sufficiently i still don't know why they wanted to kill the president or how the mole got involved the villains were nameless and undeveloped so you never felt involved in their plot michael douglas and kiefer sutherland did their best to inject some reality into the story the chase and confrontation were good but kim basinger and eva longoria were both unbelievable in their roles basinger totally lacked character and no way could longoria have been a secret service agent this could have been a very good film but somehow it missed the way with too many unanswered questions disappointing on the whole despite some very good scenes and did they use the 'west wing' set for the white house scenes i kept expecting cj or charlie to appear
<START> what a powerful start to a film when julia roberts character is punched in the face by her abusive and anal husband played by patrick bergin and i felt ready to experience a powerful film on the same level as farrah fawcett's the burning bed well as the summary says i was mis lead this film was nothing like the burning bed which had power and farrah played the part of a woman you truly felt for and felt her pain and her need to survive sleeping with the enemy drifted off after the first act into cheap thrills with roberts faking her death to escape her husband and goes to live in iowa her husband at first believes she is dead but starts to grow suspicious that she may still be alive and sets off after her the rest of the movie is basically a cat and mouse game with julia getting a house in this small town in iowa and changing her identity there is no mention of course how she got the money for this but at this point in the film i did not care all that much she meets a guy mr nice wimpy and falls for him and her husband does finally catch up to her but not before he re arranges her soup cans and straightens up the kitchen this was i assume to provide a cheap thrill to the audience but i did not care much if she was an abused wife because the film as i have said cheated the audience if it had stayed the course i might have felt for her and her situation of course the husband is killed and all is well for little ol ms roberts if only the real world was anything close to this see the burning bed and you understand what a film is suppose to be like on the subject of domestic abuse
<START> the fact that the movie is predictable is not a problem this movie is like a beautiful painting to be enjoyed the museum scene is like a nice music video the apres sex scene is an all too familiar scene in all of our adult lives but the movie would not hold any interest for me without keith gordon keith gordon is maybe one of the most underrated actors of our time almost everything i know about acting came from studying mostly his eyes he had the most compelling face his character possesses the qualities i look in a guy sensitivity and dedication keith gordon is gorgeous btw i kinda wish he'd shave his beard now as his lips jawline and adam's apple were his prettiest set next to his eyes
<START> the five or so really good westerns that mann made are unequaled as an ensemble in hollywood even john ford never made that many with so much quality the curious thing about them all is how uneven they are ford's my darling clementine is worth about two and a half of any of them or at least two br br the real hero of them besides mann and stewart is chase chase being responsible for the brilliant red river chase wrote far country bend of the river and probably some others but none of them are as finished as my darling clementine but then very few films western or otherwise are br br each of the five films of mann have huge gaps or is it six lets see bend far man of the west furies winchester 73 and yep six naked spur each have magnificent scene after magnificent scene with fairly glaring lapses yet so does red river which is still the single greatest western ever made so perfection isn't everything br br but the far country has huge huge holes it's mawkish and really comes alive only when stewart and mc entire are locking horns the rest is pretty pedestrian with the usual exception of mann's camera mann's camera is a one man course in cinematography it is about as good an eye as anybody who ever got behind a strip of moving film it is almost never in the wrong place never br br the far country has one amazing moment and as usual it comes from stewart nobody in the history of cinema ever received physical punishment with the authority of that man he is absolutely amazing look at him in bend far winchester and man from laramie in bend has been beaten up and is hanging by a thread so believably and with such boiling hatred he looks like somebody displaced from dachau in far he is shot off a raft with such violence it looks so convincing that you wince and of course when he is dragged through the fire in man well you find yourself looking for the burn marks what an actor not to mention the moment in winchester when he is beaten up early in the hotel room also as well as anybody ever did it br br but that was mann's territory look at gary cooper fighting with jack lord in man of the west as painful as any fight scene ever recorded cooper while not being quite as convincing as stewart nevertheless is somehow his equal in looking exhausted at the end of the fight in short nobody but nobody but nobody ever showed the human being in extremis as well as mann br br what a great great director br br see every western he ever made they are his real monuments even if all are scetchy but so what when he gets roaring with his great scenes they are as good as anybody including ford and his six westerns as an ensemble are the best ever done by anyone period br br thanks anthony
<START> oh dear oh dear i started watching this not knowing what to expect i couldn't believe what i was seeing there were times when i thought it was a comedy i loved how the government's plan to capture the terrorist leader is to air drop in one man who is unarmed and expect him to capture him and escape with a rocket pack if only it were really that easy i've finally found a movie worse than plan 9 from outer space
<START> perhaps the worst thing about carlos mencia's comedy is that every joke needs to be followed with an insult at the people in the crowd that aren't laughing if there's anybody who's insecure it's a comedian who won't shut up about his audience br br then again perhaps the worst thing about carlos mencia's comedy is that he doesn't get off his free speech high horse if you want to be funny just make a joke don't explain all the reasons why you're saving the american way with your failed attempts at generating laughter br br hmm actually the worst thing about carlos mencia's comedy is that it substitues meanspirited jabs at ethnicities for legitimate humor avoid this like the plague
<START> this is a bad movie not one of the funny bad ones either this is a lousy bad one it was actually painful to watch the direction was awful with lots of jumping around and the green and yellow hues used throughout the movie makes the characters look sickly keira knightly was not convincing as a tough chick at all and i cannot believe lucy liu and mickey rourke signed on for this criminal waste of celluloid the script was terrible and the acting was like fingernails across a chalkboard if you haven't seen it don't you are not missing anything and will only waste two hours of your life watching this drivel i have seen bad movies before and even enjoyed them due to their faults this one is just a waste of time
<START> definitely one of funny man eddie murphy's lesser films is this nonsense about a kidnapped mystical child three hundred year old dragons and a chosen one br br murphy is the chosen one in question and as the opening song suggests he is the best man in the world a finder of lost and missing children he is approached by a mysterious tibetan woman charlotte lewis who tells him he is the chosen one and that it is his destiny to find and rescue the golden child for if the child were to die compassion would die with him as he is the bearer of compassion br br if all this hocus pocus rubbish hasn't ruined it for you now it surely will once the movie begins suffice to say the plot is abominable and destroys the whole film meant to be another vehicle for murphy's egotistical brand of humour the comedy isn't so great mind you the movie fails on many levels even charles dance as the evil sardo numspa can't do much for proceedings very silly and disappointing br br sunday december 12 1993 t v
<START> i remember this movie in particular when i was a teenager my best friend was telling me all about this movie and how it freaked her out as a kid of course being the blood thirsty gal that i am i had to go out and find this movie now i don't know how to put this without loosing credibility so i'm just going to say it i actually had fun watching this movie i know that it's stupid not the best story and beyond bloody and gruesome but that's what i was looking for and the dentist delivers in the scares blood sex and crazy psychopaths sometimes i just need a fun movie like this to just let loose and get grossed out by br br dr alan feinstone is obsessed with order and cleanliness on the day of his wedding anniversary he spies his wife brooke having sex with their filthy pool man matt at his dental practice feinstone's first patient of the day is young jody saunders there for his very first dental appointment feinstone begins to clean jody's teeth everything goes smoothly at first until he imagines that jody's teeth are brown and rotten his dental pick slips stabbing jody in the gums jody's mother picks up her crying bleeding child and leaves angrily feinstone sees his second patient beauty queen april reign alone with april feinstone sedates her with nitrous oxide so that he can fill a cavity in one of her molars as she drifts off into unconsciousness feinstone imagines that she has transformed into his wife he begins kissing and fondling her on the dental chair then begins to choke her april starts to cough and half wakes up from the gas feinstone snaps out of his trance and quickly re buttons april's blouse feinstone decides to end the day early and sends his staff and patients home later that night brooke meets feinstone at his practice he reveals his new italian opera themed patient room he encourages brooke to try out the room's dental chair when she does feinstone binds her to the chair and sedates her with nitrous oxide with operatic music blaring in the background he begins to pull out brooke's teeth feinstone has gone off the deep end and is definitely not going to let anybody stand in his way of cleanliness br br honestly as silly as this movie sounds i did have a lot of fun watching the dentist the best scene without a doubt is when he teaches that nasty irs agent a lesson in hygiene that i'm sure he'll never forget man i don't think i've brushed my teeth so much after i watched the dentist yeah i am going to warn you this movie is in no way for the faint of heart it's very bloody there's stabbing gun shots and just these brutal dental torture scenes that will make your stomach turn yet somehow i just enjoyed this movie if i ever want just a good gore movie that was made for true horror fans i slip it in my dvd player and that's the tooth lol i am so funny um yeah i try give me a little credit br br 7 10
<START> i concur with everyone above who said anything that will convince you to not waste even a briefest of moments watching this amazingly amateurish movie very poor acting offhand production values utterly pedestrian direction and a script so inept and inane it should never have been written let alone produced even hollywood professionals apparently go to work just for a paycheck although no one should have been paid for this bad work careers should instead have ended over this inconsequential drivel br br oth there is something fascinating about watching something so jaw droppingly bad and chad lowe is terrifically and consistently bad
