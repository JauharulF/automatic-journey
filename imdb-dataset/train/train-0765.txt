<START> it felt like i watched this movie thousand times before it was absolutely predictable every time the story tried to get a bit twisted every time i awaited something interesting to happen i saw nothing but what i expected like the bread factory opened up another facility because there was not enough bread in two words flat story that has become a clichÃ© bad acting bad special effects only the dumb russian cop vlad was a bit funny while punishing around the bad guys the pile of muscles was so incredibly stupid that it made me laugh at him for a moment i wonder why i waste my time spitting on that shame of a movie it won't get worse because it is not possible d
<START> adolf hitler's maniacal desire to impose his will on the rest of the world is the subject of this second in a seven part series of films produced by the u s war department as an instructional tool for new soldiers entering the armed forces during world war ii hitler's plan was methodical and well conceived starting with the conquest of eastern europe expanding to the european heartland then moving on to the 'world island' consisting of europe asia and africa his final move would be to reach across the oceans for the ultimate conquest of the americas and the world br br in 1935 hitler ordered national conscription as the rest of the country fell under his evil spell grade school children sang his praises and young german boys received training and indoctrination in military camps marching unopposed into austria in 1938 hitler followed by annexing a strip of land bordering germany and czechoslovakia called sudetenland in 1939 hitler took all of czechoslovakia later in the year the world was stunned to learn that germany signed a non aggression pact with it's mortal enemy russia a ploy to delay hitler's military involvement on too many fronts immediately after germany invaded poland bringing hitler's conquest right to russia's doorstep he would deal with her later br br it was during this period that britain still declined to oppose hitler's thrust across europe prime minister neville chamberlain felt he procured a great victory for his country by accepting a treaty with germany his infamous declaration stating 'peace in our time' it didn't turn out that way br br the most fascinating information to be learned in this installment at least to me was provided by a small snippet of footage from a german pro hitler rally in the mid '30's it was led by a german american taking his cue directly from the homeland the venue madison square garden
<START> this movie contains one of richard dreyfuss's greatest performances as an actor who plays a dictator and does it so convincingly that his own mother does not detect the impostor also this movie is funny yet has a serious side as well what is especially intriguing about this movie is the character madonna who is the dictator's mistress but eventually becomes the leader of the country madonna's evolution from mistress to political leader added greatly to the quality of the story and to the movie's entertainment value and the main character who at the start of the movie is a struggling actor and somewhat of a buffoon evolves too and by the end of the movie commands respect i liked this movie
<START> if you have seen the sholay of 1975 don't watch this movie if you have not seen the sholay of 1975 go watch it but do not watch this movie this movie has all the ingredients that could possibly have gone wrong with making a remake of sholay br br amitabh 'babban' bachchan plays the role of a psycho villain to the best probably the only 40 mins of the reel that shouldn't be burnt if you remove the rest of the movie and just watch amitabh play around with his character it would still be worth a watch but as insp narsimha mohanlal doesn't do justice to his talent ajay devgan heero is extremely mundane and the only reason i think they cast prashant raj in the role of raj is because he has a striking resemblance to amitabh of his young days sushmita sen carries herself well with grace and make up but the award for the worst performance and any role till date must go to nisha kothari she manages to degrade her acting to such levels that even high school drama would would outshine her performance br br if you have a mortal enemy take him to this movie
<START> way back when i was renting videos for free i picked this one up oops the things i wanted to mention outside the summary already given were these 1 someone who had a lot to do with making this movie had a strange and sick fascination for food it was gross and unecessary 2 there is some kind of a soundtrack in the background of the film that seems to be there the entire time and by the way i felt for days after viewing this trash i figure they had something subliminal going on in the track either that or it was just traumatisingly bad or both many times throughout the movie you can tell the writer and director did not have much experience or talent and don't even ask about the acting
<START> this must be one of the worst swedish movies ever made br br it is embarrassing that such a bad script was allowed to become a movie and shown in cinemas as recently as year 2006 br br i've never seen so many visible sponsored products in one and the same movie it shouldn't be that obvious br br i can't understand why so many known actors even thought the idea to even be visible in a movie like this if i had any respect for some of the known actors in this movie before i saw the movie it is gone for sure now br br i've heard that there will be a follow up movie to this one and i can't understand how that is even possible
<START> star rating the works just misses the mark that little bit in between lagging behind the pits br br in this debut effort for nick park's beloved man and dog they are forced to fly to the moon when good old wallace runs out of cheese br br as well as being the shortest feature at just 22 minutes this w g adventure is also the earliest and it kinda shows the plasticine animation is a little creaky and funny here sort of reminiscent of the mork animation about the little man in the box br br admirable though the craftsmanship behind it is i've never actually been hugely into wallace gromit maybe a bit too clean and traditional for someone of my generation the only one i've really enjoyed is the wrong trousers and that was more from when i was younger and less aware of shall we say the seedier pleasures of life i was driven to actively seek out this early effort due to the resurgence in popularity as a result of the hugely successful recent film adaptation br br as technically impressive as the first two all things considered this one lacks the emotional angle it's successors were to possess that being said it's fairly good fun as a first try and certainly set the standard for greater things to come two stars but a good two stars
<START> when i first saw this film it was not an impressive one now that i have seen it again with some friends on dvd they had not viewed it on the silver screen my opinion remains the same the subject matter is puerile and the performances are weak
<START> like tarzan the ape man 1932 only more so there's more of everything more animals more varied african tribes and scenes in which the thought must be if this was good with three or four lions forty would be better tarzan wrestles with crocodilesÂthe the crocodile machine spins in the water like a rolling pin around and around jaws flapping tarzan can kill it with his ubiquitous knife if the blasted saurian would hold still tarzan kills lions and rhinos and a steadily increasing number of animals his friends are real chimps people wearing larger ape costumes and elephants in fact they use indian elephantsÂfar more friendly and trainable than african onesÂwith costume ears attached to their heads the human story another white man worse than the rest shows up to join with holt to go after the ivory from the elephant graveyard tarzan won't show them the way so the bad guy shoots an elephant so they can follow it to its deathbed tarzan intercedes and the bad guy shoots himÂbut of course he survives and returns to save jane everybody else dies holt and the bad guy and every single one of their boys people are expendable especially africans and there doesn't seem to be much distinction between the black fellows who die because they work for the white men travelling through taboo country and those black fellows who kill them this must be the last tarzan movie before the hays code made jane wear more clothes there are a number of underwater scenes in which jane swims nude and though the light is flickering the movement and the glimpses are very appealing apparently one of weismuller's friends from the olympic swim team did the nude scenes and not maureen o'sullivan she however moves through the movie wearing the same sort of loincloth weismuller wears plus a bikini top showing a splendid glimpse of thigh and hip they still don't need to talk a lot they sleep together and hang out with cool animals and stay away from cities no wonder they're happy
<START> boring predictable by the numbers horror outing at least has pretty good special effects and plenty of mindless mayhem and gore to satisfy mindless genre fans mostly it's about giant rats chomping on a set of characters we don't care an iota about if that's your thing tune in 1 2
<START> this movie will tell you why amitabh bacchan is a one man industry this movie will also tell you why indian movie goers are astute buyers br br amitabh was at the peak of his domination of bollywood when his one time godfather prakash mehra decided to use his image yet again prakash has the habit of picking themes and building stories out of it adding liberal doses of bollywood sensibilities and clichÃ©s to it zanzeer saw the making of angry young man lawaris was about being a bastard and namak halal was about the master servant loyalties br br but then the theme was limited to move the screenplay through the regulation three hours of song dance and drama what comprised of the movie is a caricature of a haryanavi who goes to mumbai and turns into a regulation hero amitabh's vocal skills and diction saw this movie earn its big bucks thanks to his flawless stock haryanvi accent to me this alone is the biggest pull in the movie the rest all is typical bollywood screen writing br br amitabh by now had to have some typical comedy scenes in each of his movies thanks to manmohan desai this movie had a good dose of them the shoe caper in the party the monologue over vijay merchant and vijay hazare's considerations the mosquito challenge in the boardroom and the usual drunkard scene that by now has become a standard amitabh fare br br shashi kapoor added an extra mile to the movie with his moody finicky character remember him asking ranjeet to shaaadaaaap after the poisoned cake incident his was the all important role of the master while amitabh was his loyal servant but prakash mehra knew the indian mind and so shashi had to carry along his act with the rest of the movie it was one character that could have been more developed to make a serious movie but this is a caper remember and as long as it stayed that way the people came and saw amitabh wearing a new hat and went back home happy the end is always predictable and the good guys get the gal and the bad ones go to the gaol the age old theme of loyalty is once again emphasized and all is well that ends well br br so what is it that makes this movie a near classic amitabh bacchan as the haryanvi prakash mehra created yet another icon in the name of a story chuck the story the characters and the plot my marks are for amitabh alone
<START> tom and butch cat fight over the capture of jerry mouse because the one who doesn't catch jerry gets kicked out the two cats dress in their master's clothing to disguise themselves and lets the other have it confused tom and butch whack their master's rear and all three of them get kicked out
<START> stylishly directed picturesquely photographed and brilliantly acted Â crosby's interpretation seems exactly right hardwicke has his best role ever while bendix is a treat too Â this yankee's appeal is universal and irresistible br br one of the principal joys of the movie of course are the songs as might be expected bing is in fine voice and although hardwicke's solo has been cut we can still hear him sing heartily as he dances merrily with crosby and bendix in their famous novelty number busy doing nothing it's also a treat to hear rhonda fleming who although she enjoyed an extensive stage and concert career as a singer was rarely given a chance to be heard in the cinema she has a lovely voice that more than matches her ravishing looksÂand she looks very fetching indeed in her mary kay dodson costumes br br director tay garnett gets the most out of his lavish budget using all the resources at his command to present every fabulous scene as effectively as possible perhaps the eclipse looks a trifle too contrived but who's complaining br br in short as the trailer actually describes an entertainment delight from start to finish
<START> i got the first bill and ted movie for christmas and i had to get the second when i saw it in a store this one was i think just as funny as the first but a much wierder story it was funny how they had their own personnal hell and how they had to play death the funny thing was that they played him in stupid little games like clue the only thing i'd change is station and death being in the band but other than that it was great
<START> proof that not everything tarantino touches turns to gold this is most definitely plastic all the way its easy to see that without quentin's involvement this would have probably sat on the shelf for years that's assuming it would have ever got produced in the first place it is about a woman with a fascination of death who gets a job cleaning up after crime scenes angela jones is unconvincing in this role william baldwin is better as the serial killer who keeps jones in employment all in all pretty poor
<START> the number of times i've had tears in my eyes when watching a movie are few and there is only one time when i have really cried and that was when i saw this movie this movie has some kliches but i really don't care i cry even as i write this and it was quite some time since i saw it it is perfectly acted and all the production values are good but what really matters is the simple and wonderful message we all know it in our hearts but it is not always easy to remember that the only thing that really matters in life is love in all it's forms it's only when we love that we're truly alive i know how sentimental i sound and i promise i'm not usually like that i'm quite a cynic this movie has brought out stronger feelings of both sorrow and happiness in me than any other movies and it will probably always be the first movie i recommend others to see
<START> ahista ahista is one little small brilliant i started watching it and at the beginning i got a little bored since the pacing was slow and the main idea of one guy meeting a girl who is lost was not really new but as the film went on i started getting increasingly and gradually engaged by the film the fantastic writing and the charming romance the film was extremely simple and natural and after some time i felt i was watching a real documentation of one guy's life there's one very good reason the film got this feel and it's the fresh talent called abhay deol he is extremely convincing as the simple kind hearted and struggling ankush whose new love motivates him to make amends and fight for a better life throughout the film he is presented as an ordinary mischievous prankster but also as a helping and loving person who like anyone else will do anything to protect his love deol portrays all the different shades of his character whether positive or negative naturally and with complete ease br br shivam nair's direction is very good his depiction of the life of people in the rural neighbourhood is excellent but what gets to be even more impressive is his portrayal of ankush's relationships with the different people who surround him including his friends and his love interest megha who he is ready to do anything for i also immensely liked the way nair portrayed his interaction with his friend's loud and plump mother whom he calls 'khala' aunty he likes to drive her crazy and annoy her on every occasion yet we see that she occupies a very special place in his heart and is like a mother figure to him as evidenced in several scenes except for abhay the rest of the cast performed well though soha ali khan did not stand out according to me she was good and had some of her mother's charm the actors who played ankush's friends were very good as was the actress who played ankush's 'khala' br br apart from the performances the film's writing was outstanding the dialogues were sort of ordinary yet brilliant and the script was also fantastic that's mainly because despite a not so new story it was never overdone or melodramatic and there were no attempts to make it look larger than life the film's biggest weakness was himesh reshammiya's uninspiring music which was unsuitable for this film otherwise ahista ahista was a delightful watch and it got only better with every scene the concept may not be new but the film manages to look fresh and becomes increasingly heartwarming as the story goes by the ending was bittersweet kind of sad yet optimistic in short this movie really grows on you slowly and this can be easily attributed to the wonderful writing the moving moments the charming romance the realistic proceedings and of course abhay deol's memorable performance
<START> i just accidentally stumbled over this film on tv one day it was aired in the middle of the day on a channel not exactly famous for airing good movies this one however was nothing less then good br br october sky tells the true story of homer hickam a boy inspired by the sputnick launch to become a rocket scientist he and his friends begin to build rockets his father is not to happy about his sons new found hobby and would rather see him become a coal miner as himself or go to college on a football scholarship like his brother br br the story is well written a bit too predictable maybe but that's ok cause it doesn't focus too much on those parts of the story it's important part but where this is obvious the inner action the action between the characters is focused on the story is good it has some clichÃ©s but that's ok it's based on actual event's so you kind of can't just drop out these clichÃ©s the characters are really good where the story is on a downhill the characters are brought out and manage to keep the action and the quality of the movie high you get to know these characters and you get sympathy for them they are well written and believable br br this is a good looking movie the sets and the 50's style is thorough and the pictures are well composed and well lit this all sets the mood of the film very good br br the acting is really good jake gyllenhaal delivers a great performance as homer hickam and chris cooper is good as john hickam as for the rest of the cast they are good too all together this makes out a pretty strong cast br br all in all i'm glad i caught this movie it was first after seeing it i learned that it was based on actual events if i had known that when seeing it it would probably just be even more interesting october sky is a good and interesting movie it's a movie i believe everyone can enjoy it's kind of a feel good movie not bad at all
<START> a powerful adaptation of the best selling book and the smash broadway play about the lives of bessie and sadie delany two colored sisters who lived past the age of 100 wonderfully played in their old age by ruby dee and diahann carroll respectively they tell their story in flashbacks to amy hill hearth played by amy madigan a white new york times reporter the flashback and present day scenes don't have as much inspirational value in them as in the book but really are powerful however certain aspects of the sisters' lives such as the inter racial background of their mother and the reasons behind their father's stern personality are not presented clearly you need to read the book to fully understand these things which is just as well because the book's just as great aside from those flaws it's wonderfully done and performed especially by dee and carroll and a very powerful and educational movie
<START> virgin is selected to marry rich guy rich guy urinates woman on boat likes sailor sailor urinates virgin attends gross out commune dinner man urinates on dinner table boatwoman does strip tease for little boys man pretending to be baby urinates there is an underlying theme here makavejev is trying to say that he is pi ed off at the world to say that this is a bizarre movie is an understatement to justify the title there is a scene where laure who hardly speaks ten lines the whole movie bathes in chocolate syrup it is a sweet scene indeed but the rest of the movie leaves a bad taste in one's mouth unless one happens to share the director's fetishes
