<START> in europe it's known as who dares wins in america it's known as the final option but under any title this ludicrous sas action flick asks the audience to put their disbelief to one side for around two hours i find it incredibly hard to comprehend how lewis collins the hero here was almost chosen as roger moore's successor in the bond films this guy is so expressionless he'd struggle to get a job in a waxwork museum as a waxwork luckily judy davis is on hand to partially redeem the affair with a meaty performance as a hard line lady terrorist and there's a climactic ten minute action sequence that is quite competently orchestrated by director ian sharp let it be added that it's a very very very long wait for these closing excitements to come around and i can't honestly say that a near two hour wait for a bit of decent action was worth the effort br br sas hard man peter skellen lewis collins goes undercover among a group of peace protesters who would like to see the end of nuclear weapons stock piling he meets their leader frankie judy davis a strong talking and opinionated woman who might just be capable of taking extraordinary measures to achieve her goals frankie's dedicated bunch violently lay siege to the american embassy in london demanding that a nuclear missile be fired at a naval base in scotland she believes that when the world witnesses a nuclear blast for real everyone will be so appalled that they will join her campaign for disarmament unfortunately for frankie she makes the mistake of taking skellen on her little embassy raid and he plans to thwart their plan from inside with a little well timed outside help from his sas comrades br br the film is inspired quite obviously by the awesome sas assault on the iranian embassy in 1981 someone who saw that event on the news apparently thought it would be good to devise a film along similar lines unfortunately the film is rather banal with too much stupid dialogue and a heck of a lot of embarrassingly bad scenes the arch bishop's debate which descends into a riot anyone frankie's idea to bring about peace by instigating a nuclear blast is ridiculous anyway so she becomes a laughable figure just when the audience is on the verge of viewing her as an interesting villain who dares wins tries to be a celebration of the military legend that is the sas but at the same time it dips into clumsy action clichÃ©s and ill thought out plotting the result is a well intentioned but wholly ineffective slice of boy's own absurdity
<START> i picked up this movie for 5 dollars at a discount book store adam sandler is a awesome actor and i figured it would be a good movie well it wasn't there was absolutely no story line at all bad jokes and the other comedian said the f word every other word he said cursing usually dosen't bother me but this was over the top and even worse than the lack of story line was the parts when sandler would just begin talking into the camera at random parts in the movie it reminded me of dora the explorer when they turn and look at the screen and ask you questions and last of all is when they would randomly put in bikini shots of girls at random times in the movie in my opinion don't buy this movie its a waste of money
<START> working class romantic drama from director martin ritt is as unbelievable as they come yet there are moments of pleasure due mostly to the charisma of stars jane fonda and robert de niro both terrific she's a widow who can't move on he's illiterate and a closet inventor you can probably guess the rest adaptation of pat barker's novel union street a better title is so laid back it verges on bland and the film's editing is a mess but it's still pleasant a rosy hued blue collar fantasy there are no overtures to serious issues even the illiteracy angle is just a plot tool for the ensuing love story and no real fireworks though the characters are intentionally a bit colorless and the leads are toned down to an interesting degree the finale is pure fluff and cynics will find it difficult to swallow though these two characters deserve a happy ending and the picture wouldn't really be satisfying any other way from
<START> this is the best emma in existence in my opinion having seen the other version 1996 which is also good and read the book i think i can safely say with confidence that this is the true interpretation and is the most faithful to jane austen's masterpiece the 1996 movie with g paltrow is good too it's just that it's almost like a different story altogether it's very light and fluffy you don't see the darker edges of the characters and if you just want a pleasant movie that one would do fine but the intricacies of some of the plot points such as the churchill fairfax entanglement is so much glossed over as to be virtually non existent but if you want the characters fleshed out a bit more real and multidimensional the 1996 tv version is the superior emma is a remarkable person but she is flawed kate beckinsale is masterful at showing the little quirks of the character you see her look casually disgusted at some of the more simple conversation of harriet smith yet she shows no remorse for having ruined harriet's proposal until that action has the effect of ruining her own marital happiness at the ending you see her narcissism and it mirrors frank churchill's in that they would do harm to others to achieve their own aims for emma it was playing matchmaker and having a new friend to while away the time with after having suffered the loss of her governess to marriage for frank churchill it is securing the promise of the woman he loves while treating her and others abominably to keep the secret in the book she realizes all of this in a crushing awakening to all the blunders she has made both kate beckinsale and gyneth paltrow are convincing in their remorse but paltrow's is more childlike and stagnant while beckinsale's awakening is rather real and serious and you see the transition from child like selfish behavior to kind and thoughtful adult both versions are very good but i prefer this one
<START> this movie isn't about football at all it's about jesus god it's the same kind of sappy sanctimonious religious drivel you get from those arch idiots who wrestle for jesus or pump iron for jesus yeah jesus was totally buffed liked contact sports and definitely owned a full set of dumb bells duhhh this movie should have been entitled hiking for jesus or something along those lines just to let the general public know that the real intent of this movie is to convert people to christianity and to pander to those whose brains have already been thoroughly washed in the blood of the lamb that the title is derived from the bible is made clear when the head coach is reading his bible and asking jesus for help the recent sports movie invincible was 100 times more inspiring than this was and jesus wasn't even a factor it was just the desire and determination of an individual with a dream br br any broad appeal as an inspirational sports movie is ultimately lost amidst all of the blatant bible thumping and sanctimonious religious propaganda one gets the impression that the sole message is the only way you can succeed and make positive gain is if you accept jesus as your personal savior but this is simply not true and is therefore a lie being perpetuated by those who believe that it is true and want everyone else to believe it the image of the winning athlete thanking jesus when he wins comes directly to mind what does he do when he loses does he curse jesus of course not when he loses jesus isn't responsible jesus is only responsible when he wins and the logic goes round and round and round and it ends up exactly where the true believer needs it to be every time i had to hit pause when the scene with the coach receiving a brand new truck came on so i could stop rolling on the floor laughing my ass off and catch my breath materialism is not what jesus taught i find it odd that most so called christians seem to either forget or ignore this message from their savior especially when i see a jesus fish on the back of a huge gas guzzling suv that passes me like i'm standing still br br another message this movie implies is that jesus apparently cares more about the win loss record of a mediocre high school football team that he does about the millions of starving children in the world the final scene where the insecure and unsure kicker boots a 51 yard field goal and it is hyped up as an unbelievably incredible miracle puts the final gag me with a spoon religious red flag on this turkey i only gave it three stars because the guy who played the black coach could actually act
<START> i sat down to watch this movie with my friends with very low expectations my expectations were no where near low enough i honestly could not tell what genre this movie was from watching it and if it was a comedy the humor was completely missed the plot was nonexistent and the acting was horrendous my friends and i managed to watch approximately 30 to 40 minutes of this film before we turned it off and promptly begged the video store to take it back i do not recommend this movie to anyone unless you are purposely trying to watch the worst movies of all time i honestly don't know how this film lasted more than a day in theatres and moreover i can not understand why anyone would willing watch it considering not only it's very uninteresting title but also the lack of any famous actors actresses in it's cast this review is not a joke and i honestly think this could possibly be the worst movie ever made it's certainly the worst movie i've ever had to sit through
<START> i was so disappointed by this show after hearing and reading all the hoopla about it how it was a ground breaking show and all sorts of wild promises if quality i tried to watch it br br what a letdown the acting was way forced and exaggerated the story made very little sense as for any hint of the vaunted look into teenagers' lives i could only see a paltry attempt that had as much reality to it as a reality show br br some are wondering why there are so many negative comments about this show the reason is that it's really not all that good and beating the drums over quality on this show only serves to attract attention to how poorly made it is
<START> thanks to a smart script and a steady hand from writer director kevin meyer perfect alibi is an entertaining and very likable mystery thriller the movie starts methodically and builds up steam as the clues begin to reveal that nothing is what it seems to be teri garr and hector elizondo are terrific as they team up to unravel the mystery reminding me of nick and nora charles from the thin man movies kathleen quinlan is excellent as alex mcarthur's tormented wife and the character roles played by veteran actors charles martin smith bruce mcgill anne ramsey and estelle harris are well done and provide plenty of light moments at just the right time there's even a cameo by rex linn in all i felt like i was reading a good book by the fire
<START> i haven't read a single imdb comment for this movie that mentions how the jewish character in this movie jumped up and down like a little baby as a gun is pointed in his face by a racist skinhead while the movie's lead black character looked in sternness down the barrel of a gun br br i don't know how anyone could perceive this as a balanced account of university life i agree universities are not bastions of tolerance like they are supposed to be and the title would be fitting if singleton didn't make his characters such broad caricatures br br on the surface he tries to portray ice cube's character as a bad guy provoking remy to become a racist skinhead but who graduates at the end in the movie's redeeming epilogue it seems singleton points at white as either unable to empathize i didn't say sympathize with his fellow black student or only able to take the path of a racist skinhead many people who have been bullied by people of another race do not turn to extreme bigotry br br nor do women who have been raped immediately turn to lesbianism which is portrayed more as a cult than a lifestyle quite honestly what was the point
<START> i do try not to take imdb ratings to heart but i was flabbergasted when i saw the 5 4 rating to one of my childhood favourites it doesn't wow me as much at 17 but as a family film this is a sweet and well meaning movie kids will definitely love it and won't mind the flaws and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the film none of the film was preachy in any way in fact it has a great message that added to its sweetness i will admit though that the story is on the thin side and some scenes like screweyes's death which still freaks me out may be a tad on the scary side but the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation the music by james horner is very beautiful and the song featured is memorable catchy and amusing i really liked the characters louie is probably the most in depth of them all but the dinosaurs were at least engaging martin short's clown was both hilarious and emphatic the part when he tells screweyes i quit had me in stitches my favourite is screweyes though an effective villain who is crafty and i suppose intelligent if anything though i wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows because that way he could've been more developed in terms of depth the script while not oscar worthy has its funny and heart warming parts and should keep kids and adults entertained the voice acting for me was what made the movie john goodman martin short rhea perlman felicity kendall and yeardley smith all gave solid performances but special mention has to go to kenneth mars for he was absolutely superb as screweyes and almost unrecognisable all in all this is a good movie i don't get the rating honestly i don't sure this film isn't perfect and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as land before time but it is good fun 7 5 10 bethany cox
<START> my school's drama club will be putting this show in the spring of 2002 and i can only hope we're as good as this i watched this film recently as sort of research for my role rosie alvarez and i'd just like to say vanessa williams is the coolest br br wow the casting for this movie was right on with one exception jason alexander oh my gawd is there anything he can't do he was the most wonderful albert peterson ever i especially loved all of his funny facial expressions and dancing during put on a happy face he is so great vanessa williams as i said before is the coolest she was a beautiful rosie and her transition from secretary to seductress was totally believable tyne daly was hilarious as albert's obnoxious mother and george wendt was superb as the annoyed mr mcafee however i loved paul lynde's performance in the 1963 version brigitta dau cracked me up as ursula merkle she really hammed it up and marc kudisch was an awesome conrad birdie suffer br br there was only one casting that i didn't understand and as you'll see from previous comments many other people didn't understand chynna phillips as kim mcafee what was that i mean she's really pretty and very talented but she looks a bit too old for the role eh maybe i'm delusional br br okay well anyways i highly recommend this movie it'll leave you smiling br br
<START> as long as you can suffer it if you like watching people waking up getting up getting dressed having a shower preparing dinner watching each other having sex in the dark then going back to bed to sleep if you like tacky flats narrow bedrooms and kitchens long minutes of silence if you like getting bored for two hours feeling the thrill of real intimate false art then you will like it but if you don't just try to see a good movie there are thousands as long as you are here but do we want to stay this german movie got the award of the torino gay film festival italian journalists still don't understand why the jury took such a bad decision as the festival presented lot of talented movies maybe to be nice with a german as they don't often get awards well the lives of others did but this one is excellent but not gay so maybe it is a question of fashion germans are they in again no matter what or maybe only for a hustler's glance of some directors
<START> there's a lot the matter with helen and none of it's good shelley winters and debbie reynolds play mothers of a pair of leopold loeb like killers who move from the mid west to hollywood to escape their past reynolds a starstruck jean harlow wannabe opens a dance studio for children and winters is her piano player soon winters as helen begins to crack up it's all very slow going and although there are moments of real creepiness nasty phone calls a visit from wino timothy carey the movie is devoid of any real horror nevertheless it's still worthy entertainment the acting divas are fine and the production values are terrific a music score by david raskin cinematography by lucien ballard and oscar nominated costumes contribute mightily with this a place in the sun and lolita to her credit does anyone do crazy as well as winters directed by curtis harrington a master at this type of not quite a movie exploitation in addition to carey the oddball supporting cast includes dennis weaver agnes moorehead as a very aimee semple mcpherson like evangelist yvette vickers and micheÃ¡l macliammÃ³ir the irish orson welles as hamilton starr aptly nicknamed hammy
<START> this thrown together piece of fecal matter adds together so many ludicrous scenarios that in the end it's a laugh riot of absolute hilarity too bad as the premise is promising as it so often is in duhllywood but in the hands of this scriptwriter it segues off into la la land br br lowe is in prison serving time for a dui that killed off his mistress we get to see him having nightmares just so that we know he feels real bad about this then his cell mate neighbor hangs himself or does he lowe has some suspicions but drops them quickly his suspicions are so weak that the bad guys have nothing to worry about so why do they then set him up to be killed ah that's where this story could get interesting that's where it falls off the rails and once off the rails it decides it can get away with insulting the viewers attention for the next numbing hour br br spoilers br br i won't bore with an endless recounting of the irrationality of what follows but contemplate this ending lowe has been trapped by the bad guys on a train they want a tape he has because that tape will screw their boss and them so on to the train come 3 cops guns drawn ready to rescue lowe the bad guys kill the cops in front of half the passengers and then continue chasing lowe to get the tape hello killing 3 cops in public will get you into deep doodo to hell with the tape yet off they go through a mall shooting up the place as if the public did not exist as witnesses and in the end lowe is grabbed and the bad guy still wants the tape
<START> the tattooed stranger was another of those rare b movies that bbc2 screened over christmas new year 2005 2006 see also they live by night and the brighton strangler br br in this one a man walking his dog in central park comes across an abandoned car and discovers a dead woman inside she was shot and police then try to identify her with only a tattoo as the main clue after being identified the murderer is discovered and is shot in the shootout at the end br br most of this movie was shot on location in and around new york so we get to see some areas of the city we don't normally see especially the back streets br br mostly unknowns are in the cast with john miles getting top billing br br the tattooed stranger is worth seeking out excellent but rather obscure br br rating 3 stars out of 5
<START> grand canyon falls under a very scarce category it is a very clever film with very clever dialogs and food for thought everywhere from start to end i have the impression that it never made it to it's deserved ranking and never will because of it's simplicity this kind of flick needs sensitive watchers pity thought that imdb makes me write ten lines because this is in no way necessary in this particular case anyway in order to fulfill this request i will tell you that the weak point of the film if any is in the acting not that it is bad but it could have been done much better exception made for kevin kline who was perfect go ahead and watch it

<START> even duller if possible than the original i hope i may say that under the imdb guidelines the french connection at least tried to absorb european influences to complicate the conventional view of the american police detective even if the attempt was foundered by friedkin's ambivalence americaness and general indirection the relative arthouse boom of the 1960s especially with the nouvelle vague allowed for a huge influence of european cinema in hollywood this lent a new vigour and complexity to a weary medium and in the best of them eg bonnie and clyde early scorcese a new subversion of received practice the original connection was part of this movement with its difficultly distanced style and anti detective figure two is old hollywood's right wing reassertion of american values br br this is figured in the film's very tiresome america vs france dialectic for instance two is shot like a 70s french policier it was the french of course who insisted on the greatness of american movies when they were ignored at home and this in a sense is a reclamation a warning against gallic presumption this can be seen in the pattern of the two movies connection has french gangsters invading new york with the french style smothering the american thriller this leads to the dissolution of the detective figure and irresolution of plot the baddie got away br br two has the american returning to france with american thriller values imposed on the native genre the power of the detective is reasserted and conventional resolution is achieved this is further dramatised in doyle's relationship with french inspector barthelmy whose dominant influence he must shake off before he can control the plot br br two seems to follow the original by undermining its detective hero from the start doyle's importance is diminished at every turn despite the ending of connection he is considered a hero but he is an american in a foreign land and his inability to control language or customs means he cannot dominate the plot he even misreads the signs of the police force mistaking an informer for a criminal and getting him killed br br a detective's power comes from his power as subject to see and interpret but doyle spends much of the movie being watched controlled an object a body literally in the scenes after he is dumped by charnier to be viewed and interpreted in connection he instigated the action chasing the criminals forcing the plot here he is passive tied to a bed locked in a cell an addict a dependent br br this loss of phallic power is predictably symbolised in the loss of his gun and the film follows a depressingly familiar oedipal trajectory in the heroin sequences he is comforted by an old lady who says he looks like her son his drugged state is like a return to the womb robbed of adult pressures her taking his watch reinforces the timelessness of this state doubly significant for a man whose career depends on timetables and precision br br oedipus was the first detective and to avoid his fate doyle must reject this false mother who is dissolving his unified identity and kill the father charnier so that he can take his accepted masculine role in society psychoanalytic theory was popular among academics in the 70s ironically instigated by a frenchman jacques lacan but it's rare to see a film so literally full of it br br if all of these facts tended towards the minimising of doyle then the film's style doesn't friedkin distanced us from his hero by refusing empathy or character motivation focusing on the mechanics of plot here doyle is a very conventional hollywood hero instead of being lost in murky long shot he is made knowable and understandable to the viewer with the traditional devices point of view shots close ups connecting shots etc br br two is all about the fall and rise of popeye doyle plot in this case is subservient to the acting which is the usual hackman showiness the cold turkey scenes therefore despite their tediousness are not disturbing we are allowed to share rather than coldly observe this a far less discomforting experience the scenes are also shot through with a lachrymose manly sentimentality that is very american br br so while connection tried to imitate the complex thrillers of jean pierre melville two does the complete opposite melville's le samourai featured a gangster who started the film whole powerful outside language and charted his eventual disintegration two starts with a disintegrated character achieved partly through inability with language whose dominance begins when he steps outside language the concluding action sequences are largely wordless br br in the film the locale and language are important as they fixed and undermined the detective but as he regains his power figured in the return of his gun and the cathartic burning of the primal site of vulnerability the tower block where charnier held him the marseilles setting becomes more irrelevant and the mythic stand off which could take place anywhere takes over compare the endings of the two films one admits ambiguity and despair the other absolute certainty br br
<START> the film was very outstanding despite the nc 17 rating and disturbing scenes in reality things like this do happen and that is why this movie shows a lot of it it all starts with maya rosario dawson in superb performance whose recently started attending college has everything going well for her she meets jared chad faust in a terrific performance at a frat party who turns out to be a real gentleman and sweet he invites her out to dinner they look at the stars from a bridge and they end going to his apartment they talk and takes her to the basement were they become flirtatious with each other she tries to put an end to it but he rapes her this incident scars her she goes to a club meets a bartender dj adrian greatfully played by marcus patrick who sees that she is getting to drunk and helps before she goes to far they strike a friendship he also does drugs and maya starts using as well in other words introduces her to a different world she starts going back to school and working as ta teaching assistant and spots jared as one of the students while the students are taking a midterm she catches jared cheating jared tries to smooth talk maya but she still has the upper hand decides to invite him to her place will history repeat itself or will maya have a surprise for jared you watch the movie excellent a rosario dawson portrays the role with focus and endurance chad faust does not like he can be a rapist but he does a terrific job as jared marcus patrick is very brilliant the man who saves maya and coaches her into a new world this film deserves an award
<START> released some months before the end of the war anchors aweigh is one of gene kelly's major musical triumphs of the fortiesÂ br br under the direction of george sidney it had the benefits of a pleasant score andÂbest of allÂthe services of gene kelly in his first true starring role at mgmÂ the year before in columbia's cover girl he had revealed an innovative approach to dance on the screen a light but agreeable singing voice and considerable charm in anchors aweigh although he was billed under frank sinatra and kathryn grayson he was laying the solid groundwork for his most revealing years at mgmÂ br br the film's story a kind of dry run for on the town four years later follows sailors kelly and sinatra on shore leave spend their holiday in hollywood where they become involved in the affairs of an aspiring singer grayson and her little nephew dean stockwell br br grayson it appears has her heart set on an audition with conductor pianist jose iturbiÂ she gets the audition of course kelly gets grayson after some misunderstandings and sinatra has forgotten to be shy and has lost his heart to a girl from brooklyn pamela britton br br the plot is conventional for the period but regrettably it now seems barely tolerableÂ but there is gene kelly who dominates the movie with his agreeable personalityÂ perhaps he grins too much but when is permitted to dance the film finally lifts off the groundÂ br br i begged her his early song and dance with sinatra is amusing and slightly absurd in which he imagines himself as a bandit chieftain in a spanish courtyard courting maiden grayson with a flamboyant flamenco dance and some athletic leapsÂ he also does a charming mexican dance with little sharon mcmanus in the square of a mexican settlement in los angelesÂ br br the highlight of the movie however is kelly's famous dance with the cartoon character jerry the mouse of tom and jerry fame delightful and innovative it skillfully combines live action and animation in its tale of a sad mouse king who refuses to allow music in his kingdom until kelly a sailor in the pomeranian navy wearing a striped shirt and a beret shows him how to danceÂ look at me i'm dancin' says the gleeful mouse king
