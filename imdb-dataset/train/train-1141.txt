<START> guy walking around without motive i will never get those two hours of my life back the guy kept on assuming identities and cheating on his pregnant wife what was i thinking how did this win a price anywhere i understood he loved his father but other than that the movie was completely senseless to me what was the purpose of walking so much and going to the funeral of a stranger for no apparent reason how did this enrich his life why did we have to see the dying old lady on her underwear why br br i though it would be deep or about something more interesting i do not recommend the movie even to leave on while sleeping
<START> though i did not begin to read the classics in literature until i was 47 it's never too late jane eyre is a favorite for many reasons mainly because there isn't a part of the book i liked less only parts i enjoyed more the 1983 tv mini series with zelah clarke and timothy dalton was everything i hoped it would be i saw it as a full length movie in 2006 dalton's 'mr rochester' was very good but i absolutely loved zelah's 'jane eyre' relecting on another 'classics' movie i saw recently i was disappointed in the production direction and dialogue it was only faithful to the avarice and arrogance of hollywood artistic license to the great works in literature is nothing short of plagiarism using the title after such license is fraud leave it to the brits to get this one right among others you won't be able to reread the book without reliving the movie with it's proper context and spirit well done bbc
<START> long on action and stunt work but so short on character delineation and development that it failed to hold our interest not always easy to figure out which side a character is on and who's doing what to whom
<START> why else would he do this to me br br not that i expect dean cain to produce hit movies or even decent movies i saw lois and clark i am aware of just how good dean cain is br br obviously this is gonna be a cheesey flick and each cheesey flick has its own special way to make you scratch your head i will not call these spoilers as you can't really spoil this movie any more than it already is br br to begin with why is that a fake helicopter i mean why br br how come that one scientist is from chicago and that other scientist is from la and neither one could be any more eastern european if they tried how hard would it have been to get either an american actor or just change that lame state sheet the movie provides us with to say those people aren't american br br why are there 2 occasions when the movie gives us a slug line we get helipad day and then mess hall day later on and then that's it who cares about the timeline to be honest who cared about it even when they mentioned it but i guess that's beside the point br br does a movie really get better if you are able to view it through multiple split screens the answer is no br br that dragon sure can walk down that hall over and over and over and over br br who on earth was responsible for one of the worst endings in film history it was straight out of scooby doo oh the dragon's dead now say wanna get dinner sure but not at some chinese place with dragon in the name ah ha ha ha ha ha ha haha ha i used to be superman aha ha ha ha ha br br fade to black br br my god it made me cringe it was so stupid br br but never fear even though the whole building exploded and no one was left alive for some reason there's a second untouched unmanned lab that survived pretty well so they can make a sequel hurray for us all br br
<START> this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen there is absolutely no storyline the gags are only for retards and there is absolutely nothing else that would make this movie worth watching in the whole movie fredi oh my god what a funny name ha ha doesn't ask himself once how he came from a plane to middle earth there are plenty of stupid and totally unfunny characters whose names should sound funny e g gandalf is called almghandi sam is called pupsi and so on i didn't even smile once during the whole movie the gags seem like they were made by people whose iq is negative if you laugh when someone's coat is trapped in the door this happens about 5 times then this movie is perhaps for you another funny scene they try to guess the code word for a closed door don't ask why don't ever ask why in this movie and the code word is ha ha dung so if you laughed at this examples you might like this movie for everybody else go to youtube and watch lord of the weed it's a lot lot more fun
<START> director writer andrÃ©s waissbluth worked seven years to complete this two hour film about the crime underground in santiago chile and perhaps that is one of the reasons the resultant film seems episodic and in need of editing or maybe this is the technique of a director who shows a fine sense of film noir storytelling br br two brothers silvio the elder nÃ©stor cantillana and victor the younger juan pablo miranda have moved to santiago from their home in temuco after their parents' death and silvio works to support victor's education on victor's seventeenth birthday silvio takes the virgin out to the clubs where he encourages victor to lose his virginity with one of the club's stripper prostitutes in a tender scene victor must face his nascent impotency while silvio is out on the club floor impressing the 'owners' with his potential for hire br br silvio goes to work for the 'gang' as a bodyguard henchman and makes good money to support victor's schooling but victor has eyes for one of the dancers at the club named gracia antonella rÃ­os and begins to woo her dropping out of school incurring silvio's angry disappointment gracia just happens to be the squeeze of the club gang's leader don pascual alejandro trejo who is silvio's boss gracia is the glue that holds this tale together as she is the paramour of victor silvio and don pascual and the consequences of this bizarre mÃ©nage a trois has deadly results through a means of re telling the story through the eyes of victor silvio and gracia we grow to understand the vulnerabilities and the cracks in each character that allow for the downfall that results br br sound like a chilean pulp fiction well it is and it is filmed in a brutally colorful dark manner that includes a lot of frontal nudity both female and male and provocative sexual encounters but in the end the sensual aspect of the director's vision is what drives this film playing on the debutante virginal psyche against the hardcore professional sex worker with success the cast is fairly strong especially antonella rÃ­os in the demanding role of gracia there are enough twists and turns and replays of incidents you think you understood the first viewing but that change dramatically in impact when told through the eyes of a different character bordering on two hours some judicious editing would have helped the impact of the film in spanish with english subtitles recommended for those who like the edgy film noir style and the art of south american cinema grady harp
<START> i saw this movie in the middle of the night when i was flipping through the channels and there was nothing else on to watch it's one of those films where you stop to see what it is just for a moment but realize after twenty minutes or so that you just can't turn it off no matter how bad it is one of those movies that is somewhere in between being so bad it's good and so bad it's well just plain bad it's worth seeing just to experience the confusion of realizing that it's both great middle of the night fare if only for the fabulous tennis drag don't even bother asking yourself why nobody can tell that chad lowe is so obviously male because logic does not apply
<START> tara reid as an intellectual christian slater usually great as a dollar store constantine and stephen dorff as well it's stephen dorff for christ sake i personally just want to thank those brilliant casting directors for the hard work and effort you guys are on heres an idea just my humble lowly opinion as the movie going public but it follows directly with your previous choices a movie about the most brilliant neuro physicist in history invent one pill to cure all diseases ever known to man and get this heres the clincher they have to be played by jessica simpson and paris hilton i knew you guys would love that seriously though you owe me 7 50
<START> in this film we have the fabulous opportunity to see what happened to timon and pumbaa in the film when they are not shown which is a lot this film even goes back to before simba and presumbably just after the birth of kiara br br quite true to the first film lion king 1 2 or lion king 3 in other places is a funny entertaining exciting and surprising film or sequel if that's what you want to call it a bundle of surprises and hilarity await for you br br while timon and pumbaa are watching a film at the cinema with a remote control timon and pumbaa have an argument of what point of the lion king they are going to start watching as timon wants to go to the part when he and pumbaa come in and pumbaa wants to go back to the beginning they have a very fair compromise of watching the film of their own story which is what awaits it starts with timon's first home br br for anyone with a good sense of humour who liked the first films of just about any age enjoy lion king 1 2
<START> shallow shallow script stilted acting the shadows of boom mikes lingering over the actors' heads in scenes worth watching because kate mulgrew plays the most selfish mother in tv movie history and it's all before ben affleck got his teeth capped
<START> br br it's a generic coming of age story think the member of the wedding summer of '42 a summer place even little women and there are moments where mulligan might have omitted the soupy music not used slow motion or played down the golden lit prettiness of the setting otherwise it's done with rare emotional perfect pitch nothing's forced every line has feeling and the pacing is just right even the below a list casting helps bigger movie stars with more recognizable personalities might have overwhelmed the material in particular witherspoon is excellent her line readings are fresh and original and her body language is just right for a gawky hoydenish 14 year old on the eve of womanhood waterston is also very fine even if he has to spend much of the movie climbing in and out of the family truck br br one senses that the film's makers were aware of its unpromising commercial prospects no big stars no big car crashes no special effects and consciously decided to make the best possible movie box office be damned it's intimate and honest and it sticks to the ribs if you find yourself misting up at the end you don't have to feel you've been duped
<START> terry gilliam's stunning feature length adaptation of chris marker's short film la jetee is full of mind bending surprises yet still touches your heart thanks to the superb cast gilliam's flair for the phantasmagorical works with the script by david and janet peoples to play with your head as much as it does with poor james cole willis at his most steve mcqueen like better than mcqueen even a time traveling convict from the future who literally doesn't know whether he's coming or going as a team of scientists keeps sending him back to the wrong eras while trying to prevent a 1995 plague that's deadly to humans but harmless to animals willis the justifiably oscar nominated brad pitt and madeline stowe as a well meaning psychiatrist give some of the best performances of their careers even paul buckmaster's tango style score is haunting this one's a don't miss
<START> dark comedy gallows humor how does one make a comedy out of murder it can be risky business as the viewer is required to let go of their moral values and laugh at the antics of a man who kills people so the story has be rock solid with a good dash of suspended reality in order to make it work so pierce brosnan the irishman's answer to 007 is now cast as a chain smoking sex addicted alcoholic who kills people for a living and is having a life crisis he meets a struggling businessman greg kinnear and after a rocky beginning he learns that he needs a friend but greg's happily married to hope davis and brosnan sees in him the basic things he doesn't have love home and a life add character actor philip baker hall as the hit man's manager and we're off to the races brosnan is wonderfully crass and crude as the anti hero and kinnear delightful as his counterpart the very human businessman hope davis adds a sparkle as kinnear's very conventional wife who is fascinated with this derelict who drifts into their lives the ending is delightful and with some surprise to it you should leave the theater feeling at least partly good if you're able to suspend being aghast at killing people
<START> charleton heston wore one james franciscus wore one but mark wahlberg opts not to don the traditional loin cloth i hope no one casts him as tarzan linda harrison wore a bikini in the first 2 planet movies but estrella warren barely shows cleavage her hair is always in the way tim burton could have sexed up this simian saga given the adults in the audience something to look at even the chaste helena bonham carter never gets out of her costume which looks like a large curtain she's cute but all the the love stuff is restricted to anxious looks a little bitty kiss at the end as in artificial intelligence which discusses inter species sex between robots humans but never delivers planet of the apes hints at inter species romance between the humans the apes but only hints lisa marie is the only ape that dares to be sexy this movie has three great actors tim roth ms carter paul giamatti chewing up the scenery as a trio of apes they are fun to watch superlative make up a certain oscar costumes sets music make this the hit summer movie of 2001
<START> enjoyable movie although i think it had the potential to be even better if it had more depth to it it is a mystery halfway through the film as to knowing why elly is such a recluse then when we are finally given an explanation going back to her childhood there still isn't much detail perhaps had they shown flashbacks or something br br anyway it is still a good movie that i'd watch again 7 10 br br
<START> envy stars some of the best jack black ben stiller amy poehler and the great christopher walken with such a cast one can only expect the best however with envy no one could save this disaster br br tim dingman stiller and nick vanderpark black are best friends and co workers at a sandpaper factory both are making a decent living but because tim has a better performance at work he's able to afford more than his buddy nick nick is a dreamer who's always coming up with new ideas for inventions one day nick comes up with the idea for a spray can that makes dog poop disappear yes i'm serious falling in love with the idea nick decides to really invent this product he makes an offer to tim to invest in his idea and share the profits 50 50 tim refuses thinking the idea will never work br br nick's invention titled va poo rize again i'm serious ends up making millions he enjoys spending his money on things like a much larger house a horse a personal trainer and fancy deserts tim starts feeling envy for nick hence the name of the movie br br the concept isn't bad but it still turns out awful this movie contains some of the worst dialog and very poor performances from all the cast then again as i mentioned earlier none of them could save this mess not even the great christoper walken playing a homeless character named j man made this movie funny the movie is bad from the start and only continues to get worse br br i recommend this movie if you like crap no pun intended you want to see jack black in a white tux br br i say avoid this movie at all costs but avoid especially if you're offended by bathroom humor you love animals
<START> nothing to say but wow has anyone actually had somebody sneak up on them in an open field well this happens about 25 times in this movie clearly the directors' favorite scare tactic in one of the opening scenes the smooth talking hot shot producer has to ride in the back seat so the camera man could sit in the front to film shortly after he arrives to the field the 5 contestants show up and although it is clearly at latest 2 in the afternoon they are all convinced that the sun will set any minute after about 30 minutes of boobless trash we are privileged with a flashback of the clown's history in which we see some of his previous victims if you watch this movie check out the ladies chest her ribs go all the way to her neck it was flat out disgusting most horror movies action occurs during the night but without a night vision camera the chaos is forced to happen during the day the few night shots that did make it in to the movie look like they were stolen from the blair witch project or random shots from the directors backyard the movie somewhat redeemed itself in the end when there was a matrix like shoot out with the clown that we rewound and watched over and over laughing hysterically br br definitely rent this movie if you have ever been snuck up on in an open field br br signed the answer
<START> i recently saw this movie in my international business class i was not expecting anything other then another boring documentary not to say i don't love documentary i've just hard bad luck with movies in that class imagine my surprise when this movie that's actually a movie came up br br this film is a tell all of cultural differences in the work place and how they need to cooperate to get anywhere the culture clash shows just how different the world is and just how differently we perceive ourselves until someone comes along and gives us a wake up call i would highly recommend this film to anyone in business or who just wants a laugh because yes it is funny br br well that's about it cheers
<START> obviously has some talent attached maria bello is always great but this is just a dreary wast of time portraying every character as someone to be loathed and exploited so someone could make a movie out of an 'interesting' story well i hope they got it out of their systems unfortunately for the audience there is no insight no sensitivity no context and really no humanity which would all be fine except it has no humor no horror no context and nothing constructive to say about the story it's trying to tell bad things happen you sit and watch it you don't care so what 99 of the time the words 'based on a true story' constitute an unintentional warning to the audience it means the director and screenwriter are lazy and fascinated by some events they heard about somewhere so they just throw them up on the screen and expect the 'true' nature of the story to make the audience feel something without the filmmakers having to do any of the work i hope they had a great time making this movie it stinks on ice
<START> the greatest sin in life is being dull and this movie is crashingly boring its funny its left out of his a life in film documentary he goes from a long piece on stardust memories and then fast forwards to zelig this little piece of cubic zirconia just isn't worth the effort
