<START> one of the things about the film that warmed my heart strings was that dry fly fishing was a major part of the scene i have occasionally carried out my times of dry fly fishing having tied my own flies and being accompanied by my brother and my father we spend a day on one river or another seeking to tempt the ever elusive brown trout to rise and take the fly that has been offered to them br br when we had occasions like this any differences between us disappeared and any of the pressures of the world melted away to be replaced by the glory of being absorbed in the activity and the surroundings of the place we were in br br this was one of the amazing things that was portrayed to me in the film as the minister and his two sons norman and pauly carried out the ritual for there is something ritualistic about fly fishing as there is something ritualistic about so many pastimes you can't just start casting your fishing line and hope for the best you have to attune yourself to the place you are in you have to scan the surface of the water considering how it is flowing and where the best point might be to place your fly and depending on your skill level you might even get your fly to land there long enough for a fish to take note of it and strike the 'art of fly fishing' was directed and represented so well that they themselves can be classified as artists br br the title for the film could not be more aptly chosen for the river did in fact run through the life of father and two sons this film however spreads itself broader than the family and community in montana by the the blackfoot river where the film is played out it has the capacity to draw you in to enthrall you to capture you as the history of the family community and period is unfolded the story told is not just a family history but a history of life what may be classified as a 'river of life'
<START> excellent farce which of course is all it is intended to be thankfully there is neither a social or political message nor is there the slightest attempt in that direction could the plot actually take or have taken place in any particular time or location unlikely for after all this is simply merely a movie and movies spring from imagination not from reality the only goal of this movie is to entertain certainly not to educate and entertain it does with reality delightfully and lightheartedly tossed to the winds i think most would agree that from documentaries we expect enlightenment and authenticity but for entertainment i want what is nowadays described as a no brainer which the mating game is in all respects for a few chuckles and an outright laugh now and then this is fine fare fantasy
<START> i first saw this when i was around 7 i remembered what i believed to be a vague outline of what took place turns out now 15 years later that i remembered everything with great accuracy because it seems the writers never got beyond making an outline to the story there is no plot to this movie cartoon there is no character development no back story no character arcs nothing the good guys do things because they are good while the bad guys do things solely because they are bad one unintentionally hilarious part is when someone who you would think to be important dies and nobody cares in the least they just shrug their shoulders and move on there's barely any dialogue either if you cut out the fight scenes and the running scenes you lose 70 of the movie br br watch this because you want to see some good animation and for no other reason or if you like to look at scantily clad hot cartoon chicks or scantily clad hot cartoon dudes
<START> oh my god what a horrible film the film has all the right people involved unfortunately it is not worth watching i saw it for free at my local library if i had paid to watch this i would be even more upset this film is unwatchable how could tarintino be involved with such a slow paced unexciting film no wonder it didn't get much distribution every one involved must have been ashamed i can make a better film with a dated camcorder and my big toe its beyond boring i really hated it tarintino just lost some standing in my eyes this must be some kind of sick joke don't bother with this film if some one even hints you should watch it kill them
<START> i remember watching this film in the eighties as a teenager but i wanted to see it again because traci lords is now earning a living as a serious actor what the hell was going on in the eighties this is a really bad film with bad taste and bad actors definitely a waste of money
<START> kill me later has an interesting initial premise a suicidal woman selma blair on the verge of jumping off the top of an office building is protects a bank robber max beesley who promises to kill her later br br the actual execution of this premise however falls flat as almost every action serves as a mere device to move the plot toward its predictable conclusion shoddily written characters who exhibit no motive for their behaviors compromise the quality of acting all around lack of character depth especially diminishes selma blair's performance whose character shawn vacillates from being morose to acting cool and ultimately comes across as a confused dolt this is unfortunate as under other circumstances ms blair is an appealing and capable actress br br compounding matters for the worse is director dana lustig's insistence on using rapid cuts incongruous special effects e g look for an unintentionally hilarious infrared motorcycle chase at the end and a hip soundtrack in the hopes of appealing to the short attention spans of the mtv crowd certainly ms lustig proves that she is able to master the technical side of direction but in no way does her skill help overcome the film's inherent problems and thus the movie drags on to the end clearly lustig has a distinct visual style however it is perhaps better suited to music videos than to feature film br br the producers ram bergman lustig can be commended for their ability to realize this film they were able to scare up 1 5 million to finance the film secure a good cast and get domestic and foreign distribution this is no small feat for an independent film yet given the quality of the product the result is a mixed bag
<START> actually they don't but they certainly did when trying to think of a singular line that adequately summarises how terrible this entry in the series really is there were some moments that could have been good but they are mostly outweighed by their own conversion into missed opportunities and don't get me started on the bad br br the wasted opportunities are pretty obvious but i will recap them here in case anyone cares anyone who hasn't seen the film and genuinely gives a toss would be advised to stop reading at this point the first and potentially the biggest wasted opportunity was the plot with freddy's long lost child now the extreme mental illness that freddy appears to suffer and i might hasten to add that less than one percent of mental patients are a threat to other people leave alone to this extent is hereditary so why not a mystery type slasher in which lisa zane's character dreams of freddy murdering the teens only we later discover it's actually her doing all the killing sound like a good plot idea to you obviously it was above the heads of talalay and de luca br br then there's the trip to springfield where the entire adolescent population has been wiped out and the remaining adults are experiencing a kind of mass psychosis funnily enough said mass psychosis was actually depicted in a realistic and convincing manner although this has a fair amount to do with the fact that we are never shown too much we are just given quick visual hints of the massive loss of connection with reality that would stem from the grief of every youngster in town dying for reasons beyond one's comprehension and control the essential problem with this plot element however is that the town is abandoned too quickly and with no real answers this collection of scenes would have been far creepier with ten minutes of say one sane citizen explaining to these visitors why the springfield fair looks like a horror show br br of course horror films are never noted for their character development unless they're the kind of horror films john carpenter used to direct but how are we supposed to really care when characters we know next to nothing about die at least wes craven took the time to set up his characters in the original and used a few cheap tricks to draw the audience in that in a nutshell is probably the biggest problem with freddy's dead it just doesn't try at all leave alone hard enough br br on a related note i feel kind of sorry for robert englund now that he is more or less inextricably linked with the freddy character he has played far better characters in far better productions the science fiction miniseries v for example and to be forever remembered as the man who played freddy is selling him rather short it seems he will never break the mold of horror films now as for the rest of the cast well i think their performances here speak for themselves they deserved to be permanently typecast as little more than b grade horror props even yaphet kotto doesn't escape this one unscathed as his character is one of the most childishly written in the history of b films br br all in all freddy's dead gets a 1 out of me i'd vote lower but the imdb doesn't allow for that fd is really a testament to how a writer's inability to exploit a concept to the fullest extent can ruin not only a film but an entire franchise
<START> i don't see enough tv game shows to understand the attraction of show me the money but i suppose it holds some appeal for undemanding audiences ostensibly a quiz show it offers contestants huge sums of money for answering a few simple questions however its quiz elements play only a small part in the proceedings which i find tortuously complicated for example before answering a question a contestant selects which question is to be asked by choosing from among random a b or c choices does this serve any purpose other than to slow the game down it would be a lot quicker simply to start with a contestants can pass on questions but must answer one of the three questions in each category br br after responding to a question the contestant is then asked to lock in the answer another delaying tactic the contestant's next task is to name which woman from about a dozen go go dancers in cages is to unveil a card that indicates how much the question is worth a correct answer adds the card's dollar figure to the contestant's running total a wrong answer subtracts the same sum this time consuming step actually has some entertainment value as it allows the audience to get a close look at the scantily clad and uniformly gorgeous dancers meanwhile the contestant is reminded that an unlucky selection of the killer card will end the game instantly this naturally makes the contestant sweat and causes further delays as the nervous contestant contemplates the sudden loss of the hundreds of thousands of dollars my suspicion is that the possibility of sudden disaster is the show's chief audience appeal br br meanwhile the whole process is slowed down even more by a lot of empty banter between host william shatner and the contestant along with occasional routines by the caged dancers all these delays burn up so much time that it might be possible for audiences to forget what the original question is by the time the correct answer is revealed br br a typical 30 minute episode of jeopardy often gets through as many as 60 questions the first 30 minutes of smtm that i watched got through only six questions many of which pertained to other tv shows no one in his right mind would watch this show because it's fun to play along by answering the questions at home that leaves three possible reasons to watch the show br br a to see how a contestant responds to being on the verge of winning as much as one million dollars only to lose everything in one stroke br br b to look at gorgeous young women performing sexually suggestive dance routines br br c to enjoy william shatner's scintillating banter br br my choice is b but the women aren't on camera long enough to justify suffering through an hour of this show
<START> watching the commercials for this movie i was fairly convinced that i was going to loathe it for one thing it was one of those loosely based on the novel movies which usually means that the book author saw the script hated it and refused to be associated with the film worse the trailer showed only the most mundane slapstick imaginable ex kid gets squirted in the face with a garden hose and falls over so when my little brother got it into his mind that this was the must see film of the season of course he thought the same thing about cars over the hedge the ant bully monster house etc etc i was admittedly less than thrilled br br but once at the theater the film won me over for a variety of reasons first and foremost the writers capture 'kid dialogue' better than just about any other children's film i've ever seen a prime example of this comes directly after the boys' principal accidentally eats a worm stuck in an egg omelet the boys do a lame over exaggerated impression of the principal lecturing them which makes it realistic since all little kids think mistakenly that they do great mocking expressions of their adult tormentors then one of the boys asks why did he say 'alley oop' another boy responds maybe he's crazy and the entire group laughs uproariously not an overly witty rejoinder but exactly the kind of thing a young kid would come up with on the spot and exactly the type of remark other kids his age would find hilarious as if to confirm it my kid brother laughed right on cue when they were spoken on screen i could practically hear his voice spouting the same exact lines if he was placed in a similar situation br br another reason the movie works is that the writers manage to work in issues like bullying sibling relationships the new kid in school and peer pressure conformity without making any of them seem as though they were subplots for some after school special for example the bully joe isn't stereotypical he's definitely bad but not pure evil and just enough of his home life is revealed that the audience feels sympathy for him and understands his bullying origins there's also no cue the dramatic music moment where billy 'worm boy' realizes what a complete tool he's being to his younger brother woody and yet by the end of the movie some type of minor transformation has been made there's some realism here in the way the characters resolve situations and in the way they relate to each other and very little of it comes across as corny br br the only drawback to the movie comes in the form of an absolutely laughable dance scene that even the creators of the infamous mcdonald's dance party in mac and me would scoff at why oh why was it put into the movie did austin rogers adam pull a macaulay culkin and refuse to take the role unless he was given a vehicle to showcase his oh so impressive dancing skills the entire sequence definitely did not need to be there and had slightly less comedic value than any given show on the history channel br br overall though this movie was excellent and the length about an hour and twenty minutes was just about perfect one of the best most realistic live action kid films you'll ever see if you're ever around children or just remember what being a kid was actually like
<START> i saw this movie in my international cinema class and was grossed out from get go this movie is nothing but one scene of blatant shock value after the next br br the 4th man is about an alcoholic writer named reve who has visions of his in pending danger he meets up with a woman named christine when giving a lecture at a local book club and only decides to stay with her when he discovers how attractive her boyfriend is to put it plainer reve likes the dutch sausage so reve concocts a plan to seduce christine's boyfriend so he can ultimately have sex with him but its later discovered that christine has had 3 previous husbands who she all murdered now reve and christine's boyfriend could be the 4th man the storyline makes sense with no plot holes the editing and everything else that is technical about this movie is perfectly fine the movie is just gross and i felt the need to vomit in some parts basically this isn't my cup of tea br br the movie opens with reve getting out of bed in just a t shirt so in the very beginning you get to see reve's lovely pecker flopping around as he walks around his cramped apartment in a hangover state later on he has a dream where his pecker gets cut off by a pair of scissors and they do show it along with the blood fountain that ensues reve fondles a statue of jesus and has homosexual sex in a mausoleum plus there's a lot of blood more blood than all the freddy krueger movies combined br br not that i have anything against shocking scenes but this movie is just so blatant when it comes to shocking the whole movie is revolved around the shock value br br so if any of this is your cup of tea watch this movie otherwise stay far far far far far away from this one my mind is still scarred
<START> wow what can i say about this film it's a lousy piece of crap i'm surprised that it got rated as high as it did what's wrong with this film here's a better question what's not wrong with this film br br the story itself is just crap and clichÃ© here's pretty much what it's about some kinda nerdy kid with no friends gets picked on gets killed and comes back as a scarecrow for revenge all of that is packed into 86 minutes of worthless film if you haven't seen this movie don't waste your time watching it also the second one isn't much better so don't bother watching that either i rated this movie a three because i liked the scarecrow's outfit not because there was anything good about the movie i think you get the picture
<START> much to your presumable happiness fair readers cage and hopper did meet and fortunately not in a lynch movieÂbecause red rock west is way better than any lynch movie Â nicolas cage is a thirdÂrate actor the porcelain babe is a surrogate femme fatal only daddy hopper is as mean as ever Â red rock west is despite the trite cast one of my favorite american thrillers in a word a thriller with some twists br br one notices mainly the gusto the awesome pace the thrills the nice suspense lara flynn boyle's cute tight small ass cage's enviable physical shape though undeniably ugly with sharp bird features thick eyebrows and thin rare hair cage displayed a fine overall shape Â hopper's consummate routine some moderately but truly funny moments cage's play with his intended persona hopper's rigid psychopathic allure lara's meanness cage seems a roamer the archetypal gloomy roamer of the noir cinema hungry tough if needed naive dirty tired lara flynn boyle performs as the cold mean seductress walsh as her heartless husband and hopper as the lynchian hit man he's already done before br br cage looks indeed rather groggy or dizzy or very confused and having a severe hangover but this might be his regular look
<START> when robot hordes start attacking major cities who will stop the madman behind the attacks sky captain jude law plays joe sullivan the ace of the skyways tackling insurmountable odds along with his pesky reporter ex girlfriend polly perkins gwyneth paltrow and former flight partner captain franky cook angelina jolie br br sky captain and the world of tomorrow may look and feel like an exciting movie but it really is quite dull and underwhelming the film's running time is 106 minutes yet it feels so much longer because there is no substance in this movie the visuals were great and the film did a nice job on that however there is nothing to support these wonderful visuals the film lacks a story and interesting characters making the while thing quite dull and unnecessary i blame director and writer kerry conran he focuses too much on the visuals and spent little time on the actual story the movie is like a girl with no personality after awhile it kind of gets bland and tiring sky captain represents a beautiful girl with no personality it's simply just another case of style over substance br br the acting is surprisingly average and that's not really their fault since they had very little to work with the main reason i watched this movie is because of angelina jolie however the advertising is quite misleading and she is only in the film for about 30 minutes her performance is surprisingly bland as well jude law gives an okay performance though you would expect a lot more from him gwyneth paltrow was just average nothing special at all ling bai's performance was the only one i really liked she gives a pretty good performance as the mysterious woman and she was the only interesting character in the entire film br br the movie is not a complete bust though there were some wow and exciting scenes there just weren't enough of them the film just doesn't have that hook to really make it memorable it was actually quite bland and it wasn't very engaging at all it's too bad the film wasn't very good since it had such a promising premise in the end sky captain is surprisingly below average and not really worth watching rating 4 10
<START> michael stearns plays mike a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality he has no problem ogling naked dancers but when women start having sex with men that's when he loses it he believes that when women actually have sex that's when they lose any sense of innocence and or beauty so he strolls through the hollywood hills stalking lovemaking couples at a distance ultimately shooting the men dead with a high powered rifle with a scope br br the seeming primary reason for this movie's existence is to indulge in sexual activity over and over again the story comes off as more of an afterthought this is bound to make many a happily heterosexual male quite pleased as we're treated to enough protracted scenes of nudity the ladies here look awfully good sans clothes and sex to serve as a major dose of titillation of course seeing a fair deal of it through a scope ups the creepiness factor considerably and illustrates the compulsion towards voyeurism for one thing mike eyes the couples through the scope for minutes at a time before finally pulling the trigger this is all underscored by awfully intrusive if somewhat atmospheric music on the soundtrack br br those with a penchant for lurid trash are bound to enjoy this to one degree or another it even includes one lesbian tryst that confounds mike and renders him uncertain how to react it unfolds at a very slow pace but wraps up with a most amusing ironic twist it's a kinky and twisted rarity that if nothing else is going to definitely keep some viewers glued to the screen br br 7 10
<START> as the front cover says the hamlet of our time for our time br br i had to study this filmed version of hamlet directly after watching keneth branagh's version and it was truly a disappointing experience br br this version takes a different approach to several aspects of the play including sexuality one very very homosexual osric and an interesting interaction between hamlet and ophelia i think for the time 60's this was a very well done version of hamlet but cannot compare to branagh's complete version br br just a note i found the video at my local video store in australia and i'm actually looking for a keneth branagh dvd to buy if such a thing even exists if anyone knows of one please tell me
<START> i don't pretend to be an authority on actors who have played othello but i've never witnessed a performance of the play on film or on stage wherein othello was portrayed with more humanity and authenticity br br according to the biographical notes fishburne never received any professional training as an actor perhaps this explains why his acting in this beautifully edited film comes over as so believable and so powerful instead of chewing the scenery in the approved fashion for such high powered roles fishburne's portrayal is focused more on othello's love for his wife and on his profound sadness at her supposed betrayal than on violence and vengeance in a word the performance is understated and made far more impressive by fishburne's extremely intelligent interpretation than it otherwise would have been br br the acting throughout is superb and the abridged speeches gain grace from their light editing even shakesspeare after all can be improved upon now and again and if that be treason make the most of it
<START> birthday girl doesn't know what it wants to be is it a comedy is it a drama it just doesn't know what could have been a very funny or touching film ends up in no man's land the premise is original enough to have warranted a script full of interesting scenarios but hardly delivers any and ends up petering out this is a real shame if you look at the cast it's very solid all the way through but they don't get the chance to shine very disappointing
<START> i don't know who wrote the script for this movie but from the first moment on i was irritated of all possible decisions they could make up in the mountains why do they make the decision which is the most dangerous of all why do the criminals act dumb although they managed to get a huge amount of money out of a bank and get away with it why doesn't the main criminal land the helicopter shoot stallone grab the money and fly away with the chick as a hostage and there are more cases of illogical behavior i'd give this movie 5 points for nice action and great landscape scenery but due to the illogical behavior of the characters i just can give this movie 1 point
<START> my introduction into yoji yamada's cinematic world is through his famed and recent samurai trilogy with the twilight samurai the hidden blade and love and honor i had enjoyed all three films and looking at the prolific veteran director's filmography i think it'll take me a very long while to watch all his films especially the tora san series needless to say when kabei our mother has finally reached our shores i jumped at the chance to watch what would be an ode to mothers everywhere celebrating their innate love for their children br br based on the autobiography of teruyo nogami kabei our mother tells of a close knit family of four Â mother kayo kabei sayuri yoshinaga father shigeru tobei mitsugoro bando eldest daughter hatsu mirai shida and youngest child teru miku sato from the get go their lives would be changed forever when shigeru gets arrested under the peace preservation law for his morally controversial writings against the nation set in the late 30s where japan had begun their crusade in china and thereafter their participation in wwii br br so begins kabei's struggle to hold down jobs to feed her family and the frequent difficult meetings with her husband behind bars help comes from relatives especially on shigeru's side since kabei's own dad had adopted an i told you so attitude with her choice of spouse shigeru's one time student yama arthouse buffs should recognize tadanobu asano here provides laughter as a bumbling man who slowly becomes confidante and surrogate guardian to the children and kabei's sister in law hisako rei dan from hiroshima which i believe would have sounded some hindsight alarm bells as to her unfortunate fate as the film progresses through its timeline br br while the film centers primarily on how the kids are growing up under the presence of their mom and in a distant relationship with their dad what i enjoyed is how the microscopic family events unfold under the macroscopic worldwide events that have impacted on the common folk in japan it's against the historical backdrop of japan's push to regional dominance and there are characters here that don't mask those ambitions even discussing what the country would eventually do should it be successful in holding onto conquered lands this is something i rarely see in japanese films being that frank in their discussion of that era and also to get a glimpse of how the common man have to struggle against domestic issues made all the more difficult with resources channeled toward the war effort br br the actresses casted here are pitch perfect in their delivery and roles be they the veterans or the child actors actress sayuri yoshinaga deserves special mention for her role as the motherly figure who has to dig deep and find that inner strength to carry the household through under trying circumstances while mirai shida and miku sato are lovable as the understanding children who have to learn to make do and compromise each scene with the three of them together just makes it heart wrenching when the going gets tough or fill your heart with joy should they be celebrating before long you'll soon find yourself being attracted to want to be part of this family thanks to the primary cast's powerful performances with yoji yamada coaxing some really natural performances from the kids br br kabei our mother boasts some stunningly beautiful art direction and is classy in its delivery of both happy and sad moments without going over the top or relying on cheap melodrama to cheapen the emotions it seeks from the audience there are plenty of little things here done right which makes it pitch perfect with every scene not being wasted and with every nuance very meaningful in conveying its message across be it compassion or love br br aside from the very abrupt ending i had hoped that it could have continued for a lot more despite its more than 2 hours runtime kabei our mother comes highly recommended and you'll find it difficult to be holding back either your tears or that thought about your own mom and her sacrifices she makes for you on an everyday basis just what those sacrifices are should you need another reminder then the scene during the end credits roll will remind you of the stuff that you'd probably have taken for granted
<START> suppose you've been on a deserted island the last ten years haven't heard of scream and left when halloween part 1 entered the cinema then this movie would have been a blast and a completely new vision on the horror scene br br at the moment a 2 7 rating is on imdb and it doesn't deserve a that low appreciation slashing all the way like i know what you did and a who is it that when getting to the end convinced me of that who and why br br no big surprise just a nice flick to watch with a cola popcorn and no urge to get a difficult plot deep characters if the video rental is out of the top titles you can take it without a risk but don't expect a masterwork i've seen a lot worse
