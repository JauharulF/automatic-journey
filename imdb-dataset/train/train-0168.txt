<START> a lot of people don't think branagh's hamlet film is all that good but i must admit i think it is splendid like virtually every production of shakespeare it has problems and it has had to make hard choices not all of which work out the thing about the secret doors everywhere for instance simply doesn't work that element never achieves the ominous feeling of metaphor or analogy that it attempts to which results in the play being too gaudy and losing its trademark sense of a thousand mysteries looming this is the biggest problem with this production and while it's a biggie i'm also inclined to say that it's the only problem almost everything else works out absolutely beautifully all right so branagh is a mite too old for the title role and the relationship with ophelia seems a little forced and he gets too hysterical at times but that's it no other complaints even with these faults i think this version is a seminal one and if it's not as powerful a drama as it ought to be it's every bit the literary work that it equally ought to be we get the complete text of the longest version of the play innovatively and expensively brought to the screen mostly enunciated in perfect and modern and highly understandable voices even if they sometimes speak too quickly in order to get the massive text over with but in a staging of shakespeare it simply is not possible to speak slowly enough for the audience to really appreciate the full depths of the language for that one must delve into the print versions of the plays br br all the actors of this version are simply mesmerizing and utterly and instantly classic incl jack lemmon julie christie as gertrude is surely one of the best ever and even the american actors are astounding esp charlton heston as the player king who would have thought it a story is going around that heston once played hamlet on stage and when a critic in the front row couldn't stand his hammy acting and said out loud this is terrible heston reportedly retorted right from the stage well i didn't write this crap of course it may not be true but it's a funny story and if true a bold and ironic choice for branagh to include heston here robin williams as young ozric is perhaps not young enough for the part but he makes it a comical one which is warranted br br overall it is a very well produced version with most of the key scenes being to my mind supremely memorable of course i watched this movie just as i was becoming interested in shakespeare and around the same time as luhrmann's formidable romeo juliet and it made a great impression on me which must account for some of my fondness for it br br all things considered i must pronounce branagh's hamlet to be my favorite one with derek jacobi's 1980 bbc version a close second i probably like branagh's shakespeare work more than most finding him an expert interpreter and popularizer with an attractively casual attitude to the words and a deep and appropriately and unashamedly enthusiastic appreciation of the text in the world of shakespeare acting the two brightest luminaries remain olivier and branagh and while olivier is the superior actor branagh brings shakespeare down from the pedestal of snobbery and artifice and transforms it into churlish easy going populistic worldliness while compromising none of its dignity branagh i believe brings out a truer shakespeare than the world has yet seen br br and so 10 out of 10 for an absolutely tremendous hamlet
<START> this remarkable film can be summed up very easily first of all while the comparisons to princess bride are inevitable it's almost futile to do so while both films combine adult wit and humor with a fairy tale backdrop stardust is so much different than any other fantasy sci fi film i've ever seen it's such a hybrid of those genres but its plot and script are so unique that along with the performances special effects cinematography and score the finished product is simply not all that comparable to anything that has ever appeared on the silver screen secondly the score is very effective at simultaneously pulling us into the story and the fantasy world in which it takes place and pushing the story along while creating just the right amount of awe and excitement necessary to make the magic believable within the realm where the characters exist thirdly i did not find the film to be even remotely difficult to follow or confusing in any way in fact the interesting interplay between the three main subplots actually made it even that much more compelling to watch wonderfully casted and superbly acted across the board this fantasy adventure with sci fi elements was the best one i've seen since return of the king not that i am comparing the two at all ok so its not that easy to sum up but don't let any crude and or heartless and cynical review nor the film's pathetic pr prevent you from partaking in the best time you could have at the movies this summer or even possibly in a long time
<START> this film was really bad whether you take it as a sci fi movie as a horror one or even as a comedy the whole thing is ridiculous br br the film looks and is definitely cheap the actors have no idea of what acting is and the script shows clearly that it was being made along with the shooting it is obvious that the monster in the closet was added because the living head was not scary at all she was even pretty and they thought they needed something more impressive they failed here too the make up is awful even for the late 50's rather funny br br the film shows clearly why director joseph green's career as such and also as a writer never materialized he was really bad at both same goes to the actors leading and supporting br br the brain that wouldn't die 's best achievement is its short running time
<START> within the realm of science fiction two particular themes consistently elicit interest were initially explored in the literature of a pre cinematic era and have since been periodically revisited by filmmakers and writers alike with varying degrees of success the first theme that of time travel has held an unwavering fascination for fans of film as well as the written word most recently on the screen with yet another version of the h g wells classic the time machine ' the second theme which also manages to hold audiences in thrall is that of invisibility which sparks the imagination with it's seemingly endless and myriad possibilities and this theme too has again become the basis for a film adapted from another h g wells classic the invisible man ' the realization of which here is hollow man ' directed by paul verhoeven and starring kevin bacon and elisabeth shue br br sebastian caine bacon and his colleagues have for some time been conducting experiments for the u s government exploring the possibility and practicality of invisibility which they have at last achieved in a number of the primates upon which they have tested their method they have in fact progressed to the point that effecting the invisibility is assured their only problem now is bringing the subject back to the original visual' state of being it's a problem however that caine after diligent effort and too many hours in the lab has solved or so he thinks and when the application of his theory on a live subject is successful he decides to present the results to the board of directors in an effort to thereby maintain the funding necessary for the continuation of the project br br at the last minute though caine demurs fearing that control of the project will be wrested from him before they can proceed to the next level the testing of a human subject and he takes it upon himself to become that subject securing the assistance of his research team by telling them that they've been given approval by the board to do so but something goes wrong and caine becomes trapped in his cloak of invisibility and as he and his team struggle to find the solution to his considerable dilemma before it's too late it all begins to take a toll on caine's mind and suddenly his fear of losing funding and control becomes inconsequential as he finds himself facing the imminent danger of losing much more than that now there's a very real chance that he may lose everything including himself br br verhoeven has crafted what is initially an exciting even thought provoking film he establishes a good pace and uses the f x at his disposal to great effect though he does tend to allow the striking visuals to overwhelm the character development anyone familiar with the invisible man ' or actually anyone who can logically follow the progression of the story will know early on that caine is not destined for happier times still verhoeven has a style of storytelling that is definitely going to capture the attention and engage his audience but he seems bent on rushing toward the climax and along the way he abandons any and all of the nuance that has made his film thus far successful opting to enter into a final sequence that is nothing more than a mindless blood and gore fest that betrays his audience and everything he's worked for earlier in the film rather than seeking an intelligent resolution to caine's suffering and using some inventiveness and imagination to take the film to it's inevitable conclusion verhoeven takes the low road and though it may succeed on a purely visceral level any meaning one could derive from the story dissolves like so many ashes in the wind along with anything that would have made this a memorable film and it's a shame because verhoeven has it at a higher level than much of what is offered in this genre and he allows it to sink unnecessarily to one much lower br br kevin bacon does a good job of creating a character that is believable if only on the surface which seemingly serves verhoeven's purposes perfectly there's little depth to bacon's portrayal but it has more to do with his director's agenda than his own acting abilities verhoeven simply does not allow bacon the time to develop caine to any extent the character is mainly a vessel around which verhoeven can build his story and toward that end it works the film would have been better served however had verhoeven and bacon collaborated more closely on at least developing a bond between caine and the audience that would have prompted some emotional involvement on the viewers part something that would have drawn them in a bit rather than leaving them at the gate as it were as mere observers of an f x laden extravaganza br br elisabeth shue comports herself well in the role of linda mckay caine's willing accomplice in the ill fated experiment but it's basically a thankless part that offers little challenge especially to an actor of shue's caliber the same can be said of kim dickens so magnificent in the 2001 film things behind the sun' her character sarah kennedy does little more than support the action and f x both actors are capable of so much more and deserve better than what they are given to work with here br br the supporting cast includes josh brolin matthew greg grunberg carter joey slotnick frank mary randle janice and william devane dr kramer entertaining to a point and even successful on a certain low level hollow man' is one of those films that leaves you contemplating what could have been like an annual fireworks display it will give you some momentary thrills but after awhile it'll begin to blend in with all the others you've seen without anything special to set it apart and it's too bad because given the talent and abilities of those involved here it could have been so much more i rate this one 4 10 br br br br br br
<START> debut wow cross eyed is easily one of the most enjoyable indie films that i've watched in the past year making it hard to believe that cross eyed is the writer's debut film i mean i logged onto imdb to find more films by this writer because cross eyed has that unique signature you want to see what else this writer might have to say these days its rare to see a movie that is well written well directed well edited and well acted for me cross eyed encapsulates what movie making should be about combining the best of all film elements to create a clever artistic and poignant tale more please
<START> george and kim are traveling with their young son miles to a remote cabin in upstate new york when their car hits a deer and swerves into a ditch but what seems to be a mere occurrence of misfortune marks the beginning of a terrifying journey where myth becomes reality and a flesh eating spirit half animal and half man wendigo haunts a small town wendigo by larry fessenden is a thought provoking horror film that often tenderfoot's into a somber family drama the acting is great the characters are well developed and there are some bone chilling moments the subtle glimpses of wendigo are handled effectively and it's never clear what is real and what is imagined or even if the story is taking place entirely in miles' head overall wendigo is my first contact with larry fessenden's work and surely won't be the last give this film a chance if you don't mind watching something unconventional 8 out of 10
<START> i found this to be a surprisingly light handed touch at a 1950's culture clash movie john wayne would hardly be one's first choice as a cultural attache being about as diplomatic with his good intentions as a bull run in harrods but this time he was left to play a part that was far more passive than his usual bluff persona and he accomplished his task with style the duke was a guy who really could act well his facial expressions and body language could be extremely subtle br br despite his considerable presence both as an actor and in terms of screen time he failed to dominate this movie many of his good intentions came a cropper he had authority over nobody and the intermittent narrative was provided by the titular geisha to whom he was the barbarian br br the story of american attempts to curry favour with an isolationist japan was one of political intrigue rather than swashbuckling or hell for leather battles i cannot comment on the accuracy of its research but the strangeness of the oriental culture to western sensibilities was demonstrated well there was a great deal of minutely choreographed ceremony entailing what looked to this observer like authentic costume and props the set pieces were complex and detailed a lot of money and thought had been applied to it br br the fractured romance between wayne and his geisha added a little extra element and stopped the movie becoming just a political or flag waving effort script was good without being too wordy there was a great deal of japanese dialogue but the lengthy periods of translation didn't interfere with the narrative it was nice to see plenty of genuine orientals on the set whether or not they were japanese i couldn't say but anyway they looked the part at least the leads were not played by cross dressing caucasians unlike other efforts such as 'blood alley' yes i know they were chinese 'the inn of the sixth happiness' or even 'the king and i' br br frankly i enjoyed this more than any of those other movies the script was better for a start i never liked the songs in 'the king and i' and wasn't impressed by the heavy laden anti communist subtext of 'blood alley' i confess to never having seen this work before and found it compared very favourably to many of the duke's more popular outings br br recommended
<START> only children below the age of 12 should be allowed to see this film the rest of us should take a book mp3 player or just take a nice nap to endure the experience of this event this can be best summed up as a blown up tv movie being distributed into theaters children will want to see this film and they will like and be amused by the movie
<START> prof janos rukh boris karloff discovers radium x a powerful force to be used for atomic power unfortunately rukh has been contaminated by the radium and starts to glow in the dark and his touch causes instant death dr felix benet bela lugosi develops an antidote but rukh starts to go mad due to the radium and the antidote and sets out to kill all he believed wronged him br br the plot is silly and the effects that make karloff glow in the dark are laughable but this is still a fun little chiller it moves quickly has some great atmosphere notice rukh's house and the movie starts on a dark and rainy night and karloff and lugosi as always give great performances there is also good acting by franic drake as rukh's wife and violet kemble cooper as his mother so it's ok but just a notch below all the other karloff lugosi movies the plot is just too far fetched for me to swallow still i did like this i give it a 7
<START> talk about a dream cast just two of the most wonderful actors who ever appeared anywhere peter ustinov and maggie smith together in hot millions a funny quirky comedy also starring karl malden robert morley and bob newhart ustinov is an ex con embezzler who gets the resume of a talented computer programmer morley and takes a position in a firm run by malden with the goal of embezzlement in mind it's not smooth sailing he has attracted the attention of his competitor at the company played by newhart and his neighbor maggie smith who knows him at their place of residence under another name becomes his secretary for a brief period she can't keep a job and she is seen throughout the film in a variety of employment all ending with her being fired when newhart makes advances to her she invites ustinov over to her flat for curry as a cover up but the two soon decide they're made for each other of course she doesn't know ustinov is a crook br br this is such a good movie you can't help but love ustinov and smith and be fascinated by ustinov's machinations his genius and the ways he slithers out of trouble but there's a twist ending that will show you who really has the brains don't miss this movie set in '60s london it's worth if it only to hear maggie smith whine i've been sacked
<START> i had suspicions the movie was going to be bad i'm a duke's fan from way back have three years of the tv series on dvd well i was right took the family to see it i really wanted to see the general jump again and some of the chase jump scenes were good but to sum it up the movie was a dumbed down tarted up version of the tv show br br jessica simpson was pathetic while i can honestly say that the original daisy's outfits were just as revealing jessica simpson's interpretation of daisy was simply awful sorrel booke and denver pyle must be rolling in their graves as well br br don't waste your money if you are an old tried and true dukes fan like me and my three kids are you will be very disappointed
<START> years ago i saw the godfather and it made a lasting impression on me the atmosphere of the movie was first class the acting memorable and the storyline a classic recently i bought the trilogy and after watching part 1 again i looked eagerly to viewing part 2 i was so pleased to realize early on into part 2 that here was a fitting follow on to the great godfather movie again everything was just about perfect and i could not wait to see godfather iii wrong i wish i'd stopped at ii the storyline was not good it seemed to me like a story made up just to have a story the characters were weak especially the daughter pacino's protege was a weak character that would have been eaten alive in godfather 1 or 2 then scenes such as corleone being invested with all the trappings of the catholic church with full choir the assassin on horseback riding away into the sunset the unseen helicopter machine gunning of the meeting where the 'goodies' get away and everyone else is shot daughter and 1st cousin rolling bits of pasta across a board the pathetic shooting on the steps corleone stuffing sweets down him with orange juice for diabetes a man of his intelligence and guile isn't ready for an emergency no it was not good and with the best will in the world i wont be able to watch it again but i'll watch 1 2 many times down the years
<START> this is quite an unusual and unique little western that is made mostly original due to its story that revolves around an unique and superior winchester 1873 rifle and all of those who get to poses it at one point or another in the movie br br it's mostly a very entertaining movie to watch but not without still being a real western as well the movie got done in a typical '40's '50's style of western genre film making so the lovers of the genre should not be turned off by its somewhat unusual main premise br br because the rifle is actually being the main plot device of the movie it allows the story to follow multiple characters throughout the movie who are all connected of course and the story makes full circle in the end without that this movie would had been a pretty messy one to watch since the story often jumps from the one hazardous occasion into the other with constantly different characters involved quite amazing how they even managed to put wyatt earp in this all but it's no criticism really i liked that the movie and its story were being original and how the movie seemed to move from the one event to the other it gave the movie a bit of a sense of adventure and entertainment br br it's also a really great looking movie i liked the settings the movie used and it seems quite amazing that this was actually the director anthony mann's first western luckily he would go on to direct more westerns later on which also often would star james stewart in the main lead br br it was a pretty daring casting choice to pick james stewart as the main lead he is one of the softest and most polite looking and acting actors so casting him as a tough gunslinger seems like a bit of an odd pick but stewart is surprisingly convincing as a tough guy and it shows how versatile and really capable as an actor he actually was br br it also has some other surprising actors in the movie that are not often get connected with this genre shelley winters plays the female lead and also later well known actors rock hudson and tony curtis appear in some small roles br br a real western with also plenty of action and entertainment to it br br 8 10
<START> as steven segal movies go this one is bottom of the barrel his best was just fodder for bored teenagers this one tips the scales then falls off the characters are all cardboard the story is double lame i can't spoil it by telling you the ending you already know how all steven segal movies end if you have seen one here goes he is a super dooper government agent who know too much to turn loose so they decide instead of killing him to dope his brain until he don't remember squat he escapes of course gets arrested and is located by his old general who needs his one man in a million experience to get back a stealth plane that has been handed over to a terrorist gang in afghanastan by a rogue air force pilot who surprise surprise segal trained all the heroes except segal's character and his dusky girlfriend die heroically and steve baby save the whole world in one swell foop or fell swoop whatever made with some surplus air force and navy flying film and a lot of boom booms get some popeye cartoons instead
<START> look if i were interested in a nancy drew book what i would do is pick up a book and read it i'm not ever since i can remember i read people trashing movies because it wasn't like the book i'm sorry in the digital age we can no longer watch movies on flip books however i'm sure you can still find a few short silent films in book form when lord of the rings came out people complained when the third one won an oscar the book was better when i watched to kill a mockingbird the book was better now a bunch of people are upset yet again because nancy drew wasn't like the book i'm not saying nancy drew is going to win any oscars if anything it'll be one of those nickelodeon blimps or kids choice awards i'm saying give film a break it's film not paper as a movie i found nancy drew quite enjoyable featuring cameos from bruce willis and adam goldberg the hebrew hammer and supporting roles featuring tate donovan jimmy cooper on the o c and rachel leigh cook she's all that this is the first time i've seen emma roberts in a movie and frankly i enjoy her work more than most of julia and of eric's her character stays consistent throughout the film and reacts well with conflict a lighthearted movie in the spirit of harriet the spy is nice now and again br br i give it ten stars because i thoroughly enjoyed the movie would love to see it again and will probably buy it upon dvd release
<START> i vaugely recall seeing this when i was 3 years old then my parents accidentally taped over all but a few seconds of it with some other cartoon then i was about 8 or 9 years old when i rediscovered it and since i was then able to comprehend things better i thought it was a good movie then fast forward to just a few weeks ago june 2006 when i re re discovered it thanks to some internet articles video clips and it's just not the same movie i'm sure it's still good with the kids but to us 20 30 somethings it's definitely got cult status written all over it it's a shame that the original production went through a painful process if fox gave it enough time it would probably be more recognized in the public eye today maybe if they were to remake it with a totally different story and an all star voice cast it could be but that's for fox to decide i'm rambling here i know i still think it's a great film but it could be better than great
<START> if this film had a budget of 20 million i'd just like to know where the money went a monkey could make better cgi effects then what was wasted for 3 hours on this dreadful piece of garbage although i must admit the machines and the martians would have looked really really cool on an original play station 1 game and early pc games from the mid 90s if a game had ever been made what puzzles me is where did the money go pendragon films could have made a great film with good old fashioned models and computer controlled cameras a la george lucas circa 1975 83 and actors who actually look like they care about what they are doing or ruining in this case for about the same 20 million this is quite possibly the worst film ever made i would rather sit through a 24 hour repeat screening of ishtar than watch this film again i hated it completely i regress i say this is the worst film ever made because unlike other bad movies like plan 9 or killer tomatoes or santa claus conquers the martians these are films that are so bad you have a special place in your heart for them you love them there is no love for this film and no place in my dvd library for it i sold it to a guy for a dollar i'm betting the money for the film was spent on booze and other vices for the cast and crew shame on you pendragon films i want my money back
<START> a cowboy sympathetic to the plight of a nearby indian tribe is wrongly accused in the rape and murder of the chief's daughter leading to much hate and violence br br this crackpot nudie feature is fun to look at though thoroughly impossible to defend on any artistic level the terrible costumes and the fact that all the indians are obviously white makes this look more like a live action cartoon than the serious production that it's press materials pretends it to be br br in short the plentiful nudity the real reason for watching this is good everything else is not there's definitely better examples of both genres br br more interesting is that the ramrodder was filmed at the infamous spahn movie ranch and features not one but two members of the manson family catherine share and bobby beausoleil who was probably already in the can for murder at the time this hit the soda stained screens of the pussycat theater
<START> lot of silly plot holes in the film first we see him watching his master practice kung fu and die in the midst of his practice that's fine with me and then at the end of the film we see him use the kung fu that he learned just by watching his master when he was still a kid is that even possible i don't think so br br this show is purely for jay chou fans and the film lacks a depth in terms of character development cinematography styles and unfolding of plot br br anybody notice that the captain of the basket team forgot his name and the idolized player li xiao look so similar to each other to the extent that you'd think they were the one and same person long hair sunshine boy look tall and strong the two of them looked like they came out from a mass production factory designed to churn out products that makes teenage girls scream wild in orgasm not that those two actors had anything of value to contribute to the movie as a whole for the movie industry at all br br the jokes were lame and not funny at all br br the scene with regards to the 4 masters of jay chou coming back to help him out in the basketball court degenerated into a pointless plot when they started bashing their opponents ala royal rumble style worse of all when the 4 masters won the fight the crowd began cheering and the match continued it was truly a wtf moment br br at the end of the show when they win the match all thanks to jay chou's excellent kung fu skills how he acquired those kung fu skills is a mystery because the show somehow shows him acquiring the skills just by observing his master br br and then his long lost father comes out of the woodwork to acknowledge jay chou as his long lost son seemed just a tad too quick of the director to wrap up the film br br in short this is a jay chou flick instead of the usual chick flick watch it only if jay chou is your fan if you are one of those whose tastes in movies coincide greatly with those in the list of imdb's top 250 films of all time then this film is not for you
<START> i love these diaper baby movies you couldn't make a movie like this today and it is rich in cinematic history it is goofy and the film was made to make you laugh which it does how they ever got these kids to act i'll never know i think they are precious and the kids make me laugh but so do the others who made this movie as it shows the naivetÃ© that existed in the early 30's you have to remember that this is when the film industry was very young the stock market had crashed the world wide depression was beginning and these films were made to give a person a break from the real world the fact that you could see movies for five cents is beyond my comprehension but then dinner for 25 cents is too it was a different time with a totally different mind set
