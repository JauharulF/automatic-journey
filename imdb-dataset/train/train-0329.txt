<START> this movie is so bad it's comical in fact mystery science theatre 3000 the television show in which three characters watch and parody bad movies used this very film to mock i suggest watching it maybe on youtube instead of actually seeing this movie br br please do not see hobgoblins if you're not prepared to stop within the first scene actually do not see this movie period please at least not seriously its jokes are not funny to say the least and you'll have much more fun parodying or watching a parody of it then viewing the movie br br you may feel yourself becoming sick upon watching so spare yourself read a book do the laundry anything is more fun than watching hobgoblins
<START> i have no idea how a texan the director douglas mcgrath and the american actress gwyneth paltrow ever pulled this off but seeing this again will remind you what all the fuss about ms paltrow was in the first place i had long since gone off the woman and still feel she is rather dull in her oscar winning shakespeare in love performance but she gets all the beats right here she is nigh on perfect as emma woodhouse she may have won her oscar for shakespeare but she should be remembered for this br br of course she's surrounded by a great supporting cast including toni collette greta scacchi juliette stevenson et al jeremy northam is very appealing as the love interest even if the script wallows a bit in his declaration of love to paltrow in the process allowing all of the tension to drain out of their relationship several years on ewan's hair is a little easier to take than it was in '96 and personally i find puckish alan cumming a grating presence in anything nowadays but the standout is without a doubt sophie thompson sister of emma thompson daughter of phyllida law as miss bates what this version needs is a scene where emma reconciles with miss bates as she is the character to whose fate we are drawn the film is worth watching again even for her performance alone br br all in all this has aged wonderfully with charm to spare and more than enough subtlety to sort out the british class system well worth a rental because its unlikely that paltrow will ever be this good again but we'll always have emma
<START> dÃ´ desu ka den is the first colored movie of master akira kurosawa and surprisingly is not about samurais ronins warlords or battlefields it is inside a very poor community in a slum in tokyo where the dwellers are homeless drunkards beggars tramps abused women losers i do not know the reason why kurosawa selected this tragic theme and environment to put colors but indeed they are very sad stories some of them heart breaking i personally like the touching story of the boy and his father that dream with a house of their own and built by them the story of the retarded boy that believes he pilots a train the story of the man that raises five children as if they were their own sons and daughters and the story of the young woman abused by her stepfather my vote is nine br br title brazil dodeskaden Â o caminho da vida dodeskaden Â the way of the life
<START> the second official episode of the columbo series murder by the book filmed later hit the airwaves first robert culp who would match wits with peter falk's detective in several future installments is terrific as the short tempered head of a sophisticated private detective agency who murders a client's wife when she refuses to cave in to his blackmail schemes the two stars are well matched in this clever cat and mouse exercise that is one of the best in the series
<START> hollywood hotel has relationships to many films like ella cinders and merton of the movies about someone winning a contest including a contract to make films in hollywood only to find the road to stardom either paved with pitfalls or non existent in fact as i was watching it tonight on turner classic movies i was considering whether or not the authors of the later musical classic singing in the rain may have taken some of their ideas from hollywood hotel most notably a temperamental leading lady star in a movie studio and a conclusion concerning one person singing a film score while another person got the credit by mouthing along on screen br br hollywood hotel is a fascinating example of movie making in the 1930s among the supporting players is louella parsons playing herself and despite some negative comments i've seen she has a very ingratiating personality on screen and a natural command of her lines she is not the only real person in the script make up specialist perc westmore briefly appears as himself to try to make one character resemble another br br this film also was one of the first in the career of young mr ronald reagan playing a radio interviewer at a movie premiere reagan actually does quite nicely in his brief scenes particularly when he realizes that nobody dick powell is about to take over the microphone when it should be used with more important people br br dick powell has won a hollywood contract in a contest and is leaving his job as a saxophonist in benny goodman's band the beginning of this film by the way is quite impressive as the band drives in a parade of trucks to give a proper goodbye to powell they end up singing hooray for hollywood the interesting thing about this wonderful number is that a lyric has been left out on purpose throughout the johnny mercer lyrics are references to such hollywood as max factor the make up king rin tin tin and even a hint of tarzan but the original song lyric referred to looking like tyrone power obviously jack warner and his brothers were not going to advertise the leading man of 20th century fox and the name donald duck was substituted in any event the number showed the singers and instrumentalists of goodman's orchestra at their best so did a later five minute section of the film where the band is rehearsing br br powell leaves the band and his girl friend frances langford and goes to hollywood only to find he is a contract player most likely for musicals involving saxophonists he is met by allen joslyn the publicist of the studio the owner is grant mitchell joslyn is not a bad fellow but he is busy and he tends to slough off people unless it is necessary to speak to them he parks powell at a room at the hollywood hotel which is also where the studio's temperamental star lola lane lives with her father hugh herbert her sister mabel todd and her sensible if cynical assistant glenda farrell lane is like jean hagen in singing in the rain except her speaking voice is good her version of dan lockwood is one alexander dupre alan mowbray scene stealing with ease several times the only difference is that mowbray is not a nice guy like gene kelly was and lane when not wrapped up in her ego is fully aware of it having a fit on being by passed for an out of the ordinary role she wanted she refuses to attend the premiere of her latest film joslyn finds a double for her lola's real life sister rosemary lane and rosemary is made up to play the star at the premiere and the follow up party but she attends with powell joslyn wanting someone who doesn't know the real lola this leads to powell knocking down mowbray when the latter makes a pest of himself but otherwise the evening is a success and when the two are together they start finding each other attractive br br the complications deal with lola coming back and slapping powell in the face after mowbray complains he was attacked by powell and his gang of hoodlums powell's contract is bought out working with photographer turned agent ted healey actually not too bad in this film he even tries to do a jolson imitation at one point the two try to find work ending up as employees at a hamburger stand run by bad tempered edgar kennedy the number of broken dishes and singing customers in the restaurant give edgar plenty of time to do his slow burns with gusto eventually powell gets a break by being hired to be dupre's singing voice in a rip off of gone with the wind this leads to the final section of the film when rosemary lane herbert and healey help give powell his chance to show it's his voice not mowbrays br br it's quite a cute and appealing film even now the worst aspects are due to it's time several jokes concerning african americans are no longer tolerable while trying to photograph powell as he arrives in hollywood healey accidentally photographs a porter and mentions to joslyn to watch out powell photographs too darkly get the point also a bit with curt bois as a fashion designer for lola lane who is shall we say too high strung is not very tolerable either herbert's hoo hoo ing is a bit much too much of the time but it was really popular in 1937 and an incident where healey nearly gets into a brawl at the premiere this was one of his last films reminds people of the tragic still mysterious end of the comedian in december 1937 but most of the film is quite good and won't disappoint the viewer in 2008
<START> the williams family live on a ranch located in the middle of the remote desert they find themselves in considerable peril when the place is suddenly thrust into a time vortex where the past present and future collide in a wildly chaotic and unpredictable manner director john bud cardos begins the film on a compellingly mysterious note and gradually allows things to get stranger crazier and more exciting as the loopy story unfolds moreover cardos fills the screen with plenty of dazzling visuals and does a nice job of creating a genuine sense of awe and wonder the admirably sincere acting from a game cast qualifies as another major plus jim davis as hearty patriarch grant williams dorothy malone as his cheery wife ana christopher mitchum as the concerned richard marcy lafferty as his lovely wife beth natasha ryan as sweet little girl jenny and scott c kolden as the gutsy steve the funky special effects offer an inspired combo of gnarly miniatures neat stop motion animation monsters said creatures include a tiny spindly hairless guy a big lumpy fanged beast and a scrawny lizard dude and nifty matte paintings richard band's rousing full bore orchestral score really hits the stirring spot john arthur morrill's crisp sunny cinematography likewise does the trick a fun flick
<START> i am a huge fan of the comic book series but this movie fell way below my expectations i expected a heavy metal 2000 kinda feel to it slow moving bad dialogue lots o' blood but this was worse than anything i could have imagined br br the plot line is almost the same as the comic but the good points pretty much stop there the characters don't have the energy or spirit that drew my attention in the comic series the movie only covers a small portion of the comic and the portion used is more slow and boring than later parts the focus in the movie is on the insignificant events instead of the more interesting overall plot of the comic book br br with the right people working on this project it could have been amazing sadly it wasn't that way so now there is yet another terrible movie that few will see and even fewer will love my copy will surely collect dust for years until i finally throw it out
<START> screenwriter lisa lutz began writing the screenplay at the age of 21 in 1991 br br is she even in business if someone gave her another chance after this piece of crap she's up for the most fortunate person of ever award this movie sucks to no end it never ceases to amaze me what the turn into movies and the fact that they made this writer put it off for a bit seriously i can write better crap than this in my sleep br br ok so how many lines to i have to type i don't get this at all i guess i m a newbie i guess i don't understand why there should ever be a limit to what anyone has to say or a quota seriously i don't care if you have a one word sentence or even a one word response i mean c'mon br br thanks is this enough finally br br this movie is worthless
<START> lorne michaels once again proves that he has absolutely no business producing movies br br you'd think that after such dismal flicks superstar night at the roxbury and coneheads he'd start to get the notion that maybe he doesn't know what he's doing when it comes to movies and many would argue that he doesn't know what he's doing when it comes to television as well trying to make feature films out of skits that wore out their welcome the third time the were done on snl makes no sense br br i personally like tim meadows and think that he would be great in the right movie it's a shame to see a talented guy wasted in a film that features unfunny after unfunny situation and caps it all with a dreadfully bad song and dance scene any laughs here will be because the movie is so bad not because it's funny br br oh well at least we can be thankful that there are many other tired snl characters who will never have films done about them it's just too bad that this one made it to the big screen
<START> contrary to popular belief this title to me at least is not so very bad in fact i regard it as a favoured film of all time the welding of stories wasn't structured too well when you consider the differences between the series however despite all this you can watch it quite happily for a feature film of its day the scenes are well proportioned and the characters remain consistently believable br br the sound audio track is a personal favourite of mine nearly everything has a correct sound effect and many of the voices suit the characters much better than their now badly cast us dub counterparts the sync is perfect in every shot i had a few issues with the casting for the 'alien' voices please forgive the crude naming it has been a while since i've seen it otherwise however the cast seemed perfectly balanced i feel and believe in the characters of this movie dubs are often a subject i rarely agree with from so long ago i loved the osd's from back then but the castings often let series down br br at this point i would like to add that this was one of the first anime i saw in my life it has historical value to me but even after seeing the original megazone 23 it remained stronger and more watched in my collection br br to my knowledge the title only ever made it to the us in texas personally i think its a big shame had the correct audience been subject to it i think robotech the movie would have been accepted and not tarnished over the years i am involved with anime each day of my life and everyone i have shown this movie thought it was a nicely put together title br br watching the film after its separate components will allow the viewer to notice the evident plot holes between shows however without seeing the originals a viewer wouldn't really notice since the animation is identical in style there was no reason to question it back in its day the uk had very limited access to anime laser discs were the most productive media personally i like the way carl had the balls to at least push the genre i mean harmony wasn't going to put up the cash for the series to get publicised br br despite the few picky faults people have had with this film the eighties feel of it keeps me in love if you watch megazone 23 now to its original japanese audio or the new dub i believe you will be greatly disappointed with the osd cast your minds back to the original bubblegum crisis dub soundtrack and imagine new eighties audio to e v e br br saying all this this film's popularity nowadays is most likely down to its rarity on the open market personally it spawned a collection for me i'm now scouring the world for merchandise from the three components that made it up and if i ever get to meet carl macek ill shake his hand for the effort and buy him a pint or a crate for getting me into anime
<START> this is my favorite classic it was filmed a little west of philadelphia pa when i was 13 in 1957 and released the next year then in 1970 i found myself working the very same county as a rookie pa state trooper i have always enjoyed checking out the different places where scenes were filmed i knew the owner of the downingtown diner well and he had a road sign out front which told all passing motorists that this was the home of the blob the theater scene was in phoenixville near valley forge park and it is still showing films today
<START> it is a frank zappa axiom that music journalism is people who can't write interviewing people who can't talk for people who can't read if you ever needed proof that musicians can't talk this is the film for you repeated attempts at profundity stumble over themselves to end up in monosyllabic comments delivered in awestruck voices wow thank you idris muhammed this film is pretentious but while much of the pontificating from youssou n'dour and his gang of merry men and one token woman grates the music saves the day br br the main idea behind the film what i take to be the main idea dredged out of the inarticulate commentary is interesting to gather a group of musicians from america and europe and take them on a journey through the different styles of music that grew up in and out of slavery back to their roots in the music of west africa and a concert in the old slave fort of gorÃ©e off the coast of senegal we are treated to gospel blues jazz and variations of these including some fantastic drumming both in new orleans and senegal there's also a good deal of n'dour's own compositions br br sadly that's another weakness it's never entirely clear what n'dour himself wants to achieve to some degree the film appears to be an exercise in self promotion on n'dour's part he wants to play his own music jazzed up to some degree and performed in the company of a bunch of musicians he admires he's clearly a little embarrassed by this and early in the film obtains the blessings of the curator of the gorÃ©e museum br br the clash between the different agendas shows through in several other places for example somebody obviously felt that it was not possible to tell the story of black music without involving a gospel choir but n'dour and most of his mates are moslems a point made repeatedly throughout the film the whole early sequence involving the black christians is uncomfortable and then they disappear from the story until the close harmony group the only black christians who can hold a tone turn up in dakar at the end of the film to be fair they turn up triumphantly and perform the best piece in the film if the story of black music needs to nod in the direction of gospel why not also in the direction of latin america where are the black musical influences from the caribbean and brazil samba reggae then there's europe here the black diaspora doesn't seem to have produced any musicians of calibre since n'dour chooses to draft in austrian guitarist and a trumpet player from luxemburg are they in the team just because n'dour has played with him before what i personally found most irritating though was the long sequence which tried to recreate a kind of 60s beatnik black power nation of islam cultural happening in the new york home of amir baraka a k a leroi jones hearing people talk about the importance of knowing your history and then in the next breath perpetuating ignorance why do so many african americans believe that taking an arabic name is an assertion of their african roots and why do they think arabic islam is so much more admirable than european christianity who do they think established the trade in african slaves in the first place the film doesn't have much to say about the situation in west africa today beyond the platitude that present conditions are a consequence of all the brightest and best having been shipped away for 300 years the senegalese appear to be a poor but happy musical gifted folk friendly and welcoming respectful of their elders and not above fleecing the visiting americans in the fish market is this ethnic stereotyping or just my imagination there is no comment on the armed guard that n'dour and the camera crew seem to need in the opening sequence as they walk through the streets of dakar br br there is also a strong implication in the film that the slaves who were taken from dakar came from dakar the similarity between the folk drumming style of new orleans and the folk drumming style of senegal is cited in evidence the last thing the slaves heard before they were shipped away was the drumming of their homeland bidding them farewell except of course that by and large the slaves shipped from dakar did not come from dakar they were captured or traded from the interior by the coastal senegalese and sold to merchants of whichever european power currently held the gorÃ©e slave fort the people of dakar are not the descendents of africans who escaped the slave trade they are just as likely Â more likely Â to be descendents of the people who sold their black brethren into slavery and exile br br the two agenda's clash again in the final part of the film there are two separate endings on the one hand the concert which n'dour and co have been rehearsing and preparing along the way and which they deliver in the courtyard of the gorÃ©e slave fort the other end comes when the harmony harmoneers sing the spiritual return to glory in the seaward doorway of the slave fort this is deeply moving even if it is hard to believe the performance is quite as spontaneous as it appears br br this is a film that is flawed unclear of the story it is trying to tell and tugged in different directions irritating confusing beautiful and emotional by turns watch it listen to it for the music and the feeling but don't expect enlightenment or intellectual rigour
<START> i can't for the life of me remember why i must have had a free ticket or something but i saw this movie in the theater when it was released i don't remember who i went with which theater i was in or even which city all i remember was how offended i was at this travesty someone dared to call a film and how half the people in the theater walked out before the movie was over unfortunately i stuck it out to end which i still consider to be one of the worst mistakes of my life thus far my offense became pure horror when just before the closing credits the smarmy demon child sticks his head out from behind a sign and says look for problem child 2 coming soon that was hands down the most terrifying moment ever recorded on film br br the plot if i recall correctly involved john ritter and perhaps his wife lord how i've tried without success to block this film out of my mind adopting a problem child maybe they think they can reform him or something i really don't know if that was their intent they fail miserably because from first frame to last this child remains the brattiest rudest most horrid demon spawn ever to hit the big screen forget damian forget rosemary's baby this kid takes the cake the only difference is we are supposed to feel sorry for him because he's a problem child however this is impossible since this child is quite likely the most unsympathetic character ever portrayed you want to kill him through the entire film and when spoiler like anyone cares john ritter decides to keep the vile hell child you will be yelling send him back in shocked disgust like several of the people at the theater where i saw it did br br this is only the second movie i have given a 1 to on the imdb the other was superman iv and by god i couldn't tell you which was worse john ritter had a quote in tv guide about the time that problem child 3 which he was not in came out he said something like the only way i would do another problem child sequel is if they dragged my dead body back to perform amen to that br br i would rather watch a 24 hour marathon of police academy sequels than see even twenty minutes of problem child again 1 10 only because i can't give it a negative score which is what it really deserves someone burn the original negatives of this film please
<START> it's a bad very bad movie br br well for people a real realistic movie is a good thing for me it is not life is also predictable bad nasty trivial senseless sometimes maybe that's the reason for people say that this film is real br br too many common places you're black you're a criminal you're doomed and cursed whatever you do you'll end up by shooting or being shot by someone don't let the kids play with the weapons it could be dangerous and then there are those who go to the church and then they are good very good br br before this one i hadn't seen such a bad movie that's perhaps the reason for i never noticed how important the photography itself is important in a movie in this one every scene shot in daytime outdoor is clearly and annoyingly blue they didn't even care to correct the colour balance oh i've rated more than 300 movies in this database so far and this 3 10 is my lowest ever
<START> this is only the second time i stopped a video dvd part way through br br i was willing to give this film the benefit of the doubt at first even though it managed to be both shallow clichÃ©d and stupid and joyless plodding and pretentious br br it was like an after school special directed by that weird grade nine kid who thinks nobody understands him creepy and sad with voice over narration that only the most deluded adolescent would consider poetry and some singing and no really the poor child's suffering br br enough already especially when it morphed into a brazen clumsy and insulting clockwork orange ripoff and did i mention the singing br br this isn't the worst film i've ever seen but certainly the one i've felt least compelled to sit through i don't recommend it to anyone
<START> i was looking for a cute simple comedy to pass the time but choosing this film proved to be an enormous mistake br br i can't write a single good thing about it first the script is stupid and not funny at all relying on tired recycled jokes and a farting turtle for laughs in my book that's not funny that's pathetic br br low budget 'effects' if i can even call them effects with horrible cinematography in many places it feels almost like an indie film shot with no money br br acting i feel sorry for the actors are pamela anderson and denise richards that desperate for some money that they've agreed to take part in this looking at their recent filmography it would appear so despite the outfits pamela is showing her age and as a whole they don't even come across as sexy let alone funny br br this movie is not even in the so bad it is funny category it's just bad as if everybody involved was sick of it br br avoid
<START> worry not disney fans this special edition dvd of the beloved cinderella won't turn into a pumpkin at the strike of midnight one of the most enduring animated films of all time the disney fide adaptation of the gory brothers grimm fairy tale became a classic in its own right thanks to some memorable tunes including a dream is a wish your heart makes bibbidi bobbidi boo and the title song and some endearingly cute comic relief the famous slipper click for larger image we all know the story the wicked stepmother and stepsisters simply won't have it this uppity cinderella thinking she's going to a ball designed to find the handsome prince an appropriate sweetheart but perseverance animal buddies and a well timed entrance by a fairy godmother make sure things turn out all right there are a few striking sequences of pure animation for example cinderella is reflected in bubbles drifting through the air and the design is rich and evocative throughout it's a simple story padded here agreeably with comic business particularly cinderella's rodent pals dressed up conspicuously like the dwarf sidekicks of another famous disney heroine and their misadventures with a wretched cat named lucifer there's also much harrumphing and exposition spouting by the king and the grand duke it's a much simpler and more graceful work than the more frenetically paced animated films of today which makes it simultaneously quaint and highly gratifying
<START> one of the more intelligent serial killer movies in recent history zodiac killer offers an imaginative take on the background and history of one of the most notorious serial killers the filmmakers create an unexpectedly good insight into the pathology of this mysterious killer and anyone who remembers zodiac will be intrigued others will want to discover more about this enigmatic criminal unlike many serial killers zodiac was not insane at all but very methodical and a self promoter the director here plays viewer expectations and pulls it off the film is constructed as a murder mystery or a cold case style thriller it is an intelligent investigative procedural style horror film that will put off gore hounds in search of cheap thrills br br some people dislike any movie that is shot on video this attitude is very old style and provincial it is an attitude and view of movies that puts technical issues above entertainment value or artistic value these attitudes are on the way out zodiac killer is a low budget film no doubt but discerning viewers will look beyond that and find a carefully crafted gem
<START> deep sh is more like it the eels are just cartooned in over the film think the incredible mr limpet meets leviathan very tacky br br no character or relationship development so called romantic scenes very corny and predictable an interesting idea but a poorly written script and lousy special effects make this a definite must miss
<START> all day now i've been watching dinosaurs and all day they've had the same fundamental problem br br they don't believe in firearms they just don't seem to have been told about them or something bullets bounce off of dinosaurs maybe it's because they became extinct millions of years before the invention of gunpowder and the laws of physics were just different back then aah no come on if they're close enough to chemically operate today they'd have to be vulnerable to fast even subsonic lead projectiles it's that simple br br look the toughest skinned reptiles on the planet today alligators and crocodiles are completely vulnerable to basic rifle fire they're nothing magic you can shoot a pistol round right through the heavy scales on their backs they don't take armor piercing bullets or anything special small bullets penetrate them they just don't kill them somewhat but not really large bullets are preferred because the challenge as with most game is to kill the animal with one shot so it doesn't run hunters consider it immoral to allow prey to run off and die unharvested br br most animals including predators are easily repelled by gunfire between the noise and the pain of even a non lethal wound most will run away an exception are big bears which are so fearless that they're merely enraged by mortal wounds cape buffalo are regarded as highly dangerous because they are well known to charge when wounded we've seen video of the big bulls of a herd of cape buffalo rescuing a calf from an entire pride of lions a big cat will run if it can but if it can't it will charge as a final act of desperation where a t rex would fit in this spectrum is unknown their behavior simply has not been observed with these larger animals safe hunting becomes a matter of applying an appropriately large and powerful projectile and or applying several of them rapidly enough to counter its charge with a t rex of course this could be a serious problem i've seen a t rex skull they have one in the museum downtown and carrying a gun big enough to bust that might be impractical chewing its neck off with lots of smaller fire might be a more viable approach small bullets would still penetrate them they wouldn't just bounce off just because the animal is too big to easily kill br br so here we have cortez and his men this is before the famous mexican campaign apparently captured by american natives and scheduled for sacrifice on the pyramid it appears that all those human sacrifices were about appeasing the bloodthirst of the pair of t rexes that terrorized the continent in the day rather than just having their hearts cut out and being fed to the lizards cortez et al talk the aztecs into letting them hunt kill them ok maybe they don't have m 16s like the guys in the carnosaur series but they do have flintlocks crossbows pointed sticks big ones made from trees and swords maybe that's a little less uneven than squads of soldiers with full auto but they've several guys and i'd quickly bet on them over a dinosaur oh wait there's a cannon about a 4 incher that's just the ticket for busting a tyrannosaurus' skull so they lay a trap with a squad of men cannon pointed sticks in a ravine and lure the first t rex into it using a pretty brown girl as bait cortez points out that they'll not have time to reload so they'll have to close the range until they can be certain of their aim t rex totally ignores their volley of flintlock fire and we see both a crossbow bolt and the cannon ball bounce off forget it end of credibility a crossbow bolt would defeat cortez' torso armor and a 4 cannon ball might penetrate the hull of a wooden ship this would also certainly get through the hide ribcage or skull of any animal ever to walk this planet do you think a whale could withstand a 4 cannon ball and here's t rex still standing not even bleeding so cortez lures it to the ravine where it falls onto the pointed sticks which i guess by magic penetrate it and kill it yaaay pointed sticks br br the dinos aren't completely invulnerable to gunfire they manage to put out an eye of the second one with a pistol this runs it off so it's not as mean as a bear or a buffalo at least in the movies br br they kill the second dinosaur with a bomb made from a gourd filled with gunpowder and gemstones my money would still be on the cannon it's engineered function is to concentrate all the gunpowder's energy in one direction toward the target a bomb is a much more diffused application of force a real bomb not a gourd bomb has a steel casing which contains the explosion to extremely high pressure think pipe bomb vs firecracker a pile of gunpowder set on fire will simply go poof trust me on that one
