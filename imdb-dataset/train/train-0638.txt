<START> if you like horror movies with lots of blood and gore tons of jump scare moments and unrelenting escalating scenes of excruciating death then look elsewhere if you like quiet moody thoughtful horror which casts blood aside in favor of a genuine feeling of dread then wendigo is for you br br thoughtful stressed out george his psychoanalyst wife kim and their young son miles are heading out to the snowy countryside for a long weekend vacation away from the city on the way up george hits a stag with his car the hunters who had been pursuing the deer are not thrilled when they find that george has ended their chase in particular deranged hunter otis takes it personally he follows the family to their vacation home making sure they see him he spies on george and kim as they have sex he fires through their windows with his rifle when they aren't home letting them discover the ominous holes in their windows and walls when they return when kim takes miles to the drugstore in town miles is attracted to a small sculpture in a display case carved to resemble a man with the head of a stag a native american man tells miles that this is the wendigo a spirit of the woods who has a taste for flesh and is always hungry miles takes the figure home with him already haunted by the death of the deer the day before that afternoon when he and his father go sledding george is shot and miles pursued through the woods by a creature barely glimpsed or is he just in shock and imagining the whole thing hours later george is rushed to the hospital and miles still clutching his statue either faints dreams or goes on a vision quest in which the wendigo returns this time the angry flesh eating god part tree part stag and part man is hunting for otis who has finally gone over the edge br br wendigo is a beautifully made film almost totally silent but for the wind howling through the snow covered trees okay so the monster itself is kind of fakey looking but it's a small flaw more than made up for by the genuine feeling of tension and dread that creeps through every frame of the film and the eerie backdrop of the silent snowy countryside the performances are great particularly by jake weber as the moody and thoughtful george and patricia clarkson as his sweet but no nonsense wife they are a happy couple with their share of common problems and it is the strength of their relationship and their love for each other that makes this film powerful watching this film is often like watching someone's home videos so realistic are the performances br br this movie is not for everyone a lot of people may find themselves totally bored waiting for the hideous lovecraftian beast and bloody revenge that never come we can never really be sure if the wendigo even exists seen as it is through the eyes of a sensitive child and also later through the eyes of a madman this is more a psychological drama than a horror film but it has more than enough creepy elements in it to satisfy fans of subtle horror
<START> probably the best picture producers releasing corp ever made this little horror piece rivets the attention from first to last director frank wisbar obviously knows a good story when he writes one and what's more important he knows how to realize its full shock potential on the screen not only is the plot involving and the characters fascinatingly drawn but the setting is absolutely out of this world just about all the action takes place either at night or in the middle of a clinging pervasive fog this chilling atmosphere is augmented by wisbar's inventive direction and the wholly convincing performances he has drawn from all his players the lovely rosemary la planche makes an ideal heroine beautiful spirited yet vulnerable robert barrat delivers his usual no nonsense straight down the line portrait of the local bigwig though it's hard to believe that the personable good looking guy who plays his son is none other than the later dullsville writer director blake edwards
<START> i saw this movie a few days ago what the hell was that br br i like movies with brian o'halloran they are funny and enjoyable when i saw a name of this title and genre i thought great this one could be really good some parody for slashers or another gore movies but then i read a preview and thought right it could be good anyway but it wasn't br br my opinion if like movies they look little bit like documentary with little bit of comedy try some moore's movies or alien autopsy they are really about something this one was empty br br and put a comedy to title no comment really bad joke

<START> the summer has been so full of blockbusters and comebacks of films and not to mention some of the disappointments of those comebacks that i was woe to find a film i could just sit down and enjoy br br in case you don't want to read further down the page there aren't any spoilers i'll sum it up here it's more mature than ella enchanted there are some questionably violent parts plenty of death and a handful of scenes with a little blood not for small children but doesn't try to be overly corny or overstep its bounds think of it as a bit more serious bit more magical princess bride and you'll be close br br br br i am perhaps not as prodigious a movie goer as others maybe once or twice a month if i feel active i'm also a huge sci fi fantasy fan i get bored of remade repetitive story lines and films with more flash than filling faster than you can count to 10 and this film is the diamond in the rough br br by the end here august i was tired enough of fractured expectations from the big hits that i averted seeing bourne ultimatum in favor of stardust having had my hopes thoroughly muddied by transformers for my fiction addiction the previews of stardust seemed appealing but i was certainly wary br br as many others here i was utterly surprised i had gone in thinking to see another generic fantasy movie clichÃ©d from here to breakfast don't be fooled it is most definitely a fairy tale and it does indeed have witches magic and utterly requires suspension of disbelief but the most refreshing thing i found is that it's not based on anything i've seen or read in the past 15 years and it's actually a really good movie br br unlike 90 of the other movies which seem to persistently re appear like thorns in a side perhaps a sign that hollywood is running out of ideas i could read a book this year and in two years the movie would be out as another epic fantasy tale the likes of lotr and the rest so says the nyt and such and such no doubt br br stardust didn't have me bolted to my seat because of jam packed action at every turn nor was i sweating bullets because of plot hook after plot hook threatening to tear the dramatic tension apart and echo throughout the theater in a loud boom it didn't even use enormous blasts of sound to grab my attention to what's happening on screen transformers i'm looking at you it's not trying to show off the latest cgi techniques nor did it offend my intelligence with dimwitted dialogs and story lines that are simple enough i could've figured them out in 3rd grade boy i hate those br br i just watched watched and enjoyed a refreshingly creative storyline unfold before my eyes sure i may have known what was going to happen throughout most of the film but it makes you forget that it even made my heart twinge at some parts but the most important aspect i noticed is that i left the theater feeling better than when i'd gone in br br it truly is a gem after so much slush this summer with so many remakes and films that fell short of my expectations this was like a cold sweet cup of tea to cap off all the hard work i'd done sitting through the others trying to come out of them with my money's worth br br it's probably not for everyone but do yourself a favor if you enjoy fantasy films that stand the test of time alone princess bride black cauldron the dark crystal etc then you should really see this movie this little diamond is finding its way into my dvd collection the moment it hits stores you can trust me on this br br simply wonderful
<START> i had the tv on for a white noise companion and heard 400 for a fully furnished apartment so i ran into the tv room expecting another 70's flick and got much more luckily i could rewind to the beginning dvr buffer and hit the record button to watch it entirely cinemax uncut and in hd no less aside from some holes in the story and intermittent improbable dialog events this is an effective thriller worthy of your time to watch pretty creepy and progressive at times beverly d'angelo's character masturbates in front of alison parker played adroitly by cristina raines parker stabs in very gory fashion her father an explicit menage a trios scene don't let the kids watch the film is totally 70's full of bad clothes polyester suits and tacky ascots and decor bad hair over bloated music score and familiar looking cinematography the cast is excellent take a second on this film's home page to check it out it was a surprise to see christopher walken jerry orbach and jeff goldblum so young sylvia miles always wonderfully creepy enjoy
<START> much worse than the original it was actually painful to sit through and it barely held my six year old's interest br br introduction of some new pokemon is marginally interesting but storyline is extra thin dialogue is still bad and music is mediocre watch the television show instead it's much better
<START> jerome crabbe has the lead role in this movie i saw this movie 6 times and i still am not tired of it this movie is similar to flesh blood in some ways gerald soetman is a great writer he wrote all of paul verhoeven's dutch films paul verhoeven is one of the greatest directors i have seen all of his movies all except for showgirls my mom does not like him so much but i disagree i think all of his films are a ride to watch especially total recall and basic instinct jerry goldsmith did some of his movies which include total recall basic instinct and hollow man i wish jerry goldsmith never died dutch films are different but still enjoyable
<START> greetings again from the darkness mary heron is amassing quite the list of films which provide a glimpse into their specific era her previous i shot andy warhol and american psycho were at their best when commenting on the quirkiness of society during that period although the notorious bettie page is obviously about ms page it is every bit as much a peak behind the curtain at the world of kinky photo shoots in the 50's br br the film is fun to watch both from the perspective of the story and the technical aspect of the way it was filmed and put together the grainy b w film and photos capture the time and the introduction of color in miami beach through the photos of bunny yeager is very well done br br the supporting cast is strong with david strathairn fresh off his edward r murrow role chris bauer as irving klaw and lili taylor the star of the film is the wonderfully talented and underrated and underworked gretchen mol ms mol always brings an edge and spirit to her roles she was absolutely mesmerizing in the little seen jason alexander directed just looking in 2000 here she is the notorious bettie page her smile is captivating and her body is flawless she really seems to enjoy this role and helps us understand how the girl next door from tennessee could become the underworld pin up queen br br as one would expect the soundtrack from the era is terrific patsy cline and peggy lee are just two of the featured performers although the film hints at providing a history into this industry the final third kinda falls flat preventing pure movie magic but the magic of gretchen mol and bettie page make this a fun movie to watch and one that will yield endless showings on hbo in the near future now will someone please turn ms mol into the star she should be
<START> a typical goth chick rainbow harvest looking like a cross between winona ryder in beetlejuice and boy george gets even with people she feels have wronged her with the help of an old haunted mirror that she finds in the new house she and her mom horror mainstay karen black the only remotely good thing about this travesty buy the acting's pretty laughably bad especially when rainbow interacts with the aforementioned mirror and there are no scares or suspense to be had this film inexplicably spawned thus for 3 sequels each slightly more atrocious than the last people looking for a similarly themed but far superior cinematic endeavor would be well advised to just search out the episode of friday the 13th the series where a geeky girl finds an old cursed compact mirror that packs more chills in it's scant 40 minutes than this whole franchise has provided across it's 4 films br br my grade d br br eye candy charlie spradling provides the obligatory t a
<START> this movie was so bad it was laughable i couldn't resist watching it though the plot is standard the acting quite horrible supporting cast such as the nutty neighbor and the lawyer friend were better actors kind of amusing if you have some time to waste and like seeing the conclusion to a dramatic plot br br the headliner who plays kathy was just fascinating because i couldn't decide if her deadpan flat affect was the result of bad surgery or simply bad acting i decided it was both this leaves the script to comment on which was pretty awful pat remarks idiotic decisions and reckless stupidity on the part of every character in the movie maybe this is what was so riveting i don't know i just watched it to see how bad it could be actually the dialog doesn't even qualify to be called cliche' but it's almost completely inane br br all in all very bad cheaply made movie the sets the same scenes a house a building were shown over and over with no artistry or actual tie in to the action more like props that were randomly dropped into the action in a bad play a chase scene could have been shot by any juvenile in a warehouse or an old school poorly shot cheap props minimal action and i still wanted to see the ending go figure
<START> this is the single worst movie i have ever seen i cannot express how bad it is i honestly wanted to kill myself several times through this atrocious experience just to have the pain end i recommend instead of seeing this movie you bathe in acid then you will at least know a fraction of the pain without all of the scars br br i had such high expectations when i read the back of the dvd case and when in the beginning it added that jesus was following them i was so excited then by the end i wanted to kill myself i mean a twenty three minute introduction to the most annoying characters in the history of cinema just pain monkeys could have done a better job editing this trash at least they would have thrown feces and blurred some of the garbage it would have made it better to have not seen any of the horror br br it wasn't that i didn't get the jokes it's that they were not only not funny they repeated themselves like twenty times apparently something isn't funny unless you see it like a million times br br do not under any circumstances see this people have rated 'manos the hands of fate' as the worlds worst movie i have seen that too and agree that it is bad but alas it is only the second worst 'fatty drives the bus' is by far worse br br this deserves all kind of harsh language but i can't write that here so just imagine i swore a whole bunch
<START> this service comedy for which peter marshall joanne dru's brother and later perennial host of the hollywood squares and tommy noonan were hyped as 'the new lewis and martin' is just shy of dreadful a few random sight gags are inserted everyone talks fast and nothing works quite right there's one scene in which noonan is throwing grenades at officers and politicians in anger they're about five feet apart noonan is throwing them in between and the total reaction is that everyone flinches br br in the midst of an awfulness relieved only by the fetching julie newmar there are a few moments of brightness marshall and noonan engage in occasional bouts of double talk and argufying and their timing is nigh unto perfect clearly they were a well honed comedy pair br br it isn't enough to save this turkey alas
<START> the movie was ok not bad not good just ok if there was anything else in the theater this would be skipped by far sadly fast and furious 2 also stunk but i'd rather see this than ff2 if you have a fetish for harrison ford or that other young punk this will be a cute movie for you personally i'd wait for hbo or blockbuster
<START> what is contained on this disk is a first rate show by a first rate band this disc is not for the faint of heart the music is incredibly intense and very cool what you will learn when you watch this movie is just why the who was so huge for so long it is true that their records were great but their shows were the top of the heap in 1969 when this concert was shot the screaming teenie boppers that threw jelly beans at the beatles were gone and bands and audiences had settled down to long and often amazing displays of musical virtuosity something that few audiences have the intellectual curiosity to pursue in the age of canned music by britney and christina what you especially learn here are the amazing things that can happen when gifted musicians are encouraged to improvise try the concert out it really is amazing
<START> it'd be easy to call guys and dolls great it's got frank sinatra and marlon brando and contrary to sinatra's original wishes the casting works it's got a really cool 1950s feel even if it is basically transposed from stage to screen with only a little interruption and most of the songs are often a lot of fun and catchy and performed with that wink and nod to the wonderful escapism inherent in the form itself if it's not entirely as great as some others of its ilk it shouldn't be any fault of the filmmaker joseph l mankiewicz not all the songs entirely click and a little of the dialog feels like it's being performed for the stage as opposed to film it's hard to tell at times brando and sinatra straddle the line so often that one has to watch carefully to tell when one plays for the camera or for the stage while the actress playing adele is better for stage than screen br br the plot is one of those winners that works well for its period even if one wonders if its influence has stretched to the likes of 1999's she's all that well not quite but close a gambler and 14 year betrothed played by sinatra wants to host a big time game but is told that the heat is on meaning the cops are on watch so he has only one choice to host the game with a thousand dollar tab the only way he can get it is through a big time bet with fellow gambler brando who's put on to make a wild wooing job of a mission worker it allows for the predictable twists in the story in the sudden turn on turn off of the charms of the character of the idiosyncrasies of people from the streets gangsters and dancers and the saitn played by jean simmons who falls for brando it is in its basic concept about this whole world of guys and dolls and how to balance one or the other obviously without getting married or too compromised br br mankiewicz brings a lot of energy to the piece even when keeping still with the camera on the subject and his stars are properly reeled in hell even brando works excellently for a musical as he goes beyond being simply the method actor and shows his chops for singing and big star quality the story and characters eventually wind down to what you'd hope will happen and that's fine all we ask for and what we get is entertainment in good spurts of witty involving dialog and a few songs and dances that bring the house down my favorites were the number with the lady cats at the club luck be a lady and the two numbers down in havana cuba a
<START> the young dr fanshawe mark letheren an avid archaeologist is dispatched by his museum boss to the large country home of squire richards pip torrens where his task is to find provenance for and catalogue the collection of antiquities and curios belonging to the recently deceased father of the squire the squire is surprised by the arrival fanshawe he hadn't been expecting him for another week but none the less welcomes him and gets his only servant patten david burke of dr watson fame to show him to his room as fanshawe must stay over for some days in order to finish his rather large task patten it would seem is not the friendliest sort and seems to resent the extra work that fanshawe's visit will entail the large empty house providing an endless amount of cooking cleaning and maintenance for him fanshawe is a fussy sort very neat and precise with everything having its place whether they be his clothes or his books and papers and he is rather disgusted by the dirt in his room needless to say he is rather eager to begin his work but unpacking he finds his binoculars have been damaged in transit so he asks the squire for a replacement pair the squire who is a modern thinking man but also it would seem rather uncultured with such matters is also eager to get rid of the clutter around the house so he obliges and walks fanshawe to the top of the hill so that he can survey the estate and the surrounding villages there the squire directs him to points of interest including gallows hill where locals were hung for their crimes and misdemeanours his interest is also taken by a local abbey which the squire describes as a ruin but fanshawe can see through the binoculars that it clearly isn't he investigates further and pays a visit to the site of the abbey and is shocked to find that there are but a few stone remnants fanshawe doesn't have too much time to think about this conundrum as he darkness falls he feels he is being watched he feels a presence he begins to see moving shadows in the woods startled he runs home over dinner he imparts details of his harrowing day to the squire patten overhears the story and suggests an explanation for it the binoculars they used to belong to a local man called baxter whom it would seem collected bones and skulls from gallows hill boiling them up for some concoction or other baxter had disappeared mysteriously one night the late squire had acquired his belongings including a mask made out of a skull and some old etchings of the area these etchings fascinate fanshawe as they portray the abbey he seen through his binoculars but he learns that the abbey had been destroyed during the reign of henry vii and so it would be impossible for baxter to have drawn the sketches never the less they are signed and dated by baxter to the recent past so he concludes that the binoculars have some special power that night he has horrifically vivid dreams when he wakes he sets off with the binoculars to have a closer look at the abbey through them what he finds surprises him but has he put himself in perilous danger by doing so fanshawe finally becomes trapped in his dangerous obsession as darkness falls the squire and a search party go in search of the now missing archaeologist they are alerted by dozens of loudly cawing crows circling above gallows hill they quicken their speed but will they be in time to help or save fanshawe from his destiny the ghost story for christmas series of films made by the bbc sadly ended its initial run of films in 1978 with the ice house they were for the most part based on the work of the great m r james in 2005 and 2006 the series was revived briefly and thankfully a view from a hill also marked a return to the work of james whose ghostly writings have haunted many generations of readers director luke watson being new to the series might have worried fans of the older films but he returns to the period setting abandoned by the later films which immediately sets the tone for a great ghost story his direction is assured as he stays true to the mood of the masters works and gradually builds up the fear factor to a terrifying climax all the while keeping what the viewer sees to a minimum thus upping the tension and mystery the autumn countryside provides oodles of atmosphere the falling leaves and low lying sun providing an unsettling backdrop for the sinister events to come the cast it must be said are all superb and are perfectly cast in their respective roles the idea behind the binoculars is simple but very effective the use of a man made object to see supernatural beings and events that the naked eye cannot see may even have influenced Ãlex de la iglesia in his film la habitaciÃ³n del niÃ±o 2006 of the following year with which it bears striking similarity i had heard mixed reviews of this particular film but i must say i found it at all times intriguing and it even raised a few hairs on my head and gave me a few shivers something that doesn't happen much these days i think any negativity surrounding the film can only be attributed to its pacing which to my eyes is perfection but to modern audiences it will be seen as deathly slow plenty of time is given even within its brief 40 minutes running time for character development and plot expansion and i must say its a new favourite of mine and certainly one of the better films of the decade
<START> ah the spirit of '68 the streets of paris were running wild with rebellion the hippies were high on the spirit of love how was britain marking this age of radicalism and revolution erm by the looks of it dear old blighty was focusing on making films about boys in boarding schools if contains the evil establishment it contains the uprising of the oppressed what it lacks in contrast to the parisien passion and the hippy headtripping is any sense of excitement except in its all out ammo and artillery fire ending br br lindsay anderson's if stars the ever marvellous malcolm mcdowell as one of three private school pupils who decorate their dorm with photos of lenin and other left wing radicals it's clearly an anti establishment movie in its depiction of the evil upper class oiks who rule the roost and the antiquated autocratic practices of the pish posh public school standard what makes if unusual though is that for all its radical sympathies it doesn't explicitly give us any sense of great tension between human decency and the despotic school system instead it just kind of floats lacking in plot and lacking in personality br br surrealist bits fade in and out occasionally and the film slips from black and white to colour again is it due to the low budget or is it an arty expression but there is little of interest to speak of all we get is the poignant denouement where the young rebels reach for their rifles and shoot down the shady overlords of the establishment hooray a revolution at last something that demands a second thought unlike the rest of this dull exercise in boarding school daydreaming br br if could have been a powerful political statement but as it is it drifts and only gathers any sense of direct interest at the end instead of being a testament to the dissident zeitgeist of the late sixties it only succeeds in being a dazed document of upper class british education anarchy apathy more like the only man many viewers will want to stick it to after watching if will be lindsay anderson
<START> excellent writing and wild cast the tech is poor but it's obviously very low budget looks like they didn't cut the negative but had to release on a video output in any case one of the most inventive comedies i've seen lately the screenwriter in particular is fine
<START> chances are uses that marvelous song by the same name throughout the film robert downey jr is excellent in this movie his extra large eyes and wonderfully variable facial expressions are part of expertise in acting as different people in diverse films compare robert downey jr in chaplin you will enjoy chances are i did
