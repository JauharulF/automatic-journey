<START> after reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years i must say it did not lose any of its mysticism nor any of its eye popping martial arts action as i had remembered from my youth the story of a dying martial arts instructor sending his unfinished pupil out to find the 5 past members of his poison clan so they do not seek out a fortune which the master's friend keeps hidden afraid that his last pupil did not have enough training he instructs him to befriend one of the five venoms so as to defeat the other four br br i can't say enough about the choreography or the camera work a fine film in its own right and quite possible one of the best martial arts movies ever made a classic
<START> one of the more satisfying western all'italiana johnny yuma has the freshness of many wai made during the heyday of the genre and is highly recommended for fans of the genre or offbeat intelligent cinema br br johnny yuma is in most respects not terribly original but this actually does not count against it the success of a genre film depends on how well it meets the audience's expectations as well as provides surprising variations on these expected elements earlier pleasing experiences are recreated but with subtle or major twist that provide continuing interest the quality of the execution is also obviously important a tired retread will be less successful than a sincere attempt to entertain or move the audience br br given these criteria johnny yuma succeeds there are numerous reprises of elements from earlier films the setting is the brutal twisted semi feudal twilight world of shared by many of the best gothic family westerns made 1964 1968 such as tempo di massacre 1966 the plot is a combination of the basic fistful of dollars 1964 plot and the ringo films a fact not surprising as screenwriter fendiando di leo was involved in both di leo was one of the best screenwriters in the popular cinema coming out of cinecitta in the 1960s 70s and his work helped provide much of the thematic continuities and coherency to the genre along with a couple of other personalities in a few distinct circles of actors directors and screenwriters in the fod plot the protagonist arrives in town stirs up a tense situation then undergoes a near death followed by a resurrection in some films like quella sporca storia nel west 1968 it is quite literally a crucifixion the catholic undertone to the narrative and the symbolism is intriguing especially given the implicit populist explicit socialist leanings of the filmmakers and their films the ringo plot developed more fully by screenwriter ernesto gastaldi in a series of films starring guliano gemma a egoistic protagonist chooses the interest of a community over his own through the medium of a relationship with a member of that community with a healthy dash ironic uncertainty br br the relationship between carradine and johnny is clearly based on that of manco mortimer from a fistful of dollar 1965 the two scene of the exchange of the gun belts provides a clever dialog and understanding between the two numerous films including da uomo a uomo 1968 or even el chuncho quiÃ©n sabe 1967 use this relationship between an older and younger man father son older younger brother anglo adviser adversary and peasant revolutionary as a central dynamic to the plot br br additionally there is the focus on deception and misdirection mazes and mirrors that recur throughout the best early wai the canons and pueblos of almeria become literal mazes through which protagonist and antagonist play shifting games of cat and mouse br br what distinguishes johnny yuma from other wai is the quality of director romolo guerriri's use of visual psychological space together arrangement with the script's intelligent mechanisms to forward the plot dialogue was never very important to the wai and often absurdly unintelligible thought there are exceptions such as the cynical commentaries in django 1966 or faccia a faccia 1967 br br psychological depth of character is created almost entirely through iconic imagery it's juxtapositions and it's description of the overall narrative situation see how the presence of the deadly samantha is felt during the beating scene Â watching from the roof or from the background of the action or how johnny strips samantha and pedro of their security and confidence in their power through his stealthy invasions of their ranch hotel even bedroom this again is a theme from fod finally note how there is a focus on the search for information like many elements this is borrowed from fod which was ultimately based on the hard boiled mystery novel red harvest it is through incidental contacts wanted posters overheard conversations glances out of windows watches left in the dust or mistaken identities and movements through the ripples created by the actions of pedro and samantha within this surreal and absurd reality that the narrative tacks forward to it's conclusion br br the movie was notable in it's time for what were perceived of as excesses in violence of course these films were hardly more violent than many american westerns what was different was the psychological intensity of the violence and the causes to which it was attributed which is to say that it was not the violence but it's meaning that had changed johnny yuma is distinct and interesting in it's use and portrayal of violence and this is another interesting aspect of the film br br what i personally find most interesting about most of this genre is the link it provides to the anonymous nameless audiences in italy and spain to whom these recurrent narratives held some significance and interest the artifact may have no intrinsic worth in and of itself Â some flint debitage from a prehistoric site a shard of cruse pottery or a moldering piece of leather and rusted metal Â but it is reference to some nameless presence lives that were significant simply because they existed while johnny yuma has intrinsic worth much of it's interest for me derives from this connection and mystery br br top spaghetti western list http imdb com mymovies list l 21849907 br br average sws http imdb com mymovies list l 21849889 br br for fanatics only bottom of the barrel

<START> if deborah messing were not already cast as grace this might be a tolerable film however it is simply another story of a frustrated spinster with issues who hires a paid escort dermot mulroney she reads about in a time magazine article to travel to london for her sister's london wedding how new is this plot br br neither funny nor remotely romantic the wedding date slides over the storyline of deceptive sex by bride and best man and paid for escorts to pass off the film as four weddings without hugh and definitely a dead end deal for the naive groom who is ignorant to the sexual history of his bride amy adams while messing has perfected the repressed princess 30 something woman with a failed relationship history her neurotic and drunken moves on yet another faux beau is simply the restating of her tv series if this woman is an actress get a role that does not rehash what is already on prime time br br lots of drunken female bonding cricket visual jokes and mulroney in a towel nice but the film is a bore with the obvious happy ending expected messing sequel divorce date
<START> this movie was just down right bad i love war movies and can normally come away from most movies and find something that i liked but this was not one of them this movie lacked substance and intensity ok i get it the finns put up one hell of a fight and thats great but the story is poorly told you don't have any real connection with any of the characters and there's no real story line to follow you just go from one random scene to another nothing flows to form the story that is trying to be conveyed if you want a war movie that will keep you riveted and amazingly enough without battles scenes then i would suggest downfall wwii german film or if you prefer a great story line and a lot of action then i would suggest brotherhood of war korean war korean film these two movies will not let you down as winter war will
<START> i first saw this film when i was around 6 or 7 years old and didn't really think it was anything particularly special as time went on i watched it a few more times and it started to grow on me as i started to understand the morals of the film which i will come to later for a while i left this film alone and didn't watch it for a while when looking for an old classic film to watch a few weeks ago now being 15 i dug out the vhs of homeward bound after watching this i was left on a natural high that i couldn't really explain the film gives an overwhelming sense of joy that you never really expect the films nature of three completely different animals collaborating together to find their way home really sends a message home that no matter how different you are you can always find common ground something that you all need the way the personalities of the characters is chosen is truly fantastic in that you have an old knowledgeable wise golden retriever looking after or guiding 'chance' the fun loving if slightly clumsy young american bulldog with sassy the clever vulnerable but confident cat the film follows these three friends or companions on a journey that is so realistically impossible it creates magic in that you start to believe that this journey can happen br br i don't want to sound like a soft tissue grabber when it comes to films i assure you i am quite the opposite but the most uplifting part of this film is without a doubt shadows return when shadow desperately tries to escape and chance and sassy painfully are told by him to leave when both animals return to their beloved owners there is a silence until shadow limps over the horizon to the awe of all there is a fine line between heartwarming and corny rubbish but this film is pure magic even at the age of 15 this film may not be lord of the rings but for disney to produce such a fantastic film using animals and for it to uplift myself in the way it does even at this age it deserves 10 10
<START> man oh man what a piece of crummy film making but this is a guilty pleasure from my childhood even though i hate to admit it they showed this movie on my basic cable system all the time where i grew up in san jose california right on the border of cupertino we had this thing called the g channel on our cable system and they basically showed the same one movie over and over and over again wanda nevada was one of those movies i fell in lust and love with the young brooke shields and loved her dopey adventures in the grand canyon in the 1940s the script makes almost no sense the direction is poor the few highlights are that henry fonda makes an appearance a lot of dialog that's so bad it's good and a nice carole king song played over the end credits maybe you have to be stoned to truly enjoy this flick and hey everybody knows there ain't no gold in the grand canyon
<START> i have to admit this movie moved me to the extent that i burst in tears however i always think about things twice and instead of writing a eulogy that would define the film as flawless and impeccable i prefer taking the risk of a closer look br br first what's first the movie has an undeniable impact on the viewer simply because it starts out and continues as a slow paced movie that doesn't try to blow you away with the actual scenes from 9 11 thumbs up for this stroke of genius because unlike stone's world trade center this film fortunately doesn't focus on the attack itself but on the fallout which similar to the fallout of a nuclear explosion is hardly visible but nonetheless dangerous and devastating the psychological impact the sheer devastation that 9 11 caused and the havoc it wreaked on the american people is almost palpable in this movie i think binder managed an astute observation of the american post 9 11 society and sandler in my opinion sky rocketed from an average comedy actor to a real talent who delivers a performance worthy of an oscar br br however in the film blood diamond the di caprio character says and i quote ah these americans always want to take about their feelings now i don't want to belittle their sufferÃ­ngs but i sure would like to make a comparison ever since 9 11 the entire world is confronted with mementos memorials and commemorations of 9 11 the hollywood industry and writers such as safran foer more than allude to 9 11 in their works now this huge amount of cultural products dealing with 9 11 turn the death of 3000 people into the biggest tragedy of this young century the number of books written on the subject and the number of films directed on this subject and i say this with all due respect blow the importance of this atrocious crime somewhat out of proportion br br fact is people die every day due to unjust actions and horrible crimes committed by bad or simply lost people we have a war in iraq in afghanistan in birma and lots of other countries on a daily basis we forget about the poverty the african people suffer from and we tend do empathize with them to a lesser degree than with the american victims of 9 11 simply because they are black and because their lives don't have much in common with our western lives africa neither has the money nor the potential to commemorate their national tragedies in a way america can so what i am saying is this the reason why we feel more for the 3000 victims of 9 11 and their families is because we are constantly reminded of 9 11 not a day goes by without a newspaper article a film or a book that discusses 9 11 br br in conclusion i commiserated with charlie fineman but i wasn't sure whether i had the right to feel for him more than for a hutu who lost his entire family in the rwandan civil war br br you catch my thrift
<START> superdome is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it was made the whole plot concerns someone trying to sabotage the superbowl and all the attempts made to stop them how tom selleck and donna mills' careers managed to survive this is beyond me however the most frustrating thing about it was there was no football in it at all avoid this one if possible
<START> first one was much better i had enjoyed it a lot this one has not even produced a smile the idea was showing how deep down can human kind fall but in reference to the characters not the film maker
<START> i cant describe how terrible this movie is am i the only one here who finds the way its animated totaly disgusting the men of rohan look 100 fake with their poorly colored hair that doesnt even come close to matching what the actors look like the orcs looked terrible why does gandalf walk with a bad limp why cant they pronounce things correctly saruman isnt aruman there were other what sounded like terrible pronounciation sp of tolkiens characters all and all im glad the studio who made this pulled the plug out from the sequal it was just a terrible terrible adaptaion go watch the hobbit cartoon for a better cartoon of tolkiens work hell even the cartoon version of rotk is better then this dribble 2 10
<START> just like wine johnny dangerously gets better and better with every day this clever witty well acted film could very well stand on its own but as a parody of the gangster genre it's truly outstanding in fact it's quite obviously the best film of its kind the funniest spoof of mob movies and even the respective period although admittedly this position is probably easier to achieve when its main competitors are such primitive vulgar and dull pseudocomedies as jane austen's mafia
<START> this movie had so much potential a strong cast a reasonably strong idea and clearly a decent budget i'm not sure where it all went wrong but each of those elements was wasted the story went nowhere the characters were hollow to say the least and the result was a very boring pointless waste of a film i hated it judging by the other votes i'm in the minority here and must be some sort of freak however i thought this movie was dreadful i had high hopes but was very disappointed a particular disappointment was jody foster's character a very cocky fixer of sorts makes a nice idea jody was confident and sexy but the character did nothing and went nowhere denzel washington played the same character he always plays enjoyable but nothing new
<START> this movie catches a lot of flak but this is usually based on the horrible looking and covered clothed version of the film that played us television and has also been issued to death on vhs and dvd buy companies like alpha unicorn etc this movie never had a theatrical release in the states although it was picked up by avco embassy in 1973 in spain at the time when there was nudity involved the filmmakers shot two versions one with clothes and one with out the fully uncut english dubbed export print was titled werewolf never sleeps and seems to have been released to home video only in sweden back in the 80's it can be found on ebay and the likes and comes highly recommended my guess is avco cut the film down for a r rated release that never happened in 1974 it was released by avco to television titled fury of the wolfman and the clothed version was used for this tv print cut to 12 years later and fury of the wolfman pops up on home video on the charter label this version appears to be what avco was going to release back in '73 it's the uncovered version with some nudity that would never pass on tv or in a pg movie there are several scenes on the charter tape that play out with nudity that are clothed in the tv print the source for all those dollar dud's and vhs editions but a comparison to the fully uncut wolfman never sleeps reveals that 2 scenes are cut on this version spoilers in next paragraph the scene where ilona has waldermar chained to the wall and whips him after he transforms into the werewolf is incomplete after whipping him into submission she starts to remove her clothes and begins making love to the werewolf the werewolf responds positively to these sexual shenanigans too this scene certainly ranks as one of the most unusual in the history of horror films and is a delirious treat it's not graphic but the implied bestiality was too much for us audiences or more likely the mpaa ilona is desperately in love with waldemar and could not possess him hence her whole scheme to mind control waldermar's wife and involve her in an affair she wanted to wreck his marriage and she accomplishes this while waldemar is in tibet unfortunately he returns a werewolf but this does not slow her down a bit if she can't physically have him as a man she loves him enough to have sex with him as a werewolf this also helps explain the later scene where the werewolf beds down with a woman he spots getting naked before bedtime while peeping through her window this scene is presented sans nudity in the covered version and really makes no sense in the uncut version it would seem ilona's affections have made the werewolf horny and in need of release so he rapes the first woman he can after escaping the other cut is a complete scene of waldemar in bed with karen and she is seen naked a very similar bedroom scene was cut out of the us version of werewolf shadow werewolf vs the vampire woman as well the film does have it's problems though for certain the director was drunk the bad stand in for the werewolf at points the atrocious english dubbing the inclusion of sequences from the first waldemar film mark of the wolfman aka frankenstein's bloody terror and the grotesque overuse of that film's music score throughout etc but seen in it's original widescreen format and uncut ie werewolf never sleeps it is one of the wildest and most outrageous of the daninsky werewolf series with a plot line unmatched in it's everything but the kitchen sink approach the cut clothed pan and scan full screen copies of this film do it no favors and unfortunately that's the version almost everyone commenting on the film have seen the film carries a 1970 copyright and i'd bet the 1972 release date on the imdb is incorrect the film precedes werewolf shadow aka werewolf vs the vampire woman in the series and was certainly released before werewolf shadow the ending of werewolf never sleeps fury of the wolfman dovetails directly into the opening of werewolf shadow offering concrete evidence of this sadly a complete version of this may never get a decent release a perfect release would be the uncut english version but in spanish with english subtitles the english dubbing severely hurts the movie but any spanish language version would reflect the covered version as shown in spain during the franco era where nudity was verboten
<START> good times in my opinion is a must see cbs hit despite the fact that i've never seen every episode i still enjoy it it's hard to say which one is my favorite also i really love the theme song if you ask me even though i like everyone it would have been nice if everyone had stayed on the show throughout its entire run everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong in conclusion even though it can be seen on tv land now i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
<START> well what can i say there are b grade movies and there are b grade movies and this definitely falls into the latter however since it's obvious that even the makers of the film know that it's not a credible movie take a look at the closing credits it can be forgiven br br the plot is basically a convicted psycho killer is killed he accidentally has his genetic material mixed up with some experimental acid that get combined and then lost in the snow the killer now takes on the form of a snowman if you can believe that the snowman jack frost is after the country town sherif who put him behind bars in doing so jack frost ends up killing half the town br br this movie lacks any real scares and the effects alone remind me of the b grade movies of the 50's this alone makes it worth watching for a laugh a movie to pass the time away
<START> whether it's a good movie or not films of this kind has to be made i think it remembers me of i love huckabees a overwhelmingly puzzling movie with isabelle huppert being sodomized by a young american in a mud pond in a merry sadistic masochist way i hope the director will go on stepping across the border as though i felt the choices vincenzo natali made were not always subtle some of the scenes were unhappily kind of tarte Ã  la crÃ¨me like a childish slapstick speaking about script and cinematographyÂ the color of cube was black nothing is white more cheerful surprisingly than the former films of natali
<START> curl up with this one on a dark and stormy night and prepare to be alternately amused irritated and frightened the creaky old plot about about a phantom train that's said to run through the lonely english countryside at dead of night may be implausible but it's a lot of fun there are some wonderful old cliches like the accident which the locals can remember but won't talk about but primarily the movie's a vehicle for comedian arthur askey to showcase his particular brand of vaudeville style humour in between the scary bits askey's corny humor is not very trendy these days but if you just let it wash over you it can be fun this is probably the best of askey's movies
<START> after star wars a new hope redefined science fiction and the empire strikes back redefined star wars it's hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two but this one really does a nice job the first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what's going on in the war there is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion's final confrontation with the emperor when the battle begins the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films this climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy with the most at stake for the rebellion this is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land including han solo chewbacca and leia the battle raging on in space including lando and a confrontation between luke and the emperor on the new death star which leads up to another duel with darth vader it is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war and there seems to be no escape although i think the idea of ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit far fetched it didn't seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers although they did have some luck fighting them there is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming which may not be quite as stunning as that of the empire strikes back but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well with the light tone of a new hope and the more sinnister tone of the empire strikes back this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale the special edition for return of the jedi concentrated on what would have been nice to change since not much of the original really needed it fifteen years of technology advancements didn't seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned and there still is the occasional disappearing tie fighter but other than that it was good the gaping non threatening sarlaac's mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge fly trap looking head that emerged which definitely added to the suspense also the disco was taken out of jabba's palace and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy instead of just a small ewok village which was the case of the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it deserved it's hard to say which of the three films was the best but since it's all part of the same story the over all trilogy is like one big outstanding film a third must see for film fans
<START> this movie is a vehicle for schwarzenegger clone alexander nevsky his charisma however is insufficient to lift this movie above the level of its poor script he has little to add to his arnie act br br michael york is quite pathetic as the begging diplomat watching him revisit his d'artagnan act from the time that he was a better actor made me feel uneasy come on you can do better than that br br the story is full of holes and unexplained relations top of this bill is the informer of vlad who sounds like an american woman but from the context appears to be working for a russian government department br br although the story takes place well after the end of the communist regime all the russian characters are still very communist like in contradiction to that vlad is allowed to drive a pimped up all utility vehicle as police car the action scenes are poorly shot and therefore lack dynamics br br not a must see movie
<START> every time this film is on the bbc somebody in the radio times says how it is a satire against the post war world of rationing and the welfare state i do not think this is the point of the film at all the film parodies the spivs small time criminals who ran the blackmarket and the housewives league who campaigned against government restrictions but were really a tory front organisation br br yes of course the film sends up the political social situation but in the end the people realise that they need all the controls to ensure a fair society they want to be british and muddle through rather than foreign br br but i don't think they go back to being exactly like they were before
