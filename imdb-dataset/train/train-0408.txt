<START> i can't understand why many imdb users don't like this movie why they think it's sooooo bad etc it's not worse than anything else out there personally i think soldier is a great movie far better than most other films in the same genre br br reasons why i liked soldier kurt russel connie nielsen jason scott lee the script david webb peoples great visual effects and the directing paul anderson br br i even think that this is the best work i've seen from director paul anderson who has previously directed the entertaining mortal kombat and the not so entertaining event horizon
<START> the angry red planet quickie review br br like the man from planet x this is a bizarre science fiction tale culled from an era where fantasy and science fiction were still damn near the same thing meaning we have some highly laughable special effects and rampant pseudo science masquerading as science fiction and yes it's another classic released in a high quality transfer with a crisp picture and sharp sound by midnite movies br br so the main reason to watch this film oh it's definitely the whole time our space crew is on mars what you thought angry red planet referred to neptune prior to that is some rather poor quality space crew boarding a space ship inside of which they smoke and toss around sexist chauvinistic banter aimed at the puny female member of the crew it'd be somewhat offensive by today's standards if it weren't so damn funny but mars is the real reason we're watching this thing the film is generally black and white but mars well mars is screaming bloody red it's filmed in this bizarre red plasticy sheen giving the angry red planet quite an interesting look of overexposed redness it's really quite a sightÂas are the ha ha aliens viewers are to witness the best being the ratbatspidercrab you think that's a joke that's what they call it in the movie it's a gigantic chimera small puppet of a thing combining traits of rats bats spiders and crabs it bounds along all puppety and scares the sh t out of our heroic crew there are other weird and poorly imagined aliens to be seen but that one takes the cake eventually after their harrowing experience on mars the sexist crew boards their ship and returns to whatever planet it was they came from br br this ain't for everyone science fiction film buffs curiosity seekers and some general film buffs fans of mystery science theater 3000 will have a field day with this one if they never got to it on the show br br 2 10 modern score 6 10 nostalgia score 4 10 overall br br www residenthazard com
<START> this was a good film with a powerful message of love and redemption i loved the transformation of the brother and the repercussions of the horrible disease on the family well acted and well directed if there were any flaws i'd have to say that the story showed the typical suburban family and their difficulties again what about all people of all cultural backgrounds i would love to see a movie where all of these cultures are shown like in real life nevertheless the film soared in terms of its values and its understanding of the how a disease can bring someone closer to his or her maker loved the film and it brought tears to my eyes
<START> star rating the works just misses the mark that little bit in between lagging behind the pits br br some plutonium's gone missing and some very nasty people now have the means to develop a bomb capable of wholesale destruction so josh mccord chuck norris and his cocky young protÃ©gÃ© deke judson mills a different actor from the previous film with the assistance of josh's adopted daughter que jennifer tung set out to stop them br br this was another film that dealt with terrorism a year after the events of 9 11 filmed in 2001 norris himself even commented afterwards how eerily the plot line to the film resembled what happened in downtown new york that day so there'd have been those that would have been in the mood for a film where norris and his side kick kick some terrorist ass if nothing else other than that it's as interchangeable as anything norris has ever been in it makes you wonder what the original did to warrant a sequel in the first place and whether if this one could get made a president's man 3 might come out sometime soon br br if you've seen one norris film you've really seen them all and there's really nothing new or unexpected that happens with this one but at least you know what you're getting and like i said it might have been just what some needed to let off some steam
<START> this film the alamo thirteen days to glory is utter rubbish the acting is awful it is far too patriotic and its historical accuracy is not always at its best historians would have a field day it does have a few good moments but not enough to keep interest because it is far too long rating out of
<START> i saw this movie years ago in a group tradition of fast forward film festivals where we would set out to rent a bunch of b movies and vote for who picked the worst br br the night we watched this it was voted the best due to semblance of plot and fun costuming br br this is certainly a silly kitschy movie to be watched under the full understanding that you are watching low budget fluff personally however i wouldn't recommend additional substances this movie will leave it's own mark on you br br it made enough of an impression on me that i've actually been trying to get my hands on a copy for a few years br br a good choice if you are setting out to watch bad movies this one is fun and i remember bouncy music
<START> as jack nicholson's directorial debut drive he said displays at the least that he is a gifted director of actors even when the story might seem to lose its way to the audience and to a modern audience if they can find it which pops up now and again on ebay it might seem more free formed than they think the film contains vivid interesting characterizations the film tells of two college kids the protagonist is hector william tepper in what borders on a break out performance a star of the leopards the college basketball team he plays on while he has to deal with a coach bruce dern who puts on the pressure to stay focused and a on and off girlfriend karen black with her own emotional problems there's gabriel michael margotta the other kid gabriel it seems is just a little more than freaked out by the possibility to be drafted and so in his own radical mind state he does what he can to keep out but as hector tries to find the balance between his oncoming fame and those he loves gabriel is going over the threshold of sanity br br nicholson on the technical side of things displays a fascinating editing style that keeps things on edge during the basketball scenes and implements darkness in many other scenes with a documentary feel throughout and from tepper black and even robert towne writer of chinatown last detail and mission impossible among others who rarely acts he garners some credible acting work though in tepper there is a tendency to downplay his emotions in some scenes for example when he could act brilliantly sarcastic he doesn't play it for what it's worth from margotta on the other hand there is a vibrant twisted force in his performance and as he descends it's frightening but perhaps understandable from the times and what a climax dern steals most of his scenes by the way in a performance that should have garnered him an oscar nomination every line of his dialog is appropriate true and it's never hammed up like in recent coach movie performances br br but what drags down the film is that elements involving the characters aren't explained to the degree one might wish more the film was based on a novel by jeremy larner who co wrote the script with nicholson and i was expecting that the film to be longer than it was it's a slim volume with a lot of information about the times about the sport about the underlying feelings that were with those of the younger generation nicholson presents us with these characters and situations and rarely are they shown to what's motivating them the anti war protesters not included their part's understandable enough gabriel is perturbed by what's going on in vietnam but what else is there hector too is a guy who has apprehensions about being drafted for the nba and he still loves to play but what's holding him back this whole atmosphere is intriguing how the late 60's college basketball experience was but that intriguing quality which does lead to some unconventionality is kept at a point where it can't go too further overall the effect of the film as a whole is bittersweet and somewhat memorable for its good points and not for it's low ones and for sure you can tell who's behind the lens every step of the way b
<START> bill and ted's bogus journey is the sequel to bill and ted's excellent adventure their bogus journey follower almost directly after the first movie and does just as good of a job if not better to entertain the viewer br br the plot is an evil person from the future is trying to kill bill and ted using evil robots that look exactly like bill and ted once the robots kill bill and ted they must compete with the grim reaper death and return their lives to normal br br the acting in the movie is top notch and even thought it is a little weird at times especially bill and ted's conversations it is a great movie the wannabe rockers sure have made another great movie pick this up the next time your at blockbuster
<START> this film is fantastic finally well written characters you can love for all their good and bad pierce brosnan is flat out hysterical in this self effacing role i think its the best thing he's ever done he's done other roles that exhibited shades of being capable of this kind of fully fledged work but this role finally gave him the room to run with it i almost died when he walked across the hotel lobby in his underwear and boots and greg kinnear and hope davis are a couple to aspire too as well as actors to aspire too kinnear is so goofy likable that his turn in the end is truly gratifying you give good actors good work to play with and they give us something more back
<START> this is a bad movie in the traditional sense but taken for what it is meant to be it is quite good very funny and well made although there are a few death scenes that are in bad taste what with jiggling breasts as a girl suffocates and so on
<START> like one of the previous commenters said this had the foundations of a great movie but something happened on the way to delivery such a waste because collette's performance was eerie and williams was believable i just kept waiting for it to get better i don't think it was bad editing or needed another director it could have just been the film it came across as a canadian movie something like the first few seasons of x files not cheap just hokey also it needed a little more suspense something that makes you jump off your seat the movie reached that moment then faded away kind of like a false climax i can see how being too suspenseful would have taken away from the reality of the story but i thought that part was reached when gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy this movie needs to have a director's cut that tries to fix these problems
<START> my comment is limited generally to the first season 1959 60 br br this superb series was one of the first to be televised in color and it was highly influential in persuading americans that they had to buy a color television set which was about 800 in 1959 the equivalent of more than 3 000 today how many of us would pay that much for the privilege of watching a show transmitted by a cathode ray picture tube on a 17 inch screen i was eleven when the series began and i watched it from the beginning br br watching it now 50 years later several things come to mind first many of the story lines involve the comstock lode and the heyday of silver mining which dates to 1859 for 1859 the weapons and clothes are for the most part not authentic the haircuts are left out of the discussion that's basically a nitpick br br and it would have been impossible for ben to have arrived in the lake tahoe area in 1839 and to have amassed a 100 square mile ranch in the next twenty years pioneers were still trying to solve the sierra nevada problem as late as 1847 and the gold rush did not even begin until two years later br br indians are not played by native american actors john ford was using native american actors in the 1920s the bonanza producers could have easily done so thirty years later that is a major nitpick for me br br there are other time line problems in season 1 mark twain appears and he is depicted as a middle aged man mark twain was 24 years old in 1859 the stories also vacillate between 1859 1860 pre civil war and what was more suitable for an 1880 time frame there are continuity problems over and over br br it is somewhat off putting too that there is so much killing in the first season in time the killing was reduced br br many of the episodes take a socially liberal slant which would be hard to believe given the time line but give the writers credit for anticipating the seismic shifts in the nation's attitudes beginning in the 1960s br br having said all that the acting is good and i have come to conclude in my latter years that adam's character was drawn better than any other's i don't think pernell roberts ever got the credit he deserved also season 1 reinforces the fact that dan blocker hoss was a good actor br br many of the stories trace real historical events the guest stars were interesting br br this was great family entertainment and the series stands up very well by any measure
<START> in short br br spike lee clearly has a lot on his mind he's thinking about racism color ism media and hegemony consumerism and capitalism religion sexism 'hetero sexism' politics of the drug war etc etc br br that level of consciousness on is own is great i think it is a blessing that more and more people are choosing to critically examine fundamental aspects of our daily lives the silent and invisible forces that govern our societies however just because lee is making contentious films does not make him a good film maker br br what comes across in jungle fever is a superficial understanding of these socio political forces this is largely the result of two main failures br br firstly lee is simply trying too hard he seems to be desperately trying to accommodate every political social statement he can think of into the 90mins and as such the end result seems confused and irresolute as he allows himself no time to develop characters that can fully embody the ideas he hopes to present and so he exhausts stereotypes and we are left with rushed testimonies and very loaded dialogs the end result is very staged and unrealistic br br secondly by attempting to make statements about such a wide variety of societal functions he appears to have no concrete or original interpretation of the social political issues presented what comes across is a puddle of regurgitated non sense you feel that he bought an elementary level sociology text book and spewed out all 500 pages br br these are highly problematic features because the artistry of film is sacrificed and the work is transformed into a loudspeaker for the voice of the voice of the filmmaker he is unable to distance himself from the work and allow it to speak for itself br br it functions neither as a piece of art nor a sound political argument br br although i still do appreciate lee bringing up these important issues i must say br br two thumbs down
<START> this was my favourite film as a child and i have been in the stage production a few times so it will always remain my favourite muscical and i doubt anybody could ever re make the story of oliver twist on screen any better than this one did br br my all time favourite ''bad guy'' has to be oliver reed as bill sikes not only did he scare the life out of my when i watched it as a 6 year old but now as a woman i can empathize more with nancys character the bar maid prostitute who helps oliver get the life he deserves br br jack wilde as the artful dodger was fantastic and i don't think anybody could ever out do him as the street pocket picker and best friend of fagin the music is fantastic especially fagin's numbers i'm also quite thankful they didn't give bill sikes a musical number it wouldn't of worked with him being such a sinister character br br i think carol reed did an excellent job of nancy's sticky ending keeping it a g rated movie by disguising her beating but giving enough away to show the violence of bill towards her br br this movie is both charming and charismatic as a musical sing along as well as being a moving drama that follows a young boy as he tries to find where he belongs in life
<START> feast of all saints where when br br was the feast of all saints storyline and theme edited out br br what a waste of a wonderful title there is never anything in the story that has the remotest connection to the feast of all saints nor is there anything in the story about all souls day which the term is referencing why bother to use this title if you never intend to including any kind of storyline or theme about all souls day or the feast of all saints br br embarrassly bad script amateur writing br br how did they attract such great talent to this clunker the writing is so amateur characters that have known each other all their life go into big long speeches about their life history for the sake of the audience not at all the way people talk to each other br br what was the director thinking br br the directing is equally bad the forced and overly deliberate style feels amateurish in one scene a character is yelling take your hands off of me and no one is touching him the most badly directed scene however is the incredibly over the top battle scene at the beginning of the film br br excessive gore in a very fake silly battle scene br br there are so many dead people in the most fake battle scene it looks like a saturday night live skit you can see extras waiting for their cues to walk across camera everyone plays their death scene like 4th grade boys exaggerating every little gasp and twitch the blood on battle victims is so excessive and carelessly applied it looks like someone used a ketchup dispenser and just squirted straight lines of red on the costumes br br this whole battle scene comes off as the spoof of a really cheesy war movie you almost expect someone like will ferrell and mike myers to ride up on a horse and deliver the punchline br br who in real life would ever behave this way br br the most ridiculous bit of writing directing and casting is actually the focus of the scene br br a little girl is standing under the dead body of her hanging father who is terribly mutilated and literally dripping blood form his gaping wounds even a totally idiot would know he is dead yet she is very monotonously repeating over and over daddy daddy while looking at someone off screen she delivered it with about as much believability and passion as you could expect from an non actor kid that had been repeating the line for the cameras all day br br even if the poor kid had any acting skills the scene is completely unbelievable the little girl wouldn't even be in the middle of the battlefield after hours of carnage surrounded by hundreds of dead bodies while she calmly stands there natural instincts would had the kid screaming and terrified running away from the bloody carnage br br are we suppose to be horrified or laugh br br one particularly goofy detail that gives the scene an snl satire tone is the father hanging with a huge hook through his mouth and cheek he looks like a fish on a hook the unintentionally funny details make the whole scene come across as fake and silly br br in fantasy la la land mothers and daughters are the same age br br another funny detail is that you see a central character the little girl's mother at the end of the scene and in the next scene that occurs 20 years later she looks exactly the same she is still young and beautiful and now the same age as her daughter br br i almost turned the movie off right there because the direction and writing were obviously awful but i tried to stick it out because i wanted to see the louisiana settings and i like all the actors i don't know what these fine actors were thinking when they accepted these roles br br who was the targeted audience br br the excessive amount of blood and badly acted violence in the opening scene are weirdly out of place with the soap opera storytelling tone that follows it is also a strange way to start a movie that for the rest of the time seems targeted to romance novel reading females weird inconsistency in tone
<START> i'm a bit conflicted over this the show is on one hand awful the acting is terrible even when we get actual name actors like brad pitt and bill moseley in one episode the dialogue is moronic and the premise moral of each episode feels like something lifted out of a 50s educational short there's no way you'll be scared for a moment from any of these episodes and robert englund's cameos are short pointless and corny in a sort of a bob saget on america's funniest home videos kind of way br br on the other hand this is one of the funniest things to ever be on television the 80s fashions the soft focus makes the actors look like their on the set of the view at all times the premises lend the material more to self parody than scares so we're left with an episode where a high school kid is afraid if he fails his sat's his girlfriend will dump him and his parents disown him another is afraid she'll be locked up in prison because she's a substandard mom her husband is played by brad pit another is afraid that all the parents in the world are in league against him when he runs away from home another is afraid she'll be confused with her socially retarded twin another is afraid if he doesn't break up his mom and step dad he'll get killed for having a party at his house the list goes on and on br br being that these are dreams i suppose you could look past the ludicrous plot points and devices but they're so out of left field that there's no opportunities for the writers to actually scare the audience you have characters dressed like something out of a 80s themed nightmare wandering around delivering bad dialogue in very hammy fashion and making illogical decisions that serve no other purpose but to move the story to the next weird plot point typically watching as a peripheral character does something uncharacteristic of a sane person while our main character stares aghast and too shocked to do anything about it br br if you're looking for something that'll scare you stay away if you're looking on the other hand for one of the funniest things to come out of the 80s ever watch it br br its been showing on chiller tv lately pretty much every day and i've been watching earlier out of morbid curiosity and now just so i can get a good laugh in each day with arrested development and extras off the air this is officially the funniest thing on television right now
<START> what a great movie this is so reminiscent of the wonderful disney classic family movies of the 60's and the 70's i was so pleasantly surprised after the past 20 years of absolute detritus disney's live productions crews have churned out br br this movie is an absolute joy the child stars were just that professional quality actors i am most impressed with the quality of this movie br br sigourney weaver was a total sycophantic insert hyperbole here running a prison camp for wayward boys siobhan fallon was wonderful as the star's mother br br i won't recant the story here as there is little point in doing that yet again but the story is wonderful the direction was extraordinary and the acting quality was superb this work reminds you what it's like to be a child without going all sugary or being too grim the deleted scenes featured on the dvd version were truly best left deleted they were too harsh for this movie and would have taken so much from it while the abuse was hinted in the finished product it was not outright shown beyond a certain extent it was best that way br br this was an absolutely delightful movie to watch br br it gets a 9 10 from br br the fiend
<START> enchanting romantic innovative and funny the vision of this extraordinary film is almost unparalleled exceeding better known death romances such as ghost while we know intuitively that peter and june will find ultimate happiness at the end of that long long stairway the joy is in the journey the moral of the tale of course is timeless love conquers all but the struggle to achieve that victory is played in a celestial arena of sweeping vision and gripping grandeur with more than 500 suitably clad extras portraying various ages and cultures the directors' vision of heaven remains memorable six decades later far into the cgi era br br yet for all the cosmic scale powell and pressburger knew an essential truth the best story is told at the smallest level the wonderfully determinedly romantic aspect of stairway is captured with ultimate simplicity june's teardrop preserved on a rose petal br br this film like the story and the set itself is one for the ages
<START> masters of horror the screwfly solution starts as america is being infected by an airborne virus that affects the male population when aroused men indiscriminately kill any woman in sight apparently in the name of god scientist alan jasn priestley is brought in by the government knows more than most senses the situation may have gone too far already so he tells his wife anne kerry norton to take their teenage daughter amy brenna o'brien try to survive as the future of the human race may depend on them br br this canadian american co production was episode 7 from season 2 of the masters of horrror tv series directed by joe dante i thought the screwfly solution was pretty bad i personally think the script by sam hamm sucks it takes itself far too seriously i don't really understand why it's part of the masters of horror series the horror that the filmmakers are going for in the screwfly solution is in the actual story itself themes ideas it brings up rather than on screen visual horror particularly the tenuous ecological message it sees intent on ramming down our throats whenever it's gets the chance during it's short 60 odd minute running time which i felt itself was a problem as the thing just finishes out of what could easily be interpreted as necessity rather than any meaningful attempt to wrap things up i wasn't happy with the inconsistencies with the story either if men only kill when sexually aroused why does the flight attendant casually break that woman's neck on the plane was he sexually aroused i think not why does every bloke then think he's killing in the name of god i just can't see every single bloke on earth suddenly knowing the bible starting to believe in god i just found the notion ridiculous the show also states clearly that there's nothing religious about what's going on so what's the deal with everyone thinking they have a divine to murder any woman they see then there's the fact people get turned on by different things what about gays for instance will they kill guys instead of women i know there's a brief scene which makes a joke out of the gay issue but it's conveniently brushed to one side then there's the thing which annoyed me the most the fact that presumably every bloke on earth has turned psycho killed all the women they go about their everyday business like nothing ever happened it just felt so stupid the plotting is rubbish to round things off there's a ending which looks like it was taken from a rejected episode of the x files 1993 2002 with a bright neon alien br br director dante on this showing definitely doesn't qualify as a master of horror as far a i'm concerned the story is badly paced it's just so stupid considering it's played deadly straight instead of trying to make a proper horror show he turns in more of a thriller with it's deadly virus on the loose situation the subsequent mother daughter on the run because of it there's very little here in the way of what i would call effective horror even less gore there's a scene when a woman is stabbed with a broken bottle a brief scene after when a guy stabs his own groin with said bottle another woman is stabbed in the stomach but nothing else to write home about br br technically like the other episodes it's really good it doesn't have the look of a cheap tv series the special effects are great as usual it's well made the acting is alright but no one really stood out br br the screwfly solution is easily the worst masters of horror episode i've seen but bear in mind i haven't seen all of them yet as a stand alone piece of entertainment it did nothing for me as a show made by a so called master of horror it disappoints me even more
<START> i joined this site to see what comments people would make about this absolute disaster of a film i wasn't drawn in for even a second the characters were all one dimensional they threw every topic they could think of hoping something would stick i would bet and hope that everyone involved in teachers looks back with embarrassment there are some great actors here but you would never know it thank god it didn't destroy morgan freeman's or judd hirsh's or nick nolte's or laura dern's careers there was no vision no labor of love here only a horrible effort gone wrong btw i don't think the writer ever set foot in a real school
