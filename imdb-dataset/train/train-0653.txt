<START> i first saw this when it was picked as a suggestion from my tivo system i like danny elfman and thought it might be interesting on top of that i'm a fan of max fleischer's work and this started out with the look and feel of his 30s cartoon with both of those i thought it would hold my interest i was wrong just a few minutes in and i had the fast forward button down i ran through it in about 15 minutes and thought that was it br br afterwards i read some of the other reviews here and figured i didn't give it enough of a chance i recorded it again and watched it through there's 75 minutes of my life i'm not getting back br br i can't believe there aren't more bad reviews personally i think it's because it's hard to get to the 10 line comment minimum how many ways are there to say this is a waste of time br br the movie comes across as though it was made by a few junior high kids ready to outrage the world and thinking they can with breasts profanity and puke jokes the characters are flat the parody of swinging the alphabet is lame essentially cobbling the tune getting through a e hitting the obvious profanity a f and then having no idea where to go the trip through the intestines to the expected landing doesn't work the first time let alone the following ones br br across the board the entire movie is what you would expect from someone trying to out south park stone and parker without the ability to determine what is and isn't funny this might be amusing if you're high otherwise it's not
<START> could contain spoilers i'm surprised by the high rating of this film to be honest really am all i saw was a slow moving propaganda movie with nothing much to say note to self must check the rating for platoon on here this movie was so black and white americans good anyone else either evil or useless i take it the british troops in it were meant to be sas one of the most elite units in the world most would agree with i'm pretty sure they lost 3 men and the others ran away while the us troops who weren't even elite soldiers in the fighting sense held the ground and opened up a can of whoop ass on them evil sneaky iraqis aye dead on strings to mind the only good thing i have to say about this movie did come in this sense when the sniper took out the sas man muzzle flash from distance good noise used really well done that bit but the rest spare me what am i 10 years of age over here well i'm not and can see nonsense propaganda in a movie and boy did this movie have it br br spoiler oh aye and in the main crazy wild guy can't stay at home with his wife and young child no he has to sign up for another year to fight in a nonsense lie of a war why because young men need thrills or something apparently like say i'm surprised by the high rating of this movie really am br br p s i'm not hating america i'm hating the message of this movie that seems to not even want to confront issues of an illegal war in my eyes which ok fair enough because clearly there are people out there who think it's a just war for whatever messed up reason wanted to say something else her but censored but hey that's up to them but to churn out a movie so one sided like it's black and white good v evil is lazy and treating me as a child in war there is a lot of grey and it's two sometimes more sides who believe in what they are fighting for not star wars with something something dark side verses the goodies f' sake hollywood at times you really do take people for mugs then again 7 8 well maybe you are right to but i'll not be buying it glad i downloaded this movie tell you all that for nothing
<START> long boring blasphemous never have i been so glad to see ending credits roll
<START> who wrote this some guy named john cohen i guess this was the first screenplay he's ever worked on someone should've told him you're supposed to write dialog that sounds like something someone actually might say br br and who directed this scott marshal son of gerry marshall my the nut has fallen far from the tree someone might have wanted to let him know that you can in fact shoot a scene in a cab in new york and it will look real and you won't have to fake it with a blue screen for no reason might have also wanted to let him know he should stay away from jessica simpson but hopefully he's learned that lesson now br br and jessica simpson naturally she can't act hell she makes jessica alba look like audry hepburn and yet she's starring in this movie oh wait it was produced by her father okay that's why she got the part that's really the only reason i can think of br br so should i be surprised it's bad no should i be amazed at how bad it is i think a lot of people would if they saw as much of it as i did i mean you expect a movie starring jessica simpson to be bad but this it's not just bad it's the complete opposite of a classic film think of a great woody allen movie this film is as bad as that film is good it's the anti annie hall br br i am so glad i didn't pay to see it i stopped watching ten minutes in cus i couldn't go on no doubt i would've walked out of the theater sooner in fact i wonder how many of the 6 people who saw it per theater actually stayed and watched the whole thing the film starts out laughably bad and then goes to the point of being so bad it becomes a kind of chinese water torture and then around when the first act is ending you realize it'll only get worse and that's when you either need to leave or kill yourself br br in conclusion this film goes under the category of being so bad it should be used in place of water boarding at guantanamo bay although some prefer the water boarding
<START> envy is bad for a number of reasons yes there are unlikeable characters that's not the problem it is that they are unlikeable and we do not care for them at all the war of the roses featured unlikeable characters but due to proper introductions we grew to at least find ourselves interested in their fate whereas in envy the introduction is thin the characters are never believable and the plot only makes things worse br br ben stiller is simply repulsive in his role and i'm a fan of his work most of the time stiller campaigned to have this released straight to video and now i can see why the movie proposes that he's best friends with jack black but from the first five minutes we are given footage that seems to indicate stiller hates black i thought this would develop into some sort of one sided relationship a la the cable guy but it never does instead stiller insists he's his best friend and i felt confused as he seemed to treat black like well poo the movie's plot is ridiculous but it doesn't matter because it's supposed to be an exaggerated morality tale unfortunately the message is lost in the mess walken gives a good performance but black is off key and annoying and i usually find him very funny no it's not a horrible film but i still can't believe barry levinson rain man sleepers is responsible for this it's not one of the worst films of all time but it could certainly be a whole lot better i wish va poo rize did exist so we could make this film disappear forever
<START> there was nothing of value in the original movie this one was even lamer the fact that i even found it to rent was absolutely amazing anyone connected to this film has to be high on something so what was the story line what was with the girl was the viewer supposed to get the story line in the first four minutes of the film sadly i tried several times to watch this i even borrowed a kid from someone to get some feedback kid said it was stupid and he was four years old i find that possibly some credit could go to the filming director as possibly some of the shots made the movie more than a b film that might be pushing it i did love the theme song good thing it was only a dollar it was worth it i suppose you might enjoy the film if you were high as the cast and crew would have to be is pot legal in france
<START> protÃ©gÃ© runs in a linear fashion expect no fast paced action and neither will you find yourself with baited breath because there are simply no seating on the edge moments br br there is not much of a crux so don't expect one either i would not fault the acting the show would have been much worst if not for wu's acting which was the film's only saving grace and oh that cute little girl too br br the humour is at best weak and the show must as well pass off as an anti drug campaign which employs the usual shock tactic esp in the scenes with zhang to tell us stuff that we already know i e drugs break up families heroin drives you crazy it is not so easy to wean off you will fall into a vicious cycle br br i know it may seem all a little harsh but i feel that the show is far from seamless and somewhat patchy spoiler alert take for example when andy lau got brought to the police station what we were just told 'oh we have all the tapes and evidence against you since 1997' and that is how he got caught nope no chasing car action just a jump of scene which kind of undermined wu's role as an undercover in the first place i suspect the lack of creativity is attributed to the fact that it is after all a production of mediacorp raintree a singaporean production film company
<START> i'm not sure quite why i clicked contains spoiler because quite honestly there is not enough explanation ever given in the movie to know enough of what is supposed to be going on to spoil it br br visually it mostly delivers well apart from some 80's throwback rubber mask monsters i'll say now that before watching this i had never seen the band lordi nor knew anything about them bar that they won eurovision apparently the monsters in this are members of the band pretty much in their stage personas whatever anyway i didn't know this while watching i just thought the monsters demons were mostly passable just about br br i'm almost sure there is a semi coherent explanation behind what we see on screen but it may actually be better not to know it it probably would actually have been incredibly lame come to think on it the action keeps it rolling along pretty much well enough to keep the viewer mostly entertained even if half the entertainment factor is joking about wtf is supposed to be happening in this movie exactly br br i gave it a four mainly because i got a good laugh out of it especially out of how it explains pretty much nothing must have been the mood i was in but i found that hella funny for some reason then i look up the movie on the internet and find out that nobody knows what the hell it's supposed to be about that amused me further and raised my score an extra half point to a 4 10 br br it's not scary or particularly coherent but it's pretty nice visually and sonically overall far from essential but watchable don't expect too much and don't expect it to make any sense and it might entertain you if you are in the right mood
<START> attention spoiler br br many people told me that Â«planet of the apesÂ» was tim burton's worst movie and apart from that much weaker than the original film so i decided not to see it another friend of mine who hadn't seen the movie yet advised me to watch it in spite of this because a tim burton movie is still a tim burton movie' i decided to do it and i found that he was right br br it's clear that a remake of such a famous film as planet of the apes' is automatically influenced by commercial thinking still tim burton managed his film to represent his weird playfulness just as well as beetlejuice' or batman' if you are already fond of burton movies it's hard not to like one of his films even if it has some flaws nerve racking monkey squeals over dressed apes and a leading actor who could have been without difficulties replaced by anbody else br br what the film gives us in the first place is an answer to the question what's the result when tim burton is instructed to create a remake first of all burton wouldn't be burton if he wouldn't refuse to call it a remake from the start it's a re imagining' on the other hand burton knows that almost every viewer of his movie has seen the very first film version starring charlton heston as human and he knows that a remake doesn't exist without its model and that the two films will not stop being compared so all he does is playing with this comparison at every moment of his film e g by referencing to quotes concerning the story line burton does a brilliant job by answering open questions of the original first and then driving the whole audience to despair by destroying this wonderful clarity and ending the movie with Â and here is the spoiler Â leo coming back to earth and finding himself inside a world that seems to have been ruled by apes forever br br now this is the burtonesque answer to people's expectations they hold because of the astonishing shocking ending of the first planet of the apes' an ending even more unexpected more astonishing and completely confusing because Â and here i'm disagreeing with various planet of the apes' homepages and platforms Â it does not make any sense there cannot be a meaning to it or just a so complicated one that it becomes ineffective tim burton is playing his cruel games he does it with a grin and he does it well burton fans will sure like it others may feel betrayed and complain about some sort of manierism well and i don't think producers will ever ask burton to direct a remake againÂ
<START> this movie had a fairly good sounding plot but the paste was very slow very slow indeed even if someone thinks this is a cult classic i think that there are a lot better films from that era to be watched br br the cinematography is not excellent but not the worst either the sounds are ok lighting ok br br i still wouldn't recommend this to anyone else than maybe a film student br br the movie does not contain music and the horses having sex don't make it a good one either and the woman masturbating on the edge of the bed was plain stupid br br no winnings here skip this utter boredom i've seen worse believe me but this is just waste of time and i don't get the good reviews here especially the high ratings
<START> in the opinion of several of my friends and family members including myself this is the finest of the entire gamut of tarzan movies johnny weissmuller never played the part as well in the following issues in the series it definitely rates a 10 in my collection of films
<START> joel schumacher made a heck of a choice when he decided on this cast and this script the story is well written and well laid out and this entirely new cast of 10 or 12 central characters was absolutely brilliant it seemed that there were 6 leads and about a half dozen supporting and by far this is the best thing about the movie the fresh young faces of tomorrow it has been a long time since hollywood has touched the controversial vietnam war films which says something for the story that needed to be told as stated by schumacher and tigerland lands in that handful of top war movies period yet it can not be labeled as a war movie because it seemed to be based more on the human spirit of bozz and the others i think anyone who just wants to see a good film with out all of the special fx but just good gritty drama should go see tigerland obviously shumachers best works in the past 8 years
<START> gÃ³mez pereira is the responsible for some of the most despicable comedies of latest spanish cinema just take a look at his curriculum vitae so i didn't expect that much of cosas que hacen in fact i don't know why in the world did i decide to watch it anyway i just did and what a surprise it looks that gÃ³mez pereira has finally matured and now he's capable of making a good movie he's last work deals with the midlife crisis the disappointing and the seeking for a second chance after you've ruined it all the last half hour of the movie the more dramatic is the best part and it just makes worth watching the film also we have eduard fernandez playing the main role and i keep on thinking he's the best actor of his generation by far br br my rate 7 10
<START> i can't believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of 6 it is barely watchable and unbelievably boring certainly one of the worst films i have seen in a long long time br br in a no budget way it reminded me of star wars episodes i and ii for the sheer impression that you are watching a total creative train wreck br br this film should be avoided at all costs it's one of those festival films that only please the pseudo intellectuals because they are so badly made those people think it makes it different therefore good br br bad film making is not different it's just bad film making
<START> although i have not seen this mini series in over twenty years i can still remember how the balance between character plot and tale of marvelous adventures succeeded the use of special effects was restrained making a more poetic rather than literal telling of the story the two versions i've seen were dubbed english and french but the actors appear to speak their own language not just italian so there is a synchronization problem it does not spoil the story telling among the cast irene pappas as penelope is the most recognizable to north americans recommended to all followers of odysseus' ever returning
<START> an offensively over the top action adventure first blood part ii seemed to catch the mood of the us at the time of it's release in the mid 80's with right wing reaganism and virulent anti red feelings still not finished yet though the emergence of a certain mikhail gorbachev in the heart of the 'evil empire' in moscow would soon render these types of films redundant even reagan himself eventually admitted this truism br br in that sense we can be most grateful to 'gorby' not for his disarmament treaties with the us nor his policies of 'glasnost' or even his support of democracy being restored to the eastern european countries in the former soviet union's backyard no it's the final diminution of foolish jingoistic bloated cold war adventures like this the first rambo film was hardly perfect though at least was a mildly literate and adequate action thriller with a not too bad storyline in this sequel any sense of even the remotest conviction is instantly jettisoned for silly senseless plotting and incident in which rambo single handedly takes on scores of brainlessly stereotyped vietnamese and russian troops to rescue american pow's ten years after the conflict ended with the americans on the losing side br br perhaps the reason why the film was a huge box office success was to let many americans wallow in fantasy they may have lost the war but there was still unfinished business at hand and ludicrous comic strip heroics with a robot like hero killing virtually every red on sight with as much hardware as possible fulfilled such whimsically far fetched ideals br br this could have been entertaining on a superman spiderman level but sadly everything is played absolutely straight but that is not to say that there is no humour in the film sadly it is virtually all of the unintentional kind the action scenes though technically adequate never once carry the slightest bit of conviction or persuasiveness because they are always placed in the most spectacularly unbelievable of contexts namely our hero rambo is always unscathed aside from a few cuts and bruises here and there despite the tons of explosives grenades gunshots etc going around him br br in between the mayhem what there is of a script consists of the dullest clichÃ©s and banalities stallone who co wrote the script with james cameron a long way from the exciting terminator made the previous year deliberately seems to have given the rambo character as little to say in understandable english and merely comes out with moronic grunts almost as though he has invented his own brand of patois only understandable to himself maybe his colleague cameron was thinking of the terminator again with so little communication involved for the lead character in this sense rambo seems even less of a human than the terminator did the rest of the cast do little better with good actors like charles napier and richard crenna doing their admirable best with the hackneyed dialogue they are given and steven berkoff hamming it up outrageously yet again with another of his russian kgb red army villain roles berkoff's overplaying is mildly enjoyable but not remotely menacing how come that sly managed to survive berkoff's electric shock torture to kill yet more of those red commie scumbags well credibility is never this film's strong point it is a work of fantasy comparable with the wizard of oz at least that was meant to be a fantasy and an immortal classic it turned out to be this is only a classic of the most dismal and indeed offensive kind and as for sly's climactic speech rather hypocritical after slaughtering all those people eh by the way in the same year he also made rocky iv br br rating 3 out of 10
<START> this is a wonderful movie about the struggle of the mormons and their final settlement in salt lake utah the beginning and the ending are especially powerful and the message is one we all have to be reminded of god doesn't talk but he communicates if we would only listen as i am writing this in the midst of the horrors going on in new orleans and the surrounding area due to katrina i was especially moved by the mormons having to leave everything behind and move on after joseph smith was assassinated people came to this country to escape religious persecution and yet they could not the struggle of the mormons to cross the country the cost in lives the hardship they suffered was truly awe inspiring demonstrating their tremendous strength as far as the actual beliefs of mormons this is not heavily gone into and polygamy is mentioned but is not a centerpiece of the film at all br br the cast is top notch though others who have commented know more about the actual characters and can talk about how true the portrayals were but as actors dean jagger mary astor brian donlevy john carradine jane darwell all do excellently with the script they were given br br though the film could have easily stood on its own and certainly does today tyrone power and linda darnell were added to the cast to get the crowds into the movie theaters to see a film about the mormons power is magnificently handsome as a young mormon and darnell as zina is not a mormon but stays on with the family after her father is killed power does not have much to do until the end of the film when he has a big scene and darnell still a teenager at the time of the filming has even less though they make a lovely couple their fate is left unclear regarding her conversion and one does wonder about the polygamy in their case you can't beat either one for eye candy however
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br the american military has just launched a major new stealth fighter plane that can evade detection unlike any other a renegade pilot steve touissant steals it and plots to hold the us government to ransom with it so they are forced to send in their best man john sands seagal who else to stop him in exchange for his freedom from a detention centre where his mind was to be wiped of all the incriminating information he's learned over the years br br i skipped attack force because i could tell from the cover and all the post production tampering that had occurred that it would be crap and when all the negative reviews and low user rating came pouring in it just confirmed what i thought but i decided to give fof a go because shadow man by the same director wasn't bad and what the hell seagal was my favourite action star once and maybe just maybe he could make a great film again oh what a fool i was br br dubbing horrendous stock footage of aerial stealth fighter jets awful camera work cheap production values risible unconvincing fight scenes that have become seagal's trademark and a boring sleep inducing plot that doesn't go anywhere br br thankfully his next film once upon a time in the hood which i'll be skipping apparently marks the end of his contract with sony meaning no more of these awful european lensed action films and his next film prince of pistols might mark a return to theatres hell he's done it before and stallone will have managed to do it before him rocky balboa br br this isn't a flight of fury it isn't even a flight of fun it's a flight that fails to even take off the ground
<START> evidently when you offer a actor enough money they will do anything i am not sure how much john rys daves got but most of the money he made should go to his fans as an apology for even being associated with such a rotten movie the special effects were worse then effects from the 1950's b movies and the acting of the rest of the cast was even worse as to how bad the acting was a child gave the second best performance in my opinion the english was terribly accented and i think no one could really even speak english they just memorized how the words should sound instead of memorizing the script and trying to make their character both life like and real
<START> well maybe the pc version of this game was impressive maybe i just finished playing the ps2 version and it's pretty much a complete mess br br there are a couple elements that are okay or promising i'll mention those first because it will be over quickly first the idea of a historical gta like game is a great one the game gun was a historical gta like game and unlike mafia gun was excellent i'd love to see a game set during mafia's era done right next the storyline is well written the story makes sense it has dramatic arcs it uses an unusual device with much of the game being a backstory and it's interesting finally some of the graphics especially those used during cutscenes are impressive mafia's designers seemed to focus on getting the graphics right in the places where gta skimped on that effort especially the characters unfortunately in many other areas the graphics kinda stink and i'd much rather have excellent gameplay than impressive looking characters br br the gameplay is what sinks this title so low first off the controls and camera absolutely suck that has to be the first focus of any game developers you can't release a game where the controls and or camera suck number one there's no reason that the player's character tom can't have his full range of motion controlled by the left analog stick unless it's absolutely necessary and it hardly ever is i hate the set up where the left stick moves the character in a strafing way and the character can only turn using the right analog stick here it's not only unnecessary it makes most of the simplest actions a challenge for example tom has to climb on a couple missions but the game is designed so poorly that you have to frustratingly keep manipulating both the right analog stick and the camera and then press l1 every time you need to climb or tom will descend instead br br next i've never seen a worse fighting system the first problem is that you can't auto aim or lock on to any targets at one early point the game seems to tell you that you can use l2 or r2 to lock on to targets but that never worked so to focus on any enemy you have to struggle with the stupid right analog stick and try to keep adjusting both the character's orientation and the camera which tends to drift to the wrong angle or make tom disappear all the time by that time you're probably getting pummeled or shot to death br br next if you're touching or almost touching an enemy and that's certainly going to be the case for hand to hand combat or when using melee weapons the fighting system which primarily consists of tapping or holding r1 is completely useless enemies can pummel you almost in a bear hug but you just can't move unless you back off so close fighting tends to consist of you yanking on the left analog stick yelling at the character to move away which it won't do 50 of the time then tapping r1 as much as you can before the enemy gets too close again and makes r1 useless and if the enemy changes their angle to you in the meantime you're also going to struggle with the right analog stick to get your character oriented in the right way and to get the camera in position so you can see anything by that time you're probably getting pummeled or shot again and your only option will be to try to move the character away again my fights often consisted of making tom run circles around an area like a comedy film hoping that i could gain enough time to struggle with the analog stick and get a couple shots in before being at the ai's mercy again so much for realistic fighting br br and the same problems and more exist when trying to fight with guns if you're touching someone half the time the controller just won't allow you to fire off a shot yet they can still riddle you full of holes additionally there's no auto aim and the aiming system is ridiculously sensitive even with the sensitivity set to zero under options gunfights tend to consist of you hopelessly trying to aim or move away while the enemy puts shot after shot into you luckily or not damage seems to be recorded almost randomly it can take one to ten shots or more to incapacitate any character and there's no rhyme or reason to it you can put five shots into an enemy's head and near point blank range and they'll still return fire and hurt you yet the game designers seemed to care enough about realism than they built a recoil into your aiming system so after shots with powerful enough guns your aim will float off target and you'll have to fight with it again br br as for the celebrated graphics except for the characters and textures that you're close to they're actually pretty disappointing the distance always seems mostly empty and there are often expanses of flat colors and textures nearby when you're driving the city wasn't very well designed it's not varied enough and there aren't many interesting things to see or do the cars seem slow and they're difficult to control they also all drive about the same some have mentioned the music but that was also pretty nondescript a much better job could have been done on that end also as many others have mentioned the load times are ridiculous and constant they tend to be over a minute long and they occur between and in the middle of everything even races br br overall the mafia port to ps2 at least seems to have been very rushed the game feels and plays like an incomplete hack job
