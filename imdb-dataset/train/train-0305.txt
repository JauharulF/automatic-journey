<START> scream was wes craven's last decent thriller since then there has been nothing but an unbearable streak of hollywood trash barely good enough for a blockbuster night including the disappointment of the scream sequels perhaps the genius and the craftsmanship devoted to the movie drained all the energy and creativity out of him so that when it came time for supper he had nothing to serve us but his own doo doo finally after who knows how many bad movies later he gives us a delicious ruthless gripping chilling suspense thriller with red eye br br rachel mcadams once again delivers an enjoyable performance as she plays a hotel manager who has the unfortunate connection with an important political figure and regular at her hotel then she meets jackson ripner cillian murphy batman beyond at the airport who she gets to know a little better after a delayed flight and a bay breeze what she doesn't know is he already knows her and he also knows her father who she will never see again if she fails to cooperate and meet jackson's demands to use her connections to set up her hotel regular for assassination br br you're probably thinking this is nothing but your everyday thriller complete with predictability and chase scenes although this is a good old fashioned thriller that's the beauty of it no special effects no cheap make up just classic suspense you feel the desperation and regret with every decision mcadams is forced to make and you actually care for her as you cheer her on every move she makes to find an escape from her claustrophobic position br br as always she delivers an entertaining and convincing performance it's either her sweet face or her uncanny ability to sincerely cry but you always seem to sympathize with her if her role demands it cillian murphy on the other hand is naturally creepy looking so even if the trailer didn't reveal it his ultimate transition from charming stranger to merciless jackass isn't so surprising perhaps it would have been more trippy to see a nice guy persona like toby maguire transforming into evil relentless madman nevertheless cillian murphy after his true identity is established played the role so solidly you'd really want him to die or at least get his ass kicked br br don't overlook this feature there are plenty of chalkboard screeching moments and heart jumpers that will keep your eyes on the screen instead of your watch like you would at craven's recent pictures if not for the you do it for all the times you'll see your girlfriend or boyfriend or someone with popcorn jump and cling on to you wes finally gets it right aside from his trademark mastery in suspense red eye is not without its humor as mcadams' replacement cynthia at the front desk fumbles to keep the hotel in order it was a relief that red eye wasn't a disappointment instead you'll get the pleasure of seeing mcadams deliver another incredibly talented performance murphy look creepier by the minute and craven craft a classic traditional thriller a flight that was delayed and would have been the beginning of craven's renaissance had it arrived right after scream
<START> if this documentary had not been made by the famous french director louis malle i probably would have turned it off after the first 15 minutes as it was an incredibly dull look at a very ordinary midwestern american town in 1979 this is not exactly my idea of a fun topic and the film footage closely resembled a collection of home movies considering i didn't know any of these people it was even less interesting br br because it was a rather dull slice of life style documentary i wondered while watching what was the message they were trying to convey perhaps it was that values aren't as conservative as you might think this was an underlying message through many of the vignettes such as the republicans whose son was a draft resister as well as the man and lady who thought sex outside of marriage was just fine or perhaps the meaning was that there was a lot of bigotry underlying the nice home town as several ugly ideas such as blaming jews for financial conspiracies anti black bigotry and homophobia all were briefly explored br br the small town of 1979 was explored in great depth and an idyllic sort of world was portrayed but when the film makers returned six years later the mood was depressed thanks to president reagan this seemed very disingenuous for several reasons first the 1979 portion was almost 90 of the film and the final 10 only consisted of a few interviews of people that blamed the president for just about everything but acne what about the rest of the folks of this town did they all see reagan as evil or that their lives had become more negative with only a few updates it seemed suspicious second while it is true that the national debt doubled in the intervening years so did the gross national product and while malle shows 1979 as a very optimistic period it was far from that as the period from 1974 1980 featured many shortages gas sugar etc strikes high inflation and general malaise while i am not a huge fan of reagan because government growth did not slow during his administration the country in general was far more optimistic than it had been in the ford and carter years while many in the media demonized reagan a popular sport in the 80s the economy improved significantly and the documentary seems very one sided and agenda driven had the documentary given a more thorough coverage of 1985 and hadn't seemed too negative to be believed after all everyone didn't have their lives get worse this defies common sense then i might have thought otherwise br br overall not the wonderful documentary some have proclaimed it to be ranging from a dull film in 1979 to an extremely slanted look at 1985 br br by the way is it just me or does the film drop dead gorgeous seem to have been inspired at least in part by this film both are set in similar communities but the latter film was a hilarious mockumentary without all the serious undertones
<START> one of my favorite movies with a very nostalgic ending the movie is about the sullivan family obviously michael sullivan the father is one of the main members of the mafia the killer to say it this way and an expert one one of the kids wants to know the work of his father a terrible mistake so he hides on his father's car and well he sees tom hanks in action to say it this way br br mafia doesn't rules in mafia nobody wins when they want you out they take you out of course you can see anyone who works at the mafia with a giant house the best car in the world whatever you like but make a wrong work or make something your boss doesn't want and you're fired and killed br br you can see what i mean in the movie sullivan jr sees something he didn't had to see and well almost all his family gets killed for that wrong thing his son did the movie is really entertaining you see how the sullivan's live after being chased by the mafia or kinda of that br br this movie is kinda of sad shows us about revenge those dirty works people do almost everything you like hopefully the guy is reading this comment doesn't works for the mafia and if you work at the mafia make yourself a favor and get the hell out of the country before you get killed by your boss and their workers br br this movie receives 10 10
<START> during eddie murphy's stand up a women from the audience yells at eddie and a man from the audience responds what is said is women do mr rob this is a character from saturday night live the man responds with shut up bitch unlike the previous post saying the women yelled do gumby this is incorrect although the post er said he was there they must have a hearing problem despite what the post er says about not being able to here it on dvd have a close listen as you actually can hear it on the dvd do mr rob i hope this helps anyone curious out the outburst cheers gaz
<START> here is one of those educational short films made to learn the unknown people out there about facts of life this time the target audience is preteen girls the fact of life is menstruation this animated film created by walt disney pictures apparently with some sponsoring from kotex br br it starts with explaining how hormones make you grow and develop with the help of animation and a female narrator it shows us how the body especially the ovaries uterus and vagina work and why this all leads to menstruation it is almost amazing becoming the comic note here how the subject of sex is avoided even the word is never mentioned although furtilized will pass once i don't really know why i saw this but since it is one of those rare short films that could give an impression of an innocent time you might want to give it a try
<START> not a very good movie but according to the info it's pretty accurate in depicting torture techniques the purpose of the film was to show the brutality of the nk pow camps and that's done effectively enough with surprising frankness for the time whatever technical flaws exist and there are plenty by watching this you'll see a forgotten corner of a forgotten war and some pretty nasty stuff again nasty because it's being done north of the dmz and not in guantanamo bay br br i don't think any of the korean veterans brought up his torture when running for office and if you watch the movies like this one and pork chop hill in comparison to the vietnam films i don't know if it was the people in '54 being trapped in the wwii concepts the boys tend to wisecrack a lot or the war or what but it's interesting to see this from the same system that 16 years later would be making movies like go tell the spartans
<START> a have a female friend who is currently being drawn into a relationship with an sob who has a long term girlfriend of course the sob is very good looking charming etc and my friend is a very intelligent woman watching jean pierre leaud's character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends it's tragic and you know she's going to end up very hurt but there's nothing you can do leaud is brilliant totally empty a blank throughout he pulls the faces and tells the stories he thinks will get the reaction he wants br br the scene two hours in when leaud and lebrun have made love and the next morning he puts on a record and very sweetly and charmingly sings along to amuse her is brilliant the what the hell am i doing here with this idiot expression that flickers back and forth across her face will be in my memory for a long time to come br br it's a long film but see it in one go preferably in a cinema takes a while to get into but then the time just disappears
<START> i spent 5 hours drenched in this film nothing i have ever seen comes close to the delicious funk this film left me in never mind females advanced aging dilemma's human fear vaults off the screen for your viewing personally engaging to the ninth degree the film invests one with an undeniable shared feeling for our lives' i enjoyed this dalliance with raw wounded gall deep from within it empowers a mutually shared vestment in the history of human encounters reaching far deeper into the pain isolation and skewed views of self and others the result forgives our tepid forming of a bridge away from the muddy sludge of dead we must encounter the birth in finding real people is a happy pursuit the effort for realism intersects with the dark ground of our bankrupt culture
<START> when i first saw this movie i was with my dad he encouraged me to watch this movie because it was one of his favorites after watching the movie it instantly became one of my favorites br br a river runs through it is about two brothers who each take a different path in life norman maclean craig sheffer is the older of the two brothers and he is set on the path of education paul maclean brad pitt is the rebellious younger brother who travels on a path full of obstacles the movie follows these characters as the each follow their own path br br there is no downside to this movie you will be entertained the whole way through the acting directing and script is all perfect the two things that are exceptional are the cinematography and the score both of which entrap you in the world robert redford creates for you br br this is an all around great movie that is destined to be a classic it sure is in my book if you haven't seen this movie definitely watch it as soon as you can because it will stay with you forever
<START> 48 out of 278 people found this comment useful and counting br br people are such suckers for image and looks as much as for the intellectually hollow idealism that lurks behind communism che's charisma and looks have as much to do with his iconic stature as the misinformation that has been spread by leftist propaganda such as this movie about him br br i don't know what's worse being captured by one of che's murder squads or having to sit through 4 hours of this typically soderberghian garbage the question isn't why this pet project was made but what took them so long by them i'm referring of course to left wing hollywood and its secret love of marxist tyrants lenin castro take your pick i am fascinated that it took decades for one of tinseltown's least talented liberal directors to finally take on such an irresistibly biased propaganda project where was oliver stone all these years robert redford tim robbins warren beatty alan pakula george clooney barbra streisand even it's a mystery all these overrated artists have often indulging themselves in similar politically one sided projects yet somehow che guevara who is arguably the most popular and well known communist hasn't been a film topic of theirs yet br br guerrilla has all the hallmarks of an american truth bending story of an epic scale there is as much factual detail to be found here as in other similar hollywood big budget political fairy tale bios such as malcolm x or gandhi i e almost none the movie stars del toro as the famous argentinian revolutionary nevertheless however controversial and criminal this man's actions may have been one thing nobody could take away from him he was an intelligent manipulator who came from a rich family which is why del toro fits the bill only visually del toro may be an interesting charismatic actor and he may resemble guevara physically but he exudes no intellectual qualities whatsoever hence he makes guevara come off as too primitive casting such mediocrities as bratt philips and franka incompetente only underlines the director's lack of sound judgment br br the movie is to the most part extremely slow no surprise there and visually uninteresting even a director as brilliant as kubrick would have carefully considered releasing a movie that goes beyond the 3 hour mark so it's quite telling that this soderbergh who has only made one or two solid movies and early on in his career would think that his oceanic grandness was up to the task if you think the film's length indicates that a bulk of che's life has been shown here then think again soderbergh focuses on che's last phase and a lot of the movie is tedious jungle nonsense full of guevara's alleged idealism psychopaths don't have ideals i do wonder what kind of a mind this highly esteemed director has to have to actually choose to ignore some of che's earlier life did he actually consider it too uninteresting a massacre of 600 people holds no interest for the viewer huh amazing some much better directors than this over praised charlatan would have easily fit not one but two complete biographies into a 4 hour movie br br soderbergh in a sense becomes an accomplice by never addressing the negative dark side which is more than 90 of guevara by spreading this kind of historical inaccuracy consciously ignoring the ugly truth god forbid he should taint the holy image of che soderbergh proves himself not a humanist a fake image which most hollywood and pop music personalities struggle very hard all their careers to uphold but the opposite that he cares only about ideas never about the people on whom these ideas are tested like on guinea pigs soderbergh and the like are elitists of the worst kind such people often have a latent contempt for the proleteriat what a stupid term they're supposedly siding with br br half of all students around the world wear che's image on their red and orange shirts but without ever knowing why he has become an iconic figure for clueless uninformed very often young people who think that by having this man's face on their chest that somehow makes them appear edgy intellectual hip or interesting in reality wearing a che shirt only underlines one's overall shallowness and total disinterest in self education wouldn't you want to find out more about a person before you start advertising his her face to the world wearing che's by now clichÃ© image has become as common as having a bart simpson coffee cup all those che wearers probably know more about marge's blue hair than they'll ever read up on about fidel castro's dead ally br br after everything that'd been done in the name of marx one would think that these mongrel ideals would be finally laid to rest it seems mankind will never learn stalin mao kim il pol pot castro milosevic ceausescu the iron curtain a hundred million dead more than a billion ruined physically and or mentally through this system so none of that matters huh br br the fact that del toro won a cannes award should only surprise those who are absolutely clueless as to how cannes and other european festivals work and vote hint sean penn headed a jury not long ago br br

<START> as a hammer completist i was dreading the time when i would have to raise the courage to watch this film and the one following it holiday on the buses i had seen one the buses the film and thought it one of the worst films i have ever seen it was full of all the awful comedy that plagued british tv screens around the early 70's br br i am ashamed to say that there were actually parts of this film that i laughed at i don't know if it was because i was now familiar with the characters and enjoyed some of the situations knowing how they would react i found blakey particularly funny although i could swear at no point in the trilogy does he say his catchphrase i'll get you butler br br having watched holiday on the buses the jokes were starting to wear thin and these three films could be compared to an early hammer trilogy dick barton in that the second film made is the best although this is probably the only way they could be compared br br the only people who would want to watch this film are probably fans of the tv series who will no doubt enjoy this and hammer completists like myself to the completists i would say that this film isn't that bad and i can certainly think of worse hammer comedies
<START> this is an honest attempt to make a bewitchingly sweet love story the obvious inspiration behind the successful tv series bewitched this lovely sweet rom com is a timeless treasure the comparisons are obvious jimmy stewart plays a hapless but stolid straight kim novac plays a voluptuous blond witch who captures him through the use of a love spell but when that spell is broken by a stronger witch she contents herself with the duties of running her own shop and takes comfort in the fact that her beloved pyewacket her feline familiar is being cared for by her beloved aunt you'll recognize the aunt from murder by death this movie is fun and touchingly sweet bearing some spectacular wit and a nice witchy feel worth a look
<START> annoying static comedy with a painfully miscast peter sellers as a smarmy self centered casanova who always has his way with the ladies a major blemish on sellers' filmography and even worse a film that seems to have been made solely to satisfy the ego of its star
<START> a meteor crashes into crater lake the heat from the impact causing a prehistoric egg to hatch br br alright so the plot is just trash but despite its obvious low budget this comes across as one of the most gripping and entertaining monster on the loose films in existence there are also some good moments of humor in an age filled so called 'monsters' which are no more than laughable men in rubber suit creations or lizards dressed up in frills and forced to rip each other to pieces cheap exploitation style it's refreshing to discover that the plesiosaur in this little gem is an excellent harryhausen style stop motion creature br br quite a hard film to find but it's worth finding
<START> i disagree with much that has been written and said about this supposed masterpiece of the german new wave br br 1 there are major flaws in simple exposition in the basic communication of critical plot points as relating to maria's abortion and the secret contract between oswald and her husband how many viewers understood that the husband agreed in exchange for substantial financial remuneration not to return to and reclaim his wife until oswald was dead br br 2 the ending is highly unsatisfying because arbitrary and accidental the original screenplay called for maria to commit suicide after the reading of oswald's will on finding out that her husband had in effect sold their marriage to oswald in the final version however maria only runs water from a faucet across her wrist in a gesture of suicide maria is then summarily blown up rather than having to confront and live with the consequences of her self delusion and moral compromise br br 3 fassbinder seeks to forcibly superimpose the public on the private the political on the personal contrary to what the critics and experts assert i don't think it works merely intruding historic radio news or the sound of the jackhammers of german reconstruction in the soundtrack on the dramatic events of the movie does not make those historical events integral to the drama br br the selfish ambition of maria's rise from poverty to prosperity is meant to parallel the so called economic miracle of postwar germany maria is thus intended to be a woman specific to and reflective of her time and place but is in reality unoriginal and nonspecific women have been asserting their independence by using sex for self advancement for ages br br 4 lastly there are several instances of inexcusable sloppiness and amateurishness fassbinder's drug addiction and consequent impatience and inattention have had their effect unknown people talk off screen without ever being seen music is clumsily intrusive in places and melodramatic posturing sporadically substitutes for acting br br strangely for a movie condemning a country for willful collective amnesia of the holocaust it itself never mentions it once
<START> sudden impact is the best of the five dirty harry movies they don't come any leaner and meaner than this as harry romps through a series of violent clashes with the bad guys getting their just desserts which is just the way i like it great story too and ably directed by clint himself excellent entertainment
<START> i couldn't help but feel that this could have been a bigger movie than it was the screenplay is highly intelligent and it just seemed that it could have been opened up in a way more reminiscent of seven not by changing the story i think mainly through the cinematography the cinematography was the only thing that i found to be holding back the film on the other hand the pacing was absolutely on point whoever worked on the editing really did their job well and i thought bill paxton did a great job of directing now away from the technical stuff br br this movie threw me for a loop spoiler ahead all along i really felt that bill paxton was crazy and then when adam finally took the fbi agent to the rose garden to show him where the bodies were buried and revealed who he was i got thrown for a loop i had suspected the first part of the twist but what really threw me was when he touches the agent and sees the agent murder his mother and the fact that the agent too without any words spoken simply by touch sees it again with adam and asks him how he knew my dilemma was not that it was yet another twist thrown in but the almost ungraspable idea that this man and his father were not crazy but actually picked out 'bad guys' so to speak knowing their sins and crimes already i don't endorse an eye for an eye so i didn't leave the film being able to believe that they were doing god's work instead i chose to believe that they were both clairvoyant and that the father had gone off the deep end one day from it and through the things that he subjected his sons to disturbed them permanently also that was my interpretation but the vexing thing about the film was it's like a house of cards and a never ending circle and what is the correct interpretation of the disturbing events you've sat through it's definitely one of those movies where i'd love to be able to meet the writer so i could just ask him what the real meaning was to it all were they crazy and psychotic were they simply telepathic and took license because of it or did they have some sort of appearance from god and if so was it god or the devil disguising himself as god my friends and i found ourselves talking about it all night trying to figure out what was what and what the filmmakers had thought was the answer when they made this movie br br a definitely perplexing and thought invoking film with some very disturbing but certainly not sensationalistic elements to it it's not a perfect film but it definitely is it's own thing great directorial work and acting by bill paxton and the child that played fenton was extremely good i hope he doesn't end up relegated to the child actor syndrome as he seems to have a lot of promise i gave this movie a good vote for the majority of the components that make a film but i would have voted higher if wasn't for the feeling that something although i can't pinpoint what was off and if it hadn't have been the movie would have gone to an even higher level still a definite recommend especially for those that are inquisitive
<START> soapdish may go down as one of the single most under rated movies ever made br br a stellar unselfish cast who understood exactly where the movie was going and the roles they played in it while everyone hammed it up there was no one upmanship kline showed wit and great physical comedy goldberg and downey knew how to carry on a funny conversation while someone else was talking i could just go on br br do not pass this movie by
<START> we always watch american movies with their particular accents from each region south west etc we have the same here all foreign people must to watch this movie and need to have a open mind to accept another culture besides american and european almost dominate the cinematographic industry br br this movie tell us about a parallel world which it isn't figured even for those who live in a big city like sÃ£o paulo all actors are improvising and they are very realistic the camera give us an idea of their confuse world the loneliness of each character and invite us to share their world br br it's a real great movie and worst a rent even have it at home
<START> from beginning to end this is the most emotionally overwrought movie about nothing i have ever seen the characterizations and interactions between the title character and marthe kller's character are pure torture the racetrack as metaphor gimmick is so overplayed that it borders on cliche yet director pollack treats every hairpin turn as if it were something profoundly important br br maybe there's some value for a msft3000 re playing of some of the scenes such as pacino getting in touch with his inner female for goof value but even such accidental humor is hard to find in this total turkey
