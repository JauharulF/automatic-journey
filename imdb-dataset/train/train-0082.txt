<START> greetings from this portuguese guy br br i believe the sopranos are one of the best production ever it has reality and fiction mixed in such a way that it's hard to see the difference it has the same quality as godfather james gandolfini fits at the paper as a glove i would love the sopranos would never finish at all it's perfect it should be a subject in school i saw sopranos when i was a kid but i was too young to stay waked until the episode ends so now i bought the all episodes in dvd format and i am watching all episodes at home before and after dinner and i am getting addicted like i did with prison break in my opinion prison break and the sopranos are the best ever series made for television the argument of both are splendid and the actors are perfect congratulations for such a work br br sorry about my english thanks for reading
<START> i sought out this film for one reason al adamson he is among the worst directors of all time right up there with ed wood jr and ray dennis steckler and the pantheon of awfulness however i was a tad disappointed because although the film was indeed bad it never approached the levels of awfulness of some of his earlier schlocky movies because of that this film wasn't particularly fun to watch for us bad movie fans br br now i was wary about watching this film as the title naughty stewardesses makes the film sound like a pornographic film something i wouldn't be reviewing on imdb however this film appeared to be this at times particularly the first 10 minutes but you could tell that the script underwent many changes as for much of the film there isn't any titillation at all and towards the end of the movie there is a plot that comes out of no where that is violent and certainly not sexy the result of all this is total confusion br br sadly none of the many parts are even good for example as a porn video it shows surprisingly little and it's incomprehensible why they would put a 71 year old guy in some of the love scenes sure for a 71 year old mr livingston looked pretty good but he was still an old man and no one would want to see him getting it on with young nymphet then when the final 20 minutes becomes very violent as livingston became a rambo like guy talk about weird and inappropriate br br overall there is little to recommend this sad movie it's not bad enough or sexy enough to care about and the film manages to be rather boring even with such a crazy title like naughty stewardesses
<START> this mindless movie is a piece of crap and boring like the full house repetitions for all the people who want to see a great exciting and cool horror movie shouldn't even think about watching this bunch of mindless work a f in my opinion i have one question what were they thinking let's make a list 1 bad script 2 bad script 3 bad script 4 bad acting 5 bad directing and last but not least a bad script i mean i am not like grumping about every movie but i was disappointed when i watched it this movie should be banned into a box locked and sunk down into the sea so please don't do something like this again please please please
<START> anyone who actually had the ability to sit through this movie and walk away feeling like it was a good film does not appreciate quality movies this movie was an insult to watch the direction was high school film class quality as well as the cinematography the blair witch project had better cinematography and i hate that move with a passion the storyline had the potential to be a very intense very good movie but it fell flat from the first 10 minutes through the rest of the movie someone mentioned that this film was about a child's imagination okay thats all good and fine but they still could have done better things with this script than what they did i mean come on the indian in the store did the kid look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the indian and the entire story about an indian spirit called wendigo which they mention to the store employee and she casually says there is no one but me that works here so you think okay creepy ghost scenario but then she just barters for the amount on the idol and we forget about the little kid seeing this guy that was so lame it goes beyond pathetic the ending left you wondering not only what happened to otis in the hospital but also with the feeling of omg why the hell did i just waste my time watching this this is a move that i recommend not to watch there are definitely better quality films out there that won't insult your intelligence thank god i never had to pay to see this movie i would have demanded my money back for those that were easily entertained by this movie it's very sad that you lowered your standards to this level of film making to actually say that it was a good movie
<START> i love eddie izzard i think this is awesome and the other television specials should be looked at as well he has a good book dress to kill out to buy as well which i think people should read i loved that this program won an emmy and anyone who likes history will probably get a laugh from eddie enjoy
<START> i grew up watching this series i was about seven eight years old when it was on i still remember the 1st episode which was called the new house it scared the h ll out of me i can almost still hear that statue laughing madly and the ending oh my god the hooror spirit comes in the room for the child yikes this was classic tv and it was a one of a kind series i have found a dvd collection for sale on the internet 2 actually my question to any readers has anyone purchased this set its a bootleg both sellers claim to have very good copy i have a sketchy and poor dvd of the new house episode and a couple of other episodes that are a bit better however if anyone knows if these are much clearer it would be worth it to me to buy and share with my kids a great series clever scary and daringly supernatural thanks in advance to any fans who have the low down on any of this in fact i'd love to discuss it chris walker
<START> starts really well nice intro and build up for the main characters but after about 5 minutes the charm is lost br br the character is in the same mould as the main protagonist from american pie and loser without the supporting cast or innovative storyline that made the pie movies more of a commercial success br br let's be honest heder's acting was pretty poor keaton daniels and faris did their best but had no substantial plot or script to get their teeth into the movie just plods on without any pace or clear logical storyline justifying its length br br the ending is about as predictable as they come so predictable i've ticked the spoilers box for this one line br br my advice avoid at all costs unless you really really have nothing else to do listen to or watch and even then you'll feel the producers just cheated you out of an hour and a half of your life
<START> i've seen this film several times in a variety of short film festivals and it always causes me the impression that i have seen a movie trailer br br for a school film is very well produced and directed but the story well it needed something else to be a bigger and interesting film the character named tim watcher needed some in dept approach this is something that lacks in some portuguese short films the script is always superficial br br but still i liked this movie br br parabens congratulations
<START> deathstalker is perfect for b fantasy movie fans this barely 80 minute travesty of film making features everything hecklers can ask for non existent plotting terrible acting save for at least a raspy sounding old lady laughable scripting and schlock editing and bargain basement style background settings there are no characters that come across as likable or interesting in particular the lead doesn't have anything appealing about him and the actors assembled barely do anything to rise above the f grade material if that's not enough then how about the lack of a compelling plot which this movie has nothing of the sort to make deathstalker qualify as a major turkey i was also offended that the women in this movie barely serve any purpose other than to 1 be topless and or scantily clad 2 get raped 3 have sex with the hero 4 all of the above in addition the background music is hideous a bizarre mess of electronic noise cheesy choral bursts and blaring orchestral cacophony ear numbing and eye numbing all in one packed with nary a thing to keep one interested deathstalker is probably best suited for folks looking for something to laugh at and believe me there's plenty of that in here otherwise i do not recommend this 100th grade conan wanna be to anyone in the least
<START> bruce almighty looks and sounds incredibly stupid especially from the trailers nevertheless i found in it a deeper message that actually made me like this film more bruce jim carrey is angry at god and is given divine powers by him to be god for a week to see if he can do a better job morgan freeman plays a man symbolized here as god and though it isn't his usual type of film or one of his best roles he does excellent with what he is given to work with although crude at times the film does have quite a few laughs from bruce parting his soup in half like the red sea and the customers' reactions to him as well as freeman's seemingly laid back and wisecracking image of god it is overly exaggerated at times and there is some crude humor but overall it manages to be somewhat funny there is a decent supporting cast such as jennifer aniston lisa ann walter and steve carrell which always helps the end of the film proves to be very romantic and tear jerking and the message is clear that we should do what god has called us to do and be the miracle the film is far from perfect but still enjoyable and far better than i and many people probably would have expected especially if we see the deeper message of the film br br out of
<START> when i first read armistead maupins story i was taken in by the human drama displayed by gabriel no one and those he cares about and loves that being said we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of hollywood br br writer armistead maupin and director patrick stettner have truly succeeded br br with just the right amount of restraint robin williams captures the fragile essence of gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel life jess and the world around him donna br br as we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably the request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forward br br it's to bad that most people will avoid this film i only say that because the average american will probably think robin williams in a serious role that didn't work before please give this movie a chance robin williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people like his movie one hour photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of art br br oh and before i forget i believe bobby cannavale as jess steals every scene he is in he has the 1940's leading man looks and screen presence it's this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right now br br s
<START> from a plot and movement standpoint this movie was terrible i found myself looking at the clock in theater hoping it would end and relieved after 80 long minutes that it mercifully did basically five characters appear in the movie a son father son's girl friend and two male characters of the son's age who appear and then disappear without context or explanation the movie and scenes seemed to suggest homo eroticism but nothing ever actually happened to reveal this one way or another there were a couple of brilliant scenes at the beginning of the movie the son's girl friend shows up at a window outside his room and they engage in an odd conversation the photography and acting lent an incredible seductiveness to the interaction between the two ending with her admitting to having another man who was older end of that story
<START> reading the various external reviews of roger ebert and other well known film critics makes me hesitate to admit how much i love this movie even though i only have a dubbed into japanese video version of it br br apparently many critics seem to take it as a minus that the story premise has been used before most famously in the very great it's a wonderful life to me a great premise is a great premise no matter how many times it's used and i'd be happy to see more movies using this particular premise the discontented man who gets a chance to gain a fresh perspective on his own life through a bit of divine magic br br i suppose folks and critics of a more intellectual bent are not as pulled into the story but i don't go to movies to critique them with notebook in hand i go to movies to throw myself into them and let them take me where they will br br if you are sentimental sort like myself you'll be well rewarded by seeing this picture the performances are excellent throughout and the movie was very well cast wonderful choice of music too michael caine is superb as the sympathetic bartender jim belushi does a great job as an average joe kind of guy who wonders if his life hasn't gone as it should linda hamilton always excellent is again right on target here as the loving wife jon lovitz entertains as usual and even has some surprisingly moving moments in mr destiny br br no mr destiny is not it's a wonderful life but who says it has to be taken on its own terms mr destiny is an enjoyable well made funny and moving film i've seen my japanese dubbed video of it numerous times and i'm sure i'll see it several more times if that somehow makes me a lowbrow so be it i'm just glad that i hadn't read any reviews of mr destiny before seeing it br br i suppose i should have the courage of my convictions and give the movie nine or ten stars but i couldn't help but doubt myself after reading all the critical reviews
<START> this film is very creepy indeed unfortunately not for the reasons the film makers would hope br br there's a mastermind serial killer too but he's not what's creepy either he's just your standard comic book villain a cross between hannibal lecter and freddie kruger though with nothing particularly fresh to add to either incidentally for even the vilest and most reprehensible of criminals can they be detained chained in a stress position on their feet arms outstretched 24 hours a day week in week out i suppose in the world that gave us abu ghraib and guantanamo bay anything's possible br br no what's really creepy about this film is the central character danny this unappealing young man aided and abetted it's true by some ludicrously lax security arrangements and a doctor entirely careless of any notion of professional ethics or patient confidentiality wanders into the hospital room occupied by what can only be described as a highly vulnerable and defenceless young woman and on the basis of nothing whatsoever her chronic sleeping precludes from being able to give anything like informed consent imagines himself to have some sort of special relationship with her br br seemingly within days he has arrogated to himself the right to abduct her believing completely falsely as we discover that he is better able to care for her than anyone else and within minutes of getting her back to his apartment is sexually molesting her though she is again due to her sleepiness entirely unable to consent or resist br br our suspicions as to why he would feel this connection are pretty soon confirmed he is of course more or less unable to form any mature adult friendships let alone sexual relationships so instead falls back on this essentially infantilised woman who because of her permanent sleeping has a mental age corresponding to a lived experience of only a few years the scene where she discovers ice cream is particularly cringe making and the coyly knowing look she gives him when he gloatingly says he'll have to clean her up again causes a particular shudder of horror but again i'm afraid not that shudder of horror the film makers were hoping for but a much more straightforward spasm of revulsion we can all see clearly what's on the end of our forks here it's the paedophile's perfect dream of innocence sexual compliance and utter dependence horrible horrible horrible br br what else have we got in this mish mash twisted dreamscapes not quite as good as del toro the compulsory you need to go to the police argument where the lead character always has a reason for not doing so even though it's the only sensible course of action the automaton sequence much praised in the comments here though completely and utterly pointless it serves no function as sigourney weaver memorably protested in galaxy quest and looking to me just like the abominable doctor phibes rehashed in one of the saw derivatives br br jeffrey combs does his best though so a star for that and a couple more because you have to keep lower rankings for films that are even worse than this and in general this is well shot and competently performed
<START> this movie represents the times it was made in as much as the original i suppose which is really sad because at a deeper level the title 'vanishing point' the original is so ironic i'm sure it wasn't intended that way but the original was filmed in 1970 and released in 1971 the real 'vanishing point' was the end of an era which pretty much ended in the early 1970s br br in this remake all the counter cultural elements have been stripped away and been rendered more pc in an attempt to reach a broader audience presumably sanitized for your protection br br inserting the american indian scenes was gratuitous and the idea of a 'noble purpose' to the trip was subtraction by addition i'm glad i watched it however it made me appreciate the original that much more the original is a cult classic and golden this remake is dreadful
<START> this is a great small film i say small because it doesn't have a hundred guns firing or a dozen explosions as in a john woo film great performances by roy scheider and the three bad guys john frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small productions these days the film is very easy to watch the story is more of a yarn than a washing machine instead of everything going around and around it seems as though things just get worse as the plot thickens wonderful ending very positive i never read the elmore leonard book but it can't be much different from the film because it feels like i'm watching an elmore leonard movie
<START> as a teenager i was pretty into the whole bigfoot thing i read the books and followed the reported sightings as a more jaded adult i've largely given up on the big guy now but don't mind watching the odd movie when i come across one this one had a few strong points to it mainly the recreations of two of the more famous bigfoot encounters the ape canyon incident of 1924 and the bauman incident of c 1850 as related to and by teddy roosevelt both of which i'm somewhat familiar with from that youthful reading i did the movie takes for granted that both incidents involved a sasquatch whereas both incidents have more plausible explanations but the recreations were well done there's also homage paid at the beginning of the movie to the famous patterson video again taking for granted its authenticity the sasquatch encounter at the end of the movie was also very well done and had a very creepy feel to it as the sasquatch were portrayed mainly in the shadows or as hairy feet running past the terrified men unfortunately in total those four things might have composed about 20 minutes whereas the movie as a whole is slightly over an hour and a half br br it's the fictional story done in a documentary style of an expedition to a remote area of northern british columbia to the suspected home range of the sasquatch a computer had targeted this area based on sightings and in one of the more amusing scenes in the movie the computer also used eyewitness sightings to draw a picture of a sasquatch that looked exactly like the creature of the patterson video aside from those 20 minutes i mentioned we basically watch this expedition travel which means we get to watch a bunch of guys go on a long camping trip i've been on camping trips with the guys let me tell you they've never been worthy of a movie interspersed among the long stretches of boredom are some nice wildlife shots although one suspects that canned footage was used or perhaps even captive animals performing as wild animals and there are some spectacular scenery shots except that the scenery isn't of northern british columbia it's from national parks in oregon br br i did appreciate that we were never given a real picture of the sasquatch so we didn't have to deal with the bad makeup that would have been part of this 3 10

<START> making the film as dark and visually fuzzy as possible in order to cover up the budget deficiencies is an often used strategy in low budget horror films but this one takes it too far it is so poorly lit and murky and it takes place almost entirely at night to boot that you often end up virtually looking at a black screen although perhaps the bad video transfer may also have had something to do with that alas murky is also the best word to describe the movie's plot the filmmakers throw in diverse and unoriginal horror ideas without any semblance of logic and halfway through you get the feeling that they just about abandoned the effort to make a good horror film you know it when you see characters who are supposed to be in mortal danger or in some occasions even dead making small talk 1 2
<START> this delighted audiences at a number of film festivals and it is not hard to see why director yang zhang with the help of some very nice work by the three principle actors xu zhu as the father master liu quanxin pu as the elder son da ming and especially wu jiang as the irrepressible and lovable younger son er ming spins a tale that will warm the coldest heart br br the film starts with a man taking a shower in an automated booth in the middle of beijing he puts some money in a slot opens the door takes off his clothes and puts some of them on a conveyor belt to be cleaned steps into the shower and gets cleaned with brushes and squirts of water and soap as though he's a car at the car wash this is the future symbolically speaking and the old bathhouse we will see in the next scene is the past agrarian china is giving way to industrial china br br pollution cultural revolution hang over industrialization blues no way what we have here is a celebration of people and their kindness and love for one another a celebration of goodness in the hearts of men yet i wonder how the chinese government views this film on the one hand it clearly presents a pleasant view of china and its people it is stringently nonpolitical without criticism of the present regime expressed or implied yet there is the slightest sense that the good old ways are going to be replaced by something that may not be as good i think yang zhang had the wisdom to just let that be as it may tell a story about old men at the bathhouse where they get back rubs and massages where they tell tall tales and reminisce about the good old days where they can relax and play chinese chess and stage cricket fights where the master is a spry and wise old guy and his assistant is his son who may be retarded or autistic but who does his job with glee and an infectious spirit of fun and good will br br enter back on the scene the older son da ming who is polished well groomed and taciturn he is uncomfortable with what he sees as the unsophisticated behavior of his father and brother he represents modern china with his tie and his briefcase his cell phone and his education he has only returned because he thought his father was dying when he sees that this is not true he packs his bags and is set to return to his wife and his career but then a crisis ensues and it is during this crisis that da ming sees the value of the natural people centered life that his father and his brother have been living br br and so yang zhang reconciles the old and the new and does so in such a charming manner that i will not object especially since his style is so neat and so carefully expressed one of the nice things he does that i miss in most movies is the way he dovetails the subplots within the larger story so that they are resolved before the picture ends the bathhouse regular who sings o sole mio in the bathhouse as the water showers down upon him much to the delight of er ming finds that he can't sing in public because of stage fright near the end of the film he loses his stage fright and sings thanks to some inspired help from er ming and the bathhouse regular who is losing his wife because well he tells a tale to master liu before he confesses the real reason but liu understands and again before the movie is over husband and wife are reconciled br br this kind of happy ending movie making is unusual in today artistic and international films or in almost any film directed at adults some happy endings are so contrived as to embarrass not only their contrivers but their audiences and some are so blatantly condescending that the audience is offended here however the audience is delighted br br see this especially for the comedic performance by wu jiang whose warm effervescence overcomes any handicap his character may have
