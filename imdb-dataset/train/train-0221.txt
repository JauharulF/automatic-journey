<START> i rented this movie from the library it's hard to find for good reason purely out of curiosity i'm a huge plath fan and this movie was a complete disappointment the bell jar 1979 is by far one of the worst movies i've ever seen the script is horrible not because it strays from the original novel text but because it strays without focus or intent the scenes are ill constructed and don't lead the viewer anywhere what's with the hokey voice over of plath's poetry lady lazarus has little do with greenwood's situation plath's poetry was completely misused marilyn hassett is completely unbelievable as esther greenwood or any 20 year old for that matter partly due to casting she was 32 during filming the age plath was when she died and partly due to the fact that she can't act hassett is all emotion no craft no skill the direction is mediocre the director simply covers what's there which isn't much the only reason i'm giving the film a 1 is because 0 isn't an option sorry sylvia you'll have to wait for someone else to adapt your fine work into something more fitting
<START> i love this movie it's wacky funny violent surreal played out in a madman's head and definitely not your usual comedy br br if you don't find the film amusing then i guess it's just not for your tastes so this is a tough one to write a review for br br for reference some other comedies i love are the big lebowski the princess bride and zoolander that one only got me the second time around there are others but my taste is definitely for the unusual and i am willing to accept that most people just don't tend to like that kind of thing i make no apologies for having an unusual sense of humour at least i have one br br the scenes and characters of this particular movie are well put together the verbal humour is hilarious the situations are intriguing the acting is very good as you would expect of the cast though the acting demands made of the cast by the script are not particularly high the overall package makes for fun funny watchable yet violent entertainment
<START> inspired at least a little by ivy benson her all girls orchestra who performed throughout the war years at the covent garden opera house this film chronicles the attempts by an elderly saxophone player to reform the almost all girl band with whom she played as a schoolgirl towards the end of wwii all too brief flashbacks to the original band on stage bring us some wonderful music and help to fill in the background to the band members and in particular to the girls' relationships with the lone male member their transvestite drummer who is trying to dodge the call up br br ian holm lord of the rings cromwell and fairfax and judi dench turn in superb leading performances as the recently widowed elizabeth and the conniving womanizing patrick the drummer the late joan sims is perfect as the band's leader now playing bar piano at the sea side and june whitfield glows as the salvation army trombone player cameo appearances by other greats like cleo laine leslie caron olympia dukakis and billie whitelaw make this an unforgettable experience the movie is a romp down memory lane with an all star cast of what ought by all rights to be a bunch of over the hill actresses all i can say is i hope i look as good at their age leslie caron in particular is still an incredible fox at 69 years of age she certainly still gets my pulse going as i watched it i was mentally berating the casting director for not using women of the appropriate age afterwards i looked these girls up and discovered that every one of them is old enough to have been performing in the london of 1944 although this might be a bit of a stretch for judi dench br br if you like swing bands thrive on nostalgia or just want to see how good a woman can manage look with almost three quarters of a century behind her don't miss this film br br
<START> as i mentioned previously john carpenter's 1978 classic is one of the first two movies i can remember seeing and being heavily influenced by the other being the classic conan the barbarian it so truly scared me that the only monster under my bed was michael meyers whom i eventually befriended imaginary friend to keep him from killing me in my sleep now that is terror for a 10 year old br br it is a horror classic and i am sure my modest review will not do it the justice it deserves the most surprising thing of all is that the movie still works perhaps not in the guttural reaction but more of a cognitive possibility or immediate subconscious this all could happen it isn't in the realm of impossibility or located in a foreign country as most modern horror is i e hostel touristas cry wolf saw etc at times it is graphic while the rest is relegated to our imaginations i believe it is this element that keeps people terrified or at the very least wary of going outside at night with the signature soundtrack still vivid in their head it still works because we can substitute implied or tertiary killing with anything more terrifying that our mind can create so we ourselves are contributing to our own fears and anxiety br br carpenter weaves a simple story about an everyday middle class suburban and relatively benign child who snaps on halloween and kills his sister he then spends the next 15 years in an institution which we thankfully do not experience only to escape and return to his hometown the infamous haddonfield on his way he kills and kills the child's name is michael meyers though he is not a person john carpenter uses michael meyers as a metaphor against the implied safety of middle class suburbia in the bastion of american safety and security chaos can still strike br br michael ceased to be a person once he killed he is not a serial killer human being or psychopath he is as unstoppable force the generic overalls bleached white shatner mask and lack of any dialog other then some breathing helps to dehumanize and complete michael's generification this is the source of all his power he is faceless speechless and unremarkable in any way other than as a source of unrelenting chaos this is helped by the cinematography post card effect a lack of information motivation explanation and the veteran narrative experience of donald pleasence dr loomis his over the top performance and uneasiness sells the shape this is also the first film performance by jamie lee curtis as laurie strode the innocent girl who deters chaos in the face of overwhelming odds at least for a little bit br br though this isn't the first movie of this new niche of horror films black christmas came out 4 years earlier it is the most successful and does not diminish upon reviewing if you haven't been scared by horror movies in a long time like me this will probably make the hairs on the back of your head tingle at the first chords of the signature soundtrack i highly recommend this movie as a must see horror movie and as one of the pinnacles of john carpenter's career
<START> this was without a doubt the worst thing i have ever spent money on i feel dirty for admitting that i rented this 'movie' and actually paid money to see it this does not even rate trash no no this is the juice that collects at the bottom of industrial dumpsters located in particularly foul neighborhoods after an extraordinarily humid summer to call it trash would be to degrade trash everywhere it was so bad i felt i had to register at imdb and warn my fellow man this luvahire character claims this movie is great one has to question his grasp on reality let's take some of his comments and analyze them br br the actor who played ricky i forgot his name did a very good job br br i see well if the director envisioned his audience cringing and wincing at every sentence uttered by ricky or alternately bursting into uncontrollable laughter at moments when most directors would want a more somber reaction from their viewers then yes ricky did an outstanding job br br i'm an aspiring actor myself taking theater at my school and i had to do a play where i had to cry and it's not easy to be emotional in a scene so i give props to actors who have to do an emotional scene and can pull it off br br wow i too must give props to actors who can pull off emotional scenes luvahire you may want to look into another line of work there buddy if you think these chuckleheads pulled it off still they can help you if you need to practice crying just watch the movie ha ha ha br br bring on the sequel br br if i was your theater teacher at school i'd fail you based solely on this comment alone br br i am too disgusted to continue i shall now turn over the movie bashing to my associate mr bangla br br howdy if you've continued to read this far i take it for granted that you've already seen the movie and you're now looking for one of two things in this comment 1 additional vitriolic debasement of what you agree was an exceptionally poor movie 2 additional vitriolic debasement of what you feel was a good cinematic effort which needs defending against such libelous scum as myself whether you want help articulating your disgust or ammunition for a stirring repartee if i say anything good it'll only disappoint you so let me assure you there is little chance of such disappointment br br the other negative comments here at imdb have already enumerated the particular failings of the movie e g the acting the soundtrack the directing the dialogue the editing etc however all of these faults can readily be forgiven in and of themselves few people will rent a movie titled hood of the living dead if they require these elements to be top notch the ultimate failure of hood however is its failure to deliver on the abundant promise of its name hood of the living dead practically leaps off the shelf at the video store with its implications of corny one liners and gruesomely creative kills here was a chance to mix the cheesy gore of the zombie movie with the realism of life in the ghetto to have gangsta thug zombies bombin' on the innocent living while rockin' do rags to have undead pimps drivin' over all too mortal po lice in their tricked out rides the mixture of the two genres could have been hilarious instead the movie is more like watching middle school kids timidly deliver the lines to a play they are performing but don't understand to avoid a feeling of betrayal on the part of their video rental audience i suggest that the quiroz brothers re release the movie with the following new title hood of the living dead a home made horror video we shot on our camcorder with some friends over a weekend last summer because we were bored or perhaps they could release it as a documentary the day creativity died an exploration of how a low budget movie can still be perfectly devoid of clever or original thought despite lacking ties to a major motion picture studio br br the potential renter whose interest has not been quelled should find the following blurb on the back of the video case the quiroz brothers have proved once again that watching things which you can easily do yourself is not very interesting mr bangla
<START> the domino principle is without question one of the worst thrillers ever made hardly any sense can be made of the convoluted plot and by the halfway point you'll want to throw your arms up in frustration and scream i give up br br how gene hackman and director stanley kramer ever got involved in this mess must only be summed up by their paychecks br br i hope they spent their money well
<START> tom the cat jerry the mouse and spike the dog here called butch his third name his second being 'killer' decide to sign a peace treaty to all love each other it's weird and a bit unnatural seeing them all buddy buddy like this and their friend's seem to think so too but by the end thanks to a disagreement over a steak everything is back to normal and all is how it should be this short is the second one of three on the new spotlight dvd to be edited and i have no clue why this one was this cartoon can be found on disc one of the spotlight collection dvd of tom jerry br br my grade b
<START> a lonely depressed french boy mathieu jeremie elkaim on vacation in the summer meets and falls in love with cedric the gorgeous stephane rideau quiet and slow this is a very frustrating movie on one hand i was absorbed by it and really felt for the two boys on the other i was getting annoyed the film constantly keeps flashing around from the past to the present with no rhyme or reason it's very confusing and pointless br br spoilers ahead br br also there are tons of plot holes mathieu at one point does something that ends him up in the hospital what is it we're never told then he breaks up with cedric and tells everybody else he's living with him why we're not told then he hooks up inexplicably with another guy at the end why no explanation it's clear cedric loves mathieu and mathieu is living in the same town so however it is a tribute to the film that you really care about the characters so much if only things were explained br br elkaim as mathieu is not good he's tall handsome and has a nice body but he can't act his idea of acting is sitting around with a blank look on his face all the time rideau on the other hand is great he's very handsome has a very nice body and is one hell of an actor also he has an incredible sexual magnetism about him there is full frontal male nudity lots of kissing and a fairly explicit sex scene in the movie which is great most movies shy away from showing male male love scenes this one doesn't and it helps to see how the characters care and feel for each other br br so a frustrating film but somewhat worth seeing especially for rideau's nude scenes that is if you like good looking nude young men br br
<START> if jean renoir's first film whirlpool of fate first takes us into the world of the countryside the rivers the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards put the characters from the first two films together and you have the seeds of his great grand illusion and rules of the game this is beautifully filmed with the restless camera making full use of the amazingly huge apartments and backstage areas that dominate the film's interiors and the acting though frequently overwrought offers some great moments as well particularly from werner krauss' muffat but the glamorous and sultry ms hessling who at first appears as if she might give louise brooks a run for her money in vampishness never goes beyond a one note selfish harlot portrayal perhaps this is in part a problem with the script which does seem to mostly go for high points and outraged emotions not having read the novel i'm not really clear on whether the choices were well made or not br br still the differences between nana's suitors are well drawn and i particularly liked the relationship between muffat and jean angelo's vandeuvres the tragic understandings that each seems to have of his ultimate fate and their sympathy with each other particularly in the scene at the bottom of the enormous staircase where vandeuvres warns muffat and we wonder if violence will erupt this and other gleanings of the ridiculousness of the idle rich help give the film the depth it has br br far from his greatest achievement and for me probably just shy overall of whirlpool of fate this is still well worth seeing for renoir fans or those interested in silent cinema generally
<START> the last station director michael hoffman's melodrama about the last months in the life of leo tolstoy begins with fog and sleep tolstoy christopher plummer lives with his family in a compound at yasnaya polyana taking walks and writing and being seen to by his wife and the adherents to his movement people dedicated to his ideas of pacifism vegetarianism sexual abstinence and communal property who have gathered in a forest camp not far away his wife sophia helen mirren wars openly with the head of his movement chertkov paul giamatti who she claims in his efforts to convince tolstoy to sign the rights to his works over to the russian people is trying to steal the wealth that is owed to her upon her husbands imminent death observing all of this is tolstoy's new steward bulgakov james mcavoy a naive adherent who is torn between his love of the man and concern for his wife br br hoffman's script which is based on the novel by jay parini quite often veers itself into confused territory building up a complex tangle of threads and opaque motivations that ultimately don't resolve themselves in any satisfying way the scope of the film is grand and its story should reverberate just as tolstoy whose beliefs foreshadowed in some ways both the bolsheviks' and those of pacifists like ghandi it unfortunately doesn't it's un unpickable building up with much gusto confrontations that are constantly ravelling off into nothingness the three way relationship between the church the faithful sophia and the unbelieving tolstoy for example is referenced often in the last section of the film a mute priest in a magnificent hat even shows up but the script never expands on this beyond awkwardly inserting it into the story as an attempt at enriching it or providing some semblance of historical accuracy there are a ton of details in the film but not enough attention is paid to most of them and as a result the film feels cluttered overburdened energetic but unfortunately pointless br br at its heart is the love story between sophia and tolstoy and that story as baffling and cramped as it is is the reason to watch the film mirren and plummer are unsurprisingly the best things in the film plummer's tolstoy is vague at once confused and resolute apprehensive and full of joy and certainty mirren's sophia is in full panic in a righteous lather forced to watch and expected to be mute as her husband gives away his time his possessions and his money to people who are unquestionably devoted to him but also clearly in possession of their own agendas they're great performances all the more so given the vast gulf between the real importance of the couple's place in history and the script's ability to support that both sophia and tolstoy seem willed into the film by mirren and plummer alone both making the best they can out of what meagre material is there giammati and mcavoy both talented actors are unable to do the same and giamatti's chertkov seems neither a revolutionary nor a thief and not both at once either but rather a cipher a stand in for a whole package of unresolved anxieties and aborted historical impulses the scope of this thing never boils down to anything it hitches along getting by on the strength of plummer and mirren and not much else it's interesting and pretty but ultimately unrewarding 4 5 10
<START> this movie works because it feels so genuine the story is simple and realistic perfectly capturing the joys and anxieties of adolescent love and sexuality that most all of us experienced during our teen years br br the actors are as natural as figures in a documentary but are as convincing and as charismatic as seasoned performers the dialogue is fresh and honest and thankfully not filled to the brim with cutesy pop culture references also the cinematography is at once gritty and beautiful bringing the lower east side setting to life in a very tangible way br br on an artistic level i love this movie because it reminds me of great italian neo realism films like the bicycle thief and la strada movies rarely feel as real as this does or as bicycle thief did and the only other movie i've seen that treats teen sexuality with the same level of seriousness is elia kazan's splendor in the grass writer director peter sollett deserves tremendous praise this film is quite an achievement br br on a personal level i am always glad to see a movie that treats members of ethnic america with love and respect as an italian american i hate the way my own people come off in the cinema as racist womanizing criminal geniuses in irritatingly popular epics and my aggravation on this count makes me acutely sensitive to other groups and their awful silver screen representations hispanics and asians in particular seem cursed to playing villains in westerns and action movies good thing gong li didn't try to become famous in america br br of course thanks largely to the rise of indie pictures and the influence of miramax we are seeing a few more pictures about ethnic characters here and there but raising victor vargas is easily one of the best while i do really like my big fat greek wedding it is a refreshing change that raising victor vargas is played straight with less exaggerated and broadly drawn characters while still being very funny in its own right finally latino characters worthy of note i have a feeling that this is a film that will be remembered br br of course now that he has made this wonderful picture about a family from the dominican republic i hope peter sollett gets around to making a movie about italians soon marc dipaolo
<START> this is waaaaay to much so frustrating to watch i was waiting for the whole damn movie to end and to finally get some answers and what i've had in the end was nothing but a huuuge neon sign question mark above my head i haven't seen such a bad acting and such a nonsense movie in a long long time and what's bothering me is how come someone an actor read the script of such a bull movie and say ok i'm in let's film this this is horrible this movie suuuuuuuuuuuucks i just can't believe i've spent an hour and a half of my life on something like this
<START> what is interesting is that the acting was not bad just not enough it was rather lame special effects nor the lines were the single culprit for this failure standing alone they weren't horribly bad but put together was a tragic move the show seemed long winded and slow with special effects apparently designed to speed the movie along but it failed totally br br much of the blame for this disaster was put on special effects don't believe it they were kinda cool appleby was not the best choice for this endeavor though she may have been all they had to chose from with a bit of fan recogniton an experienced actress would have brought something to the part like appleby never did scfi puts out some really good original movies it's just too bad that this failed so drastically
<START> first of all when people hear 'guy ritchie' they immediately think of snatch yes snatch was a good movie but the problem is that everyone associates guy ritchie to snatch they don't expect him to explore new frontiers this movie revolver is different than snatch it's much darker and is very complex the reason i gave a rating of 10 is because i've had to watch revolver 3 times to understand everything so this movie toys with your head it's very cleverly written br br this movie is different than snatch it was done wonderfully the cinematography is beautiful and you can recognize guy ritchie's personal touch style of directing in it br br what won me over was the complexity of the protagonist and how we are left with more questions than answers
<START> this movie set out to be better than the average action movie and in that regard they succeeded this movie had spectacular cinematography featuring spectacular mountain snow and heights a very fit stallone putting in a good performance as well an exciting plot and a great performance from it's main villain becouse he will really shock you with his evil ways the movie does not rank an all time great becouse of the weak screen play the plot and story cries for this movie to make stallone an extra special human much like the rambo or rocky or bond movie characters they chose to humanise stallone's character in this one which is ok but considering the plot's style weakens the excitement factor also the dialogue was cheesy and carelessly condescending at times the script should have been more realistic and less talky another weak point was the unrealistic shooting scenes the movie makers should have been more carefull how they hadled the shooting hits and misses they should have continued the quality of the scenes of the shooting sequences during the plane hijacking early in the movie instead they decided to water down a lot of the shooting sequences ala a team tv series as soon as the villains set foot on the mountain tops this movie had a lot of all time great potential crisper action sequences better dialogue and more rambo rocky style emotion determination from stallone would have taken this movie to a higher level i know this was not stallone's fault i sense the movie's director wanted to tone down stallone's character and try to steal the movie by taking credit for his direction which was not all that great if not for his cinematographer sill a good movie though
<START> 'dead letter office' is a low budget film about a couple of employees of the australian postal service struggling to rebuild their damaged lives unfortunately the acting is poor and the links between the characters' past misfortunes and present mindsets are clumsily and over schematically represented what's most disappointing of all however is the portrayal is life in the office of the film's title there's no mechanisation whatsoever and it's quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do for a living granted part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s if it ever truly existed it's a shame as the film's overall tone is poignant and wry and there's some promise in the scenario but few of the details convince overall it feels the work of someone who hasn't actually experienced much of real life a student film with a concept and an outline but sadly little else
<START> seldom do we see such short comments written by imdb filmgoers perhaps it's because this lightweight dark comedy entertains and pleases without depth or are we missing something i'd watch it again if i had some incentive br br so what's a happenstance to the french it is le battement d'ailes du papillon serendipity fate perhaps it's an event that is the culmination of a series of random happenings we've all had these it's called life but when looked at in this way you begin to get the feeling that random might be more like fated br br a 'happenstance' in this film might be an occurrence as minor as knocking a few leaves of lettuce off the back of a truck or as major as basing a major life decision on the accuracy of a stranger tossing of a pebble all these incidents cause other events that well you get the picture dominoes multiply those by 30 characters and an average of 6 each and you have to really stretch your imagination to accept the remote chance that this scenario could happen and i think that there's a diagnosis for those who believe that life is like this but then this is the magic world of cinema br br we admit that it is fun to watch the way the writer director weaves together these unrelated events into a story which enmeshes the lives of these french citizens if you have a couple of hours and are looking for a whimsical escape here's the place to do it or if you're recovering from surgery and aren't going anywhere anyway this will engage you while your stitches are healing br br happenstance will not go down as an award winner but it should develop a cult following stranger things have happened br br soren kierkegaard is attributed with the following life can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forward if you looked at the detail in many of your own life experiences meeting your first love finding the perfect gift your last auto accident you would find a series of seemingly random events leading up to it br br that's the answer i forgot to bring along an existentialist to explain happenstance to me
<START> i'm sure that operations dames was a favorite at the drive ins back in the day there's absolutely nothing in the way of a plot that you might miss if you were otherwise preoccupied and if you needed to get in the mood for other activities you did have some curvaceous cuties on screen to get you in the mood br br otherwise there ain't a whole lot that operations dames has going for it it's set in the korean war where a platoon of gis together with a british tommy gets a little too far forward and has to get back to the un lines bad enough already but these guys also come across a stranded bunch of uso girls and their choreographer in the same predicament br br you know what's sad about this film is that it took women generations to finally get accepted in the army and in combat situations these bimbos from the uso set women's liberation back light years in fact not even the hard bitten professional soldier who is the sergeant in charge of these men can keep it in his pants br br but that was probably the better to remind some what they were at the drive in for this no name cast is better off with me not recognizing any of them for any individual effort br br operations dames is definitely a team flop
<START> this is the page for house of exorcism but most people have confused this film with the mario bava masterpiece lisa the devil which explains the ridiculously high rating for this house of exorcism when lisa the devil was shown at film festivals in the early 70's it was a critical success audiences responded well to that gorgeous gothic horror film unfortunately it was a bit ahead of it's time and was considered too unusual and not commercial enough for mass consumption no distributor would buy it so producer alfredo leone decided to edit 'lisa' seemingly with a chainsaw by removing just about half of the original film and adding new scenes which he filmed two years after the original product it is important to note that bava had little to do with these new hideous additions so technically house of exorcism is not a bava film the original product is a slow dreamy classy production a few minutes into the film the viewer is jarred out of this dream world as suddenly we see lisa two years older and with a very different haircut begin to writhe on the ground making guttural sounds and croaking epitaphs like suck my co k etc subtle huh and the film continues like this jumping back and forth between a beautiful visual film and a grade z exorcist rip off leone was trying to incorporate these shock scenes while keeping some semblance of a story intact he failed miserably when the choice was made to basically destroy lisa and the devil bava himself refused saying that his film was too beautiful to cut he was right and it must have been quite sad for this artist to see all his work destroyed and flushed down the toilet it was many years before the original lisa and the devil was seen again re surfacing on late night television i had seen lisa long before i saw this new version and it was downright disturbing to witness one of my favorite films vandalised in this way worth seeing only for curiosity sake otherwise avoid this insidious disaster like the plague
<START> this movie is a very poor attempt to make money using a classical theme i used to love superman movies but this one made me want to shoot myself very poor acting outrageous special effects and a plot equal to zero to summarize superman leaves earth because scientists discovered pieces of his home planet some were in space duh doesn't tell his girlfriend anything before leaving duh again takes off in a spaceship comes back i think 5 years later and look forward to hooking up with his girlfriend again who is now razing his son which son in my humble opinion is at least 7 years old and what about that lex luthor trying to grow a new continent in order to sell land please br br i vote 1 out of 10 for this movie only because i am not allowed to vote 0 if you have anything else to do with your time don't go to see this movie and even if you don't have anything else to do stay home and watch tv
