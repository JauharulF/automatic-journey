<START> i suppose if you like pure action you'll find it here i suppose if you find a gorgeous blonde designed to be screwed find it here i suppose if you want to find a couple of extra baddies headed by 1 2 extra extra baddy bosses who meat a nasty end you'll find it here br br overall routine stuff and the good guys come out on top big time under extra ordinary circumstances br br what i marvel most at how the good guys armed only with pistols can kill dozens of bad guys with machine guns who are shooting at them at point blank range and missing the goodies even get time to reload their pistols amid the hail of machine guns bullets br br ho hum
<START> i've seen tons of science fiction from the 70s some horrendously bad and others thought provoking and truly frightening soylent green fits into the latter category yes at times it's a little campy and yes the furniture is good for a giggle or two but some of the film seems awfully prescient here we have a film 9 years before blade runner that dares to imagine the future as somthing dark scary and nihilistic both charlton heston and edward g robinson fare far better in this than the ten commandments and robinson's assisted suicide scene is creepily prescient of kevorkian and his ilk some of the attitudes are dated can you imagine a filmmaker getting away with the women as furniture concept in our oh so politically correct 90s but it's rare to find a film from the me decade that actually can make you think this is one i'd love to see on the big screen because even in a widescreen presentation i don't think the overall scope of this film would receive its due check it out
<START> i saw this in the theater during it's initial release and it was disturbing then as i'm sure it would still be it was the first part of '68 and this was still making the rounds in towns across america and there had recently been a mass murder in my hometown where i saw this where a man went on a shooting rampage the freshness of that close to home event combined with this dramatized true story made for a very disturbing theatrical experience it really brought to life the excellent acting of robert blake and scott wilson i was familiar with the novel based on the true event by truman capote and the screenplay and direction by richard brooks wove the event and truman's interpretation into compelling gritty cinematic adaptation music from quincy jones effectively scores it's story i've only seen this a couple times since it was too real almost like being a witness to the crime itself and riding along with the killers i would give this a 9 0 of a possible 10 society is so desensitized to violence and crime today that this probably seems slow and tame and could be viewed with less effect but to anyone over 50 this will be a hallmark into the examination of the criminal psyche
<START> this is a very entertaining film which follows the rehearsal process of a ny production of macbeth although it has a lot to say about power jealousy and ambition the themes of macbeth in our modern world the film works best when it is not taking itself too seriously recognizable actors such as john glover gloria reubens and david lansbury do nice jobs in the main roles but the highlight for me was the hilarious scene where the murder of banquo john elsen is rehearsed probably a more entertaining film for those involved in theatre but anyone who enjoys shakespeare should enjoy this film
<START> this is a typical late universal horror flick its technically comptent if by the numbers with a cookie cutter plot and some serious overacting the most interesting part of this film is its stunt casting of rondo hatton a man with a bone disease as the film's monster its sad to see this man exploited but he probably made good use of the money they paid him hatton is less horrifying than the studio hoped as i more often felt pity over fear or even loathing martin koslack is on board as the film's mad artist and he is very amusing in this part i for one enjoy seeing koslack in just about anything for some reason the man amuses me the only other part of the film that entertained me is the film's absurd take on the art world here we are shown evil art critics who revel in their ability to break artists this is side by side with the film's male hero who is an artist who paints get this pin up girls somehow our hero's work is reviewed side by side with the villan's absurdist sculpture also amusing is the film's chief nasty critic who at one point claims that he despises the hero's pin up art because women like that don't exist to which our heroine replies with an assurance that the critic just doesn't get out enough finally there's a bit of a subplot about the heroine's who is an art critic herself domestication by the leading man completely anti feminist and ridiculous to witness overall this film is a rather mediocre picture with a few amusing elements
<START> barbara stanwyck gives this early douglas sirk directed universal produced soap just the kick that it needs not nearly as memorable as sirk's later melodramas it's easy to see by watching all i desire where sirk would be heading artistically in the next few years stanwyck is a showgirl who returns to her family in smalltown u s a after deserting them a decade earlier her family and community have mixed emotions in dealing with her shocking return some of the cinematography is amazing and stanwyck is tough as nails and really gives this film a shot of energy overall a fairly good show
<START> zu the warriors from magic mountain was and is an impressive classic you never would have guessed it was made in 1983 tsui hark's use of special effects was very creative and inventive he continued doing this in the chinese ghost story trilogy and later productions even now it can measure up to other movies in this genre legend of zu is connected to zu warriors from magic mountain it is not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the plot of this one the plot is a bit hard to follow but to be honest it doesn't matter it is all about the action and adventure i always was wondering what tsui hark would do if he got his hands on cgi now we know he made this movie maybe it sometimes is too much but the overall result is so beautiful that i am not going to be critical about that there is so much happening on the screen you simply won't believe i think it is a big shame that this movie wasn't shown in theaters here in holland because this movie is screaming for screen time in cinemas this movie easily can beat big budget hollywood productions like superman returns or xmen 3 the only thing i do have to mention is the lack of humor in most of tsui harks's movies he combines drama fantasy martial arts and humor somehow it is missing in this movie again i am not going to be picky about these small matters legend of zu delivers on the action front with the most beautiful special effects you will see a true classic
<START> oh just what i needed another movie about 19th century england which is pretty much like regular england only nobody's vandalising football stadiums in this picturesque setting of lords dames and other randomly chosen titles charlotte gainsbourg walks around aimlessly as jane eyre from that novel nobody has ever read willingly jane usually hangs out in mr rochester's crib where she tries to teach a french girl to look at an empty chalkboard all the time one day mr rochester william hurt on auto pilot comes back to fall in love with jane and all that but there's still the matter of his fruitcake wife that is locked in the attic oops that wasn't in the brochure after some people being thrown around and some carefully spread fire they probably rented the set the movie finally comes to an end everything looked really authentic that's something i guess but then again nah
<START> the japanese have always had incredible ambitions in their fantasy movies they have always been ready to destroy cities by huge plastic monsters coming from outer space and elsewhere the problem is they have never had the money to succeed in making convincing special effects this film released in france under the title les envahisseurs de l'espace is no exception its ambition is to show three creatures from the giant octopus to the giant lobster trying to have the upper hand on the humans it's extremely awkward and laughable but well quite enjoyable too after all we do like these creatures and these films after all don't we
<START> i got myself a copy of this film thinking it was the 1964 film with 'zombie bloodbath' as one of it's alternative titles perversely this film actually has a better rating on this site than the aforementioned title which may mean that the other one is really bad this film is pretty bad too obviously you cant go into a film that calls itself 'zombie bloodbath' and expect to see a masterpiece and in fairness it does live up to the title with the amount of gore on display but it all feels very old and tired which isn't helped by the atrocious acting and stupid plot line it's just your average nuclear spill causing people to turn into zombies etc etc the film kicks off with a sequence that sees people melting and that pretty much lets you know what you're in for low quality zombie garbage there's plenty of gore in the film and it's a real good job otherwise the film would have been really boring zombie bloodbath looks really cheap too and was clearly put together by inexperienced filmmakers the main influence seemed to be romero's superior day of the dead although it could really be just about anything that features zombies and gore it all boils down to a typically predictable and pointless ending and overall i can't say i was impressed with it
<START> gods i haven't watched a movie this awful in a long while maybe not since 'the new guy' or various freddie prinze jr movies yes it is that astoundingly awful mira sorvino's blank and wooden acting surely must've been inspired by freddie the movie staging was awkward like a play rather and that feeling of confinement does not work well on film the actors had no idea what they were doing especially sorvino her accent was awful and her sex appeal non existent here so it was painful to see her 'seducing' other characters and they 'falling' for it and what was with the occaisional shots of a live audience in lawn chairs nonsensical i had to turn the dvd player off it would have been self inflicted pain to finish this film
<START> a woman asks for advice on the road to reach a mysterious town and hears two ghoulish stories from the local weirdo both zombie related but perhaps fate has something nasty in store for her too br br the zombie chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films i have ever seen in fact i must confess so bad was it i fast forwarded through most of the garbage and there was a lot of that believe me it runs for just 69 minutes and there is still tons of filler you get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups plenty of dull kissy kissy scenes between goofy teens that rhymed tee hee and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors br br as for the title characters they barely even have a footnote in the film why you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature though considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are amongst other 'delights' maybe that's a blessing in disguise br br and to top it all off it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on youtube jerky camera work scratches on the print flickering lights i had to rub my eyes when i realised it was made in 2001 and not 1971 even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date br br if you think i'm not qualified to do a review of chronicles having not seen the whole film then go ahead you try sitting through it i betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving it is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your dvd player with this gigglesome excuse for horror in fact don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning leaving you doomed to watch vhs tapes for the rest of your life you have been warned 0 10 br br p s what kind of 18 rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene see the movie can't even get that part right
<START> i buy or at least watch every seagall movie he came out with a handful of good movies then descending into poor stories bad camera work and a walk thru persona he nearly lost me a few movies ago he remembered how to make a decent movie now he's forgotten again this film is seriously dark on any level you care to name there is a lot of slash gash going on here with no discernible purpose unless it's meant as a warning against the military br br seagall may have had a stand in for many of his scenes as it was often too dark to tell and someone else's voice was used most of the time sadly the only interesting character was the bad guy who killed his guard to escape custody then proceeded to raise havoc all over the place okay since when do we place an armed guard in the holding room with a prisoner anyway this bad guy was at least colorful and very focused there's lots of gore if you like that king of thing it looked to me like the bad guys tore the same gash every time i'm just glad they didn't suck the blood from their hapless victims i harken you back to my summary basically it is a horror movie disguised as an action film dec 6 2006
<START> i had heard this film was a study of a landscape photographer's art by presenting the beauty in man's deconstructing the natural landscape it certainly showed the laborious activities to find locations setup shots and capture stark images whose final destinations were art studios worldwide put together in moving pictures it is truly a horror show br br this film oozes by you supplanting the shock of ghastly images with gentle waves of a wonderful industrial soundtrack that guides you like on slow moving river each sequence stands on its own but in combination you get deeper and deeper into the feeling of overwhelming inevitability there are few words this allowing the grandeur in what is shown to preach in its own way an awful massive factory filled with human automata who live in hopelessly lifeless dormitories individuals dying early while rummaging for recyclable scraps in mountains of our e waste the birthing of gigantic ships and their destruction by hand in giant graveyards the construction of the three gorges dam the largest industrial project in human history and likely for all time the time lapse as a city dies and is simultaneously reborn into a replica of modernity that purposefully destroys all relics of the culture that was br br the most terrifying image for me was a dam engineer explaining that the most important function of the dam was flood control the shot shifts to the orchard behind the spokesperson where you witness the level of the last flood by the toxic water having eaten the bark from the trees demonstrating that nothing but the most hideous vermin could be living in the waters br br the obvious not being stated is far more powerful than your normal preachy save the earth documentaries the artist edward burtynsky explains the method wonderfully 'by not saying what you should see Â many people today sit in an uncomfortable spot where you don't necessarily want to give up what we have but we realize what we're doing is creating problems that run deep it is not a simple right or wrong it needs a whole new way of thinking' the subtlety of this descends into an either or proposition but the film images scream that the decision has very much been made in favor of the dark side br br though never stated directly in any way as the waves of what you witness wash away from your awareness and you contemplate there is only one conclusion possible Â we are doomed the progress of mankind that is inexorable from our natures leaves behind carnage that this artist finds terrifying beauty in what he is actually capturing are the tracks of we the lemmings rushing unconsciously toward our own demise unlike most films with environmental themes this one ends with no call to arms it argues basically what's the point but makes certain you place the blame properly on all of us equally
<START> this film has a weak plot weak characterization and really weak special effects that i question why i lost valuable life by watching it it has random characters who add nothing to the story and seem like excuses for the director to get his girlfriend in the film the robots are sad and the main hero 'bot is turned on by a huge knife switch if this movie weren't so bad it would be laughable but there's nothing funny about it the main antagonist is one of the only redeeming characters and he is killed it's sad when you root for the bad guy because he's the best one to cheer for when all is said and done this movie was better left on the cutting room floor or never funded at all
<START> the secret is this movie blows sorry but it just did br br spoiler br br in this bad riff on i know what you did last summer and scream beth played admirably by dorie barton joins several friends on a spring break trip the group rents a fancy house and tries to enjoy a fun vacation then the deaths begin first one then another then another of the friends is murdered leading to a sad and trite climax with predictable results br br one note dorie barton is the poor man's reese witherspoonÂshe looks like reese acts like reese and could pass for reese in a police lineup maybe that's how they cast her anyhoo decent cinematography and fair acting could not quite make up for bad dialog and terrible writing
<START> oh my god this is without a doubt the absolute cheesiest movie i have ever seen the acting is bad the story is weak the characters are weaker and the whole film just doesn't make sense couple this with mediocre directing really strange scenes such as the one where the kid reaches over the ravine and mysteriously falls in and thoroughly abysmal dialog look musta peed his pants and you get one complete failure not to mention the fact that the only thing mr atlas looks like he could defeat is a case of chocolate bars but this is part of the movie's charm sit down and watch it with a few of your friends for a good laugh br br i love this movie because it's just so bad
<START> yeah stupidity i just finish watching and i still have bad taste in my mouth too much colors too much unnecessary addons to a story too much stupid characters i presume they wanted to achieve comic relief but i only wanted to cry too much of everything shame to spoil one of divine stories from arabian nights like this childish naive both on a bad way and with lot of magic breaking mistakes i don't think this could keep a child of five for more then ten minutes princess is lovely but should be tongueless cause actress don't know how to carry a role rest of the cast is even worse our bad guy is really bad shame that the good guy is not better only light in this dark is of course david carradine who goes unfortunately deeply down under his level with this but at least keep his actor fighter skills at top i'm still sorry to see him in a thing like this but glad that i had something to watch in whole charade so thank you david only only for him i give this 2 stars to this fiasco i would give more for him but that would rise final score to entire movie the rest is so bad that i would maybe like to grade it but there is no grade lover then 1 here and i think that would be too much
<START> i can just about understand why some people might wish to stress this film's link with the eighties but i really wouldn't say it's an accurate depiction of most peoples' lives in that era even on the poorest bradford estates it is however typical of the blunt agitprop rubbish the dear old royal court theatre was churning out at that time plenty of 'right on' artistry for small small audiences but enough well connected backslapping to ensure future commissions for turgid playrights ithe simple fact is that if you want to reflect upon truer common experience you'll find millions more nodding in knowing agreement to love and live as depicted in 'gregory's girl' br br i would be tempted to call this a 'kitchen sink' drama but that would be doing a great disservice to the plumbing industry however as far as having a decent script is concerned this film is indeed all washed up for some reason it has accrued an odd following amongst guardian reading film goers i can only assume they get a visual frisson out of pretending to slum it steer clear my friends it is a poor film with a poor script that likes to think it is breaking boundaries by adding humorous insights into grim life on the estates it isn't but it is grim do the washing up instead
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen while featuring good actors the movie doesn't live up to the expectations the most dramatic thing about this movie is the music which pretty much sums up the movie compensating for a bad and confusing storyline by having known good actors loud and dramatic music it doesn't change the fact that this is a very boring movie to watch earned itself a score of 1
