<START> i for one was glad to see jim carrey in a film where being over the top wasn't the goal his character is like all of us wanting more better things to happen to us and expecting god to deliver br br morgan freeman made a great god with a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us yet ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itself br br i thought jennifer aniston's character was a little too vulnerable and understanding towards carry's basically self centered tv anchorman wanna be but that's the way it was written br br i think the previews ruined several potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was coming before it happened br br i have read a number of the reviews and it seems some people are looking a little too deep this is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problems of the world although there are a few messages we could all take to heart br br a funny film
<START> something that really does not go down right with al gore and his supporters 's theory is the whole thing about concensus br br if there were such a consensus why is it that the believers in the almighty global warming feel the irrepressible need to try and bully anyone who questions them br br why is it that anyone who does not toe the line on global warming is met with smug accusations of being either stupid or on the payroll of the oil companies apparently being a professional global warming researcher does not mean you're on anyone's payroll in that wondrous world why is there such a need to tell everyone how the whole question is settled when it is the very nature of science to honestly question assumptions for some ideas on the answer to those questions read prey by the well know oil stooge michael crichton oh wait he is rich and not on the payroll of the oil companies he just took a huge career risk in not toeing the line of the greens and other kyoto worshippers and told the truth as he researched it by the way did you know that abiding to the kyoto protocol would result in almost no lowering of temperatures according to its own backers just a few questions that al gore made sure to stay away from lest he not get every penny of the environmental lobby in case he decides to run again br br so who's a stooge
<START> the title creatures wreak havoc at a peaceful little desert town that's basically the whole plot for this film and while the scenes devoted to the munchies themselves are somewhat fun in a lowbrow kind of way all the rest is just filler and bad filler at that from the hero who is a painful woody allen wannabe to the ultra dumb town cop it's hard to pick the most irritating character in the film there were some times when almost all of them were on the screen together and i was thinking ok at least the girlfriend is cute but why do we have to put up with the rest of those morons the film is also filled with pop references from ozzy osbourne to linda blair which probably made it already dated by the early 90's 1 2
<START> this is the movie i've seen more times than any other i believe i saw it on average once every year since it was released and every time i see it it is equally fantastic and always reveals something new to me the cast was most probably a combination of the very best there ever was in ex yu cinematography this movie is an absolute must for any self respecting movie lover in the same league maratonci trce pocasni krug balkanski spijun and otac na sluzbenom putu this is a poker of movies everyone should have in his private video collection
<START> this episode of twilight zone combines a silent section 1890 with melodramatic acting and sight gags an homage to the early buster keaton films lots of slapstick buster falling on a bulkhead door falling in a puddle running around pants less silly scientist's invention of a time helmet reminiscent of a flash gordon idea of what the future would be cheap prices like 1 95 for ladies hats or 17 cents a pound for beef seem outrageously high to buster even the world of 1890 is too much for buster mulligan how shocking when he is mistakenly transported to the modern world of 1960 buster was trying to go backwards the scientist of that time wants to return to a calmer world the 1890 that he has studied and admired they go back together and buster mulligan is now happy and the scientist regrets not having electronic equipment modern beds or an electric blanket so buster sends him back with the crazy helmet br br this twilight zone doesn't have a heavy message since buster keaton died in 1966 it is one of his last efforts that's enough br br one other cute thing longtime underutilized maytag man jesse white is a repairman who fixes the time helmet foreshadowing his washing machine career
<START> this movie is really good the plot which works like puzzle forces viewer to think and guess what will happen next such a trick brings a lot of surprises and makes a viewer really looking forward to solution of a riddle fighting scenes are very good there's a lot of different combat styles although one of styles was a bit unreal for me but it's only my opinion to watch and it's fascinating show the only thing which may be irritating is actors look a bit too effeminate at least for me hong kong was always good at kung fu movies especially in the 70's and 80's so five venoms or other its versions is great choice
<START> god i love this movie if you grew up in the 80's and love heavy metal this is the movie for you they really don't get much better than this the fastway soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks ever i put on the record when it first came out and spent the next month learning every song on guitar note for note the plot outline is your standard heavy metal horror movie kid's favorite singer dies kid plays record backwards hero comes back in demonic form and rocks the town what more could you ask for br br if you haven't seen it yet rush out and buy it you will not be disappointed metal rules
<START> i've seen this movie more than once it was on par with a lot of the spooky stuff that was being shown in television movies back then the only problem i had was with the title for the obvious reasons one immediately thinks of the famous snack cake by drake's leaving off the first part 'hound of hell' would have sufficed br br richard crenna always manages to bring a sense of seriousness to anything he does anyway whether the plot is good or bad but this was an enjoyable halloween fare offered by the cbs network i loved the part where crenna takes a flight to some obscure country to find the mystic who would help him conquer the evil beast he asks the cab driver how to find this guy great dialogue between the native cab driver and crenna in terms of the cabby dissing his own people's ethnic beliefs 'aw mr barry i left that stuff behind when i came down from the mountains ' referring to the mystic who rarely sees or advises people and nobody knows how to really contact him br br as far as supernatural fare goes this movie is still enjoyable
<START> okay if you've seen the ring you've basically seen the grudge it's trying to be scary by just having freaky camera work and loud sounds but it fails miserably the plot if you can call it that is weak and rather full of holes for instance how would the care center have known that yoko didn't show up for work when the people who lived in the house were not there and it's not really clear what bill pullman's character had to do with anything he just kind of came out of nowhere to advance the plot it didn't make a lot of sense what happened to the original family who was hanging in the room the little boy or the dad and was yoko alive or dead when the care center guy found her there were too many unanswered questions and i was too bored to think about it more
<START> every time i see nicole i like her more i love a movie like this a woman you just won't give up on but she keeps breaking your heart first movie i remember seeing like this was of human bondage the kim novak laurence harvey version the beefs about the correctness of the russian spoken in this film are petty it was good enough to fool me or anybody else who can't speak russian i'm sure funny how people miss the point the no goodnik russian guys were well cast too finally i have to tip my hat to ben chaplin as somebody else noted he plays a sap with great dignity and there was definitely some heat between him and nicole to think guys get paid for that mind blowing
<START> i stumbled on this series rather by accident after half an episode i was hooked american gothic was a dark strange series with gary cole as the mysterious probably evil sheriff buck who is trying to gain control of his illegitimate son caleb played by lucas black i was impressed with gary cole's sinister sheriff and i was even more impressed with lucas black lucas black's caleb was able to stand up against sheriff buck one of the most frightening characters ever created for a tv series i have rarely seen a child actor with as much presence or talent as lucas black if you were not lucky enough to see lucas in american gothic see him in slingblade br br it was a remarkable show with many ambiguities and mysteries that were never explained during it's short run
<START> the pioneering technicolor cinematography winner of special technical achievement oscar is indeed enchanting add an endless variety of glamorous costumes and a romantic cinema dream team like marlene dietrich and charles boyer and you've got a rather pleasant picture br br unfortunately the contrived plot as well as the over blown acting leave much to be desired still there have not been any more breathtaking technicolor films before this one 1936 and very few since then that can top this breathtaking visual experience of stunning colors cinema fans who have enjoyed the glorious color cinematography in robin hood 1938 jesse james 1939 and gone with the wind 1939 will not be disappointed in the fantastic work done here the garden of allah will always be synonymous with brilliant color cinematography
<START> in iran women are officially banned from men's sporting events in june 2005 the iran's national soccer team has an important game against bahrain in the azadi stadium for the qualification of the world cup a group of iranian girls and lovers of soccer dresses like boys and unsuccessfully attempts to enter in the stadium being arrested br br soccer and flamengo's team beach and movies are my greatest passions therefore i loved this little gem about a group of girls and their passion for soccer the director jafar panahi from the white balloon the mirror and the circle shot this movie on the day that iran defeated bahrain and qualified to the world cup in germany the dramatic and funny adventure of these iranian girls is one of the most delightful movies i have ever seen my vote is nine br br title brazil not available
<START> i got to see this on the plane to nz last week and was wondering how it would measure up to both the uk film and the book i have to say i was favorable impressed if anything the fanatical attachment to the red sox during the lean years works even better than the original devotion to arsenal fc who have had success through the years as a brit i was also interested to see that you don't need to understand baseball to get what's going on one question springs to mind was the screenplay written using the sox as the team even before they finally broke the curse of the bambino or was another team in the frame as a red sox fan myself weird i know a brit who understands baseball i have to say that it added to the enjoyment
<START> i'd completely forgotten about this film until now this was the most blatant and worst attempt to demonise a hobby that i have ever seen it's message seemed to be don't teenagers use their imagination they might take games seriously go mad and hurt people i can only guess that the unimaginative writers of this piece thought that d d style games are form of evil ritual or arcane worship
<START> unfortunately the director amos guttman died from aids related illnesses the year after making this film so we don't know how many more gay related films we might have had from him i found this used dvd from cinevista on amazon but it looks like none of his other works are still available hessed mufla amazing grace contains full frontal male nudity at least in magazines which turn into a wishful dream sequence and some drug use this is the story of two families getting by or trying to but the mothers the daughters and the gay sons all have their own problems to figure out jonathan played by gal hoyberger meets up with the next door neighbor thomas who has his own problems of course either the translations are a little weak or maybe guttman kept the conversation sparse on purpose for a little mystery watching this i get the feeling we're not getting the whole story but that's ok throw in a cute gay roommate ex lover miki aki avni who went on to do many projects mostly isreali tv lots of smoking lots of worrying by the mothers a great blues song all night long blues done by an unknown female artist if she is listed in the credits sadly it was not translated to english nice to see mothers and siblings treating gay relationships with respect like any other relationship but then usa always has been years behind other countries in this way a good way to spend 98 minutes i wanted to see even more of it won awards at several film festivals acc to imdb and the film jacket
<START> i have seen most if not all of the laurel hardy classic films i have always enjoyed there comical stupidly even after watching it over and over again this new film attempts to bring back the classic with two new actors who resemble both laurel hardy however fails miserably for various reasons one of which is how out of place their cloths are still early 20th century however are both portrayed in the 90's setting some of the former dialogue was brought back however it also fails miserably to come close to the classic series this film could very well be the worst film i have ever seen and should be pulled off the shelf and locked away forever the real laurel hardy are surly spinning in their graves at such a bad imitation
<START> this movie is so so so horrible that it makes angels lose their wings shaq had tried to make other crossover efforts like his work in shaq fu for the nes and his plethora of unbearable rap albums and later the epic serving of horrible film making that is steel br br there's not a single good thing to be said about this movie i saw it a bunch of times when i was very young but i must've been an idiot then because this movie takes all that is enjoyable about films and tears it apart it's fun to mock i saw it on the disney channel a while back and spent a few minutes doing that although once the thrill of mocking it is done you still become overwhelmed by its terribleness br br if you see it on tv try this consider as your watching the film removing from it all the scenes in which shaq uses his magical genie powers if you do that it becomes like a film about a pedophile chasing a kid and rapping to seduce him that's kinda funny and disturbing br br a horrible example of film do not unless looking to mock it see this movie
<START> barry a medical transcriptionist has his mind corroding from his job coupled with memories of an abusive upbringing at the hands of his stepfather barry the original leatherface gunnar hansen he spirals into madness and eventually a serial killer good in the form of a gay man and evil in the form of a bald mute guy battle for control of his soul this film is undone by some bad acting and unintentional humorous scenes not to say it's horrible or anything just that you cal tell that it's only as known as it is on account of bruce campbell's rabid fan base of which i am one who will likely see anything he's in or involved with in some way br br my grade c br br dvd extras commentary with michael kallio and bruce campbell second commentary by kallio and sound designer joel newport 'hating every minute' a 17 minute documentary deleted and extended scenes alternate takes outtakes footage of the world premiere poster still gallery talent bios and theatrical trailer br br dvd rom screenplay in pdf format br br 2 easter eggs highlight the eyes for a laughing outtake left eye and one minute of nothing but an actual easter egg right eye
<START> after reading the reviews it became obvious that everyone intellectualized this work how utterly boring oh how about the good ol' days and there was nothing like it of all the comments no one expressed any emotion to this work or any other br br i grew up just after the end of the steam age and this cinematic gem along with dan'l boone graced the saturday afternoon matinÃ©es this was an annual movie that made the rounds and filled the seats with gabbing yapping farting giggling snot monsters like myself or was self and it was a movie theatre filler at the time almost as big as the wizard of oz br br imdb insists that every critique contains something about the plot problem is was that it was rather a template here goes randolph scott cowboy hero gathers friends and goes defeats those evil people hooray br br all of us kids figured out that plot before we plunked our quarter down to watch it that was just about the plot line of every scott john wayne roy rogers film ever made if you take the time to go back and review each and every movie just don't ask for surprises br br one must remember the context of the times there was no or little tv none for kids there was school there was the great outdoors there were toy guns no cyber time and the steam age had just collapsed but movies such as this provided the entertainment and filled the imaginations of young whippersnappers even the girls got into it br br this movie was the entertainment and it is just as mindless as anything produced today it had a purpose originally of being propaganda but quickly came to be kids movies br br our fathers had experienced the real thing and it wouldn't be until sam peckinpah a decade later who finally lavished the red splashes of imitation blood in realistic and copious quantities not until his directorship did anyone die slowly with great pain and miserably until peckinpah war and gun fights were a rather bloodless affair thanks sam br br to see a movie had little or no blood the adults didn't mind they wouldn't have tolerated it i think no guts spraying the shattering plant life so this movie had all of the glory and none of the gory gung ho was suitable for kids then br br you will see that i assigned a four to this rating why would i do that well it is a terrible movie no matter how i love it i do love this movie because it brought back one of the happier moments of my childhood but it is not all that good of a movie in quality terms basically gung ho transitted to become a romance novel for children br br should people watch it of course i am not saying to stay away realistically however the plot is simple the characters shallow they are shoals you can love a bad movie
