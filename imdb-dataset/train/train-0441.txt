<START> i live in salt lake city and i'm not a mormon so why did i rent this movie well because i live in utah and thought it'd be nice to see locations i know in a film i really knew going into it that i wasn't going to get the inside jokes so i wasn't surprised when i sat with the deer in the headlights stare what i was surprised at was the ant non mormon actions that were placed in this film br br i know it's a mormon film catered to the members of the lds church but i found it offensive because of the typical stereotype of people that isn't of their faith every non mormon which wasn't many drank smoked and had an amazing selfishness attitude why br br that really ticked me off about this film they made the mormons so pure yet the rest of the state of utah i guess is filled with punk psychos just because they don't follow the scriptures of the lds church br br i can understand having the plots revolve around all lds members but you'd think salt lake city was 100 mormon which isn't even close to being the truth and as i said the non mormons in the movie were portrayed as drunken jerks please br br i guess i just don't get it because i don't belong to their faith and i guess i never will

<START> spoilers br br well the one line summary says it all melvilleÂ´s le samurai is the original and there are elements of leon and they are better much better br br in the samurai alain delon is a lonely warrior professional killer who keeps a bird in cage and is stealing cars for his jobs with so much suspense in these scenes even the end is exactly the same the samurai seeks death in dignity and is getting shot with an empty gun in his hand the world has changed he realizes and there is no place for the samurai in it br br delon is not killing so many people like the ghost dog but i guess jarmusch liked leon very much or even desperado by rodriguez so he added this too and let me guess the girl will become a professional like ghost dog like natalie portman in leon br br so what was jarmusch thinking after all where is the unique the original thought in this movie br br i canÂ´t see the point in making carbon celluloid copies br br a 4 10 rating by macaulay connor
<START> warning possible spoiler br br if you can get by the extremely unpleasant subject matter this film does offer a heaping helping of outrageously campy melodrama surprisingly enough this movie has been copied and ripped off several times over the years although it's hard to fathom any filmmaker being inspired by this trashy drama neither one of the hemingway women can act here although mariel has improved over the years anne bancroft offers the only touch of class as a prosecuting attorney and chris sarandon is by turns pathetic and unintentionally hilarious as the smirking smarmy bad guy of the piece br br veteran director lamont johnson can't make a silk purse out of this sow's ear of a script which is stuffed to bursting with howlingly bad dialogue and outlandish situations for example the final sequence where margaux grabs her shotgun and chases sarandon down after his latest shocking act is meant to be exciting but elicits hearty chuckles instead add a notoriously shrill and spacy musical score by michel polnareff and you have a true guilty pleasure even though you're likely to feel grubby and needing a hot shower after viewing it don't say you weren't warned
<START> this movie kinda let me down it seemed a lot like the movie jaws when the hopper was telling the mayor to close parks was like when roy shider was telling the mayor to close the beaches they both said no way its summer but the box says hopper has to get into the mind of a killer and think like one but he really doesn't do anything too interesting or exciting i'm not even a little convinced he and his partner have any experience doing police work when they are in the office wondering how they are gonna solve this case they just say lets do police work and we'll solve it and whats up with all the old men with pool cues i didn't even begin to believe that they were mob bosses and then the guy who was doubting the guy the mob picked to handle finding the killer with his hundred dollar haircut and that he thinks his di k is the size of a schoolbus come on what cruddy lines i thought he was gonna hit him with a baseball bat like in the other movies i got this movie used and wouldn't buy it new i suggest you skip this movie oh and it was funny seeing the microphone above the scene where hopper is going out to get coffee
<START> i went to the movies to see 'beat street' it wasn't bad it was kinda' neat 'krush groove' was a flick that i didn't mind but when it came to 'rappin' i drew the line word to your mother br br want me to stop br br that's just a small sample of the stupa fly style of rhymin' on display in this waste of film and location permits this movie is seriously wack thats 80s speak for just f cking awful as an emcee mario van peebles is one hell of an actor and as an actor mario van peebles is one hell of a bodybuilder br br any film calling itself rappin' had better deliver at that genre's highest standard of the time so why were 6 year olds rolling in the aisles even back in the day when standards were so knee high to webster low because this rap is weak so weak that not even b e t or comedy central will touch it with a 10 foot gold rope chain br br blondie's rapture is def poetry next to this bit of dr suess in the hood so don't be a boobie avoid this movie br br
<START> i don't understand why the reviews of this film are so universally bad unless i'm just off my rocker i found it sick brilliant twisted and psychologically sophisticated you won't get deeper into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a hollywood film than this one it has layers within layers nuanced acting by stone and a plot that will keep you guessing even after it's over people need to get over the fact that sharon stone is 48 and that michael douglas isn't in this one i predict that this film will be a huge hit on dvd once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to the drivel professional reviewers put out give it a shot you might be glad you did
<START> teresa pavlinek was a popular member of the toronto second city cast she has done numerous guest spots and commercials up here in canada finally someone has the sense to create a show for her the supporting case seems quite good too i have now watched the pilot several times and i still find it refreshing though i am not sure why the show is listed as the jane show 2004 i might be wrong but as far as i am aware the show was conceptualized in 2005 and appeared on global tv in canada in early 2006 it is a fresh idea and hopefully it does well too bad this couldn't be paired up with corner gas now i know corner gas is on ctv but the two shows would be great companion pieces
<START> this was disappointing it started well enough but as it went on and lost every opportunity to soar it fell flat maria schrader's acting is dreadful never seeming to mean what she says or even knowing what she says until she says it she showed no genuine emotion at all not for her beloved goy or her mother's story when with lena she seemed to have little more than an academic interest in lena's story there never seemed to be a real relationship between lena and her mother except her mother seemed to be having a good time at the wedding which isn't much the supposed parallel between hannah's mixed romance and her mother's relationship with her father was as clichÃ© as they come and failed miserably anyway the wedding was completely unconvincing and a dumb finish the climax of the protest was uninspiring and no matter what lena had or had not done to influence the outcome she would surely have shown some complexity of feeling at the time a haunted look an inexplicable ambivalence in fact none of the characters in the film had any depth or spark it was very hard to care about any of them even little ruth everything with luis was a distraction why did she dis him so when on the phone from the hotel there was no context or explanation whatever for that if every reference to him was removed it wouldn't be noticed br br a simple story made confusing by poor character development who was whose mother again weak acting and directing that made everyone look like they were acting you could almost hear quiet on the set i started thinking this was worthy of a 7 but as the film went on it dropped rapidly to a 4 then earning a 3 after the silliness of the wedding scene this was about as cold and sterile a movie as i have seen a terrible waste of a good story
<START> very few chess movies have been made over the last couple of years but this one is more than just a chess movie its a story about the need to be loved and the need to win it john toturro plays a psychologically challenged man nothing matters to him accept 64 squares and 32 pieces the game validates him as a person when he looses a game he looses the one thing that makes sense to him and john torturro expresses this in a beautiful fashion even the love of a woman was not enough to save him from his sad existence it makes you wonder if there other luzon's out there who obsess about the game i am sure they are if you are a chess enthusiast it won't hurt to watch it its an intelligent piece of work laid out properly and executed well it achieves its objectives unfortunately i doubt if there will be sequel
<START> genie zoe trilling arrives in egypt to visit her hypocritical bible quoting archeologist father william finley and attracts the attention of a group of cultists led by a descendant of the marquis de sade robert englund englund also plays de sade in flashbacks ranting in his cell genie is led astray by mohammed juliano merr who rides around naked on a horse and sabina alona kamhi a bisexual who introduces her to opium smoking which leads to a wild hallucination featuring topless harem dancers a woman simulating oral sex on a snake an orgy and her father preaching in the background meanwhile black hooded cult members decapitate gouge out eyeballs and slit throats when genie is slipped drugs in her tea she imagines de sade hanging from a cross a gold painted woman in a leafy g string and herself bloody on a bed covered in snakes it's all because she's the reincarnation of de sade's lost love br br this typically sleazy harry alan towers production is redundant seedy and pretty senseless but the sets costumes cinematography and location work are all excellent and at least there's always something going on br br score 3 out of 10
<START> lucky me i got a sneak peak at this pathetic little shot in texas 'horror' flick from artisan entertainment a week before it hit video shelves and let me tell you i've rarely laughed so hard in my life as i did watching this atrocious megabomb fly off the rails and steal the title of 'worst killer clown movie ever made' from the insufferably stupid full moon fiasco killjoy i'm sure many of us horror fans have suffered through that one from all indications it was shot on dv and it doesn't really 'look' all that bad quality wise for digital but boy does it ever fail miserably in every other area where it counts br br the story slight and cliche as it is goes as follows an executive ken hebert who also scripted and co produced with the director takes skeptical co worker tracy amanda watson and horny married couple mark and susan hank fields and chris buck along on a weekend getaway to a yawn secluded cabin 12 miles' from the nearest town on the way there they pick up a bitchy slutty hitchhiker melissa bale in a bar and end up at their destination where a nightly campfire tale about a murderous clown stalking the very same wooded area comes true when each of the profanity yackin pot smokin Âfriends' disappears one by one with only mutilated doll parts left behind to tell the tale of their fates br br the killer clown doesn't even show up in the film until near the end and it looks nothing like the demonic depiction of it on the video box aside from being morbidly obese it basically spends an hour prancing around in the woods chopping up wood and blabbing nursery rhymes i cannot say enough bad things about the cast especially the two guys and the hitchhiker chick who either deliver their insipid dialogue with a bare minimum of enthusiasm or overact at the most inappropriate times doesn't really help that the script is completely and utterly devoid of suspense originality intelligence general coherence or humor i could go on for days on how inept this film is how many continuity errors there are and how amateurish the whole production is but i'll just nod off by pointing out the whole package is quite a riot in that boy this sucks kind of way br br also noting that the film has been released here in the us as s i c k serial insane clown killer it's currently catalogued under its original title of grim weekend br br score 1 out of 10
<START> the story line was very straight forward and easy to follow and contained a lot of no brainer comedy to a point where it just got boring some of the audience seemed to find it funny but i like more intelligent humor br br there were several known swedish actors in the movie and their performance were decent considering the script lena endre was good looking as always br br i don't remember the original movie so i can't say if it's better or worse br br if you enjoy movies like sÃ¤llskapsresan this movie might be worth taking a look at
<START> give me my money back give me my life back give me a bit of credit this movie was vomit worthy useless and time consuming what a waste of energy and totally pointless okay i understand the premise and the idea sound but give us a break next time just give me the money and let me spend it lost child mothers remorse blamed husband clichÃ© yes get a life sorry but this movie was a total waste of my time my money and my being i would rather watch eggs cook no real explanation to why this happened prison why loss obvious but why acting deserves a what am i doing here oscar and the cinematography a am i just doing this for a wage how much did this movie make well this silly fool hired a copy enough said
<START> the animation in this re imagining of peter the wolf is excellent but at 29 minutes the film is sleep inducing they should have called it peter the snails because everything moves at a snail's pace i couldn't even watch the film in one sitting i had to watch it 15 minutes at a time and it was pure torture br br save yourself 30 minutes do not watch this film and you will thank me br br i can only guess that the oscar nominating committee only watched the first few minutes of the nominees unfortunately to vote for the winner in the best animated short short category the voters will have to sit through the whole thing i already feel sorry for them and must predict that there's no way this film will come close to winning
<START> i saw this movie with the intention of not liking it i sure didn't it's one of those movies that seems to have been made exclusively for the oscars music throughout the film in almost every single frame almost no profanity set in a time long gone sepia toned imagery pretentious title no sex and a genius that explains everything he thinks and concludes in sfx cgi so that we the stupid audience get it one thing that amused me though is the fact that they spelled the nobel price wrong instead they call the nobel price named after an actual person called alfred nobel 'the noble price' jesus how can one make such a mistake in such a big production supposedly based on a true story what a sham what were you and the others thinking ron
<START> roman polanski masterfully directs this sort of a variation on the same theme as repulsion i can't imagine there is one honest movie goer not able to acknowledge the fine director in le locataire yet both parts of the dyptic may not be thoroughly satisfactory to most people myself included br br polanski is very good at making us feels the inner torture of his characters deneuve in repulsion and himself in le locataire starting with some lack of self assurance soon to turn gradually into psychological uneasiness eventually blossoming into an irreversible physical malaise the shared ordeal for the characters and audience is really dissimilar from the fright and tension of horror movies since there's no tangible supernatural element here while horror movies allow for some kind of catharsis be it cheap or more elaborate polanski sadistically tortures us and if in his latter opus the dark humour is permanent we are mostly on our nerves as opposed to on the edge of our seats br br suspense horror all this is a matter of playing with the audience's expectations alternatively fooling and fulfilling them not literally with people's nerves in my book rosemary's baby is a far greater achievement because sheer paranoia and plain rationality are in constant struggle the story is about a couple moving in a strange flat while we are forced to identify with a sole character what's more if the fantasy elements are all in the hero's mind the situation is most uncomfortable since we the viewers are compelled to judge him reject him while we have been masterfully lured paint 'n lure into being him
<START> the version of this film i saw was titled 'horror rises from the tomb' the horror in question is a wicked medieval magician played by spanish horror legend paul naschy looking like he's playing abanazer in a church hall panto he rises from his tomb when a stupid descendant i think he's a descendant as he's also played by naschy returns to his ancestral home and reunites the magician's head and body which had been separated by by the witchfinders who executed him in an attempt to stop him er rising from the tomb br br obviously once head and body are back together all hell breaks loose and lots of people die like all good magicians abanazer here has a lovely assistant this one's played by another spanish horror great the beautiful helga line like practically every other woman in the film line periodically gets her kit off there's a lot of nudity in this film and not just female we even get to see naschy's paunchy body which isn't a pretty sight i can tell you most of the film's sex angle is laughably gratuitous there's one particularly funny scene where naschy and line discuss their evil plans and then suddenly decide to both have a grope of the nubile young blonde they've possessed br br it's also pretty gory in places notably a herschell gordon lewis esquire moment where line plunges her hands into a man's chest to remove his heart br br the best part of the film is the pretty effective zombies who turn up towards the end they're quickly scared off by a fire though and don't bother coming back which is a shame the scene where the zombies rise however is the film's most ludicrously inept moment it all happens in long shot and we haven't really got a clue what's happening until we see some figures shambling on from the distance there are several rubbish moments like this thanks largely to poor editing when a labourer falls under the hypnotic spell of naschy's head there's a big close up of his face that seems to last forever and serves no purpose whatsoever br br all in all not a great horror film but entertaining enough of course the version i saw was a dubbed american version that had probably been chopped to pieces for all i know the original spanish version could be a masterpiece
<START> the books of james michener taking readers to faraway places with strange sounding names were probably at their most popular in the 1940s and 1950s his tales of the south pacific became a major blockbuster broadway hit for rodgers hammerstein south pacific was directed by joshua logan and he was a natural to do the film adaption of another michener success sayonara br br it was only a decade before that american films during world war ii did not portray the japanese kindly i'm sure it wasn't easy for people who fought the pacific war to change attitudes overnight that and a general no fraternization policy with occupied peoples in general are at the crux of this story about interracial romance br br sayonara is a relevant film today the military has always butted in to the personal lives of its personnel in ways no civilian employer could get away with legally in america at the time sayonara was made there were still miscegenation laws on the books in many states today gays in the military is a big issue someone may one day do a sayonara like film on that issue br br joshua logan was on familiar ground south pacific also had racism as a component of its plot with a sure hand logan assembled a great cast and crafts a beautiful story br br marlon brando patricia owens james garner kent smith some of the occidental players do a fine job but the picture is stolen by the orientals here miko taka hits the mark beautifully as brando's love interest but the real stars are the two that one both supporting players oscars red buttons and miyoshi umeki br br buttons is your everyman enlisted man air force member he falls passionately in love with katsumi played by miyoshi umeki they marry and the military cruelly does everything they can to break them up they presume to know what's best for buttons and umeki buttons was a tv comedian and a fair talent but he never got a part as good as this the rest of his career br br and miyoshi umeki's oscar was the first one given to an oriental it got a great deal of attention because at the time of the academy awards miyoshi was starring on broadway in flower drum song i was privileged to see it on broadway it was the first broadway show i ever saw i still carry the memory of it br br that oscar symbolized something else too our war with japan was really over and we saw in sayonara a great nation with a proud tradition and culture br br ricardo montalban plays nakamura a kabuki theatre actor if sayonara were done today logan would never get away with it but montalban is fine br br good location photography and a grand story this film should be revived more often it has a great moral
