<START> okay let me coin a new word here polyphobia the fear of polyamorous relationships this is yet another in a long line of movies which start out by titillating audiences about some kind of threesome only to turn on a dime and go all preachy about how it is oh so necessary and the only moral thing to find a monogamistic solution only one person in a thousand understands the delight of being able to love more than one person and this director is not one of them bleh br br mark my words a few decades from now polyphobia is going to be just as big a faux pas as homophobia but guess who was too close minded to realize this right the first time the producers of this movie and so many like it why even make a ridiculously conservative and old fashioned type of movie like this priding itself on being limitlessly open minded about gayness it completely overlooks the fact that we live in an age where monogamy is turning into sequential monogamy which in turn in turning into swinging and polyamory open your eyes people please br br this is a disappointing run of the mill chick flick but damn i gotta say heather graham is the cutest thing alive br br 3 out of 10
<START> the twilight zone has achieved a certain mythology about it much like star trek that's because there are many devoted lovers of the show that no matter what think every episode was a winner they are the ones who score each individual show a 10 and cannot objectively evaluate the show because of this a while back i reviewed all the original star trek episodes the good and the bad because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive now it's time to do the same for the twilight zone br br while i have scored many episodes 10 this one gets a 3 simply because it was bad the writing was in fact embarrassingly bad two people from opposing sides in a great war are seen wandering about through the entire episode after a while it's apparent that they are the only two people left on earth as you learn in the really stupid and totally unconvincing conclusion usually the twist at the end makes the episode great this one killed it
<START> well astronaut steve west sits in a plastic space capsule commenting that you haven't lived until you've seen the sun through the rings of saturn all the while the obvious mid day sunlight is streaming through the window when suddenly he has a nose bleed next west is back home in some secret hospital a melting gelatinous mass who goes berserk and causes a chunky nurse to run through a fake glass door apparently west gets stronger as he melts which makes about as much sense as anything in this hopelessly purile adle brained moovie then this dopey army brass who looks kind of like coleman francis director of many bad moovies tries to cover the info up but goo man runs around killing everyone he sees because he is melting he attacks a bickering old couple because he is melting he makes one terrible actress scream and moan helplessly for about 10 minutes because he is melting he is melting because he is melting the fx by the slumming rick baker are supposed to be the star here but they just look hokey the film is poorly shot and everything looks so dark and muddled that it's very difficult making out what's what not that it would help any moocow says who cut the cheese with this one 8p ps didn't you get any crackers
<START> i'm a cartoon you're an illustration what does that suppose to mean this plot could not be worse as a boy who's afraid of everything becomes very brave at the very end of the film because he went into a library the only purpose of this waste of celluloid was to encourage american kids to read when a cheaper and more effective way of doing this could have been a series of adverts even the talents of macaulay culkin as the kid christopher lloyd as the so predictable that he's a the page master librarian could save this pointless film from the dull plot even the voices of whoopi goldberg patrick stewart even leonard nimoy or the hollywood god of voices frank welker as the cartoon characters don't save it ever i can only describe it as a 1990s equivalent to the even ghastly 1978 adaption of the water babies because the bland animation makes the film worse not improving the dull plot
<START> what was steven seagal thinking i mean firstly i love seagal i love all his movies up to the mid 2000s his early stuff is some of the best in the genre this however does not live up to its excellent name attack force with protagonist marshall lawson seagal would be expected to be a mindless action movie with seagal in typical one liner ass kicking form however what we get is a crime mystery bordering on a political thriller with little or no action seagal is always in shadows because of his weight i could not follow this story there's people who mutate to superhumans when they take a drug what happened in this movie the dubbing of seagal is a disgrace a shambles and a shame why dub the man the story is terrible this got a 2 10 from me because of the scene where seagal asks for backup despite having an army with him and an hilarious fight scene where seagal swings his hands like a girl facing the camera revenge is a two way street seagal says in this movie well forget revenge steven you need redemption
<START> i mistakenly kept myself awake late last night watching this thing about the only thing i could say good about this horrid film is that it could be used by film schools to show how not to make a movie no proper character development wait i'm not even sure they were characters set ups were hokey and inane and the overuse of split screens was wasted since sometimes they couldn't even synchronize with alternate shots if i could give this a zero or minus rating i would sadly it isn't even worth the time for a few laughs br br it's just a sad example of money wasted by hollywood and now i waste my time even thinking about it
<START> film starts with 3 people meeting each other in the bar ok they're talking about their imaginary lives lying all the time with no reason still ok from time to time they even make you laugh interesting first 30 minutes you actually enjoy it but then things become worse nothing's happening for a long time and then when something happen all you can see are naked old ladies touching each other not ok disgusting by the way this part should be the top of the movie but it's everything except that movie has no point it's boring and sick br br the strangest thing is that here belgrade serbia on fest film festival this movie was the most popular according to researches of course before people watched it i even thought before watching hay this might be interesting although it's a russian movie but god no
<START> the blob is a great horror movie not merely because of the vividly horrific images of its nearly unstoppable flesh dissolving title character but because it features a real societal message it is in many ways a feel good horror film the clever storyline is helped immeasurably by solid performances from the entire cast the two romantic leads steve mcqueen and aneta corsaut bring surprising depth and sentimentality to the proceedings they are misunderstood but very well meaning young people and it's very easy to root for them br br this is a pro society movie and its juvenile delinquent characters cause trouble mainly out of boredom not out of some malevolent character flaw steve mcqueen's drag racing rival almost appears to be an enemy early on in the proceedings but quickly joins in mcqueen's campaign to save the town from the oozing invader once he sees mcqueen's seriousness in this way a character situation that at first appears to be cartoonish suddenly develops depth and human realism br br the authorities' initial skepticism of the kids' wild claims is proved wrong and once the threat is acknowledged by all all conflict within the society disappears this unification of purpose and the validation of the troublemaking teens becomes official when aneta corsaut's father breaks into the school to obtain the fire extinguishers needed to freeze the blob on any other day breaking into the school would be considered an act of vandalism typical of a juvenile delinquent on this particular day it is a necessary action performed by an adult authority figure at this turning point it is clear that there are no lines of division between the young and the old br br this is an unusual film in that it acknowledges the perception of a generation gap but suggests that it is more imaginary than real and that given a real crisis people will naturally band together to restore order the blob is a perfect tonic for the kind of depression that generally comes with a viewing of night of the living dead 1968 br br much has been made of the film's cheap but innovative and effective visual effects they are undeniably clever a lot of the gravity defying tricks we see the blob perform were achieved with miniature sets designed to be rotated the camera was typically attached to the sets in a very firmly locked down position the lights had to be similarly attached so that the lighting remained steady as the room was turned this way and that these scenes were often photographed one frame at a time as the room was slowly turned the silicone blob oozed very slowly and its action needed to be sped up in a way this was similar to stop motion photography but utilizing a blob of silicone rather than an articulated puppet even today the effects are startling and bizarre br br a very good film with an exploitative sounding title the blob is a must see
<START> the surprise nominee of this year's best animated feature race at the oscars it's an irish film by heart but it was co produced by belgium and brazil with i'm guessing animators working in all three countries the product is one of the most beautiful and unique films in recent memory the character design is a little reminiscent of the french animated film persepolis from a couple of years back with very simple characters with thick black outlines this film is not in black and white oh no what makes this film great is its use of color simply some of the most outrageous and startling use of colors i've ever seen the general design of the pictures is also a lot more geometrical with characters who are basically rectangles or ovals much of the film can be spent playing find the circle a major aspect of the visual design is a circle in the center of the image all of these geometrical designs have a purpose the story is about a young boy who is learning to be an artist working on illuminated manuscripts the book of kells is a real illuminated bible the art of the film is based on the drawings in it the story of the film isn't especially deep but it's a pretty good fantasy tale brendan is a young boy in kells a city surrounded by enormous walls built by his uncle to keep out vikings a newcomer to kells brother aiden inspires brendan to take up illustrating he also inspires him to do things like leave kells and explore the nearby forest within which lives a nymph bruno coulais provides a fantastic score almost as good as the one he did for coraline which i consider the very best of the year
<START> after watching the bodyguard last night i felt compelled to write a review of it br br this could have been a pretty decent movie had it not been for the awful camera work it was beyond annoying the angles were all wrong it was impossible to see anything especially during the fight sequences the closeups were even horrible br br the story has sonny chiba hiring himself out as a bodyguard to anyone willing to lead him to the top of a drug ring he is approached by judy lee who is never quite straight with chiba lee's involvement in the drug ring is deeper than chiba thought as the mob and another gang of thugs are after her br br the story was decent and despite horrible dubbing this could have been a good movie given better direction and editing i'm sure this would have been a classic kung foo movie as it is it's more like another cheesy 70's action movie br br note the opening sequence has a quote familiar to pulp fiction fans and then continues to a karate school in times square that is in no way related to the rest of the movie br br rating 4 out of 10
<START> without reiterating what was said above about this movie i would like to add that i was looking forward to watching this film the cast location and the work of the excellent director michael winterbottom etc it had a vague shadow of 'don't look now' about the storyline from the beginning a stay in different surroundings italy again to dim the heartbreak of loss or perhaps that's how i saw it so consequently i sat there waiting for the story to unfold and put a spin on what we expect to happen to this family in a foreign european country and i sat there and sat there and guess what nothing actually happens and i mean nothing you are not even given the chance to get into the characters as they are so 1 dimensional and vacuous you are led to believe from the pace of the movie that something was going to happen to turn the whole film on it's head the eldest daughters flirtation with the local vespa boys had great scope to take the movie in another direction the youngest daughters visions of her dead mother ended up being a fruitless and pointless exercise the fathers attempts at being seduced by one of his female students felt ridiculous given his age it felt as if the script had a last recall made where they decided at the last minute to eradicated any guts to the story and went for paring it down to a bare minimum to no effect when the credits started to roll unexpectedly you can't help but feel robbed of your time spent sat watching this pile of rubbish
<START> ah yez the sci fi channel produces yeti another abominable movie i was particularly taken by the scenes immediately following the crash where as the survivors desperately searched for matches at least a half dozen fires burned Â with no apparent reason Â at various points of the wreckage fire seemed to be a predominate theme throughout they searched corpses for lighters and matches and finally finding a box built a fire every day for apparently 12 but no one ever gathered wood then when the vegan hah burned the bodies what did she use for an accelerant i mean these guys were frozen Â well maybe not despite the apparent low temperature everything the yeti ate bled maybe it's just me but even in a totally unbelievable tale none of the survivors had ever heard of a yeti or an abominable snowman until the very end if you take care of the little things the bigger deals become more acceptable oh what did the prologue 1972 have to do with the remainder of the movie and the revolver warm enough to hold in his hand froze up and wouldn't fire gimme a break well at least we have carly pope another eminently lovely canadian lass and with little irony ed marinaro as the coach br br well i might as well add the rabbit they ate despite it looking like chicken is not a rodent but a lagomorph now if it had been a squirrel or a rat it would have been a rodent but it still looked like chicken and the writers missed a real chance to have someone note it tastes just like
<START> oh come on learn to have a little fun when i was a kid oh this movie was oscar worthy to me i thought it was absolutely hysterical one of the best movies i had seen br br now it's a little stupid but come on if you enjoyed excellent adventure you should most likely have fun with bogus journey this was the movie before dude where's my car only this one is actually funny like i said it's just a good time it shouldn't be taken seriously and if you enjoyed the first one you should like bogus journey it's just a funny movie with some memorable characters for your enjoyment only watch it let go and remember that it's a silly comedy that's all br br 7 10
<START> i was really looking forward to seeing this film but after watching it i was really disappointed the best bit was when stephen king was in it rober john berk cannot act to save his life and neither can any of the others a few of the performances even made me laugh out loud the film was was not as i imagined it after reading the book which was awesome i imagined it darker and a lot scarier if i was stephen i would be really mad br br i don't know why they changed the ending i thought the ending of the book was very good if you just found out the pie killed your daughter you wouldn't feed it to anyone else would you br br book was so much better
<START> wow i can't believe just how bad zombie doom aka violent sh t 3 really is i'd heard the rumors read the reviews but had to make my mind up for myself well let me tell ya it blows the worst acting of any film ever made dubbing that must have been done while everyone involved was completely wasted inept and laughable gore fx no discernible plot cinematography that looks like my grandma filmed it with her camcorder weapons props that are no joke made out of tin foil the list goes on and on br br three guys get stranded on an island where a bunch of weirdos run around with plastic and tin foil swords two of the captives are freed along with a rebel of the island freaks and are given a day's head start before they are hunted down by the rest of the tribe that's pretty much it br br honestly this is one of the worst films i've ever had the misfortune to subject myself too the budget had to be about 200 and was spent entirely on the gore fx which actually may not have been a bad idea there is nothing to zombie doom other than strung together ridiculous looking gore scenes with lots of horribly dubbed dialog this film makes other no budget outings like premutos lord of the living dead look like titanic some may rank zd in the so bad it's good category and i guess if you're really drunk or high and watching it with a few friends mst3k style i guess it could be looked at that way but not by me i hated pretty much everything about it if zombie doom or zombie 90 which is equally appalling and is included as a bonus on the shock o rama release of zd is indicative of andreas schnaas' other works then he should be banned from ever having anything to do with making a film ever again under penalty of death there is one amusing kung fu battle in the latter half of the film and a lot of blood so i'll grant this one a very generous 3 10 do yourself a favor and skip this
<START> pakeezah is in my mind the greatest achievement of indian cinema the film is visually overwhelming but also emotionally breathtaking the music the songs the sets the costumes the cinematography in fact every creative element is worthy of superlatives
<START> the premise and subject about making a criminal realize what his victims went through by capturing his family hostage sounds promising and interesting but this is the only interesting part which was also dealt 20 years ago with quite finesse by director ravi tandon in his film jawab' 1985 too the problem here is ace director rajkumar santoshi found himself in some sort of confusion as to whether to make it a fast paced action thriller viz khakee or an emotions rich heavy duty drama viz damini and this confusion is quite evident in the final outcome if we ignore two of his pukar 2000 and lajja 2001 this brilliant director has always given us fairly engrossing films with high entertainment value therefore this film comes as a surprise as to what made this script Âsensitive director going for half baked characterization of both of his protagonists amitabh bachchan and aryeman as the film is getting over audience didn't know whom to hate and whom to sympathize with and this factor is the major limiting force in the complete narration therefore what starts as a war between a common man and an underworld don ends on a strange note of self realization and regret by the don about what went wrong with his own family the revelation of don's son as a real baddie does not come as a surprise element in the climax which if compared to similar situation in 'khakee worked so effectively with aishwarya's character that is not all there is more to it the whole dramatization of life of an underworld don operating from abroad looks quite illogical his openly landing up at mumbai from where he is suppose to be absconding as well as running after his enemies and shooting them himself does not look believable pitching a mediocre newcomer actor like aryeman opposite mr bachchan is again not a good idea but nonetheless film has some plus points ashok mehta's fine camera work two good fight sequences co ordinator abbas ali moughal some light well acted scenes of akshay kumar in the ist half santoshi's fast paced slick treatment and of course mr bachchan as usual trying hard to put some life into his lifeless character but all these put together does not make this viewing an exciting experience for you and your family
<START> spoilers br br this is only the second pay per view i've given a perfect 10 the first being the 1991 royal rumble it was full of exciting matches that weren't memorable just disposable fun and that's why i love it br br the opening match between razor and dibiase as well as ludvig borga vs marty jannetty were the only low points they were ok matches but dibiase deserved better in his final pay per view match these days a match like this would have run ins and a bigger climax for razor's first major babyface push and jannetty fresh off a intercontinental title run could have had a better match with borga but i don't think anyone really cared they just needed a borga push on pay per view television br br irs and the kid were great as were michaels and perfect i wish perfect could have won but michaels lies down for no one notice how right after this he left the wwf so he wouldn't have to job to razor bret hart had two great brawls with doink notice how everyone's best match is against the hit man and then lawler their rivalry was a classic that's why that year's feud of the year was a no brainer how often do you see two legends win feud of the year this late in their careers br br the steiners heavenly bodies match was one of the best of the year who knew the bodies could hold their own against one of the best teams ever br br many say that the undertaker giant gonzalez match was a waste of time but i loved it remember what made the old wwf as in pre wwe great was the mix of athleticism and freak show is there a soul out there who didn't like akeem br br the main event wasn't bad although nowhere near match of the year status they put lex luger over well but made a wise choice in having yokozuna keep the belt he was the first heel since superstar graham to hold the belt for more than two months nowadays heels are champions all the time but from the beginning of the wwwf through the wwf of the 90s if you blinked you missed a heel title reign br br as an old school wrestling fan this one and summerslam '88 are my favorites
