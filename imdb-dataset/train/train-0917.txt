<START> i've read some of the other comments and i do have to agree with the ones that didn't get the ending i thought it was going rather well until the end it kept your mind running and then splat i have not clue what went on the last couple minutes of the movie except a complete mess it's like they ran out of money to come up with a good ending so they improvised first they had a mysterious thing making people disappear then they had a guy talking about area 51 which makes you think about aliens then after they it went to crap i thought the actors and actresses did fine it's just the script went sour anyways if you do watch this movie be prepared to be disappointed at the end
<START> marlene dietrich and charles boyer give solid performances in this beautiful but empty film the irony is that dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life truly gorgeous cinematography and sets and yes dietrich's bottomless trunk of clothes are also fabulous she look great boyer looks young and trim br br story of a woman seeking meaning and an ex priest seeking life seems pretty stale but set against such unreal sets and skies it somehow works given the two stars the terrific score by max steiner and a good supporting cast the film runs like 76 minutes and seems badly edited plus certain characters just appear or disappear br br joseph schildkraut is funny as the arab guide c aubrey smith is the old priest lucile watson the mother superior tilly losch the dancer john carradine the diviner and basil rathbone plays well i'm not sure he just rides in from the desert and spoils everything as others have noted john gilbert was slated to star with dietrich i can't help but think he would have been wonderful the role of world weary boris would have suited the great gilbert quite well and after the success of queen christina with garbo his career might have gotten back on track br br i can't think of any other 30s film dietrich did in color she looks great and wears some terrific clothes my favorite is the valentino as the shiek like outfit she wears by the pool br br certainly worth a look for the lush sets and color and the two great stars
<START> this is the movie for those who believe cinema is the seventh art not an entertainment business lars von trier creates a noir atmosphere of post war germany utterly captivating you get absorbed into the dream and you're let go only at the end credits the plot necessarily comes second but it still is a thrilling story with tough issues being raised just wonderful
<START> after mistaking a halloween re broadcast of orson welles' classic radio adaptation of war of the worlds for a real martian invasion a group of moronic martians shows up on earth looking to conquer only their plans go awry as they find themselves truly out of their element and in reality all alone br br this really is often quite good and funny with some decent lines just check the memorable quotes to boot it will most likely appeal to sci fi fans this has passed the test of time for me as seeing it again recently it proved much better than i expected it to be despite a cast made up of no name stars this may just be the funniest martian invasion ever put to film interestingly enough the martians themselves seem to represent almost every classic action hero sci fi hero stereotype there is cool 50s teen fighter pilot fearless astronaut brave soldier and kooky scientist fun for the whole family br br prepare to die earth scum
<START> this was the second of the series of 6 classic tarzan movies featuring johnny weismuller in the title role and maureen o'sullivan as jane br br as usual this was a wonderful film in this series and perhaps stands out as an in between film in a progression that could almost exemplify the development of cinema from the early 1930s into the 1940s as such it displayed good pace though not as good as subsequent films likewise the cinematography is less accomplished than later tarzan films in this series the stock i saw was of uneven quality containing some grainy scenery and some under exposed and over exposed scenes the crisp display of later tarzan films is lacking here on the other hand there is one scene very early on in which the jerky movements of a camera with foliage swishing in front of it as the camera backs up showing safari men forging ahead into the jungle was really almost modern in its style and stands in strong contrast to the stationary shots that make up the rest of the movie br br regarding plot one interesting feature here was jane's near fickleness and inconstancy when she was being subject to martin's flirtations the kiss Â and jane's stunned and partly guilty reaction Â foreshadow something of the jane we see in the future as well in these films compare for example in tarzan finds a son jane's duplicitous actions tricking tarzan and delivering boy to his family later she admits to tarzan that she was wrong here nothing quite so explicit but we have jane returning to the jane parker of yesteryear and in an almost repentant series of actions stripping herself of the evening gown brought by martin and harry to entice her away from tarzan br br there were a whole series of depictions and sequences that especially struck me in this viewing br br for one thing the picture we get of the domestic life of tarzan is here as later a combination of sensual idyll with always the nearby possibility of violent death this to me is very much at the core of the tarzan experience br br i was really surprised by some quite violent scenes even by today's standards br br there were a whole series of scenes that gave me special pleasure tarzan leading the elephants into the valley of the elephants' graveyard tarzan being rescued from watery death by the hippo and then nursed to health by the apes cheetah going to find tarzan when jane and the other men are trapped at the foot of the escarpment cheetah in particular crossing the river on the log the final battle scenes of savages lions on the ground and savages apes in the trees jane showing us that she is truly of tarzan's world now quickly displaying her enterprising woodcraft to work up a line of fire to keep the lions away br br the final series of scenes is splendid suddenly tarzan is on the scene flinging savages from the trees and taking charge of the lions and summoning the elephants to the rescue that final cry of tarzan in triumph holding a happy jane in his arms with a dancing and delighted cheetah beside them is a memorably picture and really a fine summation of the story of tarzan and jane br br all in all this is another wonderful classic tarzan movie i would recommend this movie strongly to anyone
<START> the idea is nice bringing so many stars in one movie is great but too many stories too short and lacking really any sense no connection between the scenes there were some 3 4 brilliant stories but these were out of 18 the frame reminded me of all the invisible children a movie which i liked a lot compared to it however paris je t'aime lacks the intriguing short story which develops starts and has its end and it lacks the topic connecting all those children i do not find paris enough of a topic to connect 18 short sketches together perhaps for people who know paris it is interesting otherwise i wouldn't recommend it
<START> i cringed all the way through this movie first of all the idiotic plot has little to do with parson's own story hollywood has attempted to create a kind of comedy car chase movie imagine englebert sings hendrix br br do not take anything about this movie to be accurate the name parsons in the title and stealing of his body is just used as springboard for a low budget chase movie a blatant attempt to grab a few bucks from the parsons legacy and his fan base gram's father had long since been dead in 1973 the other global characters are fictional none of this has anything to do with grams life or death br br if you are a gram fan i advise you to not see this movie i wish i hadn't it's saddening to see something special be treated as such disgracing fodder i'd swear i could hear gram turning in his grave while the movie was playing if you are not familiar with gram's life and legacy do not take anything in this movie as being representative of gram br br i cannot say enough bad things about this movie if gram were alive and saw this movie he would kill himself then again maybe he'd be afraid to if he knew this movie were to result
<START> unwatchable you can't even make it past the first three minutes and this is coming from a huge adam sandler fan 1
<START> i've recently went back and watched this movie again from not seeing it in years when i first seen the movie i was too young to understand what the movie was about now that i've seen it again i couldn't believe what i've missed all these years for me being able to see movies for what they are i think that this movie was great most people feel as though the music are the best part but i don't think that's true most people don't realize how good the story is because it's judge by the acting the truth of the matter is that no one in the movie were really trying to act rather they were just being themselves the entire main cast were just playing themselves they weren't trying to be anyone else but themselves br br i've actually watched and analyzed the work and effort put into the movie now from my perspective the situations shown in the movie are pretty much based on what actually went on musically in minneapolis at the time and it's most of the things that happen are actually true events that happened in prince's career and who can tell it better than him the music that was coming from the city at the time was starting to be recognized and be revolutionary it was interesting to see how the music was very influential mainly at the club first avenue 7th st entry where in fact prince among other musicians got their career started it's also a known fact that prince and morris day always had a competition with each other in real life but it was a friendly competition they were always friends so the story basically plays off of that competition aspect of their rivalry rather than their friendship which shows the true competitive side of what occurred at club first avenue for it's time br br another reason why this movie is good is due to the fact that some of the situations that occur in the movie are actually based on events that prince has gone through in his life with the music aspect and the personal to me this made the movie more realistic as far as the emotion because he's telling his trials and tribulations pre superstardom plus his dedication he puts into his performances is phenomenal prince made sure that every moment in the movie was done perfectly anytime you hear a song play in the movie it's in perfect sync with the situation at hand br br prince is in all a musical genius and he has proved it on many occasions this movie is what really put prince on the map officially and he hasn't slowed down since anyone who has watched this movie or still unbelieveably hasn't watched it yet when you sit down and view this film you have have to watch it with intellect or you will miss the whole aspect of the movie if you really love music this is definitely the movie to watch above what anyone else says i think it's a great movie to watch and own
<START> i had first watched this several years ago on a now defunct sicilian tv channel amazingly the film emerged as a heftily priced dvd from criterion not being sure what i had made of it initially despite having attained cult status over the years the achievement proper is clearly viewed with modesty even by genre buffs i opted not to make the purchase Â as i did with the similar and to me unfamiliar fiend without a face 1958 recently however i managed to acquire the blob via a copy of the spanish dvd which interestingly ported over the two audio commentary tracks from the criterion special edition Âbut regrettably i could not switch off the spanish subtitles during playback of the main feature anyway looking at the film anew i was surprised by how much i enjoyed it despite many a narrative flaw which i will get to later Â as a pure example of 'b movie' schlockiness atypically shot in pleasant color and a time capsule illustrating late 1950s social attitudes the male lead was an early role for steve n mcqueen and though the actor may have subsequently looked at it with disdain his sole contribution to the genre proves fairly engaging not averse to juvenile kicks but still essentially a decent and more importantly altruistic kid the special effects depicting the slimy and expanding creature are not too bad of its kind and period the film itself rises to a good climax Â beginning with the monster's invasion of a cinema showing daughter of horror 1953 7 as i mentioned recently in that film's review but being curiously screened 'flipped' and which sequence incidentally would be featured at the opening of a satirical italian program actually called blob as to the admittedly minor quibbles i have with the film the monster is not shown traveling Â it just turns up at a variety of places never being seen by anyone there is a baffling over emphasis tantamount to padding on the kids' scrapes with police it is silly to have the town doctor shoot at the blob Â as if fluid whatever its proportion can be destroyed by bullets equally nonsensical is having the teenagers alert the townsfolk of the danger by making door to door visits especially when considering that at that stage only mcqueen had actually seen the monster in action an inferior sequel emerged in 1972 called beware the blob the original was then remade in 1988 Â i watched this not too long ago but it seems not to have made a lasting impression on me though i know micheal elliott loves it for the record i will be following this viewing with two more collaborations between director yeaworth and producer jack h harris namely 4d man 1959 and dinosaurus 1960
<START> the only reason that this movie is rated a 1 is that zero is not one of the selection options with a plot thinner than depression era cabbage soup horrific acting and special effects that look like they came out of the thunderbirds tv series it is amazing that widmark didn't kill the director for putting this black mark on his resume even by 1950's standards the special effects are atrocious except for a couple of underwater submarine sequences i can only assume that it was nominated for best special effects because except for 20 000 leagues under the sea and them there wasn't anybody else doing effects it was certainly no contest for disney that year if this was their only competition i wouldn't recommend the film even for hard core submarine movie buffs as the most realistic scene on the submarine was limited to one shot where seawater can be seen dribbling down the up raised periscope there are other much better sub films that you can enjoy from this era like the aforementioned 20 000 leagues or torpedo run
<START> this is an intimate movie of a sincere girl in the real world out of hollywood's cheap fantasy is a very good piece of its class and ashley judd fills the role impeccably it may appear slow for thrill seekers though cool movie for a calm night br br
<START> fly me to the moon has to be the worst animated film i've seen in a long time that's saying something since i have taken my son to see every animated release for the last 4 years now the story is to be generous trite the voice acting is atrocious too cute sounding the humor is of the romper room variety the animation is passable for a nickolodeon type of cartoon but this is being released on the big screen not cable television br br it gets a 2 only because of it's ok 3 d visuals some of the scenes had a mildly stimulating image but we've seen much better in the past i also question the insistence of the filmmakers to have characters fly away from the screen rather than into it in most of the scenes while that is interesting at first it became tiresome after the 3rd or 4th time it seemed to smack of indifference to me on the part of the creators br br i will say this though it had a pretty cool soundtrack and for the record my son wasn't too crazy about it either bad movie
<START> a classy film pulled in 2 directions to its advantage it is directed by wes craven on the downside the tv film budget shows what could have been so much more with a larger budget it moves along as susan lucci draws robert urichfamily into her clutches and trying to persuade him into the secret of her health club his latest invention a spacesuit which can analyse people or things becomes unexpectedly useful in his new neighbourhood anyone seeing this should pay attention to susan lucci her looks and performance had an unexpected repercussions a few years later the actor scientist and parapsychologist stephen armourae is a fan of this film and wrote a review of this film lucci became subject of a portrait by him followed as the basis for works of a sitter called catherine lucci and barbara steele's portrait in 'black sunday' were used as references for the catherine portraits which were immediately withdrawn by armourae probably due to a personal nature between the artist and catherine so by seeing both films we can get an insight into another story and the appearance of unknown woman that would make an interesting film
<START> this is a made for tv and rather needless sci fi channel retelling of the beowulf story especially after the recent 2005 film beowulf and grendel this movie doesn't really get into beowulf's story but just takes us through his battle against the ravenous beast known as grendel as it leaves a kingdom in absolute fear and turmoil while the powerful viking warrior beowulf is called upon to rid them of the monster's rampage if this is successfully accomplished the king will no longer have to sacrifice the children to keep it at bay after a few failed attempts the creature is slain but it's angry and vengeful mother soon attacks leaving it up to beowulf to again lend his mighty acts of bravery and strength to defeat it grendel looks like it was shot on a tiny budget and the cg effects are terrible like i said this movie is absolutely needless
<START> ''ranma Â½ is my favorite anime by rumiko takahashi the woman really knows how to entertain us with a good story that is not only a comedy but also an action anime the main character of the story is ranma saotome a teenager boy who is also an expert in martial arts ranma is engaged to akane because of an arrangement of both fathers who are great friends and trained together during many years br br akane is the younger and most violent sister of the tendo's kasumi is the oldest and is very sweet and nabiki is the middle and loves to win money no matter what br br ranma and akane fight all the time specially because both have a very bad temper and when they discover that ranma becomes a girl when splashed with cold water as well as his father becomes a panda many new characters and situations starts to happen they also discover the reason of the transformation while fighting ranma and his father fell in a cursed river but not only them had this kind of fate br br if you watched ''ranma 1 2'' and liked i would recommend you ''inuyasha'' and ''maison ikkoku two other good creations from rumiko's hands
<START> this movie is amazing while being funny and entertaining it is also profoundly deep and eye opening i will watch it again and again bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life he has a job and a life but it isn't what he thinks it will take to bring him happiness bruce is bitter unsatisfied and resentful that his life isn't the way he envisions it should be as a result of this state of mind bruce ends up losing his job and blaming god for everything that he thinks is wrong with his life god comes to bruce and grants him godly powers bruce uses these powers to get everything he has always wanted his life is finally exactly what he envisioned it would take to make him happy with one exception in the process of gaining everything he loses the one person who truly loved him as the movie unfolds bruce learns that the real change that needed to occur in his life was not the circumstances but his perception of what was truly there this movie was inspirational and deep if you really pay attention it forces you to look at your life with a deeply humbling respect for the fact that a lot of the time we are so much more blessed than we recognize as my wife says since when does anybody know what it takes to make them happy and my humble addition may we not lose ourselves and those who matter while we try to find out
<START> so i don't ruin it for you i'll be very brief there's some great acting and funny lines from the attractive cast a young graduate of harvard med school brian white finds out he doesn't know as much as he thinks about people he goes to a small hospital in florida for his internship because a girlfriend mya left him for a job as a tv producer his senior resident wood harris helped marvelously by his 'creative collaborator' zoe saldana bring him up to speed they help protect his career and show him the wider possibilities that come from being a compassionate doctor instead of a player who just wants to make money as seems to be true for many of my pre med friends
<START> this movie is of almost generation defining importance to some of us born in the early post war years in that and especially if you were born between 1946 and 1953 and loved spending saturday afternoons at your neighborhood movie house you almost certainly saw it and the memory of seeing it has probably stayed with you it's style is the stuff of a brief and somehow gloriously exciting moment in our growing up days br br it had a modern space age storyboard for the audiences of it's time the set was any town with a supermarket and a movie theater that would be packed for a friday midnight show it has hot rods and rebellious youth but in the 'why can't they let us have fun' way rather than the disturbed histrionic rebel without a cause way all characters were identifiable to us teens parents the old man the doctor the nurse the mechanic the boy the puppy even the cops were sympathetic to us we could relate to them all br br it had a singularly horrifying monster it's first victim is heard moaning 'it hurts it hurts' and we were convinced and frightened the menace grows continually throughout the story there are intense periods of suspense colourful effects a fabulous lead in mcqueen and moments of humour both intended and not it even had an almost over the top sad part to make the more sensitive of us feel like crying br br i saw it in summer age 9 or so double billed with 'i married a monster from outer space' and was so thrilled by the experience of this particular double feature that i went back a couple more times before it left everyone i knew saw it everyone i knew loved it
<START> the movie takes place in a little swedish town where everybody knows each other here mia visits her parent for the birthday of her father a which occasionally always have some kind of tragedy the question is just what will it be this year and you will be surprised it is an extremely well composed movie with a story which has a perfect balance of humor and seriousness which is rarely seen you get happy you get hurt and basically everything in between finally you can't help falling in love with mia if you are a boy i guess the main actress she is an extremely well chosen actress as a lot of the other actors actresses br br enjoy
