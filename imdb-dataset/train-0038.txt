<START> is miike like <UNK> <UNK> art with dreck sometimes confusing the two does he match the fifty fifty rate some claim for <UNK> do we see here too much or too little miike i don't know i don't know i don't know but i could easily fill ten lines just <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> one missed <UNK> steals <UNK> and clichés others here will hit on most of them though not perhaps <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for the sleazy <UNK> <UNK> things supernatural only once when <UNK> takes the zombie like mother in her arms did one missed call <UNK> me a little br br one other point of interest <UNK> <UNK> looks like christopher walken as the detective <UNK> in <UNK> abusive back story and as dead or <UNK> boss <UNK> of the <UNK> of <UNK> drowning and more may be the most convincingly evil character actor i've ever seen so here he's a cop
<START> a group of human looking aliens going to earth to eat crash land on a planet of <UNK> <UNK> instead where they all eat <UNK> <UNK> and act retarded padded with footage from planet of the <UNK> and horrible jokes this is definitely one to miss the acting is atrocious as well and while this isn't as bad as <UNK> what movie can be this is still pretty awful <UNK> stuff it's 90 minute running time feels like an eternity and you will likely be <UNK> life so do yourself a huge favor and just move on skip this crappy film there's nothing to see here br br the film makers try to <UNK> this turd as a mst3k style making fun of the movie they made a decade before and it works to an extent it's still nothing that watchable though <UNK> <UNK> is hot but <UNK> stabs has a pretty unattractive speaking voice br br my grade d br br dvd extras joke commentary 17 behind the scenes <UNK> 7 minute into the black <UNK> jessica mills <UNK> stills gallery and original trailer
<START> there should be more movies about our native americans i especially think that using actual real native americans would be the the right thing i know that this <UNK> <UNK> who was played by pierce brosnan he did an excellent job in portraying that character since he was an <UNK> but my suggestion to hollywood is to put more american indians into the roles and never use anyone else the <UNK> nation has been put on the back <UNK> far too long their poverty is a disgrace to our country it is my firm belief that our country should return the black hills to the <UNK> we ask israel to return their lands to the <UNK> but we do not make any effort to do the same we should be ashamed of ourselves we must practice what we <UNK>
<START> <UNK> ambitious sci fi from <UNK> <UNK> for whom this is clearly a <UNK> of love unfortunately it's just not that good it all starts well enough with an epic but restrained score a mixture of lucas and hitchcock style editing and the glossy cinematography of a spielberg the movie also references many pulp sci fi novels serials and films as diverse as the day the earth stood still superman metropolis planet of the apes the iron giant star wars and the spy who loved me the film however fails to be as good as any one of those for several reasons the main being that it's such a <UNK> of love so concerned with throwing everything at the screen and creating a brave new world <UNK> actually forgets about making a movie there is little to no tension atmosphere or magic on offer here despite <UNK> battles dinosaurs and race against time set pieces even the noir elements fall flat this is a broad way of looking at things though those elements mainly fail because nothing feels at all real and is so obviously fake the green screen just looks like a video game half the time and it's obvious the actors have been <UNK> on afterwards the actors don't get to do much either jude law is wooden gwyneth paltrow is annoying and stupid angelina jolie is wasted and it's all because of an awful script the sort that has to explain nearly everything it is a decent experience and some might get a nostalgia feel but ultimately this is a pointless step into the world of yesterday nice ending though
<START> this movie stinks you will want back the two plus hours it takes to get through it <UNK> doors w <UNK> paltrow and directed by peter <UNK> did what melinda melinda tries to do much much much better that movie was clever witty and well acted i cared about what happened to both <UNK> or rather the characters she played and the performances by supporting cast were fantastic br br where as melinda melinda is tiresome the dialogue is contrived and i could have cared less about any of these people least of all melinda one melinda is so dysfunctional her first glass of wine is at 10 a m and so melodramatic she is laughable and not in the comedic sense the 2nd melinda is fine but forgettable br br woody allen's previous ensemble movies worked because i'm guessing he spent time on the screenplay and the actors were talented one piece of trivia for this movie is that he wrote this screenplay in two months you can tell and while chloe <UNK> is talented those around her are not not enough to be a whole presence the movie ends up being chloe <UNK> and a bunch of other people you know you've seen in other movies but can't quite remember which ones br br sad very sad

<START> since the 70s writer producer director charles band has been responsible for literally hundreds of science fiction fantasy and horror b movies some of them are wonderful examples of how to use a tiny budget to maximum effect many of them are pretty bad <UNK> 1985 was one of those rare gems br br a terminator style tale of time travel and action <UNK> saw tim <UNK> playing jack <UNK> a future cop given the task of tracking down bad guy <UNK> who travels into the past by <UNK> the body of an <UNK> <UNK> is capable of controlling other humans with his psychic powers <UNK> them into <UNK> zombies the <UNK> of the title and attempts to alter the course of history by killing off the <UNK> of the leaders of the future jack follows him to 1985 determined to stop him br br in this 1991 sequel jack is still living in 1985 having destroyed <UNK> he has settled down and married <UNK> helen hunt the young woman who helped him succeed in the first movie but for jack things don't stay calm for long and trouble appears in the form of <UNK> brother e d <UNK> who is trying to build a <UNK> army br br <UNK> ii lacks the charm and simplicity of the original and is a huge disappointment considering how good the original was the story is difficult to pick up if you haven't seen the first film or at least not for a long while and there is loads of unimpressive action and a few poor special effects gone is the <UNK> and wit that made <UNK> so much fun instead we get some cheesy one liners and a script that feels like it was written on the fly br br about the only reason i can give for <UNK> this film to fans of the genre is the cast which boasts many names that will be familiar to followers of sci fi and horror movies jeffrey combs barbara <UNK> richard lynch <UNK> <UNK> unfortunately most of them seemed to be having an <UNK> <UNK> whilst filming <UNK> ii and performances are mediocre at best br br the <UNK> series obviously has its fans four further sequels have since been <UNK> out unless the quality has taken up massive <UNK> swing i can't imagine them being any good
<START> i have this film out of the library right now and i haven't finished watching it it is so bad i am in disbelief audrey hepburn had totally lost her talent by then although she'd pretty much finished with it in <UNK> and <UNK> ' this is the worst thing about this <UNK> stupid film it's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the dorothy <UNK> appearance just prior to her homicide br br there is nothing but idiocy between <UNK> and his <UNK> little <UNK> and little <UNK> and <UNK> to real screwball comedy of which this is the <UNK> <UNK> shadow br br who could believe that there are even some of the same manhattan <UNK> that hepburn inhabited so magically and even <UNK> in <UNK> at <UNK> twenty years earlier the soundtrack of old sinatra songs and the gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the <UNK> <UNK> of the picture to know when the songs <UNK> out at you br br <UNK> to <UNK> means going back up as well as going back down i guess in this case audrey <UNK> <UNK> european lady is all you see of someone who was <UNK> occasionally an actress and always a star here she has even lost her talent as a star if someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period like ann <UNK> had played the role there would have been some life in it even given the unbelievably bad material and <UNK> level situations br br hepburn was a great person of course greater than most movie stars ever <UNK> of being and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors after this dreadful performance she went on to make an atrocious tv movie with robert wagner called <UNK> among thieves ' in <UNK> all <UNK> it is as though she were still playing an <UNK> in her 50's even much <UNK> and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like <UNK> turner were infinitely more effective than is hepburn turner took acting seriously even when she was bad hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all couldn't be bothered with it even her hair and clothes look tacky her last really good work was in <UNK> for the road ' perhaps her most perfect if possibly not her best in many ways br br and that girl who plays the country singer is just sickening john ritter is horrible there is simply nothing to recommend this film except to see dorothy <UNK> who was truly pretty otherwise critic david <UNK> <UNK> used phrase <UNK> his her <UNK> never has made more sense br br ben <UNK> had lost all sex appeal by then and so we have 2 films with <UNK> and hepburn who could ask for anything less sandra <UNK> last pitiful film <UNK> ' from 2 years later a low budget nothing had more to it than this at least ms dee spoke in her own voice by 1981 audrey <UNK> accent just sounded silly she'd go on to do the <UNK> <UNK> of the world with audrey <UNK> and there her somewhat irritating accent works as she walks through english gardens with <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> about <UNK> i like most is when flowers go back to nature ' as in <UNK> <UNK> but in an actual fictional movie she just sounds ridiculous br br to think that <UNK> at <UNK> was such a profound sort of light poetic thing with audrey hepburn one of the most beautiful women in the world she was surely one of the most beautiful screen <UNK> in <UNK> fair <UNK> matching garbo in several things and <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> year at <UNK> ' and then this and her final brief role as the angel <UNK> in the spielberg film <UNK> was just more of the lady stuff corny witless and <UNK> br br i went to her <UNK> service at the fifth <UNK> <UNK> church a beautiful service which included a <UNK> choir singing the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gifts ' the only thing not listed in the program was the sudden playing of <UNK> singing <UNK> <UNK> on the fire escape in <UNK> at <UNK> ' and this brought much emotion and some real tears out in the <UNK> br br a great lady who was once a fine actress as in 'the <UNK> <UNK> and one of the greatest and most beautiful of film stars in many movies of the 50's and 60's who became a truly bad one that's not all that common and perhaps it is only a great human being who in making such things as film performances trivial nevertheless has the <UNK> of mind to want to have the flaws pointed out mercilessly which all of her late film work contained in abundance most of the talk about <UNK> <UNK> is about <UNK> fair lady ' but the one that should have had the original actress in it was <UNK> until dark ' which had starred lee <UNK> on broadway never as celebrated as hepburn she was a better actress in many ways hepburn was completely incapable of playing anything really <UNK> although hepburn was at least adequate enough in that part after that all of her acting went downhill
<START> the cure is an amazing film so suspenseful and just so real i was lucky enough to catch a screening of 'the <UNK> at it's nyc premiere and it completely blew me away i also heard it won an award from that particular festival and it definitely deserved it the first thing that struck out at me was the cinematography eric <UNK> did an amazing job the shooting style of the love scene halfway into the film was amazing a love scene was necessary in this film and <UNK> got the point across but also kept the scene <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> make an excellent creative team and they should definitely work together on future projects judy <UNK> narration was so surreal but simultaneously heart wrenching it made me feel what the main character felt i'm a very tough critic but i must say the cure is one of my favorite films just love it if you haven't seen it yet check it out
<START> hollywood the home of hype <UNK> and the search for <UNK> is <UNK> ruled by spiritual values and so it comes as no surprise that its attempts at <UNK> of the spiritual life are thin and often silly better to go <UNK> <UNK> to the films of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and bergman for <UNK> depictions of the <UNK> strange <UNK> is no exception this odd hybrid of adventure film love story and religious <UNK> <UNK> the very insights it tries to communicate that a figure of <UNK> and salvation would work to match <UNK> clark gable at his most <UNK> mannered and self regarding and julie joan crawford <UNK> and spitting out every other word in an attempt to be the queen of tough <UNK> seems ludicrous at best is this the <UNK> saint of the star system at work matching <UNK> <UNK> before sending them off to further <UNK> <UNK> on the m g m lot but there are good supporting performances here and visually <UNK> moments the shadowy prison <UNK> the escaping boat by <UNK> or against a <UNK> <UNK> julie walking along the <UNK> as the wind <UNK> up julie and <UNK> pig peter lorre <UNK> for <UNK> freedom as the storm builds an unusually <UNK> gay prison romance between two <UNK> above all there is paul <UNK> <UNK> and detached performance as <UNK> a murderer who can appreciate <UNK> virtues yet turns his back on him in the film's most <UNK> moment <UNK> having left <UNK> stands outside the cabin we hear the wind through the jungle see the shadows on his face which conveys a moment of fear and self doubt then he <UNK> into the night in this moment <UNK> achieves an ambiguity depth and existential strength that none of the other characters manage to achieve is the film's secret that its deepest <UNK> are allied with <UNK>

<START> not that he'd care but i'm not one of simon <UNK> friends if i was there's a good chance we'd <UNK> if he continued to make <UNK> like this the trouble is he found a successful formula as the bumbling ordinary guy next door type in shawn of the dead run fat boy run etc but it's starting to wear thin here his character has no discernible qualities he's rude and obnoxious and thinks he's funny when he frankly isn't when transferred to new york from london and i presume this link is meant to appeal to viewers on both sides of the atlantic he proves equally out of place with his new colleagues still is it any wonder when amongst his jolly <UNK> he hires a <UNK> stripper to appear at an <UNK> meeting an act of revenge for his boss yet somehow kirsten dunst starts to warm to him even though he's done nothing nice oh and because he's a superficial male he falls for <UNK> fox at first sight possibly because her character is as shallow as his it all makes for a predictable film conclusion although i can't see any viewer expressing how this <UNK> their life the shame is that on paper this is a cast supposedly worth watching pegg though plays himself kirsten dunst seems to just go though the motions creating no on screen chemistry and <UNK> fox isn't stretched at all the one huge plus is <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> new york <UNK> now if she had been on screen longer
<START> soon americans would <UNK> over a <UNK> damaged england preparing to <UNK> europe but in <UNK> the picture of hip americans in the sunny slightly ridiculous english countryside was an appealing <UNK> <UNK> american dancing star <UNK> jerry <UNK> astaire on a european tour weary of the screaming female crowds generated by the lurid propaganda of his manager burns is <UNK> caught up in the marriage <UNK> of frustrated <UNK> lady alice <UNK> fontaine the tale is complicated by a <UNK> pool among the <UNK> servants that is run by and <UNK> for head butler <UNK> <UNK> who's <UNK> on lady <UNK> cousin <UNK> noble the favorite of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> aunt <UNK> the story would have been much better as a half hour tv episode the usual <UNK> plot devices of mistaken identity and jumps to wrong conclusions wear thin in a full length film both alice jerry appear <UNK> and annoyingly clueless by the second half of the film the amusement park <UNK> the climax in the castle are too long begin to drag fontaine is too beautiful too <UNK> too quiet to be a <UNK> blonde no matter how <UNK> while young <UNK> albert watson is painfully awful but while damsel is a pretty <UNK> vehicle for so much talent the talent doesn't let us down <UNK> romantic comedy skill is no less enjoyable here than in any of his films with ginger rogers and his dance scenes both solo with burns allen are up to par though his one dance with <UNK> <UNK> joan is necessarily tame <UNK> nearly steals the whole show as <UNK> <UNK> secretary who is at once <UNK> conniving <UNK> self confident her scene with solid character actor <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a one of a kind classic this <UNK> priceless scene with the <UNK> singers give damsel a delightful color of naive but noble spirited americans mixing with noble but dull spirited <UNK> gershwin is at the top of his game with nice work if you can get it stiff upper lip which carry the film through its weak points and is there another film where <UNK> get a gershwin swing treatment damsel is more than a piece of trivia for those who might want to see astaire without rogers or fontaine before she was a real star it's a fine <UNK> as entertaining as any of the <UNK> musical comedies that ruled the 1930s but will never be made again
<START> saw this movie recently and had higher hopes not so much based upon the director who hadn't made a cinematographic release before but more based upon its cast harvey keitel scott glenn and craig <UNK> lead role in body double a brian de palma masterpiece have all starred in great movies not together though and this fact hasn't exactly changed because of this one br br the film is unbelievable very predictable and cliché the only thing that might make it slightly appealing is the selection of locations on which it's been shot in my humble opinion don't waste your time on this one
<START> this was one of the worst <UNK> i've seen it just didn't stand out at all really card wise i thought it was going to be pretty good but every match just seemed to fall short br br chris benoit vs <UNK> one of the better matches benoit carried it i just didn't think <UNK> was that great but benoit saved this match br br kane vs <UNK> wow these two guys don't mix or maybe it's <UNK> and any other person alive don't mix awful match br br <UNK> vs ashley i'm not a fan of female wrestling br br <UNK> originals vs new breed i was excited about this match until i saw it really really disappointing br br edge vs <UNK> punk vs king booker vs jeff hardy vs matt hardy vs mr kennedy vs <UNK> vs randy <UNK> absolutely the worst <UNK> match so far just a major let down to many people in the ring at the same time it just didn't live up br br bobby <UNK> vs <UNK> o k not extremely impressive but not the worst of the night br br <UNK> vs undertaker this was maybe the best match of the night very very very nice to see something good for a change br br john cena vs shawn michaels i really feel like this match deserved to be last people make a case for <UNK> vs undertaker but this match was just as good i am starting to get sick of seeing cena win every match though it's getting a little old now i have to say i feel this match is the best of the night but i'm a huge shawn michaels fan so i'm a little biased <UNK> vs <UNK> may have been better but i'm biased so sorry the last two were undoubtedly the best matches of the night and most everything else really came up short
<START> the best film on the battle of san antonio texas in march <UNK> was john wayne's 1960 epic the <UNK> in a one shot job as director producer that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> him wayne demonstrated that he was talented in movie making outside of his icon like acting ability <UNK> the west br br i have commented on that film in a review the other night and i pointed out that wayne and james edward grant the screenwriter <UNK> some points that were barely mentioned in earlier films about the battle they did bring in the issue of slavery they also finally discussed the contribution of local mexican land owner juan <UNK> as an important leader in the war for independence on par with <UNK> <UNK> travis austin and <UNK> br br but there was one weakness though well hidden in the film wayne worked hard to cast it properly thinking of many people for lead roles in it but he did not properly handle the leader of the enemy forces general antonio de santa anna the role was played by an obscure actor <UNK> <UNK> on this board his thread shows only three credits listed <UNK> did not have any spoken dialog even in spanish and while he does have one of the last shots in the film he just is shown as a silent <UNK> <UNK> the burning of the bodies of the americans and their allies br br despite several poor choices in the casting of this television movie the <UNK> thirteen days to <UNK> it is the best film in showing the man who was from <UNK> to <UNK> a leading <UNK> to american policy makers <UNK> julia was a wonderful stage actor i was fortunate to see him in a production in the late 1980s of arms and the man in manhattan as <UNK> he was never boring and usually first rate in his acting br br here we see the <UNK> monster at his worst nothing is acceptable that does not fit santa <UNK> wishes or activities it can be the failure of an <UNK> in the army to bring some item he <UNK> fast enough or it can be the <UNK> of these foreign <UNK> as he saw the americans in not <UNK> down to himself the <UNK> of the west br br santa anna was president of mexico five or six times between <UNK> and <UNK> he claimed that he first got involved in <UNK> a president because that president did not live up to the country's <UNK> but it was the power that kept him going year after year it is a sad commentary that he was the leading mexican historical figure in those two decades no political figure or military figure would rise to <UNK> him until <UNK> <UNK> did in the late <UNK> initially he claimed great liberal ideals but he once admitted that the people of mexico were children who needed <UNK> for one hundred years before they could rule themselves and thus he sounds like gilbert <UNK> in crisis talking about the people he has helped lead against jose <UNK> the amazing thing about him was he managed to keep coming back his <UNK> were disasters while we know about his attack on texas to put down a revolt there he also tried to expand into <UNK> and probably saw himself controlling much of central america he did win at the <UNK> but at great cost of lives his massacre of <UNK> <UNK> men at <UNK> was <UNK> one might make a case for the destruction of the <UNK> of the <UNK> who were fighting to the last but <UNK> had <UNK> then came the disaster of san <UNK> where his army was wiped out he failed to take adequate <UNK> to watch for the american troops he was captured and <UNK> and forced to sign a surrender of texas <UNK> was kind to him the troops wanted to string him up br br except for losing a leg in a battle against the french in <UNK> he managed not to get wounded in most of his wars he <UNK> the forced surrender of texas but could not <UNK> <UNK> it instead he would lead mexico into defeat in the war of <UNK> 48 against the americans leading to the mexican session the u s was decent enough to pay mexico 15 000 000 for the <UNK> but mexico lost half of it's territory he would be president for the last time in <UNK> in time to give franklin <UNK> <UNK> bad administration it's one moment of glory santa anna sold the border of arizona and new mexico the <UNK> purchase to the u s no other mexican president not even <UNK> diaz ever cost his country so much diaz did sell out to foreign business interests but he built up <UNK> economic <UNK> doing so he was <UNK> in <UNK> and settled in <UNK> island there he managed to do his most creative work he introduced <UNK> to the u s and it became chewing <UNK> some achievement br br <UNK> santa anna is younger than the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> who became america's best land purchase agent he is not going to stand for opposition and he jumps into furious <UNK> at a <UNK> notice most of the time his chief <UNK> <UNK> black david <UNK> <UNK> here a british born officer holds his tongue he does not wish to be in front of a firing squad as he could be but <UNK> is secretly less than enchanted by his boss at the end when alone with the newly widowed wives of the dead <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> suggests that they tell the world what santa anna is really like and they did
<START> some possible spoilers br br i'm not too sure what <UNK> was thinking when they decided to <UNK> 80 million down on this extremely tired and lame animated flick they probably thought the spectacular animation would be more than enough to bring audiences mostly families to see it in <UNK> well it seemed to work for the opening weekend it made 26 <UNK> roughly and has made <UNK> 1 <UNK> total an <UNK> for this weekend but i think audiences that came during the weekend saw pretty much the same thing i did when i saw and they spread the word this is one <UNK> lame movie apart from the animation everything else mostly the script seem to be done by a three year old br br the movie is only about 80 mins long but it feels like a three hour epic a few sticking points for me are well the irritating narration is one of them and it's so obviously written at one point he escapes from some <UNK> and even though you can see the horse is obviously scared up pops the narrator the voice of the talented matt damon to clear up any <UNK> which would only happen in the <UNK> of <UNK> br br another one is the constant pop up of bryan adams songs now i'm a fan of his music i think he's good but come on did <UNK> really think audiences would be able to handle 8 9 of his songs throughout such a short movie i certainly couldn't finally and here's a spoiler a horse gets shot at point blank range by a member of the <UNK> no less she the horse then falls into a raging river spirit the focus of the movie tries to save her but they both go over a <UNK> that must have at least a 50 foot drop well later in the movie near the end we see that this horse is alive and well now i know this is a kids movie but even that little amount of realism is <UNK> br br to sum up this is a really lame movie i'm not saying kids won't enjoy it but anyone else will be checking their watches just waiting for this tripe to end definitely on my top 10 worst list of this year out of 4 stars br br
<START> in the beginning and throughout the movie it was great it was suspenseful and thrilling yet in the end it gave no answer to what had happened they mysteriously turned into zombies by a <UNK> or crow it did not answer the questions that we all had and therefore was not as good a movie as i thought that it was going to be
<START> usually i support independent art and i try to be very <UNK> and <UNK> i tend to support everybody because their efforts are worth br br but this movie just moves away from all <UNK> and tolerance limits br br imagine the following situation br br 1 think about the really worst horror movie you have ever seen in your life so far br br 2 think about some great attractive art for that movie's dvd box and a promising plot br br 3 <UNK> you got zombie nation br br see it only if you really don't have anything else better to do anything is better
<START> peter <UNK> has made a handful of truly great films and they all laughed is one of his best the cast couldn't be better <UNK> to play this light but slightly bittersweet screwball comedy interestingly enough the witty light touch <UNK> so effortlessly employs gives the film a rather <UNK> emotional core fresh and immediate the film starts with absolutely no explanation there's no soundtrack music to cue us we meet the characters in action and as <UNK> <UNK> down the streets of new york the film unfolds effortlessly <UNK> <UNK> camera captures it all with an understated simplicity that seems accidental but surely isn't the cast is terrific in every way a classic
<START> all the bare <UNK> women in the world couldn't keep me from hitting the stop button about a third of the way through this awful rubbish with the <UNK> acting equally terrible script plus the poor cgi fx to match this movie is an insult to the werewolf genre it is supposed to be serious which in itself would be funny if this film could even make it to the level of being a bad joke br br this is one of those movies where the people behind the camera are obviously competent but are too lazy to make something even one quarter decent avoid at all costs and watch one of the classic werewolf movies instead br br 0 out of 10
<START> this is one of the worst films i've seen in years you could randomly <UNK> 5 people off the streets and they could act better than anyone in this film absolute waste of time watching it i only gave it a 2 as i like gory films but this is just plain rubbish the acting and i use that term very loosely is abysmal someone please tell me that the 5 main actors in this were making their first ever film don't waste your time watching this hostel was a better film by some way i cannot believe that someone has spent money making this i hope for the producers sake it only cost 50 000 to make it looks like a school project made by kids who haven't got a clue did this even make it to the cinema
<START> i borrowed this movie despite its extremely low rating because i wanted to see how the crew manages to <UNK> the presence of multiple worlds as a matter of fact they didn't at least so its seems some cameo appearance cut rather clumsily into the movie that's it this is what the majority of viewers think however the surprise comes at the end and unfortunately then when probably most of the viewers have already stopped this movie i was also <UNK> when i saw that the brazilian portuguese title of this movie means voyage into death this is the spoiler br br that this movie is about a young girl who goes alone onto this boat on reasons that are completely unclear you understand only in the last 5 minutes when you start the movie with the english title haunted boat in your head you clearly think that the cameo appearances of strange figures are the ghosts but in reality this movie is not like most other horror movies told from the distant writer watcher perspective who can at almost any time <UNK> between different levels of reality it is told from the perspective of the young girl we see her not alone but together with the four friends because she sees them we do not see that she is alone so the parallel worlds are not the cameo appearances <UNK> into the picture stream but the main story we have at least two parallel worlds the world in which the girl is and the world in which the 4 friends are an <UNK> of a third world is probably the young man with the medical skills who comes for a short time on the boat br br i cannot get rid of the deep conviction that with this movie the movie makers cheated an audience of several thousand people by letting them believe that what they have done is more or less a <UNK> film student elaborate with <UNK> chosen pseudo actors that have met just the night before the start of the shooting in a dump after at least twelve beers how mistaken can one be but in addition to this big surprise which one learns only in the very last minutes the end that follows gives another surprise the girl is saved by a crew in a helicopter and another boat when she has <UNK> from her shock she visits again the place at the harbor where she <UNK> the boat together with the four friends and there they are again they wave her to them from the boat which has already taken off shore she jumps into the water arrives at the boat and they are away miraculously beautiful it remembers me a bit to the end of a poem by a <UNK> writer when i <UNK> i saw death standing at my bed but i closed my eyes when i opened them again he was gone
<START> this is the most ludicrous and laughable thriller i've ever seen oh where to start br br plot what little there is <UNK> <UNK> jr hayden christensen a young <UNK> with a bad heart is desperately in need of a transplant clay has been secretly engaged to his mother's <UNK> samantha played by jessica alba on the night that these two secretly get married it just so happens that a heart <UNK> with the same rare blood type is found go and figure the odds of that one once on the operating table clay finds out the <UNK> isn't working and he can feel everything and hear everything br br fortunately clay seems to be able to <UNK> out the pain of a razor sharp <UNK> cutting open his chest by simply <UNK> on his memories of samantha which we are told he's doing through an annoying voice over which never seems to stop br br if you didn't burst out in laughter yet you will surely start to when you see the <UNK> scenes br br how could a young <UNK> agree to have a heart transplant performed by one surgeon one nurse an attending <UNK> and an drunk <UNK> there were more people in the room when my wisdom tooth was getting pulled not to mention the medical behavior which is too preposterous to be taken seriously the operating room isn't even kept <UNK> people are practically able to just walk in and out of the room without even having washed up during the operation the viewer gets to hear <UNK> thoughts none of which are too fascinating ah but here's what it's all about the doctors are trying to kill him in order to take his money believing him to be unconscious the villains speak <UNK> gosh what will happen br br well at least there's no <UNK> from anyone else in the hospital while an incompetent doctor who's got four <UNK> <UNK> running against him is performing major heart surgery not even <UNK> <UNK> mother seems to be able to check on his status the only one interested in keeping updated is samantha but oh no could sweet sam be in on it you'll quickly find out through some scooby doo dialog br br in the end it wouldn't even matter whether or not clay <UNK> <UNK> awareness because the end would have turned out the same way in both cases br br if you can ignore the feeling that the director writer is trying to make fun of the patients who fell victim to <UNK> awareness maybe there's some dumb fun to be had br br enjoy
<START> <UNK> cinema can be quite surprising for an <UNK> audience because of the <UNK> of the tones and genres you can find in the same movie in a <UNK> drama such as this secret sunshine you'll also find some comical parts thriller scenes and romantic times there's not only tragedy in life there's also tragic comedy says at one point of the movie the character interpreted by song <UNK> ho <UNK> up the mixture of the picture but don't get me wrong this <UNK> of the genres the movie deals with adds <UNK> to the experience this rich movie offers to its <UNK> that doesn't mean that it lacks <UNK> on the contrary it's rare to see such a dense and profound portrait of a woman in pain br br shin <UNK> who's in quest for a quiet life with her son in the native town of her late husband really gives by all the different faces of suffering she's going through <UNK> to this movie it's realistic part is <UNK> by the psychological <UNK> of all the <UNK> the poor mother is going through denial lost anger faith <UNK> of reality the movie <UNK> all the steps the character crosses and looks like a psychological <UNK> of all the suffering <UNK> a woman can experience br br the only thing is to accept what may look like a <UNK> experience the woman wears the mask of tragedy the man represents the comical <UNK> and to let the <UNK> of the movie touch you i must say that some parts of the movie really did move me <UNK> in the beginning particularly those concerning the <UNK> of chang joan to truly help the one he loves but also that the <UNK> of suffering emotionally tired me towards the end nevertheless some cinematographic ideas are really breathtaking and surprising the scene where a body is discovered in a large shot is for instance amazing this kind of scenes makes secret sunshine the <UNK> equivalent of the host for horror movies or memories of murder for thrillers these movies are indeed surprising most original <UNK> incredible and manage to give another dimension to the genres they deal with the only thing that secret sunshine forgets as the host forgot to be scary is to make its audience cry bad point for a melodrama but good point for a good film
<START> often laugh out loud sometimes sad story of 2 working divorced guys lemmon a neurotic clean house husband and matthau a <UNK> <UNK> who decide to live together to cut down on <UNK> br br nicely photographed and directed the script is very <UNK> that is there's always more than one side to almost every line particularly funny scene involves 2 british sisters evans and shelley who seem amused by everything anyone says but when lemmon <UNK> out his photos of kids and yes ex wife to be he has the girls <UNK> along with him before matthau can show up with the promised drinks br br very entertaining
<START> it is such a strange movie you can call it awful or if you sit with friends it can give you a killer laugh <UNK> strange comes to mind again and again shot <UNK> acted even worse and the directions maybe none the special effects are funny but the music accompanying a flying demon baby will surely be the biggest hit see it if you got time to kill but don't don't even try to take it seriously supposed to be a tribute to <UNK> holocaust ' since i haven't seen it from the tribute i can assume it to be as bad should have given it 1 10 but it did give me a good laugh or two so it gets a 3 excessive gore the only thing somebody worked on stay away if you are <UNK> more gore than laughs wonder if the makers had a laugh making it
<START> this film is not funny it is not entertaining it does not contain one single second of originality or intelligence nor does it lead you to take the slightest interest in the characters or situation added to that it's about as juvenile a movie as anything in recent memory it's as if a group of 14 or 15 year old high school kids who had never actually met or had any type of relationship with a real girl had sat down and wrote a movie based on their incorrect fantasies about what being an adult man would be like this movie is boring <UNK> mind numbing and at times offensive and disgusting at most it contains one or two moments that make you laugh also it seems twice as long as its 85 minute running time
<START> i was intrigued to see how a little seen 2008 film had somehow won the oscar for best picture of 2009 and thus went to see the hurt locker sadly all i got for the two hours invested was the grim <UNK> that this film had won awards purely for off the screen reasons br br the direction and visual style of this film is some of the weakest you will ever see when it's not busy being yet another bourne identity homage with dire annoying shaky <UNK> visuals it shows off all the <UNK> of a second rate daytime soap opera in terms of <UNK> br br the plot is <UNK> the characterizations are about as well developed as rejected beetle <UNK> comic strip ideas and the dialogue on the instances where the film gives up on being <UNK> and for no apparent reason turns one or two soldiers into right <UNK> is some of the worst ever recorded in fairness the actors do the best they can in the circumstances just not enough to obscure how bad the project is br br the whole film has the feel of it being intended as some kind of <UNK> that they <UNK> was <UNK> of humour and thus re edited as best they could so as to pass it off as a serious drama br br if you spend two hours on this film they are two hours you will never get back and two hours wasted that you will regret for the rest of your life
<START> this begins a <UNK> between edgar allen poe and a journalist poe <UNK> that the man can not spend an entire night in a creepy castle well of course he can but will he come out <UNK> hard to say with all these strange people that aren't supposed to be there wandering around including the icy barbara steele this is a fairly odd film in that the presentation is both in french and english and switches back and forth a few times perhaps this is done because bits of dialog were lost it's also rather dark and claustrophobic being that one doesn't see much beyond a small circle of light that <UNK> and such generate plus there's a feel of dread and impending doom pretty much at all times this version on <UNK> is also <UNK> and i wondered what might be <UNK> in a film from 1964 until i saw the topless scene i guess that might be it overall this is pretty good and in gloomy black and white barbara steele definitely makes the movie too 8 out of 10
<START> the primary aspect of this film which most people miss is that <UNK> lives his life as a chess game so many people have seen this film and just don't get it and i don't understand why while watching this film i was taken on a private journey which <UNK> me i will try to explain this without any spoilers but be <UNK> i do talk about things that happen in the movie br br possible spoilers be <UNK> br br his is a life of large moves versus small moves he chooses <UNK> to be his queen and he and she behave as his aunt first described the king and queen and their moves when she introduced him to chess as a boy listen closely to that description br br when someone asks him a question he flashbacks to the past as if reviewing past moves the flashbacks are beautifully lit by the way the flashbacks are quite interesting as well for they give not only his point of view as a child but the point of view of the other character as well it's stunning br br various characters become either his <UNK> or his enemies <UNK> <UNK> and knights their actions <UNK> you as to who's side they are on even their placement in a scene is pivotal to understanding what is going on beautifully done br br i will not comment more on what happens to the character of <UNK> but i hope that this will <UNK> what is actually happening at the end br br this film is constantly working on many levels which is why i <UNK> it it was a treat and a joy to watch br br if you like this film i would recommend a film called fresh the only way that these films are similar is the use of chess and the characters being treated as pieces br br
<START> this movie could have been great cause its got a somewhat fascinating premise but it never rises above sheer caricature the acting is severely flawed and there were moments where i <UNK> so severely that i thought i was going to fall of my seat in the theater never and i mean never watch this <UNK> piece of danish cinema has been getting a lot of good <UNK> the recent years but if this piece of crosses the border i'm afraid nobody sane will ever want to rent a danish movie this movie is the reason why i chose to register here i really felt i needed to steer people away from this piece of my <UNK> go out to the people who already went to the cinema to watch this
<START> thomas <UNK> was not anne <UNK> boss tom <UNK> the <UNK> was that is the reason the <UNK> became involved he called <UNK> and asked him to get the <UNK> involved in the case i lived outside of philadelphia at the time so the case was front page news every day i also read ann <UNK> book and saw the city <UNK> segment on a e tom <UNK> was a <UNK> <UNK> an uber <UNK> and a monster he claimed to love ann marie but all he wanted was someone that he could control when she wouldn't let him do that anymore he killed her the ultimate form of control i think it's a waste of money that he is still alive
<START> i love watching jerry as much as the rest of the world but this poor excuse for a soft core porno flick is needlessly offensive lacks anything resembling wit and serves merely as a vehicle of self promotion for springer even though it runs a quick 90 minutes the film drags <UNK> and i should have had the common sense to walk out simply atrocious
<START> the <UNK> nurse 1975 was a italian sexual comedy that starred the one time bond girl ursula <UNK> man was she hot in this movie she was <UNK> and built like a brick house ursula was smoking hot in this movie i have never seen a <UNK> outfit that filled out before br br ms <UNK> stars as a nurse who is hired to take care of a rich elderly man even one in the house seems to be knocking the boots one night the nurse decides to take the <UNK> <UNK> and give some needed t l c to her ancient client the old man takes to his nurse and this <UNK> the rest of the family what kind of job did the family hire her out to do will the <UNK> fall for her car <UNK> how can she deal with the <UNK> <UNK> and the rest of the family to find out you need to find a copy of the <UNK> nurse italian but badly dubbed into english br br highly recommended
<START> now isn't it considering all the good work done by <UNK> clive and jodie the movie never grew into something more than a horrible die hard heist movies <UNK> yes a couple of jokes no absolutely no unpredictable twists to be honest the only unpredictable moments are there because both director and editor made some stupid mistakes it is a shame for them and a waste of time for us if someone can tell me why on earth were they digging a hole inside that safe who the hell is the <UNK> and how on earth did they know that the <UNK> were in the particular cell it could just make my day but it seems that spike asks us to take too much things in this one for granted and do not raise our <UNK> when something looks stupid its just another studio contract movie relax and enjoy
<START> how can a movie with amy posey and <UNK> have nothing funny in it believe it or not <UNK> <UNK> did this better and funnier hopefully the principals had a good holiday and got some money this movie is an embarrassment to all of them it is a cliché from beginning to end clichés can work well with a script or at least an idea this movie does nothing but use cliché after cliché rather than ideas or script it uses the <UNK> <UNK> of the actresses rather than develop characters bad sad and rubbish now i apparently have to have ten lines of text for a comment really why as an it <UNK> manager this is another example of sloppy <UNK>
<START> when it comes to paul verhoeven and erotic thrillers most people think of basic instinct and some maybe of <UNK> but verhoeven has made his best erotic thriller years before these two movies de <UNK> man this film is mesmerizing and <UNK> and above all the story is absolutely plausible which makes the whole experience even more intense the performances by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> hoffman are exceptional and verhoeven's direction does the rest de <UNK> man makes even basic instinct look quite tame it can't get much better than this a true classic of erotic nightmare cinema 10 out of 10 at least
<START> once in the life means that once a <UNK> always a <UNK> and nobody gets in or out of the <UNK> for free neighborhood <UNK> in new york sell drugs and run <UNK> because they can't make it in the legitimate world maybe because they have a criminal record or a drug habit or because they're just lazy this simple story with a couple of twists about mostly despicable characters manages to draw compassion out of the audience for its main players because of their loyalty and compassion for each other the film is written produced and directed by laurence fishburne who also stars as 20 20 mike all <UNK> have <UNK> and is based on his play riff <UNK> ' it feels like a play from beginning to end especially during the longest scene where the three main players square off to decide who can be trusted often times the dialog comes very fast much faster than it would on stage and i think it's the film's biggest flaw mixed in as flashbacks throughout the film are <UNK> from the street a sort of <UNK> <UNK> rap that is violent and <UNK> of the world this movie <UNK> the poetry makes it difficult to dismiss these men these <UNK> who murder cheat and <UNK> each other as <UNK> of our attention or below our contempt the disturbing thing about this film is that its realism shows us not only how these people live but how they suffer for the same reasons as us all one is too stupid another a <UNK> and the last suffers from conscience while the audience wonders or even laughs at the irony of <UNK> demanding from him hanging in the <UNK> to tell jokes in the midst of his demise
<START> i used to watch this show as a child and i loved it i watched it when it came on <UNK> years ago <UNK> i sound so old i must've been 13 or 14 when it came on but anyways it had a great plot line and i'm one of those <UNK> girls who watched and <UNK> <UNK> and i enjoyed it very much the animation wasn't the best quite amusing in some parts actually and the voice acting was extremely lame in the beginning but it was all a good watch and i found myself sucked into it day after day br br samurai troopers <UNK> warriors is a classic and an all time one of my <UNK> go <UNK>
<START> absolutely nothing happens in this <UNK> annoying thrill less thriller directed by <UNK> usual <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the film which in some way deals with the effect of boredom and the quest for thrills actually delivers none and seems like an exercise in boredom the only mildly suspenseful moment is the movie's climax which takes about 30 seconds of the whole <UNK> 100 plus minutes and is resolved too simply the plot lacks sophistication or credibility and while the idea is original the way the story unfolds is <UNK> and every plot device or twist is a result of outside <UNK> <UNK> ex <UNK> the hero is always passive everything happens to him without forcing him to show any <UNK> or <UNK> if you're fans of the genre watch <UNK> instead
<START> really everybody in this movie looks like they want to be <UNK> else no wonder the casting is done not with the left hand but rather not at all i haven't seen anything worse than <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> some sort of agent carrying a gun you don't use a spoiled city brat look in such a role the only worse thing i can imagine is casting doris day as a prostitute the rest of the cast is likewise awful possibly with hurt as the sole exception sometimes you can see him trying but suffering oh did i mention that it is a completely insane story <UNK> many peoples lives because you are divorced and want to see your family well it must be because the guy <UNK> is german br br 2 10 because the photography could be worse
<START> this is the kind of movie i fear the most arrogant and irresponsible it presents a sketch of the <UNK> conflict so cliched and dumb it represents an insult to all <UNK> people the performances are <UNK> from <UNK> her naked scene is absolutely pitiful to <UNK> to <UNK> mickey who looks right out of a tim burton nightmare to <UNK> who makes a notable effort to bring life to a character so one dimensional so cliched and so badly written all <UNK> left to work with is a mustache not to mention the gratuitous ending a gore fest so cheesy that it would make ed wood cringe it fails in all ways cinematography art direction costumes makeup editing and most of all directing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has always been a lousy filmmaker but at least his previous movies had some dignity i can't say anything good about this waste of money except that i hope <UNK> filmmakers learn a lesson about honesty integrity and <UNK> from this mean intended fiasco
<START> from the very beginning the political theme of this film is so obvious and heavy handed that the outcome is entirely predictable any good <UNK> on writing screenplays will advise <UNK> of characters <UNK> character <UNK> and three act structure in this film you will find none of that the police are the baddies and consequently are shown as shallow incompetent and <UNK> it never seems to occur to the makers of this film that police might be <UNK> citizens who see joining the police as a good way to contribute to the <UNK> of society br br the viewer gets no opportunity to make up his or her mind on whether ned kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain the film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse but we get no clue as to his guilt or innocence we see him walk through the door of a <UNK> but only know that he has been inside for three years when we hear this much later in some dialogue br br this film contains many shots of ned looking at the camera with a serious expression i found the film a real chore to watch it is the direction for modern films and this one put me off watching any more
<START> this movie was so <UNK> bad i could hardly believe i was watching it the directing editing production and script all seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who don't know all that much about movies there was no narrative flow that made any sort of sense big emotional moments and <UNK> like one early on between heath ledger and <UNK> <UNK> and character relationships like one hinted at at the very beginning come completely out of no where and are not set up like they would have been in a more <UNK> and effectively made film the characters are sadly underdeveloped making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them the acting surprisingly is not entirely bad but the terrible writing <UNK> out the relatively convincing performances the film plays like a particularly bad t v western epic and sadly <UNK> the fascinating true story that it attempts to tell i have read a lot of reviews that defend the film as being important to <UNK> because of the subject matter that's all very well but just because ned kelly is an important australian historical icon doesn't make the movie good no one is saying that the subject matter isn't good just the quality of the movie itself pearl harbor was about a very important historical event to americans but that doesn't mean i'm going to defend the movie and say it was good because it was still bad a failure all around though heath and orlando are lovely to look at
<START> tess of the storm country was a mary pickford vehicle i had intended to get for some time i finally found a vhs copy for a reasonable price and got to enjoy it br br mary gives her typical <UNK> <UNK> sexy portrayal of a wrong side of tracks girl who wins the heart of a rich heir only this time the stakes are higher a false murder charge an <UNK> child and ensuing case of mistaken <UNK> and <UNK> suicide br br one can see why pickford wanted to <UNK> this one the story is a real morality tale the kind that she loved to star in the controversial topics aren't always spelled out <UNK> a viewer has to pay attention and pick up on hints to catch everything that is being implied on first viewing  although everything is more or less explained in the end br br about the only negative remark i can make would be concerning jean <UNK> and the dog <UNK> whose character ben <UNK> looks to be about 6 2 200 pounds bigger next to mary of course is sent fleeing in panic when a 60 pound chocolate lab charges toward him then to top it off or maybe to justify his <UNK> fear of the dog it manages to pin him to the ground and somehow <UNK> him so badly that he is still struggling to get up much later as a bad storm hits this is the same lovable lab that sleeps with <UNK> lloyd hughes and <UNK> with mary yet mary later throws <UNK> water in ben's face which barely slows him ok i've <UNK> about ben and the chocolate lab other than that the movie was quite touching and certainly held my attention <UNK> supporting cast was strong and believable this is certainly among her better films
<START> this movie is so bad it's funny it stars scott <UNK> as some coach but that's not important what is important is the large black fellow who plays 1st base first off he has to be at least 75 years old yet still plays minor league baseball second he starts out the movie in the <UNK> despite not being able to walk let alone run coach <UNK> brilliantly moves him to first <UNK> the fact that when he attempts to run he stays in the same place for too long a period of time <UNK> shows more brilliant <UNK> <UNK> in the end of the film spoiler he tells his star player downtown to hit a home run clearly downtown viewed this as a good move he hit the home run and won the game for his team a minor league squad playing the twins who were the class of the <UNK> in the movie now if only tony <UNK> manager of the <UNK> would be as smart a coach as <UNK> and tell his players to simply hit a home run in every at bat the <UNK> would never end an <UNK> let alone lose a game
<START> la <UNK> <UNK> la <UNK> or the <UNK> leads the dance as i believe is it's common english title is set on <UNK> in <UNK> where the mysterious count richard <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> stuart invites soon to be out of work theatre actress evelyn <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> de <UNK> three more of her fellow soon to be out of work actress friends <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> penny <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> damon as <UNK> <UNK> to his castle <UNK> on a small island just off the coast at first evelyn is reluctant but is <UNK> when it is agreed stage hand samuel leo <UNK> goes along as well once there count <UNK> tells his guests that his father grandfather both cut the heads off their cheating wives using a <UNK> knife there's a feeling of <UNK> when it turns out that evelyn looks exactly the same as the current <UNK> wife who ran away not too long ago along with having to worry about weirdo servants it turns out that someone wants to use the knife themselves to chop a few heads off br br this italian production was written directed by <UNK> rizzo is total complete utter crap from start to finish first things first lets start the criticism with the title the <UNK> leads the dance lets examine that title because when i do i feel somewhat cheated that there aren't any vampires or any form of <UNK> whatsoever no one <UNK> anything at anytime there most certainly isn't any dance or dancing so don't expect any of these things what you should expect though is a tedious dull boring pointless little <UNK> that takes over an hour before anyone is killed any sort of murder mystery starts to take shape the first hour of la <UNK> <UNK> la <UNK> is as plot less uninteresting as anything out there the best way to imagine it is to think of the most boring soft core porn film you've ever seen then cut most of the soft core porn out that just leaves bad actors bad dubbing bad dialogue a tiny bit of soft core sex <UNK> absolutely nothing else yep it really is that bad the mystery elements are crap people do illogical things for no apparent reason the overly complicated <UNK> ending is as bad as the rest of it the sixth sense 1999 this ain't br br director <UNK> does an ok job la <UNK> <UNK> la <UNK> actually has a nice look feel to it despite it's obvious low budget i mean there are scenes where he shows a <UNK> raging outside the castle however the stock footage used is in black white so the film jumps from bright colour to black white whenever it cuts to the storm back to colour again there is one absolutely hilarious scene where a maid her friend discuss her breasts she lets her friend feel them who is then full of <UNK> this scene is so funny just so unnatural that it's priceless easily the films best moment even if a bad 70's porno would be embarrassed by the dialogue there is minimal nudity the sex lesbian scenes are very tame forget about any blood or gore as there isn't any apart from a decapitated head br br technically the films pretty good the period setting production design are actually quite impressive although it's not massive in scope it does the job effectively enough the film has a nice sense of colour the cinematography is fine the film is dubbed so it's hard to give an opinion on the original performances but the voice actors are terrible the dialogue is even worse than usual br br la <UNK> <UNK> la <UNK> is a terrible film it makes no sense it has virtually no story for over an hour it has possibly the most misleading title ever is really dull boring with a confused stupid <UNK> ending as far as euro horror fans go there are plenty of much better films than this so please don't waste your time as for anyone else this is definitely one to avoid trivia note the notorious banned in the uk nazi exploitation horror film horrifying experiments of the s s last days 1977 aka ss hell camp the beast in heat was directed by <UNK> <UNK> he has a fairly substantial role as a police detective in la <UNK> <UNK> la <UNK>
<START> beginning with its long opening shot of seemingly endless <UNK> of <UNK> line workers in a chinese factory <UNK> landscapes attempts to show the devastating impact of <UNK> on the natural environment and traditional societies its <UNK> narrative assumes that industrial development in china and elsewhere is entirely <UNK> as if there had never been an industrial revolution in europe and america and karl marx had never visited the british museum that there might be a connection between the present day asian drive for <UNK> and wealth and earlier experiences of <UNK> and terror is never mentioned br br at the same time there's an effort to present edward <UNK> photographs of industrial waste as somehow beautiful much of the film is a slide show of these images they are well produced of museum size and have apparently appeared in several <UNK> to me however they only demonstrate that almost any photograph can be made to appear beautiful if well presented industrial waste is still industrial waste the relationship if any between the photographs and the film's spoken message remains unclear br br i don't mean to imply that there aren't real and sometimes desperate problems when countries rush to <UNK> <UNK> landscapes however offers only strange and bitter <UNK> it's like a two hour lecture by noam <UNK> maybe it has some value as a <UNK> of what's wrong with the american and canadian left
<START> pet sematary though a nice 80's horror movie with a nice director and atmosphere is a copy of the italian movie <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> it's clear that stephen king has copied almost all the ideas from this director the movie <UNK> was made before king wrote the book br br the cat the ground everything was copied this is a case of <UNK> but being stephen kind a famous american writer it's totally normal that he can get away with this it's obviously due to the huge difference between this kind of italians movies with no budget and in part it's crap itself but the original idea i repeat it it's italian director <UNK> br br let the world know
<START> kalifornia is a good <UNK> odyssey of suspense and terror which tells of two couples who drive cross country to california to share the cost of gas a pair of losers lewis pitt and two <UNK> artists a photographer and a writer duchovny forbes pitt nails his character which is the focus of this somewhat predictable thriller a good watch for those into psycho killer <UNK>
<START> this film should have never been made honestly i must admit that before i saw it i had some serious doubts the director is not a great actress though she did a lot of movies in holland and the young woman who took the main part is a tv personality with a constant smile on the face and not much self criticism the actor who played the other main part i recently saw in bride flight and although that film is better he did not convince me than to start with the the story i have not read the novel it is based upon but the script that <UNK> the film is something that might have been done with in mind kids having a birthday party on a rainy sunday afternoon not someone of the same age as the director who likes to watch a good movie something really disturbing were the <UNK> dialogues it was most of the time spoken out loud my regards go to the cameraman at least he tried to make something out of it it is a pity that the film is edited lousy if not some scenes were certainly more credible
<START> i was fooled to rent this movie by its impressive cover alas it is easily one of the worst movies ever made judging by the acting of the film characters it's more a comedy than a horror film no surprise why no one else has written comments on the imdb avoid it
<START> any film in the early days of orson welles is a triumph all the way to the third man with joseph <UNK> he is also wonderful in a touch of evil please see them all he tends to get pompous and self serving in films like f is for fake really stupid waste of film don't waste your time watching it it is really ignorant orson welles is a film icon and anyone studying film should see everything he has filmed all his leading ladies are tremendous but in the end welles became a fat drunk like his character in a touch of evil for some reason orson welles had a way with women i see how he could be considered attractive in his youth not like gary cooper or joseph <UNK> or cary grant john wayne i could go on and on but i <UNK> and because i am a woman i can see the attraction to him he orson welles is one of the last true film makers and unless you count the film makers of today tarantino <UNK> spike lee most of the film makers just don't measure up to the film makers of the forties i know there are many more great film makers of today but in such a short amount of time i can't name them all no offense to any of the great film makers of this millennium august 21 2006 please remind me of some current up and coming film makers i don't want to be stuck in the past i love some of the films out now but rarely are there any that i would put on a 100 best list <UNK> and flow was great so was <UNK> and oh brother where art <UNK> from a line in <UNK> travels another fine film from the forties can anyone give me a best list for the 90's and on up to 2006 i would like to know who to watch thank you also props to this website where else can you plug a film or boo it i love the <UNK> and raving from regular folks like me who can say what i want and i promise not to spoil any film for someone who hasn't seen it yet
<START> this <UNK> <UNK> adapted from a gore <UNK> novel actually one of the great american writers makes the magic christian and valley of the dolls look like fellini art works <UNK> welch with an incredible body and she's actually not very tall in a lead role except for kansas city <UNK> when she was quite good playing rex <UNK> bad movie reviewer not critic alter ego only to be surrounded by drag queen great chick mae west horny john huston a young and naive farrah fawcett pre lee <UNK> what a shame and other various creep <UNK> to pretend to spoof way too may things has nothing going for it except inter spliced old films clips i e widmark in kiss of death lena <UNK> just so they can continue to bleed the life out of everyone br br a 2 out of 10 best performance it's so bad it's worth seeing
<START> hard to <UNK> the film perhaps it's an avant garde spy thriller mother night is a very good <UNK> novel and most certainly one of his <UNK> novels to adapt into a feature length film the film adaptation is very faithful to the original book the indie approach to how this film was produced is probably more effective than having a big hollywood studio <UNK> it these days i doubt an intelligent novel like mother night would ever get the green light from the big hollywood <UNK> and normally that is too bad but not in this case mother night has tight direction and a solid cast nick nolte who seems to be getting better roles as he gets older still has that <UNK> persona that allows him to take on a wide range of different characters <UNK> lee is beautiful and great as always i always thought she deserved better than she got out of the entertainment industry i guess making your debut as a dead girl twin peaks with little air time isn't the <UNK> of roles even if the tv show becomes a minor phenomenon anyway this film is totally enjoyable and you don't have to read the book to understand the movie in fact given today's <UNK> realities the <UNK> premise may appear dated and some younger viewers with little knowledge of history will be utterly confused by the events unfolding i am talking to you fellow americans who are students and <UNK> the lowest in the <UNK> world in <UNK> history and lord knows what other subjects
<START> i was about 11 years old i found out i live 0 48 miles from the uncle house the uncle house is on <UNK> dr deer park <UNK> they have added homes since the movie was made i don't know the house number but you can go look it up i am now 21 and i enjoy watching this movie the bar on spencer is no longer their <UNK> <UNK> wants to build a school their i drove by the house last week the house still looks great my dad and uncle would go to the street where the house is and watch the actors come in and out of the house trying to make the movie where john cross over the <UNK> cracks they have made <UNK> higher when i hear about john <UNK> his son i start thinking about when he made urban cowboy he was 26 or 25 at the time
<START> animal farm 1954 was a very good read about the dangers of <UNK> how good ideals can be changed and distorted by those who are ignorant or rule with an iron fist and an empty head sadly this movie does not portray either of these what we're shown is a propaganda piece with a lot of finger waving and pointing the animation and the direction were good considering the budget and the time period but the very essence of george <UNK> novel is sorely missing br br if you're one of those who want to see how not to adapt a novel or are just interested in seeing an adaptation of this brilliant <UNK> then by all means watch i just found this one to be somewhat mediocre just one man's opinion however br br the remake is a notch below but not by much
<START> scott <UNK> is not <UNK> <UNK> that is the first most important and most disturbing thing about this attempt at re imagining scooby doo and company br br <UNK> voice is <UNK> and does not sound anything like he has ever sounded in any of the previous <UNK> of the scooby shows they've also changed the outfit and the classic mode of walking from the original br br i'm not sure what they're on about yet with the villain angle but it surely isn't following the formula used in any of the previous scooby shows br br and the animation style is very bizarre and distorted i like it but it's not real scooby doo type animation but the weird animation used for other wb shows grew on me this might too br br it's worth a glance at once if you can handle the lack of proper shaggy voice that right there is enough to jar one out of enjoying the show properly besides i am trying not to be an <UNK> <UNK> fan <UNK> or die as the saying goes we'll see how it looks after two more episodes by then i'll have formed a much more solid opinion
<START> the only reason i rented this was because of the article in <UNK> magazine the article made this film look interesting well it isn't this was a very boring <UNK> written and directed movie all the actors in this movie are awful except faye <UNK> who is always a joy to watch but too much time was focused on gina phillips and her ridiculous encounters with <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has such a thick <UNK> accent you can only understand every couple of words he says also on hand is nicholas <UNK> who plays the ultra bland love interest to gina phillips the bottom line this movie is not scary there is only one good scene and that is the last five to ten minutes of the movie i would have given this one star but i gave it three just because i like faye <UNK> so much but even she wasn't that great in this
<START> i almost drowned in cheese watching this movie in fact i could not even finish it i want my money back one more of hollywood's feeble attempts to come up with a new idea good thing i keep a bowl of <UNK> in the <UNK> just in case they should of gave <UNK> cage a hat and a bull whip <UNK> <UNK> performance in raising arizona or leaving las vegas beats this <UNK> people who are completely and totally <UNK> and most of them are should love this movie if this film had been animated i would have taken it more seriously i would of rather paid to see a completely stupid movie that did not try to hide it in my opinion this was a incredibly stupid movie and it made a even more incredibly sad attempt to try and hide that fact br br all the sheep seem to love it though
<START> deliverance is one of the best exploitation films to come out of that wonderful 1970's decade from <UNK> so many other exploitation films came br br a group of friends sets out on a <UNK> trip down a river in the south and they become <UNK> by a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> who pretty much try to ruin their lives it's awesome br br we are treated to <UNK> rape vicious <UNK> bow and arrow killings shootings broken bones etc a lot like <UNK> texas chainsaw massacre to say that deliverance is believable would be immature this would never and could never happen even in the dark ages of 1972 br br deliverance is a very entertaining ride and packed full of action it is one in a huge pile of exploitation films to come from the early 70's and it arguably sits on top of that pile with it's great acting superb cinematography and excellent writing br br 8 out of 10 kids
<START> this was one of the <UNK> movies we watched in the last few months with a predictable plot line and pretty bad acting mainly from the supporting characters the interview with hugh laurie on the dvd was actually more rewarding than the film itself br br hugh laurie obviously put a lot of effort into learning how to dance the <UNK> but the scope of his character only required that he <UNK> himself at the kiddie end of the pool the movie is based on the appearance of a lovely girl and great music but these are not sufficient to make good entertainment br br if you have never seen <UNK> or the inside of a british bank this film is for you 2 out of 10
<START> the h g wells classic has had several <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> version and the classic <UNK> version but only this one stays completely true to the book nothing is changed nothing is removed br br originally released as a 3 hour film the director re cut the film down to 2 hours of pure excellence its got a chapter by chapter <UNK> of the novels pages that wells would be proud of the story is as everyone remembers martians <UNK> the earth with <UNK> containing an army of <UNK> walking war machines the people of 19th century earth are ill prepared to <UNK> the alien forces and fight back with <UNK> and guns who <UNK> <UNK> bound right off the <UNK> and when humanity is no longer a world wide power they are saved by the smallest of <UNK> on earth br br the film is an excellent accomplishment for director timothy hines who has great potential as he brought this vision to life with a <UNK> 5 million budget today b movies have larger budgets
<START> i'm in awe wow prepare to be blown away by the uncanny ways of the ninja watch them as they <UNK> crawl along the ground on their backs or <UNK> like a <UNK> fly through the sky climb buildings hide and spring from trees throw about ninja stars role out blue welcome <UNK> disappear in smoke bombs make a lot of <UNK> noises with their <UNK> and quickly <UNK> or <UNK> about on their <UNK> what a sight really i could go on about the many traditional actions but i'll be here all day oh not to forget we even get the legendary chuck <UNK> popping up now and again and watch him <UNK> some ninjas with his shotgun with little ease what class what a <UNK> anyhow the ultra cheap <UNK> <UNK> is some stupid but cheesy ninja action fun that only fanatics of the genre would get anything out of this <UNK> b grade <UNK> br br a genetic lab in america has a very important video that's stolen by a couple of ninjas two americans are sent to japan by the colonel chuck <UNK> to retrieve it br br the opening of the feature sets it up nicely get ready for the laughs afterwards it slows down but soon after the two main protagonists learns about the ninja and goes through the training it gets a head of steam as they break in costumes and <UNK> after the stolen <UNK> tape that contains a very important formula this is when the violently swift action and <UNK> marital arts really come in to play it's not too shoddy either like the moronic script and <UNK> performances the final climatic showdown is very well done br br in the slow stretches it has the two americans mike kelly and george nicholas looking in to the case sharing brainless conversations and <UNK> some minor problems what made me laugh was how the ninjas were put off by how brave and clever these two were these were supposed to be professional killers director dusty nelson <UNK> 1989 ' does an earnest job with what he had and plays it for what it is he <UNK> the on screen activities around striking <UNK> locations the score is a <UNK> <UNK>
<START> as someone who has seen and followed hartley's public work for several years i think much of what used to be fiction told through true stories has been <UNK> into obscure philosophical mind games br br while entertaining fay grim is another step in the henry fool line of thinking where the movie reflects the quality of an object within the movie itself in henry fool the object is the <UNK> in fay grim the object is <UNK> <UNK> which are themselves stolen <UNK> and <UNK> mutated into something so obscure it can't really make any sense i e the process of script writing and film making in the modern era where most blockbuster films are little more than a mash up of the past that is in a philosophical sense what fay grim is all about the object perhaps is the tragedy that shock is now cliché and dull as hinted in the opening scenes at the <UNK> office br br that being said many of the movie best points are lost if you do not understand <UNK> character and the significance of the <UNK> being looked for henry is a <UNK> <UNK> devil first visiting simon as a modern <UNK> etc without understanding how tragic <UNK> character is much of the quality of fay <UNK> plot and story is lost br br and there is not enough <UNK> expressed through verbal flashbacks knowing the plot of henry fool cannot compare to <UNK> the quality of the characters as one did in henry fool and so i think for someone who walks into this movie cold there is about 10 minutes of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to highly constructed dialog and then that's it br br however henry fool was also my least favorite hartley film until i realized that it was bad <UNK> and <UNK> precisely because henry <UNK> <UNK> were bad not just raunchy or dirty but <UNK> broken henry can not even be a proper villain and this is perhaps the tragic flaw that makes him most endearing like <UNK> in <UNK> works henry is <UNK> br br that doesn't come across in fay grim although <UNK> dialog is excellent what does come across is that the entire movie is constructed as an <UNK> a sort of <UNK> of another plot around what ends up being yet another bad story to add to <UNK> <UNK> it is an interesting twist but one that can't really be <UNK> without viewing the first film perhaps showing more of henry earlier on would have been better than having the <UNK> describe the basic storyline of the first movie although this plot is also not really what the first movie was about unless perhaps one is a casual <UNK> br br part of the <UNK> hard to say a little disappointed at the sex gimmicks though cheesy
<START> this movie with the alternate title martial law 3 for some reason introduced me to jeff <UNK> for the first time and it was a great introduction although i had never heard of him before he seemed to be an excellent fighter the action scenes in this movie are great there are lots of them too by the way the <UNK> fight at the <UNK> <UNK> is especially good there's just something about one single guy beating the crap out of a bunch of people that's really fun and for the rest of the cast <UNK> <UNK> was a good choice for the villain roles like this fits her but others don't <UNK> <UNK> also did a good job as always he's a great fighter and macho like character and was a good rival for <UNK> in this movie
<START> this one was marred by potentially great matches being cut very short br br the opening match was a waste of the legion of doom but i guess the only way they could have been eliminated by <UNK> was a double <UNK> otherwise mr perfect would have had to put in <UNK> <UNK> von <UNK> the i c <UNK> was wasted here and this was the third <UNK> in a row where perfect <UNK> remember before that he never lost a match br br the second match was very good possibly the best of the night ted <UNK> and the undertaker were excellent while the jim <UNK> had one of his <UNK> highlights <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> man <UNK> b <UNK> continued his tradition of being the first to put over a new <UNK> remember the big <UNK> and <UNK> this was a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> career as he came back from two on one and almost survived the match he and <UNK> put on a wrestling clinic making us forget that the point of the match was <UNK> boring <UNK> with dusty <UNK> br br even though the <UNK> were the first team to have all of its members survive and only the second since <UNK> to have four survivors this match was not a <UNK> this was the longest match of the night and jake did a repeat of his <UNK> performance when he was left alone against four men and dominated i think he could have actually pulled off an upset these days the match would have ended the other way around br br one of the <UNK> ss matches ever was also one of its most surprising possibly the most underrated wrestler ever <UNK> <UNK> was the inspirational wrestler of the night putting on war paint and <UNK> boris <UNK> <UNK> and even the <UNK> in the final survival match it was so strange to see him put over so <UNK> then go right back to his mediocre career sgt slaughter also did well getting rid of <UNK> and the <UNK> but that just wasn't a surprise <UNK> was br br i think the only point of the survival match was to have hogan and the warrior win together at the end br br this show was boring and the matches were too short the <UNK> debut was cool but <UNK> <UNK> is the reason i will remember this one
<START> i really enjoyed the detail that went into the script br br jonathan rhys myers <UNK> and jewel were outstanding in their support roles as was <UNK> wright toby <UNK> gave as fine a acting job as ever depicted when he had to <UNK> his best friend's arm knowing he would die without the <UNK> br br attention to detail with good <UNK> <UNK> to catch the southern accent incredibly well br br why this movie was swept under the <UNK> by the hollywood <UNK> i can only imagine i have strong <UNK> which makes it all the more appealing to me i have given a dozen dvd copies out for presents br br completely overlooked movie rent or buy it and give it your full attention for a couple of hours then judge
<START> i liked the first movie but this is a <UNK> example of a sequel that would have been better of left on the drawing board the general idea in the first movie was if not great then at least very interesting this sequel tries to build upon the idea and the characters from the first movie and though christopher walken is still good as gabriel the whole idea suddenly gets a bit ridiculous if you haven't seen any of these movies then get the first movie and forget about the sequels they can take away all of the joy from the original
<START> i had no idea what jane eyre was before i saw this miniseries i had read and watched many classics before and i believed that most classics were boring over <UNK> and overrated stories with moderately interesting plots at best this jane eyre miniseries completely changed my <UNK> br br zelah clarke is a fabulous actress and she gives a wonderful portrayal of jane eyre her accent is delightful and her quiet yet firm nature matches the young <UNK> character exactly timothy dalton is an amazing rochester his passion and energy in the film makes me believe that he was born to play the brooding master of <UNK> hall i couldn't sleep at all the night after i had watched this miniseries the plot is both haunting and inspiring the characters are masterfully performed and the story is incredible this is the best version of jane eyre to ever appear on film br br i read the book later and was amazed at how closely this miniseries followed <UNK> <UNK> writing jane eyre is now my favorite film and book if you want to see a masterpiece that will change your life watch the 1983 bbc version of jane eyre
<START> i could barely keep myself from either <UNK> off or just turning off this turd but i decided to stick it out if only for the reasoning that maybe something would happen this is the work of a writer producer director special fx kenneth <UNK> who wants to make a statement on <UNK> damage while making a monster movie that's what he wanted anyway what it turns out to be is a lot of acting either slightly hammy or just mundane and without much merit and scenes that seem to repeat themselves as the monster attacks in the river waters oh and what luck a woman just happens to be naked in it even though there have already been <UNK> br br this is just nonsensical stuff but i suppose it's not too <UNK> it's not very obnoxious at the least and once or twice we get a semi interesting <UNK> at brazilian culture which is the father walking through town with his flock or other pieces of a semblance of <UNK> this is not america ' but whatever hope the director had in casting mitchum or carradine is <UNK> on at best pedestrian and at worst excruciatingly banal and dumb dialog it doesn't help that when we finally get something of a good look at the monster and the action happens it too is <UNK> staged and with only sleazy appeal usually i would feel sorry for a filmmaker who had a lot of problems getting a particular picture finished in this case it took the better part of the mid 70s but with <UNK> or monster or whatever it's called <UNK> br br if you happen to get the elvira dvd double feature of this bad print with bad transfer quality with blue sunshine make sure to skip this one unless of course you're an elvira die hard and can't help yourself to hear her <UNK> commentary personally i'd rather get joel or mike nelson with the robots from mystery science theater on this <UNK> turkey
<START> dahmer is an interesting film although i wouldn't use horror or thriller do describe it it's more a minor character study that seems oddly sympathetic of the killer br br jeremy <UNK> portrays serial killer jeffrey dahmer who drugged murdered and <UNK> his male victims the film centers on the relationship between dahmer and rodney well played by <UNK> <UNK> br br rodney is almost the more interesting character <UNK> of dahmer and having once escaped an attack he returns to dahmer for sex and survives a second attack br br i think the film is disjointed because it does little to portray <UNK> <UNK> years how events may have created the human monster we see on screen and offers no insight into <UNK> belief that he could create sexual zombies of his victims br br the roles are well played but the story is thin
<START> this is the worst movie i've ever seen in my life this is saying quite a bit considering some of the choices i've made in film <UNK> br br i got this on netflix based entirely on the fact that someone i went to high school with is topless in it the topless scene lasted all of about 5 seconds and the rest of the movie was about as much fun as having <UNK> sticks driven underneath my <UNK> whilst being forced to listen to <UNK> sing big <UNK> br br the skits are stupid and consist of the worst kind of juvenile bathroom humor and locker room gags and it's such a blatant and poor rip off of the kentucky fried movie that you'll be begging for big jim <UNK> to crash through the wall and save us from the stupidity of vince offer whoever that is br br unless you are a <UNK> avoid this pile of rubbish
<START> second <UNK> american leading man guy madison plays a character whose <UNK> <UNK> him in this spaghetti western  which having very modest <UNK> emerges as essentially routine though featuring a nice enough score the plot offers some mild interest the title incidentally refers to a wounded man involved in the murderous assault by gun <UNK> on a ranch  the property of the family of their <UNK> <UNK> agent madison the <UNK> younger siblings are determined that the injured party now in their charge lead them to the gang boss responsible ultimately the identity of either mystery man proves a surprise  and both ironically become involved with one of <UNK> sisters another is raped during the raid euro cult <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> appears <UNK> as a saloon <UNK> and <UNK> ex flame
<START> you know all those letters to father christmas and jesus that are sent every year well it turns out that they are not actually delivered but dropped off in a half forgotten corner of the post office to <UNK> unless some bright spark figures out a way of <UNK> them as bizarre settings go it's a winner and one which perfectly fits the strange movie that is dead letter office having said that this is obviously an australian film as opposed to a british one if it was royal mail most letters get this sort of treatment anyway i haven't been in this flat for two years and we're still getting letters for a mr wang some female priest of the church of latter day i've never heard of you and various <UNK> for industrial equipment addressed to a <UNK> company br br dead letter office the name given to the place where <UNK> mail ends up follows the story of alice miranda otto who grows up in a seriously divided home writing to her absent father she only learns in <UNK> that her letters haven't been delivered for one reason or another so <UNK> she gets a job at the d l o and finds herself working alongside other social rejects including the brooding <UNK> immigrant frank lopez george del <UNK> slowly she finds herself drawn to him but can she find out where her dad is without bringing the self contained world of the dead letters office to its knees br br nothing against this film but i was reminded of the god awful heather graham film committed while watching this however this is so much better than that pile of horse crap but then again that ain't difficult for a start this film is much more logical true the <UNK> are somewhat blatant and the <UNK> symbolism quickly becomes a <UNK> but at least this is cohesive and quirky without being complete drivel it is also well acted both otto and del <UNK> are very good as the lovers looking for something they know they'll never find while other characters are <UNK> at best part of the trouble is that it seems to wrap up far too quickly leaving this viewer somewhat disappointed the other part is that when you consider <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> policy i e if you don't speak english rack off such a story is unlikely to take place in reality the other characters sadly also help to <UNK> the realism by proving to be little more than odd ball stereotypes br br despite that dead letter office is certainly something a little different it might not be to everyone's taste but i liked it yes it was hackneyed and predictable but sometimes it's nice to watch a film without guns or violence or heavy duty swearing and nudity no chance of that in an australian film there ain't any major laughs there's no bullet time and the characters are usually one dimensional but it's the story that counts here and while it's not earth shattering in its <UNK> it's a pleasant enough way of passing the time it's the movie equivalent of a <UNK> crow cd nice to listen to now and again but you wouldn't really miss it if it wasn't there
<START> the movie <UNK> life br br the world is setting itself for the innocent and the pure souls and everything has happy end just like in the closing scene of the movie br br the movie has wonderful soundtrack mixture of serbian <UNK> gypsy music and jazz br br this movie is very refreshing piece of visual <UNK> br br the watching experience is like you've been sucked in another colorful romantic and sometimes rough world br br like mr kusturica movie should be
<START> i usually like zombie movies but this one was just plain bad br br the good parts girl swimming topless with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> topless and <UNK> <UNK> boobs <UNK> in a skimpy top when she ran br br the bad part too much video cuts too much matrix slow motion it drags the action not enough blood and guts bad acting and no story the only other person in the theater was smart and left right after the topless swimming scene a total waste of 6 and time i give it a 2 out of 10
<START> dig i would say to anyone even if you don't like <UNK> to see <UNK> kind of <UNK> it is a spinal tap type documentary about one of the biggest bands in the world acting like mental kids during a breakdown of sorts it's fun and fascinating along the same lines comes dig a film about 'the dandy <UNK> and 'the brian <UNK> <UNK> two <UNK> bands who start off a kind of music scene in there home town only for one of the bands to become huge and one to fall by the <UNK> into the musical history books right from the start the two bands pull in opposite directions just on their ability to make decisions whether good or bad filmed over seven years and at times painful to watch we see the <UNK> <UNK> rise to fame thanks to that <UNK> ad and the <UNK> <UNK> fall from scene <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> as the bands become more disjointed the friendships are stretched tension tight and at several points snap into arguments and even on stage fights all of this is half funny and half tragic and believe it or not is <UNK> watch able like i said at the beginning you can watch the <UNK> film even if you have no interest in the band dig on the other hand is slightly different and is more enjoyable and a whole lot easier to watch if you have a passing interest in either band still a good film and more a testament to not be in a band than <UNK> that as a career path dig is a mad ride on rock and <UNK> coat <UNK> and a fine example of the <UNK> and pleasures of being or wanting to be famous
<START> due to budget cuts <UNK> <UNK> again played by <UNK> <UNK> is released from a mental institution even though she killed six people and delivered to the hope <UNK> halfway house once there she immediately <UNK> into her criminally insane ways and kills anyone who gets between her and her food br br holy <UNK> does this movie suck you know you are in trouble when the open credits start up and they are just the credits from the first film apparently filmed off a tv screen nick <UNK> under his <UNK> nick phillips decided to return to the world of crazy fat <UNK> over ten years later and with a budget that probably covered the cost of a blank tape and a video camera rental for the weekend let's just say that <UNK> unique style doesn't translate well to video seriously i have made home movies with more production value than this and <UNK> tries to pull a silent night deadly night 2 by padding half the running time with footage from the first film which looks like it was taken off a worn vhs copy <UNK> is again good as <UNK> but the film is so inept that you start to feel sorry for her for starring in this garbage i mean at least the first film tried here we have no music weaker effects if that is at all possible shaky camera work horrible audio and editing that looks like it was done with two <UNK> hooked up avoid this at all costs
<START> this woman who works as an <UNK> for a photographer goes home and takes a bath where she discovers this hole in the ceiling so she goes to find out that her neighbor above her is a photographer this movie could have had a great plot but then the plot <UNK> of any hope the problem i had with this movie is that every ten seconds someone is <UNK> heroin if they took out the scenes where someone <UNK> heroin then this would be a pretty good movie every time i thought that a scene was going somewhere someone <UNK> the white <UNK> it was really lame to have that much drug use in one movie it pulled attention from the main plot and a great story about a photographer the lesbian stuff didn't bother me i was looking for a movie about art i found a movie about drug use
<START> there is simply no use in trying to <UNK> any part of this film br br it was straight up trash at the very beginning you might think that you are in for a visually stunning piece of cinematography and then shortly thereafter you are hit with a large sack <UNK> of fail the fighting is barely martial the acting is <UNK> on the edge of par and the music is not worth describing there is only enough of a story to have created an excuse for this film to have been made the decisions that the characters make and the way that they deal with the situations is weak and did nothing but <UNK> me i think that the only reason this film came about was to act as a bit of fan service by using <UNK> <UNK>
<START> a unique film one of the best of all time acting script <UNK> jones' score cinematography editing etc just fantastic as most viewers know this movie is based on truman <UNK> book about the famous murder of a kansas farm family the <UNK> by a couple of young guys during a misguided robbery i've never seen a movie that so brilliantly turned a true story into a riveting film br br the actors are solid across the board but the focus is on the killers dick and perry and the law <UNK> team pursuing them scott wilson as dick <UNK> is amazing cocky <UNK> and devoid of compassion he comes across so charming <UNK> and plausible robert blake as perry smith is extraordinary as well lonely and at once <UNK> and cold blooded who could <UNK> these characteristics into one individual and make us buy it he does and it's brilliant a key point of the book is how it took the <UNK> of these two very differently <UNK> individuals to create the critical mass to commit such a stupid and <UNK> crime and these two actors make it work beautifully both had moments in their subsequent careers but these performances are high water marks and that stands for acting period br br the cops are wonderful too leading the investigation is john forsythe but the other three detectives are great as well unlike contemporary movies where producers feel it necessary to <UNK> police with <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> these are just genuine <UNK> working the case with determination and <UNK> they seem so real i've never seen cops on the screen so powerful in their authenticity and i've seen most of the crime classics going way back really one of a kind in this respect br br partial spoiler coming this movie's unique in that you already know what's happened but i'm warning for the record br br of course the best scenes from the best crime shows and movies are the <UNK> the intellectual <UNK> matches between the cops and the crooks <UNK> a <UNK> this movie has hands down the best <UNK> scenes you'll ever see on film watch dick and perry try to <UNK> their way through and slowly unravel unaware the cops have the goods on them but the cops need to <UNK> <UNK> their suspects to <UNK> their <UNK> and hopefully <UNK> <UNK> this is some of the best acting you'll ever see think <UNK> <UNK> ross without the <UNK> br br to help translate the sad and horrific angles of this true story <UNK> was filmed at the actual clutter house and i've heard the <UNK> were played by film students to give them a genuine feel it works these seem like decent simple folk it makes the crime so <UNK> and sad br br i'll stop here it's not a feel good movie but it is one of the best movies ever made and so unique it's mandatory viewing for every film buff
<START> they constructed this one as a kind of fantasy man from snowy river meets butch cassidy and the sundance kid and just for a romantic touch ned and joe get to play away with high class talent the bored young wives of wealthy older men ok there are lots of <UNK> about ned kelly but there are also a lot of well documented facts still leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical <UNK> i mean this is not the robin hood story not the <UNK> legends not beowulf not someone whose life is so <UNK> in the <UNK> of many many centuries past that any recreation of their life and times is 99 <UNK> it's only a couple of <UNK> ago my own grandparents were already of school age when ned was <UNK> br br so it's silly me for <UNK> imagining this movie was a serious attempt to tell the kelly story having recently read peter <UNK> excellent novel the true history of the kelly gang i had eagerly anticipated that this would be in similar vein but no the fact is that mick <UNK> much <UNK> 1970 kelly was probably far closer to reality and a better movie overall which isn't saying a whole lot for it br br glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the dvd i'll give it 3 10 and that's only because some of the nice shots of the australian bush make me feel generous
<START> this is one of the best movies it is one of my favorites a movie with good acting the story is very sensitive and touching good camera work also br br the names of the actresses and actors are not at the top of the american star list however they give equal or better performances than the top of the list br br it is such a pleasure to see a movie about true love romance friendship without having to endure watching someone having to kick box their way to save the world br br if you don't like this movie then you have no heart or feelings then go watch a sports movie there is no killing or horror here see the movie it is a must <UNK>
<START> this documentary was very <UNK> and exposing and at the same time entertaining which i thought was rather impressive i felt as if they did a very good job covering the sport from its' origin until present day but nonetheless there is a reason why i do not give such a high score to this film br br i felt as if at times the story focused too much on the <UNK> <UNK> of the sport so to speak too much on individual locations at which to surf and especially too much on individual surfers i felt as if the documentary had more to do with the nature of the sport the ideology of the sport etc it would have been better although this of course was covered i do not think it got as much time as it <UNK> br br and for many people who are not absolutely nuts about surfing at times hearing them go on and on about specific locations and specific surfers could become boring although the video clips and the in depth research is well respected it could have been presented in a way that would be better for those who are not avid surfers br br furthermore my biggest disappointment was at times they spoke of how utterly amazing and <UNK> certain events in surfing history were yet they did not have the actual footage of these events unfolding and the whole time you are waiting to see on the silver screen this amazing breath taking event that these men are talking about as life changing moments and in the end all you get is a lot of men talking about it and not the actual footage it was far too <UNK> to myself to hear these stories and then be unable to see them i understand the difficulty of <UNK> footage of everything but please do not <UNK> an event up so much and then not show it br br overall a very fresh documentary that i enjoyed watching not the best documentary due to the above reasons but being very fresh and having some extremely exciting footage and a good soundtrack it is a documentary that i would advise everybody to check out
<START> on the surface this is an above average post war romantic comedy beneath the <UNK> it is mgm character actor stunt casting at its funniest br br the leads are straightforward but all the <UNK> are cast much against type margaret hamilton aka wicked witch of the west edward everett <UNK> professional obsessive <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the marx <UNK> nemesis in night in casablanca and the always wonderful night at the opera playing a well <UNK> gang trying to bring the two leads together instead of driving them apart as their usual characters would do br br it also <UNK> fun at many romantic comedy conventions which is another indication that this could be not so much a straight romantic comedy as it is a <UNK> send up of the many post war romantic comedies their 2 dimensional stock characters br br i've seen it only once with <UNK> so i can't be positive but this movie may be one of those that worked better in the context of the time at which it was made but is less successful now that viewers see these secondary characters through a completely different lens i'm assuming this is the case when i give it 9 stars i thought it was hysterical
<START> city girl meg <UNK> receives a horrifying phone call from her mother and understandably <UNK> returns home to her family's rural <UNK> only to be faced with a mystery why are all the <UNK> residents acting out in bizarre and unsettling ways radiation thriller with barely a nod to <UNK> has small town residents going <UNK> which laughably includes two women <UNK> at each other with desire in a public place and tim <UNK> receiving <UNK> attention from a girl on an office <UNK> the picture is too silly for words wasting <UNK> <UNK> and quiet intensity on trash while forcing itself into a corner it can't possibly hope to get out of some of the cinematography by thomas del ruth is good particularly a fire sequence set inside a garage though he is let down by the <UNK> editing and a fairly <UNK> finale simplistic screenplay has <UNK> a surprise nor a shred of originality up its <UNK> 1 2 from
<START> reviewed at the world premiere screening <UNK> 9 2006 at the <UNK> <UNK> theatre during the toronto international film festival <UNK> br br this had an interesting premise but seemed to go on too long with too many shots of <UNK> of <UNK> recycled computers <UNK> <UNK> etc <UNK> over to china by the ton and then <UNK> and remade into new products to sell back and other <UNK> br br the filmmakers tried to get more people interviews to boost the human element but were frequently prevented from doing so due to chinese censorship still what was there was interesting the bits of a shanghai high end real estate agent <UNK> and <UNK> around showing off her <UNK> mansion and gardens <UNK> with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions were especially striking the opening tracking shot of a <UNK> factory floor was quite something as well scenes of the activity at the three <UNK> <UNK> project were also a <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> je films at <UNK> the feature still life <UNK> <UNK> the documentary <UNK> which were also built around that subject br br director jennifer <UNK> producer nick de <UNK> cinematographer peter <UNK> and subject edward <UNK> were all there on stage for a q a after the world premiere producer <UNK> <UNK> was introduced from the audience and was <UNK> as the most key person that <UNK> in the on the ground access in china itself
<START> if people didn't know who barbra streisand was before this is that possible they sure knew who she was after br br this show went on to win 5 <UNK> stands out as one the best things streisand has ever done br br it's made up of 3 acts br br act i barbra singing standards from room to room filled with musicians including a segment where she is a little girl again all ending with a splendid version of her signature song at the time people br br act ii a musical tour of <UNK> goodman while barbra sings poverty songs it's better than it sounds br br act iii the best part just barbra musicians some great songs like happy days are here again a funny girl <UNK> br br all in all a great part of television history made by one of the greatest performers in the world
<START> i love this movie director michael powell once stated that this was his favorite movie and it is mine as well powell and <UNK> created a seemingly simple superbly crafted story the power of love against the powers that be however its deception lies in the complexity of its is it real or is it imaginary premise basically one could argue that it is simply a depiction of the effects of war on a young <UNK> inclined <UNK> during wwii or is it the question is never answered one way or the other actually it is never even asked this continuous understatement is part of the film's appeal br br the innovative photography and cinematography even includes some nice touches portraying the interests of the filmmakers for instance <UNK> always wanted to do a cinematic version of richard <UNK> opera der <UNK> about a young 18th century <UNK> aristocrat this is evident in the brief <UNK> in which conductor <UNK> dressed in all his <UNK> holds the rose which appears silver in heaven the music even has a dreamy quality br br all of the acting is first rate david niven is at his most charming and he has excellent support from veteran roger <UNK> and relative newcomer kim hunter but in my opinion the film's charm comes from <UNK> <UNK> as conductor <UNK> he by far has the most interesting role filling each of his scenes with his innocent <UNK> <UNK> the film it's a pity that some of conductor <UNK> scenes were left on the cutting room floor it is also a pity that <UNK> comedic talents are rarely seen again on film except in the wonderful videos of the scarlet <UNK> television series from the 1950s this is by far and away the most memorable role of his film career he is a perfect foil for relaxed style of niven and his virtual <UNK> <UNK> so nicely with the seriousness of the rest of the characters ironically also in the mid 1940s niven also starred against another heavenly <UNK> played by cary grant in the <UNK> wife their acting styles were so similar that i found the result boring <UNK> and disappointing as a note according to powell <UNK> desperately wanted the role of peter carter initially <UNK> conductor <UNK> it's a good thing he gave in and gave us such a delightful portrayal br br the movie <UNK> to smooth over the strained relations between britain and the u s <UNK> its point towards the end but it is <UNK> in its gentle <UNK> of the horrors of war the numerous <UNK> both military and <UNK> the need to go on when faced with death there is a <UNK> lack of wwii enemies in heaven but the civilians shown are of <UNK> origin powell and <UNK> could have been more explicit in their depiction but it wasn't necessary the movie may not have served its <UNK> purpose as was hoped for but its originality continues to inspire <UNK> and viewers alike on both sides of the atlantic
<START> picture the scene where a bunch of <UNK> sit around a table and one says lets have a black woman approach an unsuspecting member of the public also black in the street and ask him if he is black then walk away the other writers fall about laughing hysterically until one suggests they repeat it in every episode more laughter now if you think the premise is funny and the show contains many such types of situation you will enjoy this show for the rest use your <UNK> and find something more entertaining like watching paint dry those that have written glowing reports of this show should either get out more or be forced to watch television comedies that are really funny another example of the humor in the show a girl tries to get out of paying at a supermarket <UNK> by trying to <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> funny the first time but why repeat it over and over in different shows with different <UNK> i could give other examples but these just might be treated as spoilers <UNK> why this comedy just is not funny at all
<START> ok i like b movies i know what b movies are supposed to represent but this is just awful i am amazed it got such a decent overall score the only redeeming qualities of this flick are the mostly <UNK> splatter effects don't get me wrong gore <UNK> in this flick but few effects really jumped out at me like the <UNK> <UNK> that was great br br i believe this movie was filmed on a camcorder c'mon rent a <UNK> at least i've seen porn with better production values and better acting as well br br acting sucked but not in the troma or full moon sort of way br br story contrived but thats what you get from films like these very loose br br sets props sucked my 16 year old brother makes more elaborate sets for our house on halloween br br dubbing and dialogue sucked horrible voice acting i shouldn't even call it acting and every other word is s t or f k br br there are tons of good classic and b rated horror splatter flicks out there and they are not that hard to track down do yourself a favor by not wasting time on this crap
<START> ok so it was written in 1996 before 9 11 so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the cia director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world is <UNK> that's it that's the good stuff the acting fair the plot silly the twist unnecessary <UNK> it isn't as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets <UNK> don't you think <UNK> have a <UNK> for <UNK> and how to contain them proper execution of such a plan is always a problem as we saw after <UNK> but they have a plan it isn't to send them off to <UNK> and then to <UNK> and if the virus is carried in the air why was the plane door open and the <UNK> standing there with no protection in fact did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs that would stop her but not as dramatic i'm a sucker i always watch a movie to see the end once i started it but this was a waste of time and for the most part predictable i saw it using a <UNK> so i didn't have to watch all the ads that was a plus it's a good example of why i watch so little network tv rubbish
<START> i was <UNK> to have seen some snippets from <UNK> original run of this show in the uk it was always fun and always funny none of the charm has been lost in translation it's as fresh as the people interviewed whether some of it is scripted or not as has been <UNK> is beside the point it's always entertaining br br <UNK> animations shows great imagination in the characters used for each voice the single aspect that i probably love most about the show and its concept the <UNK> between the <UNK> the <UNK> discussing fear of <UNK> the painting ape <UNK> really grow on you as well such as the horse and <UNK> teens from <UNK> most every married couple the <UNK> the insects and the cats to name a few and child voiced character and i've really come to dig the <UNK> <UNK> finally become a day to which to look forward
<START> when i got this movie free from my job along with three other similar movies i watched then with very low expectations now this movie isn't bad per se you get what you pay for it is a tale of love betrayal lies sex scandal everything you want in a movie definitely not a hollywood blockbuster but for cheap thrills it is not that bad i would probably never watch this movie again in a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time or you would see it on a sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time despite the bad acting cliché lines and sub par camera work i didn't have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my dvd player the story has been done many times in many movies this one is no different no better no worse br br just your average movie
<START> frustrated middle aged deputy district attorney george <UNK> a fine performance by george e carey who also produced this picture can't stand his <UNK> <UNK> wife edith a perfectly bitchy anne <UNK> anymore worse yet poor george is further <UNK> with a <UNK> baby sun and a <UNK> lesbian teenage daughter <UNK> brunette <UNK> jackson george has an <UNK> <UNK> with lovely <UNK> and free spirited swinging hippie babysitter candy wilson delightfully played with sexy <UNK> by <UNK> blonde <UNK> patricia <UNK> complications ensue when george finds himself being <UNK> by the bitter julia freeman a nicely <UNK> turn by kathy williams who wants george to spring her psychotic biker boyfriend laurence <UNK> a frightening robert <UNK> who sports a head full of hair here from jail director tom <UNK> yep the same dude who portrayed billy jack and screenwriter james <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> story with a winning and highly entertaining <UNK> of delicious female nudity <UNK> soft core sex and raw violence moreover they accurately <UNK> the whole <UNK> <UNK> sensibility of the 60's youth culture and relate the plot in a tight 75 minute running time thus <UNK> that this movie doesn't <UNK> its welcome one definite highlight occurs when candy invites her <UNK> friends over the <UNK> house for an <UNK> basement bash complete with pot smoking <UNK> rock music and of course hot naked dancing chicks robert o <UNK> funky score hits the <UNK> spot <UNK> <UNK> stark black and white cinematography adds an extra gritty edge to the <UNK> sleazy goings on best of all this flick rates as a marvelous showcase for the utterly charming and fresh faced <UNK> patricia <UNK> who positively lights up the screen with her sweet <UNK> personality and captivating beauty a total trashy treat
<START> i didn't like this film at all first of all i don't know why but everyone here says that <UNK> <UNK> play is excellent which in my opinion is absolutely wrong she is not like natasha another appearance another character what's worse she is a very <UNK> actress and that's why she wasn't able to play this role she <UNK> the heroine completely that was really disgusting to watch her play to my mind that would be much better to give this role to a russian actress because that would be much easier for her to understand the russian soul for a russian person unfortunately <UNK> looked like a drunk man who hasn't <UNK> 2 weeks and defeated a battle in which he lost his eye <UNK> god in this film <UNK> some actors whose play was awesome i suppose that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with his task very well i was pleasantly amazed he is one of the few people who's read the book which is very important for the play in addition i liked plays of our russian actors that was really wonderful to watch them the only thing i liked in this work was very beautiful views and amazing dresses my advice is to read the book and to understand a real sense the aim with which leo <UNK> wrote this masterpiece and maybe realize the whole idea of the book 1 from 10
<START> german nut case <UNK> <UNK> apparently has fans but i don't know why and i'm definitely not one of them the only <UNK> film i'd seen previously was <UNK> and i hated every minute of it but shockingly this film is worse der <UNK> is pointless in the same way as <UNK> but it's a worse film because it's boring in a way that few movies have ever managed it's not far off the blair witch project seriously some people say that this film is <UNK> and <UNK> but it really isn't the director may have been making a point about death but only he knows what it is how anyone could watch this film and be anything other than bored with it is completely beyond me the film revolves around the theme of suicide and follows the deaths of seven different people over the course of a week yes that means we have a pointless and boring episode for monday a pointless and boring episode for <UNK> a pointless and boring episode for <UNK> etc etc this film manages to be even more boring than my average week br br der <UNK> is apparently an <UNK> film although this would appear to be a reference to the way that not very much makes sense rather than a reference to the film bearing any resemblance to <UNK> each segment of the film is meant to tell a separate story but it doesn't we just get a quick little sketch on suicide and it only makes you wonder what the point is the film feels like it should be deep but there's a great big void where the intelligence should be and nothing there to fill it <UNK> uses a few <UNK> images but i'm unlikely to remember any of them for more than a week or so because this film just isn't that memorable there's a shot involving a <UNK> man's body that features fairly often but that gets old pretty quick and all you're left with is the rest of the film which is unfortunate if i were to struggle for good things to say about this crap all i can think of is this the title sounds cool as i mentioned <UNK> is the only other film i've seen from this amateur director i have copies of <UNK> and <UNK> 2 and now i'm really in no rush to watch either der <UNK> is a dull film with no point and anyone that calls it <UNK> is very much mistaken give it a miss
<START> i must say that looking at hamlet from the perspective of a student <UNK> version of hamlet is by far the best his dedication to stay true to the original text should be <UNK> it helps the play come to life on screen and makes it easier for people holding the text while watching as we did while studying it to follow and analyze the text br br one of the things i have heard criticized many times is the casting of major hollywood names in the play i find that this helps viewers recognize the characters easier as opposed to having actors that all look and sound the same that aid in the confusion normally associated with shakespeare br br also his flashbacks help to clear up many <UNK> in the text such as how far the relationship between hamlet and <UNK> really went and why <UNK> just happened to be at the castle at the end all in all not only does this version contain some brilliant performances by actors both familiar and not familiar with shakespeare it is presented in a way that one does not have to be an english literature <UNK> d to understand and enjoy it
<START> just saw this movie version of frank <UNK> guys and dolls for the third time with my mother who had never seen this before she was pleasantly surprised by the singing voices of jean simmons and marlon brando and she thought the <UNK> sequences where simmons and brando dance up a storm were excellent those were pretty impressive to me too and were usually the highlights of the film directed by joseph l <UNK> this movie which <UNK> as a story by damon <UNK> takes a while with the slow pacing of the non musical scenes at first but pulls you in after a while the other story with frank sinatra and vivian <UNK> wasn't as compelling to me but still had their charms especially during the sue me number also loved <UNK> <UNK> sit down you're <UNK> the boat number and the performances of <UNK> leonard and b s <UNK> with a theatrical look throughout guys and dolls isn't a great film musical but certainly a very good one
<START> a beautiful and touching movie that deserves a wider viewing than it is likely to get <UNK> <UNK> plays <UNK> a second generation turkish immigrant who tries to break the mold neither entirely at home with her moderately conservative muslim family nor with her liberal danish friends <UNK> martial arts experience becomes a fight to find herself and have the strength to allow herself to be who she wants to be in spite of both family and friends br br director natasha <UNK> manages to balance <UNK> and narrative so that it has depth without becoming <UNK> philosophical <UNK> and drawing on <UNK> <UNK> choreography skills pays off in spectacular fight sequences in the end however it is <UNK> <UNK> stunning debut performance that gives this movie spirit raw charisma and requisite martial arts skills are <UNK> by heart to make her personal drama believable br br well worth your while
<START> add paulie the parrot to beloved movie animal characters this movie is a love story bird and gena rowlands bird and beloved marie michael and marie a russian janitor helps a talking and thinking parrot find his <UNK> owner many years after <UNK> parents sell him to a <UNK> shop before the heart warming ending we learn all the <UNK> of paulie cheech <UNK> and his dancing <UNK> are marvelous beautiful photography throughout great little movie word of mouth will make it a cult favorite
<START> i first saw the film when it landed on us cable a year after it came out it blew my little head away i was only 16 and it was the first new wave music i'd heard having been a strictly <UNK> classical kid growing up the music <UNK> me as did <UNK> <UNK> amazing look and charismatic vocal performances and phil <UNK> tough but soft cockney manager just stole my heart but i think my favorite character was jonathan <UNK> drugged out <UNK> player he was so out of place in the band and so harmless and pathetic he just <UNK> for sympathy favorite scenes the performance when the lights went out and the love scene on the train br br okay so the movie isn't the rose but it was really excellent for its limited budget and for its portrayal of the britain of the early 80's exploding with rebellious youth looking for a way out of the <UNK> <UNK> i went to britain only a couple of years later and found the movie to have been very <UNK> of the atmosphere i found when i was there br br if you get a chance to see it it is a great movie with some wonderful performances and the music will blow you away br br
<START> this is one of the greatest 80s movies it sticks out like a turd in a <UNK> i can't believe mad magazine <UNK> it or whatever and yet they proudly put their name on a show with stuart i speak a no <UNK> chinese lady and ups guy on speed what's up with that and i love ron <UNK> he's <UNK> wonder why he had his name removed from the credits it was his funniest role that i know of of course he's not nearly as <UNK> as he was in norma <UNK> but in my opinion this movie is right up there with national <UNK> vacation if you liked movies such as <UNK> fast times last american virgin or any of the other 80s teen focused movies you'll love this one rent it and you'll see what i mean
<START> the story idea is excellent unfortunately the execution lets it down br br the movie lacks pace for one thing it should be an exciting ride but it is slow and more than a little boring br br i think the <UNK> mainly in the screenplay and editing there aren't enough obstacles and <UNK> to <UNK> up suspense and there are scenes which don't really move the story along very effectively br br the producers should have seen this in the screenplay and insisted upon a major rewrite unfortunately when the producer is also the writer and the director this evidently ain't gonna happen br br much of the acting seems kind of flat and that is down to the director all the actors have been quite competent in other projects br br it's a shame because with better writing editing and direction this could have been a really good thriller

<START> not that i was really surprised movies are never as good as the books that they <UNK> from i was looking forward to seeing this movie because this is one of my favorite books even though i knew it would probably suck i was hoping to be pleasantly surprised however they <UNK> from the <UNK> storyline too much and the movie version did not convey how horrible this house really was ending was different too lara flynn boyle looked terrible due to some really bad <UNK> surgery the acting was <UNK> at best perhaps if a theatrical version was made so that they wouldn't have to stay so much in <UNK> made for tv movie box it would be a better flick if you saw this movie i highly encourage you to track down the book and read it i doubt you'll be disappointed and hope you enjoy it as much as i do every time i read it
<START> i got this in the dvd 10 pack curse of the dead you gotta love those bargain packs for even if they don't feature true <UNK> <UNK> and all that <UNK> ha and the films are generally in full frame pan and <UNK> format there's no denying that there are always a few gems included and by gems i mean there's always some good crap to be seen especially if the films are from the '70s as the mansion of madness is br br my copy is called mansion of madness but when the title screens roll it's <UNK> dr <UNK> torture <UNK> doesn't matter really as crap is crap is crap no yes but saying this film is completely worthless is not true at all there are some funky elements here and there and obviously the flick did have a decent budget br br the opening title sequence is cool with its colored negative run through a cheap tv look the dialogue is always hilarious near the beginning of the film the horse and <UNK> driver gets out to move a dead tree <UNK> in the middle of the road what strength says our hero funny then that this dude should later not be able to fight off the wacky <UNK> when they come to make freaky fun you'll completely forget that this guy was even in the movie until he <UNK> up again later near the end that's how memorable these characters are br br the best part about mansion of madness however has to be the wacky music and screwball <UNK> that the good guys have to endure it's like bad cartoon music that a three year old would find enjoyable and why all the weirdo slapstick anyway i'd say my <UNK> moment had to be when the horse and <UNK> is <UNK> by the forest freaks when they pull a stupid looking <UNK> ghost up by a stick in the middle of the road and make the <UNK> stop what the hell oh yeah there's plenty of <UNK> to be seen too for those of you that dig such things <UNK> bad dialogue and wacky music that best sums of mansion of madness for me it's well worth at least one viewing and may be a lot better if you've had a few to drink or <UNK> i can't say i was ever bored watching it but i can't deny that it's also a barrel of <UNK> kinda like magical mystery tour but with a plot but not hmm br br and mr chicken <UNK>
<START> mysterious murders in a european village seem the result of the vampire bat <UNK> <UNK> the terrified community br br this surprisingly effective little thriller was created by <UNK> pictures one of hollywood's poverty row studios the sparse production values and rough editing actually add to its eerie atmosphere and lend it an almost <UNK> quality overall it leaves the viewer the feeling of being caught up in a bad dream which is appropriate for a thriller of this sort br br even though the eventual explanation for the hideous crimes is quite ludicrous and is not given proper plot development the film can <UNK> of a good cast grave lionel <UNK> gives another one of his typically fine performances this time as a doctor doing scientific research in an old castle beautiful fay <UNK> plays his assistant in a role which requires her to do little more than look lovely <UNK> <UNK> melvyn douglas appears as the <UNK> police inspector who also happens to be conveniently miss <UNK> boyfriend br br <UNK> <UNK> who could be extremely funny given the right situation steals most of her scenes as miss <UNK> <UNK> aunt elderly lionel <UNK> plays the <UNK> terrified <UNK> and little dwight frye who will always be remembered for his weird roles in the frankenstein and dracula films here is most effective as a bat loving lunatic
<START> antwone fisher is the story of a young emotionally troubled u s navy <UNK> his problems lead him to <UNK> <UNK> a psychiatrist who helps him realize that his troubles <UNK> from his childhood upbringing br br get ready to shed a tear or two the movie could <UNK> the <UNK> heart i loved the story which turns from something so very awful to happen to anyone into a positive ending antwone fisher is a powerful movie most importantly about forgiveness other important issues that get you thinking are child abuse <UNK> and foster care br br oscar winner denzel washington does an impressive job in his directorial debut there were many scenes which i enjoyed watching they included the beginning dreams of a little boy  check out the gigantic sized <UNK> and the ending dreams turned into reality which beautifully tied the story together br br another wonderful scene occurred when the doctor encouraged antwone to search for his family to find answers to his questions about his family that abandoned him br br my favorite scene happened when the young man finally confronted his mother and her reaction towards him priceless br br all the actors represented their parts well br br in addition to directorial <UNK> mr washington continues to show why he won an oscar award and is successful in all his acting roles he had a strong presence in this movie br br actor derek luke demonstrated why he was so right for the part of antwone fisher he portrayed very real and heart <UNK> work br br joy <UNK> who played the part of <UNK> <UNK> love interest <UNK> a ray of sunshine on the screen the chemistry <UNK> well between the romantic characters br br <UNK> nelson who played the part of mrs <UNK> a despicable character deserves special mention br br although we only see her for a few minutes the actress who played <UNK> mother gave an outstanding performance br br everyone should see antwone fisher
<START> the original les <UNK> was original hilarious interesting balanced and near perfect <UNK> must be a candidate for worst first sequel to a really good film in <UNK> everyone keeps shouting when a gag doesn't work first it's repeated another 5 times with some vague hope that it will eventually become funny <UNK> is a horrible parody of <UNK> except of course that a parody should be inventive if you loved <UNK> just don't see this film just see <UNK> again
<START> i saw this movie when i was 13 and i really liked dana <UNK> who later starred in different <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> i don't think it's garbage it was not meant to be a sequel to the documentary either its just a cute kids movie about 3 children who go after men trying to find the <UNK> creek monster the men get hurt and the kids rescue them with the help of the creature haunting shots of the <UNK> swamp and scenery were neat this is a good movie for kids no real violence a few mild scares but good fun for the young kids
<START> there are so many reasons as to why i rate the sopranos so highly one of its biggest <UNK> being the cast and character building each character unfolds more and more each series also each series has an array of different <UNK> time characters' as well as the main a good example of a character who was only in three episodes who you can feel for is david the <UNK> <UNK> played brilliantly by robert patrick every little detail builds the perfect tv series the show revolves round mob boss tony soprano james gandolfini who attempts to balance his life of crime with his role as father of two the show is not afraid to be bold and powerful with its dialogue and imagery and this is what makes it so believable whilst tony runs things with <UNK> paulie tony <UNK> and <UNK> steve van <UNK> his nephew christopher michael <UNK> looks for a promotion every episode also features tony's other family in some way which includes his children and wife <UNK> soprano edie <UNK> on top of these problems is his uncle junior soprano dominic <UNK> is trying to get what he can out of tony's <UNK> despite being under house arrest all the acting is powerful and characters complex but the two who stand out the most are james gandolfini who <UNK> tony soprano also michael <UNK> who plays christopher representing the younger 20 30 generation in crime if david chase had not created this masterpiece modern tv dramas of such caliber may not have existed such as the wire and <UNK> so the sopranos is definitely the godfather <UNK> and pulp fiction of tv
<START> i was impressed by the beautiful photography in this film which was shot on location in <UNK> although technically a melodrama we see lots of activities <UNK> are involved in such as hunting dancing building <UNK> etc and their customs such as offering their wives to <UNK> are <UNK> in the story the hunting sequences were sometimes from stock footage as it was easy to recognize some rear projection scenes of animals but even these were fascinating <UNK> fishing for <UNK> hunting for <UNK> <UNK> and even a polar bear and a whale made it seem like a documentary at times there was no cast listing which <UNK> the documentary flavor the film makers tried to make it seem very authentic with the natives speaking only in an <UNK> language that was either translated by someone on screen or by <UNK> the introduction stated that except for the white <UNK> and the royal <UNK> canadian police there were no actors in the film but this was not strictly true the two leading characters played by <UNK> and <UNK> long were <UNK> by birth but were professional actors with credits for earlier films and you could see sometimes they had makeup on but they were excellent in their roles and they went on to have hollywood careers all in all the film is definitely worth a look
<START> i saw it at the legacy theater in the joseph smith <UNK> building in salt lake city this morning i'm going to assume that one's level of enjoyment during this movie will largely be based on one's level of acceptance of <UNK> story br br however that aside it was very well made well acted and had a nice score if you get to salt lake city it is a must to see it in the legacy theater i have never been in a <UNK> theater as far as picture quality sound quality and ambiance in my entire life i wonder if the church would let me watch batman begins there being that i'm lds and regard joseph as a prophet i was touched in several places and was brought to tears quite a few times which i presume is expected since they handed out <UNK> before the movie started anyway i'm told that this film is available in several lds visitor centers around the globe if you have 70 minutes check it out because whether you believe joseph smith or not he tells a fascinating story
<START> <UNK> macdonald and nelson eddy star in this modern musical that showcases <UNK> comic abilities surreal 40s musical seem to be making fun of 40s fashions even as they were in current <UNK> eye popping costumes and sets yes b w add to the surreal <UNK> quality of the entire film several good songs <UNK> the film with the <UNK> in your eye number a total highlight including a fun <UNK> number between macdonald and <UNK> barnes also in the huge cast are edward everett <UNK> <UNK> owen <UNK> <UNK> douglas <UNK> and anne <UNK> also to been seen in extended bit parts are esther <UNK> <UNK> sessions grace <UNK> <UNK> hoffman <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cecil cunningham and many others br br great fun and nice to see the wonderful macdonald in her <UNK> <UNK> routines she could do it all
<START> occasionally one is served a new <UNK> from foreign films that is their great attraction they take from life and serve it up raw american films rarely dare to touch the forbidden subjects of society too many hang ups and a morbid fear of financial failure the almighty dollar <UNK> their <UNK> something which invites european directors in addition audiences world wide remain hungry for different films especially those which offer a <UNK> bite out of the wretched suffering body of humanity despite the fear of directors or producers many audiences <UNK> for beauty poetry and the <UNK> flavor of life that is what the film to the left of the father offers to curious audiences a family locked in the belief that <UNK> of family <UNK> from the <UNK> of it's <UNK> to tradition yet when the <UNK> of a family forgets it's members are flesh and blood humans filled with raging <UNK> dreams and dark passions then the two are set in motions against itself <UNK> <UNK> plays <UNK> a son who seeks to control his inner passions with the <UNK> philosophy of his father <UNK> cortez plays his father <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> a young woman who seeks to <UNK> a forbidden <UNK> from the family waters <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> the elder brother the film offers much but does takes an extremely <UNK> amount of time to say it
<START> to be as honest as i possibly can the devil's <UNK> or <UNK> of blood or vampire ecstasy or the curse of the black sisters <UNK> is a complete bore the movie has a good premise behind it  the <UNK> of a long dead vampire through the body of a <UNK> through the aid and assistance of a group of women dressed in black  but the execution is horrible there are great long moments of screen time when literally nothing happens characters just stand around with nothing to do there's no mystery no suspense and no plot points to care about the acting is simply abysmal most of the acting involves a group of below average looking women dancing naked while staring at the camera they do this repeatedly and what little plot there is seems to be designed to get more of these less than attractive women naked so they can join in the dancing while it's not as bad or pointless as the dancing or the plot in something like orgy of the dead it comes close
<START> creep is the story of kate <UNK> an intensely unlikeable <UNK> bitch that finds herself somehow sleeping through the noise of the last underground train and waking up to find herself locked in the tube station after somehow meeting <UNK> and would be rapist guy on a mystery train that runs after the lines have closed things go awry and she finds herself pursued by what <UNK> beneath the city's streets her story is linked to that of george <UNK> an ex con working in the <UNK> system they meet in the final third of the film brought together by their attempts to escape the monster that <UNK> them br br the pair proceed through a set of increasingly unlikely locations from the tube station they end up in the <UNK> works before somehow finding themselves in some sort of abandoned underground surgery most tube stations don't have <UNK> so how one has a surgery is beyond me naturally the film cares to explain that the surgery doesn't have running water yet it has electricity just one of many inconsistencies that work against the atmosphere of everyday believability that the film tries to create br br the monster itself is a problem there's a complete lack of reasoning for its actions it just kills people for no obvious reason and then of course it keeps some alive for no real reason either perhaps just so that they can eventually escape and give the film an extra 15 minutes or so running time i understand that natural evil is supposed to be scary but then the film attempts to explain itself via a photo of a doctor and his son and a few shots of some <UNK> containing babies and yes it is just as tired and pathetic as it sounds it also fails to explain how the creature has been underground long enough to lose the ability to speak <UNK> only in <UNK> screams but not long enough for its pair of shorts to <UNK> hmm br br this doctor business leads to scene that is the film's desperate attempt to <UNK> itself on your memory and while it is gory and uncomfortable to watch it just isn't enough the final third of the film <UNK> on an emotional relationship that never existed and the characters break down and recover for little or no obvious reason george breaks down unable to cope with something despite stating that he wants to escape so he can see his daughter again and kate becomes emotionally tough seconds after going to pieces over someone that ripped her off for a <UNK> yeah br br after starting out as a this could happen to anyone movie it quickly falls apart as it introduces ideas that make it more and more unrealistic a complete lack of emotional interest in the characters and an absence of suspense make this one to avoid
<START> the story of a woman from nowhere is rather simple and pretty much adapted right out of a eastwood spaghetti western a mysterious stranger comes into a <UNK> town run by a <UNK> and starts shooting up the place even the opening credits and music have that spaghetti feel sergio <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> would be proud the really interesting twists are that the stranger is a beautiful woman <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on a <UNK> and the location is in a town somewhere in japan br br in this <UNK> there's a considerable amount of <UNK> some of it good some predictable and other spots somewhat hokey but it's a whole lot of fun <UNK> handles her guns with believability and <UNK> and gives the thugs their due it wasn't much of an acting challenge for her as it was a physical challenge but she handled things very well she shows her acting skills much more as <UNK> in the <UNK> drama <UNK> br br i'd highly recommend film if you're a <UNK> <UNK> fan which i <UNK> am and or a girls with guns movie fan and it does hold up to repeated viewings to me there's something <UNK> and inexplicably appealing about girls with guns movies like la femme <UNK> and the long kiss <UNK> and to have a gorgeous gal like <UNK> starring in it as well is just <UNK> of <UNK> on the cake
<START> witty and disgusting <UNK> and intelligent baseketball <UNK> comedy sports with a pot spoof of an easy target makes other so called comedies like dead boring one of the best of all time <UNK> parker and matt stone play their roles as losers with apt perfection
<START> i wanted to watch this movie but one bizarre ridiculous scene after another forced me to shut it off character's don't seem to react to anything consider this heath ledger is walking a night through a cemetery i believe when he is attacked by spirits which he drives away once past this ordeal he <UNK> walks away and meets up with a friend that saw it all when asked what happen he says <UNK> attacked by demons nothing serious as if this is only a little more exciting than a flat tire br br i shut it off when they go to ask something a demon or something i stopped caring a <UNK> <UNK> the answer can only be rented out of someone with the energy of their death and the priest watch in what appears to be vague annoyance as a man is strung up and hung and they ask his <UNK> dying body question br br 0 out of stars
<START> cameron grant is one of the best directors doing adult films his only rival is andrew blake <UNK> is dynamite all thru the movie but the <UNK> office sequence with her two other ladies is just incredible nearly as good is asia <UNK> performance with the construction worker i highly recommend this movie gave it a 9 it's almost as good as cameron <UNK> elements of desire which i gave a 10
<START> 'the hills eyes <UNK> one of the most pointless and blatantly stupid sequels to come around in some time is 90 minutes of incompetent film making at its finest or worst however you choose to look at it while <UNK> <UNK> remake was one of the year's best and truly frightening horror films this sequel takes every spark out of what made that such an accomplishment part 2 never gets off the ground and neither does its mind numbing dialogue worst of all it's not that scary br br <UNK> remake followed a family who find themselves in the middle of the new mexico desert deserted and one by one being picked off by deranged and sadistic hill people people who as a result of the military testing the atomic bomb on their land years ago have become who they are surviving off <UNK> who wander into the region the sequel puts audiences in the same desert now occupied by the military as they <UNK> investigate the hills and what might have happened to that poor family when a group of military <UNK> are brought to the <UNK> they find it deserted with no signs of life a grim reality soon <UNK> them as they come to the realization that they're not alone and the bloody fate that was handed to many before them will soon become their destiny br br it doesn't take a genius to realize that <UNK> has no legitimate reason to exist but because last year's remake was received well both at the box office and by critics it came to no surprise that a sequel would be rushed into production while there's still money to be earned there's no rhyme or reason to it this time around just an unbelievable and ridiculous set up to <UNK> the way for <UNK> characters unoriginal killings a non existent story and <UNK> interest originally director alexander <UNK> made craven's cult classic into a remake that was a unique and thoroughly disturbing experience one that <UNK> crossed the line on more than one occasions its frank display of violence sadistic torture well rounded characterization and white <UNK> suspense were all effectively used to shock and <UNK> audiences the second time around it's <UNK> hand me downs there's no style no <UNK> it tries to build up tension by <UNK> bodies when all it really does is make for a been there done that kind film where even the gore seems tame compared to more recent <UNK> br br it's a sad state of affairs when <UNK> mutants who capture women for <UNK> purposes fails to keep your attention it's a bore nothing more <UNK> has no bite despite a jump or two here and there there's nothing very scary about this by the numbers horror flick it feels like something you'd see on the sci fi channel only with some f bombs a blood splatter here and there a rape and a graphic birth scene that's more gross than shocking it's cheap and with <UNK> you <UNK> what you <UNK> with no effort given you can't expect anything in return br br replacing <UNK> with martin <UNK> as director was the film's first big mistake all he does is drain the film of any sort of emotional <UNK> but even more shocking is the <UNK> bad script penned by wes craven and his son jonathan craven you ask how bad could it possibly be this is the kind of dialogue that makes any comparison look like shakespeare craven has had his fair share of <UNK> in the past but i'd never expect something like this from him it's so unintentionally funny you have to wonder is craven playing a joke on this or did he dump this one on his son after the studio <UNK> him off the film's characters are one dimensional talking heads with no emotions or common sense the acting is just as bad the only character who may win you over is <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> kid who doesn't fit in with the others even the deranged and instinct driven villains who we might have found some favor with in the deepest of our thoughts a year ago are met with indifferent you don't hate them you don't like them you honestly couldn't care less just like this movie br br even if you were <UNK> with fear during 'the hills have <UNK> as i was you'll have a tough time finding anything to enjoy in this piece of garbage it's as generic as generic gets and there's absolutely nothing here we haven't seen done many times already i can't express this enough avoid 'the hills have eyes <UNK> like the plague it's <UNK> unoriginal frantic and a bore stick to the remake or craven's original vision because if you don't walk out after the first thirty minutes don't say i didn't warn you
<START> in this <UNK> bruce is still called billy lo get it bruce billy lo lee no but apart from that that's all it has in common with the other movie billy doesn't seem to be an actor anymore he seems to be in another country he's more like a spy he's the only cast member to return and sadly they kill him off to make way for a new character his brother bobby sadly when bruce dies the movie pretty much dies with him this was extremely poorly made it seemed like they were writing the script as they were filming the footage works for a while it's not too obvious at first but soon bruce is always shown in the dark all the time he kicks out a light at one stage for no other apparent reason to hide the fact that it's not bruce playing the part sadly when he dies the movie changes i can't help but wonder if they were filming as they were writing and may well have planned to keep bruce alive but later decided to kill him off because it would not have been plausible as bobby does not appear until billy is dead it's hard to change the lead character halfway in the movie and bruce is a hard act to follow so it's hard to now accept bobby as the star bruce is never seen again in this movie i think they should have made this sequel without bruce he has a lame role in this movie people hoping to see a new bruce lee movie will be disappointed to see that although he's given the top billing he only has a featuring role even the worst movies have at least one memorable bit if there was one bit about this movie people seem to talk about it's the scene where billy fights in a plant <UNK> ironically it doesn't even use bruce lee footage mind you they did it more convincingly in no <UNK> no surrender not one of the other actors here ever made anything else memorable <UNK> girlfriend <UNK> camp is never mentioned my advice is to turn it off as soon as bruce is finished writing his letter to his brother nothing else in the movie is worth watching i found it really sad to see bruce die i don't see how a small budgeted movie like this could get enough money to use footage from enter the dragon this was a cheap way of trying to cash in on <UNK> name oddly this and the original are credited in <UNK> filmography thankfully so far no one has tried anything like this again 1981 was the year of <UNK> last movie appearance it was a sad way to end it but thankfully this is proof that <UNK> movie career should be left alone
<START> darius goes west is an amazing documentary about a teenager <UNK> with <UNK> muscular <UNK> and his 11 friends who take him on a cross country trip to see if <UNK> my ride will <UNK> out his wheelchair br br i recently watched this movie at the <UNK> film festival it played twice over the course of the festival this movie is an amazing story about the human spirit and the spirit of <UNK> friends i do not say this often about movies but after watching this movie i feel moved to do something towards the cause every festival this movie has taken part in this movie has won an award of some kind it is in the <UNK> film festival and it is going to london and <UNK> <UNK> i would not be surprised if this movie went all the way to the academy awards it is <UNK> out of control if anyone has a chance to see this movie wherever it is playing go take as many people as possible and go it is heading to new orleans for a film festival then on to <UNK> and palm beach <UNK> darius is from georgia so i expect the tickets for the <UNK> showing will be sold out quickly if they are not already please go see this movie <UNK> talk about it br br <UNK>
<START> last november i had a chance to see this film at the reno film festival i have to say that it was a lot of fun a few tech errors aside it was a great experience i loved the writing and acting especially from the guy that played the lead role there is a lot of heart in this movie a lot of wit to i got a chance to speak with a few of the filmmakers after it was done and they seemed real nice all in all the whole movie was just a positive experience and one i'd definitely recommend the story was entertaining and cool as a woman i've been through a lot of the same problems as the lead guy and i could really understand his problems because of it the movie does a great job of giving us people we can sympathize with the friends in the movie are really well written to they are realistic i know people like these i only wish <UNK> friends and i could sound as cool as these people when we talk the whole movie is just real cool i wish there were more films out there like it br br <UNK>
<START> if ever i was asked to remember a song from a film of <UNK> years then it would have to be <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for its meaning the way it is sung by <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the lyrics by <UNK> <UNK> and not to mention the cinema photography when the <UNK> boat goes out against the black background and the shining stars the other would have to be <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> <UNK> last film before she died and the amount of it time it took can be seen on the screen in each of the the songs that are <UNK> she looks young but after that she does not but one actor who didn't change in his looks was the late raj kumar who falls in love with her and especially her feet after he accidentally goes into her train cabin and upon seeing them he leaves a note describing how beautiful they are br br conclusion <UNK> is a beautiful romantic story that if at all possible should be viewed on large screen just for the sake of the cinema photography and songs the movie stars the <UNK> <UNK> raj kumar and <UNK> kumar and is directed by kamal <UNK> br br kamal <UNK> <UNK> has now started to revive his grand father's studio by making a comedy movie
<START> this is a good film for 99 of the duration i feel that the ending has <UNK> this film from higher acclaim br br it is shot in a rather naive fashion this is clearly done to create a more chilling feel to the film a feeling of isolation becomes apparent very soon on due to this filming technique br br the gruesome characters are very well acted and presented especially the <UNK> called joe however the wholesome normal characters are a little too pathetic for my liking granted they are supposed to come across as pathetic but this is done a little <UNK> br br the film starts slowly and the naive camera work <UNK> of <UNK> movie to start with and very normally but you soon get a feel of the impending brutality that is about to occur this is one of the most <UNK> movies with respect to cold hearted violence br br after the abrupt and unbelievably lazy ending i was left feeling disappointed i would have given the film a 9 if the ending was in keeping with the rest of the film but as it is it gets only a 7 on the strength of the <UNK> and nail biting scenes earlier on in the film br br give it a watch and excuse the ending
<START> saving grace is a feel good movie with it's heart in the right place grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of <UNK> she could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana she's living in a beautiful village where most viewers would love to live and the villagers are all wonderful people most viewers would love to have as neighbors there's only one thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it <UNK> the effect marijuana has on it's user it's obvious none of the actors or writers of this film actually ever did smoke the stuff the way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny it's precisely in those scenes that wit is replaced by english slapstick and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less very enjoyable
<START> this movie didn't really surprise me as such it just got better and better i thought paul <UNK> wrote this huh well we'll see how he does then i saw peter falk was in it i appreciate <UNK> even though i was never a big fan of the show i've always liked watching peter falk br br the performances of peter and paul were so natural that i felt like a fly on the wall they played off of each other so well that i practically felt <UNK> with enjoyment and i hadn't even been drinking br br this movie was so well done that i wanted to get right on the phone to paul and let him know how much i enjoyed it but i couldn't find his number must be <UNK> or something br br this was one of those movies that i had no idea what it was going to be about or who was in it or anything it just came on and i thought eh why not let's see if i don't like it i don't have to watch it and i ended up just loving it
<START> i just saw this recently after an <UNK> of nearly forty years it holds up well especially lionel <UNK> outstanding songs who will buy with it's magical <UNK> just one of many <UNK> br br i disagree with the other post that <UNK> its g rating the ratings system brand new at the time never intended the g general rating to mean completely devoid of conflict br br <UNK> it as <UNK> for kids reminds me of the description i once saw of the wizard of oz a girl arrives in a strange land and kills the first person she encounters she then goes on a road trip with three male companions and kills again
<START> when i was at the movie store the other day i passed up blonde and <UNK> but something about it just seemed like it could possibly be a cute movie who knows i mean i'm sure most people <UNK> <UNK> and michelle before they saw it blonde and <UNK> might have just been another secret treasure that was passed up but when i started watching it executive producer pamela anderson wow i knew i was in for something scary not only that but both of what were considered the <UNK> of <UNK> pam anderson and denise richards not to offend them but they were not aging well at all and they're playing roles that i think were more meant for women who are supposed to be in their <UNK> not their 40's the story was just plain bad and obnoxious br br dee and dawn are your beyond stupid stereotypical <UNK> they really don't have a clue when it comes to what is going on in the world it's just really sad but when the girls are somehow mistaken for murder <UNK> the cops are on their tale and are actually calling the girls geniuses due to their ignorance is bliss attitudes they are set up to make a hit on a guy and they think they're just going to show him a good time but the real assassin is <UNK> and wants the case and to kill the girls br br denise and pam just look very awkward on the screen and almost like they read the script the day before i know that this was supposed to be the stupid comedy but it was more than stupid it went onto obnoxious and was just unnecessary would i ever recommend this not in a million years the girls are just at this point trying to maintain their status as sex <UNK> it's more a sign of desperation and blonde and <UNK> is a huge blonde <UNK> br br 1 10
<START> <UNK> this movie sucked a lot br br i have been reading some of the other reviews apparently there are a lot of people that think that anything woody allen writes or stars in is automatically good br br i have watched several of his films in the vain hope that i'm missing something but no they just suck poorly written trash the characters are all very stereotypical not to mention rather stupid the plot is i think it is supposed to be mysterious not sure on that mr allen's character is woody allen on any other film you have seen of his br br if you are a fan of woody allen go see this film if you are under 50 don't bother if you are a fan of woody allen and you are under 50 well you are <UNK> i don't know what to say
<START> i saw this film at the ny gay lesbian film festival and thought it was pretty bad first and most distracting was the way much of it was shot that is a lot of slow motion and overly arty close ups that seemed to have no point story wise or <UNK> other than to show the skills of the cinematographer who i believe was also the director this film seemed what a pretentious film student would come up with the lead actor sam <UNK> was certainly very cute but was a mediocre actor at best and the rest of the cast <UNK> from so so to bad the story itself was mostly annoyingly predictable i do have to <UNK> that most of the audience seemed to enjoy the film laughing and <UNK> constantly but i disliked it a great deal
<START> this is a <UNK> story on the lindy chamberlain case and a look at it's impact on australian society it especially looks at the problem of innuendo <UNK> and expectation when dealing with real life dramas br br one issue the story deals with is the way it is expected people will all give the same emotional response to similar situations not everyone goes into wild melodramatic <UNK> to every major crisis just because the characters in the movies and on tv act in a certain way is no reason to expect real people to do so this is especially apt for <UNK> and news <UNK> who appear to be looking for the the big <UNK> scene that will pull the ratings it's an issue that has to be constantly addressed br br the leads play the characters with depth personality and sensitivity and they are <UNK> supported by a large cast all playing based on fact individuals some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the supporting cast in this story are people better known in australia as comic actors it re <UNK> my idea that comic actors make some of the best supports in dramas because with comedy they know how to establish quick impressions of individuals br br spoiler warning br br i have to say something very personal here in that i am actually an ex <UNK> who was a practicing member in australia at the time this incident occurred so i have a slightly different impression of the story than most i think it is handled with amazing creativity and personality and emotional heart i think the best scene is the one where the couple are <UNK> by the new <UNK> it captured the themes of the story brilliantly br br i once heard fred <UNK> say in an interview that he told the actors to play the best case for their character they could while this is especially apt for this story i think it is also a general principle that should apply to all acting as well
<START> when <UNK> husband to be is murdered on the eve of their wedding she <UNK> to a mountain <UNK> where she slips sort of off a cliff and is rescued by wealthy attorney morgan morgan falls in love with her leading to a definitely one sided marriage spent on a huge estate in chicago which appears to be surrounded by mountains stanwyck is tempted by dashing cortez but eventually returns to morgan in a very subdued and unconvincing story resolution br br this film has a great cast morgan in particular is one of my favorites and a great director but the script is meandering and seems pointless at times i was so ready to enjoy this movie but i was ultimately disappointed still worth watching for the cast and it's good for anyone who likes 1930s films
<START> just got back from a free screening and i'm very glad i didn't pay to see this very sub par film the theater was full and the crowd was a mix of kids and adults it seemed like it was just the kids who were laughing at all the slap stick and fart jokes though good god they loved to hit these poor mice in the <UNK> a lot the movie is pretty juvenile <UNK> predictable and mostly annoying the characters just seem to be thrown together to fill in empty space and the relationships between them all seemed very forced with no charm at all br br visually the film is about average with nothing that really stands out they did a decent job of <UNK> the clay look from wallace and <UNK> but other than that it's very forgettable imagery br br although i was really bored throughout the whole film i <UNK> a couple times it's not an absolute failure but i most definitely would not want to watch it again if you're a parent with kids and you don't care that your kids see mindless cheap jokes then feel free to take them to see it but everyone else shouldn't waste their money
<START> wow a movie about nyc politics seemingly written by someone who has never set foot in nyc you know there's a problem when at one moment you expect the credits to roll and the movie continues on for another half hour the characters are boring john <UNK> accent is laughable and the <UNK> <UNK> between boring and laughable a horrible movie
<START> finally got to see this classic tv movie on an <UNK> disc recorded from an old vhs it is a classic piece of horror its a pity more of this neglected corner of horror in terms of official releases on dvd and vhs the tv horror movie recommended for all fans of the 70's tv movie much like trilogy of terror those interested should get the book on the subject by david deal television fright films of the 70's email me for a chance to see it its fabulous to see it again br br it does have it problems like many tv movies they have to be rather inventive in the effects <UNK> and even at 70 mins it can seem to drag possibly we are all used to more modern editing but still great stuff and far better than many theatrical <UNK> released today
<START> bollywood fans pretty much hold amitabh <UNK> <UNK> in high regard but i think it is very overrated <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> before on movies like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> anthony <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and i have seen all of them i liked so i had very high expectations before i watched <UNK> and was <UNK> disappointed my main <UNK> about <UNK> is that it feels like <UNK> <UNK> anthony part 2 maybe mr <UNK> ran out of ideas after all he had been using that formula for years and years 1 first of all some members of the cast is repeated from <UNK> for instance the police inspector who brings up <UNK> the muslim who brings up <UNK> <UNK> roy and a few more 2 in <UNK> <UNK> roy loses her <UNK> in <UNK> she loses her voice 3 in <UNK> there is the famous song <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> well in <UNK> we have amitabh singing <UNK> <UNK> having seen <UNK> for over 1000 times i noticed that straight away br br my other <UNK> are that some of the situations just seem ridiculous true <UNK> <UNK> made leave your brain at the door kind of movies but with <UNK> i thought he went too far my last <UNK> is that compared to songs in previous <UNK> <UNK> movies i found the songs rather disappointing i know it has many fans that swear by it but i didn't like it one bit it actually pains me to write this review because i am such a huge fan and have loved his movies since i was a child
<START> i don't recall walking out of a movie theater except this once not only that but i was with 7 friends and we all wanted to go an uninteresting plot characters made of clay violence with no point i didn't care when the good guys died i didn't care when the bad guys got it the fantasy and magic was laid on thick as <UNK> <UNK> and there was no <UNK> in short fine entertainment if you happen to be spending an eternity in hell
<START> ripping this movie apart is like shooting fish in a barrel it's too easy so i'm going to challenge myself to acknowledge the positive aspects of little man first i'm impressed with the special effects it really did look like marlon <UNK> head was attached to the body of a little person i never <UNK> it for a minute br br secondly i loved some of the unexpected cameos david alan <UNK> played an annoying restaurant singer and his <UNK> of <UNK> my baby and <UNK> on up were priceless john <UNK> who <UNK> played <UNK> father in <UNK> <UNK> if you remember he <UNK> the <UNK> belt with the <UNK> jacket now plays <UNK> father in little man so that was fun br br beyond that this movie is about as believable as white chicks how dumb is it when even the doctor can't tell that it's a 40 year old man and not a baby he's got a full set of teeth how is it possible that no one seems to notice that it's not a baby little man is so bad that there's a rob schneider cameo and please if you're stupid enough to waste 8 on this movie at least do me a favor and do not bring your children this movie is way too sexual for small children lots of jokes and innuendo about sex going down eating out etc and i felt embarrassed for the parents who brought their kids to the screening i was forced to endure if you insist on seeing an idiotic film as least spare your children the pain and suffering
<START> this animation tv series is simply the best way for children to learn how the human body works yes this is <UNK> but they will never tell it is br br i truly think this is the best part of this stream of educational cartoons i do remember you can find little books and a plastic body in several parts skin <UNK> and of course organs br br in the same stream you'll find <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which relate the human history from the big bang to the 20th century there is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as well about the space and its exploration but that one is more a fiction than a description of the reality since it takes place in the future
<START> while i count myself as a fan of the <UNK> 5 television series the original movie that introduced the series was a weak start although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there the pace of the gathering is slow the makeup somewhat <UNK> and the plot confusing worse the characterization in the premiere episode is poor although the ratings <UNK> shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems i remember the gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into a spectacular series
<START> a few years ago i bought several 1 dvd's that contained two movies each one of them had three broadway girls an alternate title for the <UNK> had a word for them and this one happy go lovely it's basically a <UNK> musical comedy that takes place in scotland and concerns mistaken identity involving one of the dancers <UNK> a ride from a <UNK> <UNK> vera ellen is that dancer and wow what legs <UNK> romero is her producer who takes a chance on her after the original leading lady leaves because he thinks she's dating the millionaire whose car i just mentioned and david niven is that rich guy who when looking for vera ellen is mistaken for a reporter who's supposed to interview her but gets <UNK> by romero what i've just mentioned may be confusing but mostly makes sense if you're willing to check your brain while watching this <UNK> screwball comedy with wonderful musical numbers as performed by the exquisite ms vera ellen romero can be a bit frantic here but niven becomes hilariously <UNK> throughout the print i saw was actually pretty good considering its age and the fact that it's in public <UNK> and vera ellen does pretty well with her lines since she's not really an actress so on that note i highly recommend happy go lovely for movie buffs who love old fashioned musical comedies
<START> the fourth in the dirty harry series this film features one of the most despicable <UNK> unlikable <UNK> disgusting females i have ever seen on film ray <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> she is the modern nasty low life version of the 1945 <UNK> character ann savage br br her foul mouth and <UNK> attitude turned me off so much i never watched this film again until i acquired a profanity <UNK> which shut her up and least some of her then i could enjoy the rest of the movie br br everywhere harry callahan clint eastwood goes violence immediately follows within minutes it happens so often it's almost laughable but it makes for a fast moving entertaining film with a satisfying ending as all the <UNK> villains are eliminated one by one br br this is a very <UNK> film that appeals to our base instincts and <UNK> sad to say most of us like to see these <UNK> get it in the end and who does it better than dirty harry
<START> this type of plot really does have a lot of potential but it was butchered here honestly i <UNK> the cheese element in the beginning but i thought it would get better after the grotesque <UNK> <UNK> i was wrong so mad scientist makes a monster wants to <UNK> to his old <UNK> before he kills them but of course they escape after that it's really bad i should've counted the times the rubber shark mask <UNK> out from behind some <UNK> but i most likely would have lost count br br pan down to the blood dripping from severed leg to show us how the shark man finds the folks i hate being <UNK> fed every aspect of a horror film br br oh and after being nearly killed by a mutated shark man and <UNK> around a jungle <UNK> island there's nothing more cheerful than a middle aged man <UNK> shakespeare br br this is one where you'll find yourself rooting for the monster if you can bear to watch this poor excuse for a flick
<START> why would anyone want to see this if this was a film posted on youtube by a teenager i might have <UNK> the teen in doing so much with his <UNK> video camera i might have also <UNK> his family and friends for doing a good job acting sadly it was made by a very experienced film maker and these were apparently professional actors making this a very very sad film sad and very pathetic actually as i said it has a definite made directly to video look about it it also has narration and acting that just scream <UNK> how could this be the film is filled with lots of corpses and blood normally this would turn me off completely as i hate ultra violent films and don't like seeing all that gore however given that none of it is that realistic it's bearable however i should warn you that there are a few scenes that are still pretty disturbing for example the scene with the kid throwing a radio into a <UNK> <UNK> and watching her naked and <UNK> is pretty bad there are also scenes where you can hear the thought of <UNK> as they <UNK> about killing women with a level of <UNK> that is pretty awful the people who wrote this are pretty sick like killing women is meant to be for our entertainment br br after a bunch of senseless murders the film goes to a <UNK> room table around which are a bunch of goof balls wearing black <UNK> without eye holes they are talking with pride about all the murders they have committed and <UNK> it's all very funny though i am not sure that was the <UNK> purpose br br then the film talks about various sex crimes and killings and even <UNK> and <UNK> why i don't know perhaps because they people made this got off on this sort of crap and once again you see and hear the thoughts and actions of a creepy german looking man as he tracks down people and kills them br br by the way considering the film used what i must assume are professional actors i wondered why so many people were chosen who were clearly germans while they tried to act like americans and the film was supposed to be in california the accents are strong perhaps german audiences watched this and <UNK> at how realistic the acting was but to any american it's obvious these folks ain't their fellow americans considering that there really was a zodiac killer who was never captured i do wonder why anyone would want to make a fan film of sorts for the sick menace i mean was this film meant as a snuff film for <UNK> i just can't see anyone else wanting to see this or enjoying it in fact i wonder what would <UNK> anyone to make such a stupid and offensive film worthless and deserving to be in <UNK> bottom 100 list
<START> it is an extremely difficult film to watch particularly as it targets the <UNK> core of all of our lives but ultimately it is a very beautiful and deeply moving film any person who finds it cynical i have to say that they must have greatly missed the point of the film's entire message for those who actually watch the film they will see that the way the issues are dealt with is absolutely necessary and the outcome is ultimately uplifting sure it's very hard to watch a difficult subject matter and even brutal yet it's extremely relevant to society and everybody it shows the peak of what world cinema is doing at the moment i will not <UNK> that term to just france and everyone should try to see it i will say that it is best to go in with a clear head without being <UNK> by <UNK> views and just let the film work for you
<START> the house that <UNK> blood is the third in a series of seven <UNK> horror <UNK> if the monster club is included as part of the series this would make eight movies although that movie is very different from the others br br i look upon the <UNK> <UNK> with great memories as i used to love them when i was in my teens my feelings for them today are just as strong br br i spent many years trying to track down this movie the <UNK> of the stories was so appealing that i went as far as paying a substantial amount for it when i eventually found a copy as great as though the movie is i did feel a sense of disappointment when i finally saw it it wasn't quite as good as i was led to believe whilst better than its two predecessors it's nowhere near as good as its four <UNK> as i shall demonstrate br br the <UNK> story sees john bennett as a police inspector tracking down a missing person who lives in a mysterious old house his journey begins at the local police station where he learns the stories of previous <UNK> the <UNK> story later sees him visiting the estate agent who sold the house whilst this <UNK> story seems <UNK> on paper it is flat and lifeless in practice and easily the weakest of any <UNK> anthology i couldn't help but get the feeling that john bennett is a poor man's version of donald <UNK> or ian <UNK> i would much rather have seen one of the two aforementioned actors in his role we could have even had both here one as the police inspector and another as the estate agent they could and i believe would have brought this weak element of the movie to life much better br br the movie contains four stories each of which focuses on an <UNK> of the house br br the first story sees <UNK> elliott as a writer of crime stories he is absorbed into an exciting story about a <UNK> even going as far as drawing a sketch to aid his writing soon after he begins seeing visions of his own creation some excellent direction by peter <UNK> particularly with the choice of camera angles helps to detract from the restrained script <UNK> performance is superb as the tormented writer and he also helps to elevate the story the story ends with a semi twist but i couldn't help get the sense of a script which didn't allow it to live up to its potential br br the second story sees peter cushing move into the house he is a lonely man who is still <UNK> for a beautiful young woman who once <UNK> him and who he keeps a picture of <UNK> performance really brings this emotionally moving story to life he is helped by the director who chooses to include <UNK> focus on <UNK> loneliness this is taken further with a great <UNK> scene that helps us to see inside <UNK> mind anyway cushing sees a figure at a nearby wax museum that looks just like his girl naturally his obsession grows but this seemingly romantic story has a disturbing twist at the end <UNK> <UNK> plays <UNK> rival but his performance is <UNK> overshadowed by the late great peter cushing br br the third story and easily the best sees christopher lee my favourite horror actor of all time move into the house with his daughter mr lee gives one his perfect ice cold performances here he shows no love or attention for his daughter at all he even brings in a school <UNK> to <UNK> her the <UNK> played by <UNK> dawn porter in another of her superb performances tries to find out what is wrong without giving too much away i can reveal that witchcraft plays a role christopher lee's presence is truly <UNK> in every scene he's in chloe <UNK> deserves special recognition for her <UNK> underrated performance as the little girl who is easily the <UNK> character in the whole movie the movie is worth seeing even for the sake of seeing just this one story br br the final story is played almost entirely for laughs but it certainly does entertain and that's what matters jon pertwee plays a horror movie actor who moves into the house he is very <UNK> at the approach his producers take to movies seeing everything as cheap and fake particularly the costumes so he decides to buy an authentic cloak for his latest vampire role geoffrey <UNK> has an excellent cameo as a dealer who sells pertwee an ancient cloak when pertwee puts the cloak on he starts developing <UNK> and basically <UNK> into a vampire <UNK> performance has to be seen to be believed it truly is hilarious ingrid pitt is also in this story but her talent is wasted in a role that should have been much larger br br the <UNK> story finishes with a loose connection to the final story this is particularly fitting since the inspector was looking for pertwee and naturally decides to visit the house the rest you'll be able to work out for yourself as weak as the <UNK> story is it does have a decent if somewhat unintentionally comical ending br br i'm convinced that the blame for the shortcomings in what should have been a truly magnificent movie doesn't lie with peter <UNK> the director who really does his best with what he's got i think the script was just too restrained and lacking the ambition that can be found in the four later movies br br overall the house that <UNK> blood despite its flaws is a must see for fans of the <UNK> <UNK> fans of other <UNK> movies or fans of <UNK> horror movies if my summary provides the movie with enough appeal in your eyes check it out you'll enjoy it
<START> hey now i can't claim to have seen all of the films of jesse jesus franco and there sure seem to be a lot of them but this is one of the better and <UNK> of the lot that i have seen i'd say most likely he was in his prime back in the late sixties early seventies and anything lately has been a bit too strange for me and it takes a lot for me to <UNK> that anyway this is like one big bad dream where parts of it seem to come true at various points this woman is an actress or something performs in some theater in berlin where acts of fake torture are performed for an <UNK> audience and she seems to have this problem with dreaming the catch to what's real and what's not in this movie is apparently the real stuff is in sharp focus and the dream stuff isn't she seems to exist in a state of <UNK> <UNK> i won't say this makes a whole lot of sense but it is pretty wild and weird and entertaining shots of berlin make it seem like a lonely and creepy place so that adds to the atmosphere the ending is extremely abrupt though the film just ends and the tape went black i guess no need to let you know it was over at that point my copy was from the anchor bay euro trash collection and i say give me more euro trash i can't get enough of that crap but it's good crap
<START> fever pitch is a sweet and charming addition to the small genre of sports romances as date movies or movies a son could be willing to go to with his mother though the guys in the audience got <UNK> restless during the romantic scenes br br i have lived through a <UNK> version of such a story as my first exposure to baseball was dating my husband the spring after the <UNK> first world series win and then i watched the <UNK> <UNK> their next one because i was the one still up in the wee hours with our two little sons who have grown up to teach me more about baseball through our local neighborhood national league <UNK> other heartbreaking failures to win it again and it was me who took our older son to his only <UNK> park game as i caught a bit of red sox fever as a graduate student in boston br br so compared to reality the script <UNK> creates two people with actual jobs it is particularly impressive that drew <UNK> character is a <UNK> <UNK> who has anti <UNK> skills though she pretty much only visits with her three bland girlfriends during gym <UNK> that allow for much <UNK> and the minor side stories with her parents don't completely work br br it is even set up <UNK> how she meets jimmy <UNK> <UNK> teacher and how she falls for his winter guy though it's surprising that his red sox <UNK> filled apartment didn't tip her off to his <UNK> and hyde summer guy their relationship crisis during the baseball season is also played out in a <UNK> grown up way from efforts at compromise to her frank challenges to him centered around that they are both facing thirty and single fallon surprisingly rises to his character's <UNK> emotional maturity br br while the ending borrows heavily from o henry the script writers did a <UNK> job of quickly <UNK> the <UNK> incredible 2004 season into a <UNK> story line with lots of <UNK> from the red sox organization for filming at the stadium br br the script goes out of its way to explain why fallon doesn't have a boston accent as an immigrant from new jersey but that doesn't explain why his <UNK> friends don't the most authentic sounding boston sounds come from most of his summer family of other season ticket <UNK> who kindly <UNK> the <UNK> of sox <UNK> to <UNK> barrymore and any such audience members br br the song selection includes many red sox <UNK> favorites from the opening notes of the classic dirty water though most are held to be heard over the closing credits as if you are listening to local radio and are worth sitting through to hear
<START> after hearing <UNK> about this movie for years i finally decided to rent it and watch let me start by saying that i'm glad that the rental was free from the local library this move was slow boring unrealistic and the plot made no sense after 2 hours i was ready to <UNK> that <UNK> texas town and put the group of those characters out of their misery i realize that taste is <UNK> but believe me i just do not understand all of the hype that i have heard about this movie dallas provided as good a detail of the life in texas as this movie rent it only if you want to understand how movie studios can pay enough money to reviewers to convince the general public that a bad movie is good
<START> i'm far from a <UNK> stallone fan and i guess the only time i really appreciated his appearance was in the french movie taxi 3 which is an almost <UNK> small role and yet i must admit that this movie was actually not that bad even though i feared the worst br br when <UNK> stallone fails to rescue the girlfriend of one of his friends and she <UNK> to her death from a <UNK> feet high mountain top he can't possibly force himself to keep working as a mountain ranger for almost a year he doesn't set a food in the <UNK> but than he returns soon after he's back they get an <UNK> call from a group of <UNK> who got trapped in a snow storm at least that's what the rangers believe in reality it is a group of robbers who crashed with their airplane in the mountains after their daring plan to steal cases full of money from a flying government plane failed the cases are spread all over the <UNK> and they need the help of professional <UNK> to retrieve them br br this is of course not one of the most intelligent movies ever but in its genre it's an enjoyable one i especially enjoyed john <UNK> as the evil master mind and leader of the gang of robbers i know him best from the tv series 3rd rock from the sun but i enjoyed his performance in this movie as well overall the acting is ok it had a lot of action to offer and of course also some one liners but it also offered a very nice <UNK> this movie was filmed in a magnificent natural environment i loved the snowy mountains and <UNK> the mountain rivers and the <UNK> perhaps that's why i give this movie a score higher than what i normally give to an action adventure movie of this kind i give it a 6 5 10 if you don't expect too much this is an enjoyable movie
<START> this movie offers nothing but the dumbest conversations possible as a matter of fact i most probably could not have imagined how meaningless a film how <UNK> the dialogs could be until an hour ago but then again i saw this video in a movie that does not depend on a powerful script one expects to see at least good acting and tasty conversations and even some humor maybe yet this movie lacks them all you heard me it lacks them all there is not a single point i like about this movie none i hate it i'm sure anyone will do so too the name is intended to give the target audience some thoughts of nudity and stuff yet it fails even at the nudity i don't know how but i <UNK> to watch this thing for an hour or so and i definitely recommend you don't do so worst movie i've seen in my entire life if someone offers you to watch it <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> your <UNK>
<START> jack <UNK> character tim <UNK> the <UNK> in envy finds wealth and success in the idea of a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that when <UNK> on <UNK> dung makes the poo disappear into thin air br br for a moment i was hoping that <UNK> was a real product so that i could <UNK> it on this stinker of a movie and make it disappear into thin air as well br br although envy is not the worst movie that i have seen in the past 12 months that honor goes to the cat in the hat it does get the honor of a close second br br not funny not sad not anything a real <UNK> br br a 0 2 out of 10
<START> this movie has the made for tv stink all over it though it started out with great intentions featuring great looking sets and authentic props and costumes the film quickly <UNK> into horrible on the nose cheesy dialogue and rushed tv sappy melodramatic acting the characters were so sappy that at times i thought that they are about to <UNK> into a <UNK> <UNK> of goo and the action was so convoluted and poorly cut that it looked as it the soldiers were merely standing around and taking turns shooting at one another the germans were so <UNK> depicted that it was painful to watch the only thing that the german officers talked about was how wonderful the americans are please take my word for this i am a huge fan of the war genre and this movie is crap nevertheless this dvd does have an excellent extra feature covering letters from the wwi front lines thus making this rental not a total waste of my time
<START> what is cry freedom like it is simply great and unique experience about making of south africa and how black people in that country were repressed by white people main character of the story is donald woods kevin kline chief editor of the newspaper daily <UNK> in south africa woods writes several <UNK> where he speaks <UNK> about views of steve biko denzel washington soon woods meets biko and he changes his views about him and he also begins to understand what authorities are doing to black people in south africa right from the top even from the chief of police when biko dies in police custody woods decides that he have to write book about him and that no matter what he has to <UNK> it but woods must escape from his country to get that book published and he must also put his family on second place so world can find out the truth br br attenborough managed to make a good movie about people with main message that black and white are the same cause we are all people story leads us to south africa and this movie is great way for the whole world to learn what happened in that land and i'm disappointed that only <UNK> people rated this movie this is movie from which we all can learn something although it is a bit long this story couldn't be presented in any shorter way because director wanted to show us how hard was for woods to get that book published after death of biko br br also relationship between woods and biko was shown great just like families of those two people and all the problems they are going through but sometimes sacrifices must be made <UNK> death so the truth could be <UNK> woods book
<START> i doubt much of this film is based on a true story at the beginning it says based on a true story sort of i bet the only truth to it was there was an ex model turned bounty hunter possibly named domino br br anyways it begins with domino talking to lucy liu who works for the fbi domino is being <UNK> about what she knows about a <UNK> of 10 million dollars through flashbacks we see domino as a child then as a model and how she became interested in being a bounty hunter she basically tells 2 other bounty hunters off ed and <UNK> they let her join the group she's tough can use any kind of weapon and will use her good looks if needed br br they get involved with a <UNK> that <UNK> a <UNK> has going along the way the group starts a reality tv show and that's where ian <UNK> and brian austin green become involved they are sort of like <UNK> and must have been really desperate to appear in this br br i thought the story was entertaining and it had some laughs the editing didn't bother me there's also a lot of violence mainly using guns and blood it could have been a little shorter br br final verdict good enough to watch
<START> <UNK> a big fan of mr ram <UNK> <UNK> but i could not believe that he made this movie i was really disappointed br br ram <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> doesn't come anywhere close to the real sholay it does not leave a lasting impression on a viewer ram <UNK> <UNK> fails to create chemistry between the characters there is no <UNK> between <UNK> ajay <UNK> and raj <UNK> raj there are hardly any scenes with more than two people in the frame together the sequence outside the courtroom with amitabh bachchan and <UNK> face off is remarkable amitabh bachchan should not have done this movie ajay and <UNK> <UNK> was trying their best but no use <UNK> <UNK> voice <UNK> <UNK> and rather pointless <UNK> did full justice and proved it again that acting is all about facial expression and body language rest of the cast was below expectation the comedy situation which was adapted from the original sholay fall flat in this movie br br ram <UNK> <UNK> could have worked upon the script but because of the <UNK> surrounded against the movie he messed up and just for the sake of making he made this <UNK> but there is no fire
<START> highly recommended br br a well written funny film which will appeal to everyone out there with a sense of humour give it a go it's good to see an independent british movie more than holding it's own against the big established studios definitely worth adding to any film collection there are scenes in this film that i'm sure a lot of people will be able to relate to you will laugh out loud at the antics and enjoy the great soundtrack i especially enjoyed the <UNK> version of jimmy <UNK> vietnam and the tower of <UNK> take on <UNK> br br go on give it a go you won't be disappointed
<START> when i saw this documentary i was disappointed to see serbian propaganda in action once again even though <UNK> and its <UNK> politics is main reason of <UNK> <UNK> it is not mentioned in this documentary which is made by bogdanovich whose name tells us that he is serbian and his movie that he is far from being objective it is one in the set of lies pushed by <UNK> regime everyone else is guilty only <UNK> were right and victims even though most of the war criminals tried in <UNK> are <UNK> even though <UNK> are one who have committed <UNK> against <UNK> and attacked <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> all independent nations recognized by the un <UNK> of <UNK> was not <UNK> because <UNK> did not want to release the grip their <UNK> has put on federal <UNK> government so <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> were forced to become independent nations in order to protect their interests if you are interested in an objective documentary about <UNK> of <UNK> and fact led documentary this is not it you should watch <UNK> death of a nation made by discovery channel and bbc
<START> a great funny sweet movie with morgan freeman who plays himself and who meets a spanish girl named scarlet paz vega at a small store whilst <UNK> a potential independent film i was a bit dubious about the film for the first ten minutes but as soon as he was in the store i really started to enjoy the film it shows how a positive attitude can change anything it does not contain any complex plots and it is easy to follow but will lift the saddest of <UNK> and make you smile all the way through without the need for petty cliché romance it includes several scenes all the way through which make you <UNK> your sides with laughter a very rare masterpiece
<START> watched this on dvd in original language with english <UNK> either the <UNK> was very poor or the actual dialog doesn't make much of story and give any character development there are quite a few hk stars in this but the movie doesn't need their presence to make it better or worse it's just bad the bright and colorful scenes done in cg are attractive for the sheer colors and brilliance but it can get overwhelming before long if anything this makes me think of a child's movie with its <UNK> <UNK> of cg fight scenes and crap plot i'm certain i <UNK> what took place in the film but the whole delivery of the story was rather lousy
<START> when i first heard that hal hartley was doing a sequel to henry fool i was excited it's been a personal favorite for years now and then <UNK> when i heard it had something to do with terrorism having just seen it though i was surprised to find that it worked while still being an entirely different sort of movie than henry fool the writing and direction were both dead on and the acting was superb <UNK> kudos go to hartley for <UNK> virtually the whole cast right down to <UNK> son who was only four in the original like i said though this movie is quite different from the first but it works i <UNK> myself with the change in tone and subject matter to the fact that 10 years have passed and the characters would have found themselves in very different situations since the first film ended in this case an unexpected adventure ensues and that's about all i'll give away not to mention the fact that i'll need to see it again to really understand what's going on and who's double crossing who while it was certainly one of the better movies i've seen in some time it suffers like many sequels with its ending as it appears that hartley is planning a third now and the film leaves you hanging i'll be sure to buy my tickets for part 3 <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK>
<START> i saw this movie last night and even after a couple of beers the only giggle this movie got out of me was when i realized that i was actually watching it in a word it is unfunny unfunny i totally believe the trivia <UNK> about jack black <UNK> for making this garbage i can't believe that barry <UNK> didn't just toss this script when he read the first page moreover i can't believe that i watched more than ten minutes of it br br i gave it 3 out of 10 because i love to see christopher walken make terrible movies for the paycheck also the horse corky by merely existing as a character in this movie is actually quite ridiculous
<START> cannot believe a movie that can be made that good in 1987 and is virtually unknown in the west not to repeat other reviews here the score is very good and moving literally it means dawn please never comes when it comes the beautiful ghost and the lover will be apart forever after 24 years joel and leslie still look great i enjoyed joel in god of <UNK> and many movies by leslie including better tomorrow
<START> this is only the second time i've felt compelled enough to comment at imdb about a film the first time was for probably the best movie i've ever seen and that was for <UNK> br br seeing <UNK> is at the other end of the scale compared to <UNK> as in the worst film i've had the misfortune to see apart from the two scenes containing naked women there is nothing in this movie to raise it from the trash pile that it is br br let's see <UNK> effects cliched script bad acting and about 90 minutes too long my wife and i laughed through most of it in disbelief at how bad amazingly i watched it to the end how i did that i don't know avoid
<START> farewell friend aka <UNK> <UNK> honour among thieves isn't perfect but it is a neat and entertaining thriller that sees <UNK> <UNK> french <UNK> war veterans <UNK> <UNK> and charles bronson trapped in the same basement vault one to return stolen bonds the other to clean out the two million in <UNK> sitting there over the christmas weekend naturally things aren't quite that simple even after they open the vault leading to some neat twists and turns on the <UNK> side there's a very bizarre <UNK> scene in a car park bronson has a very irritating <UNK> like <UNK> he uses at the most <UNK> moments <UNK> <UNK> sporting perhaps the most <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of the 60s it makes her look like a bald woman whose wig is blown back off the top of her head by a high wind is something of a <UNK>  her i'll cook spaghetti i'll learn to make love well i'll read shakespeare speech is hysterical in all the wrong ways  and it's a shame about the horrible last line shot but otherwise this is a surprisingly entertaining and <UNK> number that's worth checking out if you can find a decent print br br cinema <UNK> uk dvd only offers the english soundtrack but since <UNK> voices himself and the rest of the cast are fairly well dubbed that's no great problem especially since the widescreen transfer is pretty good quality
<START> i'm not a <UNK> of a certain movie genre i <UNK> movies only as industrial or non industrial valentine is the second industrial movie of the director jamie <UNK> after his urban legends unlike urban legends the screenplay and the story line is very weak yet again unlike urban legends the basic elements of the movie is so dashing and iconic and that is what makes valentine the best br br as the first basic and iconic element the growing hatred of the serial killer is so down to earth since his secondary school years he has grown up with his wounds he had <UNK> in his soul against his <UNK> girlfriends who have made fun of him when you concentrate enough on this first element while watching the movie you will come to see this point of view of <UNK> <UNK> is entirely good or evil in fact somebody known as evil can be secretly kind hearted just because the story line and the direction is very weak we are not as satisfied as we deserved br br the second iconic element is of course the magnificent <UNK> of the late <UNK> super <UNK> my favourite is jessica <UNK> who is killed within the coolest way to be killed an arrow shot from a bow <UNK> her <UNK> and stays stuck in while she was playing hide and seek with her blind date never able to met with <UNK> <UNK> is the first <UNK> getting killed in a <UNK> laboratory while trying to hide under human body models lying on the <UNK> operation tables denise richards is killed third while she just found a <UNK> day gift for her at a <UNK> bath jessica <UNK> is killed last in a <UNK> and unseen way then she is <UNK> to be as the serial killer <UNK> <UNK> is the <UNK> one with a <UNK> of fortune that she is going to be killed within the most <UNK> way that we will never know 'cause the movie is coming to an end before she is getting killed finally <UNK> ha is the <UNK> one since she was not a <UNK> of the serial killer david <UNK> br br the third and the last iconic element is the soundtrack from the blind date <UNK> scene the <UNK> day celebration at <UNK> house scenes and ultimately the killing themes everybody has loved the soundtrack as far as i know hard rock never suits better within a serial killer mystery movie
<START> this movie is not in anyway funny it tries to be funny with it's lame humor which is so dry and boring that the movie is just 2 hours of torture throughout the whole movie i was thinking one thing when is this gonna end one thing you have to hand to them is that they do have a very few mildly funny moments which is also why i gave it a whole 2 stars it is unoriginal and uses up almost every old blonde joke in the book even the ones that wasn't funny the first time it basically is a movie to <UNK> <UNK> and to record the whole <UNK> of blonde jokes br br to sum it all up this movie is blonde humor gone bad it is not worth paying any amount of money to watch it is just that bad
<START> <UNK> said you can only do so much when the two stars of the show can only be seen by one fellow cast member br br i assume then that you never heard of <UNK> br br which in addition to the two stars who could only be seen by one member of the cast had a dog <UNK> br br this was the kind of program that had not gonna make it written <UNK> it from the first episode it was like an <UNK> video game where you actually have to read the <UNK> to play no one well very few of us apparently wants to watch a comedy program that has a basic premise that actually requires thought to grasp
<START> i thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend sitting in the air <UNK> theater and watching a light hearted comedy the plot is simplistic but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable even the well bread suspected serial killer while some may be disappointed when they realize this is not match point 2 risk addiction i thought it was proof that woody allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love br br this was the most i'd laughed at one of <UNK> comedies in years dare i say a decade while i've never been impressed with scarlet <UNK> in this she managed to tone down her sexy image and jumped right into a average but spirited young woman br br this may not be the crown jewel of his career but it was <UNK> than devil wears <UNK> and more interesting than superman a great comedy to go see with friends
<START> if i could give it less that 1 i would do not bother to rent if someone gives you the dvd burn it br br this is horrible movie making a total waste of even digital film i have seen better on youtube made by 12 year old boys <UNK> claims to have written this if that is the case he is a classic case of someone who is illiterate in two languages the story line is none existent the dialog is mainly screaming the camera work is some sort of attempted arty <UNK> with nonsensical cutting of totally unrelated jumps to either industrial <UNK> scenes or some sort of odd angry young woman <UNK> br br i can usually follow a less than obvious plot or see the purpose in a creative film i like david lynch br br this one is either so far beyond my limited powers of <UNK> i missed it or it is totally pointless i think this is a lets see if we can grab a title that will be coming out soon and do a weird <UNK> on it and see if we can grab some of the bucks con job br br i cannot see why <UNK> even bothered with this totally worthless it is so bad i will not rent any other by this same director
<START> in an alternate 1950s where an <UNK> of the undead caused by a mysterious <UNK> <UNK> has been contained through the use of special electronic <UNK> a young loner timmy finds a friend in fido billy <UNK> his family's recently acquired <UNK> zombie br br fido quickly becomes a surrogate father to timmy whose real dad is unable to adequately express his love for his son or for his hot to <UNK> wife played by the gorgeous carrie anne moss having been psychologically <UNK> as a child when he was forced to shoot his own father who tried to eat him br br timmy runs into a spot of bother however when his <UNK> <UNK> collar goes on the blink and he attacks and kills an elderly <UNK> with the authorities on <UNK> trail trouble <UNK> with a pair of local bullies and his mother <UNK> a bond with their undead house help will timmy be able to hold on to his new found friend br br a refreshing take on the whole zombie <UNK> fido is a thoroughly entertaining deliciously dark comedy that should appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humour taking the romero zombie <UNK> and <UNK> it into 1950s small town america is a stroke of genius and the result is simply one of the most original films to tackle the whole <UNK> <UNK> theme that i have seen br br <UNK> fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of inclusion in the undead movie hall of fame along with day of the <UNK> <UNK> and return of the living <UNK> <UNK> it is not often i feel empathy for a walking corpse but the big <UNK> performance is so fine that i actually found myself rooting for the big blue bag of <UNK> the rest of the cast also give commendable performances with young <UNK> ray as timmy and ms moss deserving special <UNK> because for one so young he puts in a particularly assured turn and moss because she is so bloody <UNK> br br this is the third zombie film that i have watched this week the others being the somewhat disappointing planet terror and the rather fun flight of the living dead and to my surprise it is also the best director andrew <UNK> has given fans of the genre something truly original to treasure and is a talent to be watched in the future br br 8 5 out of 10 rounded up to 9 for imdb
<START> watch the 1936 version as personally annoying i find charles <UNK> voice he's more of a match to pay <UNK> depressed <UNK> i mean omar <UNK> tries but no too cute and vibrant catherine <UNK> <UNK> besides being too old looks nothing like marie nothing she looks too sophisticated to even think of dying for love of this man in such a fashion br br the only actor in the entire movie who conveys the role they're playing is <UNK> <UNK> whose appearance as <UNK> <UNK> on the screen is <UNK> brief and look up pictures of the <UNK> there's more than a passing resemblance as historically <UNK> <UNK> wasn't involved that much in <UNK> life
<START> the films of <UNK> are surprisingly well rated on imdb despite the fact that the animation quality is light years behind that of looney <UNK> disney and mgm at their prime sadly due to rising costs in making pretty cartoons with high frame rates and lovely backgrounds the <UNK> style which <UNK> about 1950 began to dominate in the late 50s and 60s after all the films were dirt cheap to make and they'd received several oscars to prove that the cartoons were now mainstream so as a result lousy animation was becoming the norm and this trend wasn't <UNK> until the 1980s br br this <UNK> film is one of the early ones the characters are very simply drawn any simpler and they would have used stick figures and the backgrounds were ugly simple line drawings with colors added in a very slap dash manner often with a <UNK> and rarely completely filling the items br br as for the story it's a <UNK> story with a strong jazz style attitude some will love this others will just find it very very loud it's the traditional frankie and johnny story and because of the shootings and all it's probably not a great film for the kids heck because of the animation and jazz it's not a particularly good film for me either some will read my review and no doubt think i am a <UNK> which i am to a degree however i love animated films and a little of this <UNK> <UNK> style goes a very very long way and you can't seriously consider them great works of art just very very quickly made cartoons ignore the oscars and try watching some classic cartoons or something anything else
<START> sweet romantic drama comedy about stewart and <UNK> writing love letters to each other without either one knowing who the other is naturally they work together and can't stand each other you can guess the rest it's beautifully acted by the entire cast especially <UNK> stewart and frank morgan has a witty intelligent script and looks absolutely stunning it takes place in <UNK> and was shot in hollywood but i found myself believing i was seeing <UNK> everything looks so perfect and dream like a one of a kind film don't miss it
<START> the orange tone to everything was just <UNK> oh yeah the main character lives in a ghetto that is all orange <UNK> with orange <UNK> people meanwhile to mentally escape from this <UNK> poverty of the body she plays a full <UNK> video game which sucks in that no rules are clear and no logic follows the <UNK> she apparently earns an <UNK> playing the game but she is revealed to not be an employee of the game company lots of non speaking pauses later the story drags on slowly she uses a <UNK> orange computer <UNK> with an operating <UNK> that is so visually annoying and i can only suspect a <UNK> future release br br meanwhile i the viewer ask basically why she is wasting her precious time in some moronic game when she barely has the <UNK> of life oh yeah playing games is fun but what is the point when you're almost starving while she is <UNK> her life away playing some lousy even more orange <UNK> lame full <UNK> video game her dog runs off probably looking for an owner who pays at least a moment of attention to it and <UNK> it regularly or is stolen from the woman while she is ignoring her lousy orange <UNK> reality br br meanwhile she <UNK> over some game her game playing team lost the entire uninteresting movie yawn so she wants to be the best of the best go get them ash <UNK> got to bore us all <UNK> this main character sucks as a human being as well and has no redeeming qualities aside from her physical beauty which she could <UNK> for some manner to escape her <UNK> poverty br br so she reaches the real level and it at least not sucks horribly and she is sent to kill a former <UNK> <UNK> mentally living in the real level finally the <UNK> boring bland orange <UNK> movie is no longer a tedious chore to watch but has the potential to say something along the lines the main character is trapped in imaginary computer generated poverty and she is actually in the real world now perhaps she will do the murder deed and live in the real world now well she kills the guy and he <UNK> in a digital effect wow thanks idiotic director you suck you suck so very much director br br here the director had an <UNK> of a chance to redeem himself slightly by <UNK> this lousy lame moronic <UNK> movie with a philosophical twist br br the director could have said the real world is there and if you live in it and contribute to it to make it better it won't be some <UNK> orange <UNK> poverty land a clever way to make this suck <UNK> movie a <UNK> slow lesson on basic <UNK> pride for the 1 of the viewers that haven't found something actually entertaining to watch at this point or are movie <UNK> br br nope director the director had to screw this all up by <UNK> in some <UNK> digital effect and ruin all chances of redemption for this awfully lousy movie which was a waste of money a waste of time and a waste of viewer trust br br after that it ends good <UNK> i hope the director <UNK> on it i'm putting this hack on my avoid at all costs list for any other films his name is attached to
<START> i'm not looking for quality i'm just trying to get through the <UNK> famous video <UNK> that were banned in britain this one was initially banned and re released in 2001 with a whole 10 seconds cut br br some college kids spend their christmas vacation preparing a <UNK> for <UNK> there are some creepy characters lurking about along with the four kids which of them is the slasher the actual killings are not very gory so this video <UNK> is not really nasty there is the requisite flashing of the <UNK> but it has nothing to do with the college kids br br i had a suspect very quickly and i turned out to be right maybe i've seen too many of these the end twist was clever i have to give the writers credit for that bit of originality
<START> i want to warn you that there is a very bittersweet quality to this comment also this comment will be much more meaningful to you after you have seen the movie br br although it is <UNK> sad to say that movie bears a resemblance to my life that is so striking that it is truly scary the rest of you will never know how accurately that movie depicts how persons who have been in situations like that act and react in their later lives br br this could not have been a work of fiction it had to be based on personal experience br br my testament to the how good the movie was is shown by the fact that although it was one of the best movies i've ever seen watching my life portrayed on the silver screen was such a <UNK> painful experience that i will never be able to see it again br br but i <UNK> it <UNK> to all others as a chance to <UNK> into the soul of another human being to the extent that you probably never experienced before or will ever again i know that for a fact because that's my soul you will be <UNK>
<START> so there's an old security guard and a guy who dies and then there's kevin the world's biggest <UNK> kevin wants to impress his incredibly <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> girlfriend amy as he returns from work to a random house he finds his friends the sexually confusing red <UNK> kyle and the truly revolting <UNK> daphne they are soon joined by <UNK> boyfriend the trigger happy sex crazed macho <UNK> nick and there's the title creatures horrid little <UNK> puppets who kill people by giving them their <UNK> desire <UNK> <UNK> desire is to mate with a creepy <UNK> woman in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> desire is to throw <UNK> in a grade school <UNK> i mean nightclub <UNK> <UNK> desire is to beat up a skinny thug with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> desire is to be a disgusting slut <UNK> already a disgusting slut so she doesn't have a <UNK> desire along the way a truly hideous band sings a truly odd song the hobgoblins randomly go back to where they came from then blow up citizen kane cannot hold a candle to this true masterpiece of american cinema
<START> i saw el <UNK> yesterday and thought it to be a great movie it starts with a childhood episode in the life of the 3 main characters <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> after that we jump about 10 years to an hospital where the 3 friends meet again br br religion sickness love violence and sexuality rage throughout the movie creating and intense and tension filled movie br br i see people complaining about the film being too gory and i think they missed the point of the story it's a violent intense and sad story people are expected to suffer to cry to get hurt to bleed and i think that what the film shows isn't done for pure shock value or presented in a <UNK> way i know that some people like their films clean even those with violence in it but sometimes a movie needs to make you feel <UNK> to work this is one of those movies and a great movie it is br br the only fault i found was that there were 3 or 4 moments were some plot details weren't 100 clear and only after thinking about them at the end of the movie it all made sense but it wasn't anything of much importance to the overall story so i still give this movie a 9
<START> jim <UNK> muppets were a favorite of mine since childhood this film makes me feel like a kid again okay the muppets are back with miss <UNK> and <UNK> the frog and their friends the premise is that they are trying to get on broadway in a musical show in where else but new york city you will see cameos by the then new york city mayor ed <UNK> anyway the film turns 25 this year and i hope the kids of today will learn to appreciate the <UNK> of the muppets gang the problem with the show is <UNK> goes missing and the gang has to find him in new york city it's worth watching for kids and even sentimental adults like myself
<START> first of all what is good in the movie some pretty actress the exotic background the fact that the actors don't laugh while acting i would have if i had been in their situation i don't know the storyline is simple a catholic priest who does abstract painting tries to find out who another abstract painter killed his little brother a male prostitute raped by another priest when he was young i'm afraid there is nothing here to learn or to let think a little about serial killers art or religion dennis hopper is not very good here this is the worst episode of the worst season of <UNK> the <UNK> with replacement actors and unbelievable <UNK> the uncle is the policeman who the girl who lives at another <UNK> house could have a baby with the priest etc etc
<START> i've always enjoyed kenneth branagh's versions of the shakespeare classics as he always does a very good job but in this movie the one who lifts the whole movie is none other than the always great actor laurence fishburne surely he has made some poor choices in films even though he's a wonderful actor but in this one we're truly given the real othello the passion the intensity of jealousy as it grows stronger alongside with <UNK> well portrayed paranoia and furthermore we're finally given a black othello br br i don't think they could have chosen a better othello who else could have given him that blend of sympathy <UNK> love hatred and not to forget those fiery eyes branagh is good as always but not at his peak <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is fairly good but a bit bleak whilst laurence fishburne truly lifts it and makes it a very interesting and enjoyable movie do watch it
<START> this is a story of a jewish dysfunctional family the parents have divorced and mom remains back east in the house the father murray <UNK> moves with his children to california and moves around beverly hills so that his children can get the best education possible br br things really become funny when marisa tomei <UNK> niece comes to lives with the group br br the film deals with the various adventures of the family complicated by the drug scene of the <UNK> neighborhood br br jessica walter <UNK> as a woman who wants murray to move in with her since she wants a companion br br carl <UNK> and rita <UNK> come in towards the end they play <UNK> brother and sister in law respectively they're also the parents of tomei in front of the children <UNK> lets loose reminding murray that he has been paying the bills for them all along br br the film ends on a sour note as the embarrassed family moves out of their fancy <UNK> and take to riding around beverly hills in their car i guess the film is promoting independence and some good old self <UNK>
<START> this was one film i wanted to watch always when it released the <UNK> were eye catching and govinda in a negative role was a surprise br br but the film isn't that good br br it has lot of flaws br br the start is good and till the murder everything goes well but the film falls flat when the romance track starts between govinda and <UNK> and the songs that follow br br then the twist about govinda and <UNK> being in love leaves more doubts and flaws and then how come govinda turns into a rich criminal from a poor <UNK> br br the last flashback too is prolonged and also the entire clash between govinda <UNK> and <UNK> br br n <UNK> disappoints music is okay <UNK> <UNK> stands out br br govinda tries a negative role and does very well in it though he <UNK> it too much at times <UNK> is good but <UNK> at times with her cries <UNK> is okay <UNK> <UNK> still doesn't know the difference between loud screaming and acting rest are okay
<START> this is the kind of movie which shows the <UNK> of french cinema when it comes to making thrillers the director's desire to sound american is so glaring that you will not be fooled a minute unless you have not seen a serial killer movie since <UNK> tom br br two male cops or one and a half more like as you will see horrible murders a plot more complicated than complex charles <UNK> is not lucky with the genre see the <UNK> dumb <UNK> de <UNK> a couple of years ago the scenes with his pregnant wife which are supposed to be a counterpart for the otherwise noir atmosphere of the rest of the plot are among the worst ever filmed add a steamy love scene between them and a gory <UNK> to get a pg 12 and thus to attract the huge adolescent audience a violent and absurd conclusion followed by a silent <UNK> who could make a nice commercial for the <UNK> <UNK> it's really the silence of the lame
<START> idiotic hack crooks a babe a safe a plan and a baby add them all up and you get the best comedy you've never heard of br br even with some a list star power at least a minus okay b plus this movie got very little publicity br br but that does not <UNK> its genius br br terrific writing solid delivery and a believable group of characters some truly classic lines and a fun twist at the end br br this is not some watered down nutty professor comedy these are low life bad guys they speak low life bad guy language and they do low life bad guy things but they do it for your amusement and entertainment and they do that well br br one of the best comedies i've ever seen
<START> if this movie was written directed and produced with the intention of creating a bad movie cult classic it might i say might have been a hit have you ever sat and watched a movie that was so absolutely awful that it becomes fascinating in terms of its faults well this is it every one of the acting cast should be nominated for worst acting performance awards it would be hard to find another film with this kind of production budget that contains so little of any value whatsoever the whole thing from the opening scenes defies logic dialogue is completely unbelievable and illogical <UNK> for the behaviour and general storyline of the film itself what is really mind <UNK> is that some <UNK> in a <UNK> actually made decisions to spend money on this piece of trash wow
<START> there was something here with the female lead having this perfect life she's always wanted after the worst life possible beginning as a child prostitute and <UNK> up with eric roberts but her background makes it impossible for her to trust dean cain and this utterly destroys it in the end it sounds weird but i like the position dean cain was in at the end and the choice he made he can't hurt her because he loves her and she's the mother of his child i think the time frame makes it clear it's his child and not his brother's but at the same he can't forgive her for all she's done sleeping with his brother which shows the love and <UNK> he felt was pretty much one way and then being part of his death in better hands this would have been a better movie but for something i caught on late night cable it's not bad
<START> this is a pretty decent example of film noir the setting is the early 50's with the <UNK> trying to steal weapon secrets from the us government br br richard widmark is the suave <UNK> without <UNK> he gives a pretty decent performance but there is nothing a list about him the interesting thing was that he was not only an anti hero but through most of the film an unlikeable anti hero that is not very normal jean peters gave a so so performance as the hooker with the heart of gold that great character actress thelma ritter shines as the <UNK> <UNK> br br the plot had its fair share of twists and turns <UNK> and tough talk there is a fight scene near the end of the movie in the subway station that was pretty gritty and exciting br br i think noir fans like myself will enjoy this film for non noir viewers it may seem a little dated and the whole <UNK> thing a tad overdone
<START> a murder investigation goes on back stage while the <UNK> on its opening night plays on to an <UNK> audience odd combination of musical and murder mystery is worth a look for its cast its production numbers and the sheer novelty of the film br br <UNK> michael has the <UNK> role of a bitchy actress intent on stopping the marriage between the show's stars kitty <UNK> and carl <UNK> as well as starring in the infamous sweet marijuana number which was also on a 70s bette midler album so while the chorus girls <UNK> around <UNK> bumbling detective victor mclaglen <UNK> the girls while he tries to solve the <UNK> murder of an unknown woman br br we quickly learn that the maid dorothy <UNK> loves <UNK> from <UNK> that the wardrobe lady jessie ralph is <UNK> mother and that the stage manager jack <UNK> <UNK> into everything lots of plots twists among the musical numbers the show's best known song is <UNK> for two kitty <UNK> also sings the haunting where do they come from and there's a weird <UNK> that <UNK> into a harlem <UNK> number featuring duke <UNK> quite the cast br br some terrific acting here especially <UNK> michael and dorothy <UNK> kitty <UNK> is quite good as well <UNK> is a total zero though br br charles <UNK> plays homer toby wing plays nancy donald meek plays the doctor and also see if you can spot ann sheridan and lucille ball among the show girls
<START> it could have been a better film it does drag at points and the central story shifts from boyer <UNK> his mission to boyer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> death but graham greene is an author who is really hard to spoil his stories are all morality tales due to his own <UNK> of <UNK> guilt and innocence very relative terms in his world view and the human condition br br boyer is luis <UNK> a well known concert <UNK> who has sided with the <UNK> in the spanish civil war he has been sent to england to try to carry through an arms purchase deal that is desperately needed unfortunately for <UNK> he is literally on his own everyone of his contacts turns out to be a willing <UNK> for the <UNK> of spain in particular <UNK> <UNK> mrs <UNK> a grim <UNK> house keeper and peter lorre mr <UNK> a teacher of an <UNK> type international language <UNK> <UNK> is the <UNK> of a girl else who works for mrs <UNK> the local <UNK> <UNK> victor <UNK> is already a willing associate of the <UNK> br br the brits holmes herbert miles <UNK> and best if not worst of the lot george <UNK> don't give much hope to <UNK> cause which he soon <UNK> may be <UNK> before long herbert and <UNK> just <UNK> behind the official policy of <UNK> ordered by the <UNK> <UNK> and stanley <UNK> <UNK> during the civil war <UNK> here is a typical <UNK> <UNK> type always impeccable in his native english <UNK> he is sharp in showing his dislike for <UNK> in general br br the one ray of hope is lauren bacall rose <UNK> here trying to play her role as well as she can but she can't really she's an aristocrat the daughter of a press lord it was <UNK> second film and sad to say almost <UNK> her long career she does act well but the spark she showed in her first film was due to the <UNK> effect of starring with <UNK> bogart and being directed by howard <UNK> boyer is a fine actor but he's not <UNK> and herman <UNK> is not <UNK> her next film returned her to <UNK> and <UNK> again and her star <UNK> it's <UNK> br br it's a bleak film as was the novel <UNK> mission never succeeds as he has too many hidden <UNK> all over the place but the villains are likewise also losers frequently with their lives br br with dan seymour as a suspicious foreign tenant of <UNK> <UNK> and the man who destroys her it is well worth watching to catch the <UNK> lot of character actors doing their best given the weakness in direction
<START> i mean really this is not going to help the australian film industry to make this kind of film with no values of any kind okay if you're a <UNK> and have nothing better to do then maybe i think film makers from here should try to show the rest of the world what great talented people we have and this is not the vehicle for it come on now this film is just tacky
<START> orson welles' the lady from shanghai does not have the brilliant screenplay of citizen kane e g but charles <UNK> jr 's cinematography the unforgettable set pieces such as the scene in the <UNK> the <UNK> scene featuring a stunning blonde <UNK> rita hayworth singing please don't love me and the truly amazing hall of mirrors climax and the wonderful cast everett sloane in his greatest performance welles in a beautifully under played role the <UNK> mentioned miss hayworth welles' wife at the time at her most gorgeous make for a very memorable <UNK> experience the bizarre murder mystery plot is fun and compelling not <UNK> at all the viewer is surprised by the twists and turns and welles' closing line is an <UNK> classic the lady from shanghai gets four stars from this <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the plot of <UNK> mr tom on paper makes it seem we are in for a large dose of <UNK> <UNK> sentiment but talented director jack gold is an expert on touching the emotions in the right manner and it emerges instead as a compelling deeply moving wartime drama with excellent production and lead performances one of the best if not the best tv movies of the 1990's which possibly would've had even greater success if it had been released in the cinemas br br the <UNK> of children to countryside towns and <UNK> in world war ii was of course a common practice but in the case of the young boy here was <UNK> important because of a wretched home life in the <UNK> capital the horrors of war on the home front are not <UNK> over though and the construction of the film until it's throat <UNK> misty eyed ending leaves us with a sense of optimism despite what has happened before it is almost but not quite worthy of comparison with the finale to it's a wonderful life 1946 all in all a modern classic
<START> to like this movie at most you must be a strongly in love without a marriage b acknowledge english humor which is about <UNK> <UNK> and witty life situations and not just running gags c be fairly very intelligent because authors gave an opportunity to laugh and cry over every single minute of this movie and only if you meet b and c <UNK> you can recognize and enjoy author's <UNK> d to fully enjoy the movie you must love women like <UNK> dunst who is so natural sweet and irresistible e you must admire creative a little <UNK> people with great and remarkable personalities br br if you meet all these <UNK> you'll be likely to rate this movie near 10 points br br i never laughed half as much as from watching this masterpiece and i even managed to cry while laughing in some moments i always get sensitive whenever good things happen to kirsten dunst
<START> i rented this because i'm a bit weary of '80s nbc programming and apparently i saved myself a lot of money i have nothing against any of the actors and for their credit they do a good job but this show is flawed from the premise br br we have a character who is unlikable he's full of flaws not <UNK> and a complete jerk on a good day yet the reason why anybody should care just isn't there while creating an american sitcom centered around a complete <UNK> jackass is revolutionary and full of potential it just isn't met here within this show most of the supporting characters aren't fully fleshed characters but rather sad <UNK> <UNK> that want empathy from the audience for being <UNK> <UNK> as in any sitcom they are the ones who are made the most normal for the audience to relate to and in doing this they <UNK> the lead character to such an extent that we see <UNK> being himself and <UNK> people and they just stay there because why there is no reason any normal people would have simply left the abuse keeping them there without any real reason even the really unbelievable one given by joanna cassidy in the very special 2 part abortion episode that has major problems of its own is where the show just falls apart to simply believe that people put up with this guy because we are told he has a heart of gold does not <UNK> with the reality of the situation if anything this isn't even <UNK> this is a badly plotted conceived and executed premise that had a few moments but overall met the fate it deserved someone had the guts to go out and make a very good idea but the execution is so <UNK> that it just looks like a <UNK> scripted version of the jerry springer show where someone is abused by this <UNK> that we're supposed to root for because we are told to a show like this requires a <UNK> touch that the actors here could have provided easily but somehow aren't able to and that's a fatal error that really killed the program br br <UNK> it up to a show in its <UNK> regardless the show is worth a watch but it really screwed up when trying to aim for the stars and made the whole enterprise not what it could have been
<START> i was supposed to review this for a website and i watched this with optimism that perhaps it would at least be a cheesy yet entertaining rip off and it didn't even do that well enough br br <UNK> the child is probably one of the worst supernatural thrillers i've ever seen even worse than <UNK> with scenes that rip from the omen without shame the ending is even very similar to the way the omen ends br br not to mention that the acting writing and story are all just hackneyed if these movies make money i'm sad to see where asylum is headed it's embarrassing
<START> i have previously seen zu warriors from the magic mountain in that film the setting takes place in <UNK> mountains the legend of zu looks like another dimension thank that to tsui <UNK> extensive use of cgi effects he's able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds a land where beings fly <UNK> and powers ranging from razor sharp wing <UNK> split swords and the ultra cool moon <UNK> br br while there are many characters in this one the focus is mainly on king sky and <UNK> the romance aspect is there although the movie seems much darker than its predecessor <UNK> cheung is beautiful and her presence on screen makes this movie worth watching in the beginning i like how she resembles the <UNK> from zu warriors and she does well playing <UNK> as she deals with facing her past life oh by the way did i mention that <UNK> very appealing to the eye br br in truth zu warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983 tsui <UNK> takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in cinema
<START> an absolute steaming pile of cow dung it's mind blowing to me that this film was even made hip hop and old westerns just don't seem to mix what target audience were these people thinking of when planning this <UNK> br br not only is the concept and plot a joke but the acting is atrocious and the fact that some decent actors were even in this nightmare of a film makes their entire careers a laughing stock the chick from clueless should never be forgiven and she is stripped of any remaining dignity she had after reading the first ten pages of dialogue she should have been asking which one of her friends was playing this sick joke after some research i actually found a list of some other actors who passed on this film <UNK> <UNK> smith denzel washington <UNK> <UNK> kim <UNK> jenna jameson oprah and finally <UNK> simpson br br simply put i would rather stare at a blank tv than watch this movie again
<START> i really really enjoyed watching this movie at first seeing its poster i thought it was just another easy romantic comedy but it is simply more than this i personally believe that this idea that i'm sure a good part of the viewers had just before they saw the movie it's yet another important part of the big concept of this movie itself or even of its marketing <UNK> what i mean is nowadays we are slaves to images to impressions i went to the cinema to view this film having the wrong impression the wrong expectations and at the end i felt how superficial i could be to <UNK> it comes to my mind the sequence near the end in which sidney buys the plane ticket to go back to new york and as he is asked to <UNK> an <UNK> meaning to sign for the ticket he believes that just because he got on tv thanks to the scandal at the awards he is now some kind of celebrity and this is just i believe the climax of this main theme around which the movies revolves above this i believe the movie also offers us a solution to get along with this illustrated throughout the movie by <UNK> attitude don't become too serious about yourself or about anybody else even saints were people in the beginning as sophie once says in the movie the saints of the moment are the stars we <UNK> them an <UNK> of perfection of eternal happiness but the reality is much less than that even the saints of any religion are images ideal models of how to behave and how to live your life even they were not for real they became <UNK> <UNK> after they died and we looked back at them and that's the catch we need our saints we need our stars we <UNK> for them as if it wasn't for them we wouldn't have anything to <UNK> for and television and all other media are means to create and capture our <UNK> we desperately need <UNK> in regard to which to measure ourselves and that's how we got in the cinema to watch this movie in the first place to see if we can fit the <UNK> or if the <UNK> is to small for us this time it was larger than we expected
<START> i'm going to keep this review short and sweet br br i saw the trailer for this and thought i'd give it a <UNK> 5 minutes in and my initial thoughts were what the hell is this but after 10 minutes i was hooked and after 20 i was picking my jaw up from off the floor this film is a great example of how different a movie can be and furthermore it's french this film is high art eye candy wrapped up in a <UNK> futuristic film noir package the motion capture is very clever and the black and white animation style which has no grey although at first didn't do it for me totally captivated me and by the end of the film and i found myself wishing every film was made like this i think my opinion was helped by the great dubbing it would have been very easy to ruin it had they not landed so many respected actors as many voice actors give no feeling to the characters just watch any hong kong legends film in english to see a perfect example i gave it 9 although i gave it an extra 2 because of how fresh and new the whole thing feels
<START> as i was watching this film on video last night i kept getting these <UNK> that told me this one will endure i've a feeling i'll be watching this again and again for years to come br br it's got all the timeless qualities you could ask for in a story film and even though some cultural references are obscure for me a western viewer at the core this is a universal tale
<START> from reading all of the comments posted here on imdb this movie seems to get <UNK> on a lot but i didn't think it was that bad i've seen much worse actually br br the house where evil <UNK> is a ghost story about a husband and his wife ted and laura <UNK> and their daughter amy who move into an old house in japan little do they know a japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and her lover and then killed himself 100 years earlier with a samurai sword as strange things happen in the house the ghosts of the previous residents begin to possess the bodies of the living and plan on re <UNK> the bloody murder that took place 100 years back br br i saw this movie and decided to give it a chance from the cover it looked like a decent ghost story it was routine and it was corny but i've seen worse in my day the ghost sequences were a little over done we get to see the <UNK> blue <UNK> figures randomly pop up randomly around the family and take over their bodies to be honest the ghosts in this movie kind of reminded me of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride at <UNK> i may be mistaken but after watching this it seemed to me that the japanese horror film <UNK> on the grudge and the american remake of that film ripped this off a little the old japanese home where a brutal murder took place ghostly activity <UNK> put on the home etc but i may be wrong br br to sum it up this is a pretty corny ghost story don't go out of your way to see it but if you like this kind of thing and it happens to come on tv you can give it a shot 4 10
<START> the film attempts to be a <UNK> shot in the documentary form but with many obviously scripted parts but fails in not providing the audience with any characters with which to create the illusion of the <UNK> also the film <UNK> to be about finding real love in los angeles but is nothing more than an uninteresting look at an amateur filmmaker trying to make his first big movie
<START> dolph lundgren stars as murray wilson an alcoholic ex cop who gets involved with a serial killer who kills during sex after his brother is murdered wilson starts his own investigation and finds out a lot of his brother's secrets in this very dull thriller lundgren <UNK> in his performance and the movie is flat and <UNK> also when has anyone watched a dolph lundgren movie for anything but action
<START> watching film i was in very light mood and also this film is light but the end of the film is just unexpected which leaves a long lasting memories in one's mind br br movie starts with <UNK> and his profession of being witness during <UNK> marriage <UNK> comes for marriage and his boyfriend doesn't leaving <UNK> alone on to the street she cant go back home and she don't have any thing to live on here in this situation <UNK> turns out to be a <UNK> for her this is the base of story br br the rest is just watchable and the end of the story is bitter sweet that <UNK> has to face which keeps you at the edge of the seat br br dialogues and music are good songs are ok direction is good and so as the screenplay you do feel that movie is slow but looking to the demand of story it is all right br br a truly watchable especially with light mood i enjoyed this at home with coke and <UNK> my rating for this is 8 10
<START> this little seen movie is a <UNK> and laid back giallo it <UNK> away from some of the <UNK> of the genre and <UNK> a <UNK> approach it's about a woman searching for her missing lover a psychiatrist who has suddenly <UNK> for no apparent reason her search leads her to a villa populated by a group of eccentric individuals in true giallo style murder is never far away br br the cast is really rather good we have <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> frank cat <UNK> nine <UNK> and a very young <UNK> <UNK> 80's scream queen the lead actress is <UNK> <UNK> and while i am not familiar with her she does a good job in leading the picture br br one of the defining features of eye in the <UNK> is its music <UNK> for a giallo it features a jazz rock <UNK> soundtrack this score composed by <UNK> <UNK> is reminiscent of miles davis especially his work on in a silent way it's an excellent soundtrack and really gives this movie a different feel than most <UNK> the <UNK> groove <UNK> the <UNK> atmosphere and <UNK> the sunny sea front scenery that the film is mostly made up of br br this is a giallo so we really need to talk about the murder set pieces well this film falls a little short in this regard it's certainly not devoid of them but they are few and far between the opening dream murder being probably the best on offer as well as a memorable burning car sequence but this really isn't a particularly violent film still i don't think it should disappoint too many seasoned fans of the genre the mystery is fairly compelling and it has enough eccentric characters the idiot boy <UNK> and that <UNK> inappropriate dubbed accent and moments of the bizarre to satisfy while the sleaze factor is <UNK> with a <UNK> of nudity throughout br br eye in the <UNK> plays like a giallo version of an agatha christie mystery as it features a group of unsympathetic characters in a villa all under suspicion of murder we have the obligatory flashbacks <UNK> their connections with the final hours of the highly unsympathetic murder victim while this isn't a grade a example of the genre it's certainly an <UNK> different one as it doesn't borrow too heavily from other films of the sub genre for giallo <UNK> i give this a thumbs up and hope one day it's given a nice dvd transfer it certainly deserves the treatment
<START> this movie has everything you want from an action movie explosions <UNK> bad guys and worse guys it is fun to see james belushi using his humor to get out of the trouble he has gotten himself in to since he stole 12 million dollars from the ultimate big boss the <UNK> does this sounds cheesy of course it is but boy did i have fun watching this movie it is a whole lot better than all the direct to dvd garbage that is made nowadays if you can get over the silly plot than you will find out that this movie has quite a few surprises in store you could argue about the twists being predictable but the fast pace of this movie doesn't give you time too think too much of them which is a <UNK> since this movie is not about revealing the ultimate twist but more about the journey to that moment only the title is a bit misleading and that could be the reason why so many people hated this movie they probably expected a movie about <UNK> in <UNK> of some crooks double crossing each other pure fun
<START> meet peter <UNK> rock star genetic professor at <UNK> university when he's not <UNK> on the court he's blowing minds and dropping <UNK> in his <UNK> <UNK> dr <UNK> is working on a serum that would allow the body to constantly <UNK> cells allowing humans to become immortal i'd want to be immortal too if i looked like christian <UNK> and got the sweet female <UNK> that only <UNK> can offer an assortment of old and ugly university <UNK> don't care for the popular <UNK> and cut off funding for his project due to lack of results this causes peter to use himself as the guinea pig for his serum much to my <UNK> there are side effects and he get this <UNK> into something that is <UNK> into our genetic <UNK> that has been repressed for millions of years he also <UNK> dr <UNK> crush sally after a whole day of knowing her she has a son his name is tommy he is an angry little boy br br <UNK> isn't a terrible movie just not a well produced one the whole time i watched this i couldn't get past the fact that this was filmed in 1989 the look and feel of the movie is late seventies quality at the latest it does not help that it's <UNK> along with 1970's movies as <UNK> is part of mill creek <UNK> 50 chilling classics there is basically no film quality difference whatsoever the final five minutes are pure bad movie cheese that actually for me at least save the movie from a lower rating pay attention to the computer <UNK> such as <UNK> <UNK> no wonder <UNK> experiment failed your computer can't spell this is worthy of a view followed by a trip to your local <UNK>
<START> the incredible melting man is a fantastically gross trashy and energetic z grade production that every self <UNK> camp horror freak simply has to see for him herself the ideal way to describe this low budget 70's gem is like a shameless copy of <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> only a thousand times <UNK> <UNK> steve west is the only survivor of a disastrous space mission but turns out the <UNK> of a horrible disease that makes him <UNK> and causes him to melt in shock after seeing his face in the mirror can you blame him steve <UNK> out of the hospital leaving a trail of <UNK> <UNK> and fallen off body parts behind doctor ted nelson has to find him <UNK> as the disease also set steve up with an <UNK> <UNK> for human flesh the premise may sound utterly stupid but this flick is enormously entertaining and contains great make up effects from the hand of rick baker the melting <UNK> face looks like a rotting pizza and his heavy breathing makes him sound like darth vader another big advantage is that william <UNK> screenplay doesn't waste any time on tedious scientific explanations or emotional speeches the <UNK> starts right away and lasts until the very last moment of the film just enjoy this silly horror gem and try to switch off your brain activity as much as you can because if you start <UNK> about the many <UNK> in the script you'll miss out on all the campy fun
<START> one of the weaker carry on adventures sees sid james as the head of a crime gang stealing <UNK> <UNK> the fourth of the series to be hospital based it's possibly the least of the genre there's a curiously flat feel throughout with all seemingly <UNK> on below par material this is far from the late 70s <UNK> but williams james <UNK> <UNK> et al are all class performers yet not given the backing of a script equal to their ability br br most of the gags are <UNK> rather than episodic as carry <UNK> usually are so that instead of the traditional hit and miss ratio if you don't find the joke funny in the first place you're stuck with it for most of the film these continuous plot <UNK> include williams  for no good reason  worrying that he's changing sex and kenneth cope in drag like the <UNK> physical <UNK> falls the whole thing feels more contrived than in other movies and lacking in cast interest continuing this theme <UNK> lacks the <UNK> pun and innuendo format largely <UNK> for characterisation and consequence to provide the humour in fact the somewhat <UNK> series of <UNK> <UNK> and forced <UNK> reminds one more of terry and june so it's appropriate that terry scott is present <UNK> <UNK> throughout br br some dialogue <UNK> have a bit of the old magic such as this between scott and cope what about a little drink oh no no i never touch it oh cigarette then no i never touch them that leaves only one thing to offer you i never touch that either that said while a funny man in his own right <UNK> up the <UNK> episodes of randall and <UNK> deceased no end you do feel that cope isn't quite <UNK> in to the self <UNK> carry on <UNK> and that bernard <UNK> dressed as a nurse would be far funnier this does actually happen in part though only for the last fifteen minutes br br williams attempting to seduce <UNK> jacques while charles <UNK> is hiding in a <UNK> is pure <UNK> room farce but lacks the irony to carry it off that said <UNK> description of <UNK> relations is priceless you don't just go into the shop and buy enough for the whole room you tear yourself off a little strip and try it first that may be so <UNK> jacques but you're not going to stick me up against a wall williams really comes to life in his scenes with <UNK> and you can never get bored of hearing a tin <UNK> whenever someone accidentally flashes their <UNK> br br carry on <UNK> is not a bad film by any means just a <UNK> <UNK> standard one
<START> what a movie i never imagined richard attenborough could have such a movie in him gandhi has always left me indifferent apart from ben <UNK> performance and i never considered attenborough a particularly good filmmaker but cry freedom held my interest like few movies have in recent times it's an exciting mesmerizing political movie with great performances by kevin kline and a young denzel washington br br kline plays donald woods a south africa newspaper editor who befriends the civil rights <UNK> steve biko it starts as a difficult friendship for woods sees biko as a black <UNK> preaching hatred against whites but biko with his kind words upbeat attitude and complete <UNK> wins over woods and introduces him to a reality about apartheid that woods knew nothing about br br biko is a decent law <UNK> citizen who <UNK> stands up against all prejudice and the system that keeps down his people one night coming from an illegal meeting he's arrested and beaten to death the authorities try to <UNK> up the matter because biko has become a huge personality in south africa but through the efforts of woods the truth comes out but what should be a triumph only becomes a nightmare as woods and his family become targets for the secret police br br this movie has an interesting structure it has in fact two <UNK> first it <UNK> the life and death of biko it's an amazing first half completely dominated by the charisma of washington in what may be his greatest performance yet br br the second half no less interesting <UNK> woods attempt to escape from south africa to <UNK> a book about biko woods has become an enemy of state a banned person which means he can't meet people or leave his country plus he's constantly <UNK> by the police kevin kline gives a great performance in this second half too br br although the first half is quite straightforward the second does interesting things with editing by giving flashbacks of biko and of events that show the <UNK> against the black south <UNK> some may argue this is to make it more interesting but for me the second half just as captivating as woods and his family <UNK> a bold plan to escape south africa br br the last minutes were so heartbreaking i was in tears george <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> score certainly had something to do with it although i've never been much of a fan of <UNK> cannot stand his gandhi score i do think the score for cry freedom is one of the most beautiful ever composed for cinema the movie thanks to the music married to the powerful images at times reached incredible peaks of emotion br br cry freedom is definitely not a movie just to watch because of denzel washington this is a movie to be <UNK> in its entirety acting writing music editing cinematography come together in a perfect <UNK> to create an <UNK> to the power of the human spirit this movie deserve a place alongside movies like the <UNK> life is beautiful and the <UNK> redemption

<START> never heard of this movie saw it on dvd great movie perfect example of a movie that took every cast member to make it work no <UNK> typical hollywood movie with the same old <UNK> actors no current quote a list actor could have pulled off any performance in this movie brought back memories of my own post vietnam war military experiences it concentrated on the people who were sent to fight as was portrayed by the characters who had fears and emotions even if some <UNK> for service they were regular people too some just weren't cut out for military life i remember a few in my experience to put it mildly couldn't adapt to military life either but i'll never forget them should have stayed in touch i highly recommend it and then think about those serving present day in <UNK> basic training is a trip notice those <UNK> <UNK> aren't morning people and maybe they need sensitivity training ha ha ha
<START> don't get me wrong i love david <UNK> as <UNK> i love the series as well as the movies but enough already re death on the <UNK> everyone has done this one we know who dies we know why they die we know who the killer is we know how it was done so i say enough already mr <UNK> could have used that awesome talent in another one of agatha <UNK> novels i will say that the acting by all the actors was superb the sets were terrific and very realistic i especially liked david soul but i was surprised at how <UNK> he looked i hope he doesn't look that way in <UNK> life i honestly can't remember from other movies whether the very end was the same somehow i don't think so i thought that was a rather brilliant touch whether or not ms christie wrote it that way i would much rather have that ending then wasting away in prison
<START> whatever happened to keaton is what i want to know br br actually i don't i <UNK> away <UNK> thinking she must owe half the <UNK> in vegas or maybe not maybe she was just <UNK> <UNK> and bored to death rich enough to adopt a third world country she somehow had to star in yet another cookie cut cliché ridden <UNK> based on the same character franchise she's been <UNK> since <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> you'd think she's going head to head with mr bean br br spoilers br br so <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> fired by obnoxious son of boss his mom keaton leaves his dad after classic row and crashes over with her own dog show in <UNK> oh those little <UNK> <UNK> got cold feet for <UNK> duty <UNK> clock a <UNK> and hey let's toss in a space <UNK> as second house guest for good measure all in one day because that's so funny and original wife gets fed up and walks away mom leaves dad for space <UNK> and the couple makes up in time for closing credits <UNK> very long minutes later br br now if you have to have a space <UNK> he can't be <UNK> as well he can't scheme some excuse for his <UNK> and if mom leaves dad she can't hop into a cab dressed as a <UNK> just because some scriptwriter <UNK> over how to cheer thing up br br plus that gag <UNK> they invite her in only to then discover she's got her <UNK> <UNK> in the cab has got to be <UNK> by now and you only get one obnoxious 2 dimensional boss to <UNK> another movie killer would be the movie script the space <UNK> is <UNK> away at supposedly more lame than the actual one again <UNK> ad <UNK> br br <UNK> tyler doesn't seem happy here her voice was weird at times it had me wondering if they later had her <UNK> some of it and she's a smart one she's handled great roles and we'll forgive her for jersey girl it was disaster prone could happen to anyone <UNK> shepard was watchable and that's being generous considering the material br br personally it's the director the screenwriters and especially the producers that i would love to see <UNK> before <UNK> to <UNK> as <UNK> for the prisoners and that's me keeping this <UNK>
<START> by <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> is film by the one and only ralph bakshi is reportedly a satirical <UNK> of <UNK> films and negative black stereotypes as well as a look at life black in modern america modern for the day i mean 1975 paramount dropped it like a hot <UNK> that just burst into flame br br but this is a bakshi film controversial thrilling and a must see almost by definition alone not just another random shock jock of a movie which tries to shock for the sake of shock it's by ralph bakshi anyone who knows the name knows that if he made a movie he has something big to say br br although it's roots are based in cheap <UNK> <UNK> isn't just another campy knock off of mainstream white film or any kind of throwaway flick <UNK> wants to be more it aims it's sights higher and <UNK> some much bigger fish br br the movie doesn't just poke fun at the genre nor does it just <UNK> black people but actually seems to show love beauty and heart in the strangest places br br <UNK> tells a story out of some <UNK> awaiting a jail break the fact that it's even possible to break out of a prison in the <UNK> world alone makes it old fashioned br br one of the inmates tells a story about a trio of black brothers in harlem named brother bear brother rabbit preacher fox who want respect and a piece of the action and are willing to get it by any means necessary the <UNK> mob is running all the real action br br big name black musicians star barry white and <UNK> <UNK> as well as charles <UNK> the first black playwright to take home the <UNK> something big is happening here obviously br br the movie plays out like a descent into this world this side of the racial <UNK> from an angry hip deep <UNK> black man with a hate in his heart and a gun in his hand br br bakshi's films never know the meaning of the word <UNK> this one looks like it's never even heard of the word but maybe a subject like this needs <UNK> real <UNK> satire some subjects can't be <UNK> gently br br bakshi is god <UNK> <UNK> here no member or minority of the harlem scene appears <UNK> br br the characters here are animated to real all depending on what the mood and situation are the animated characters and the human ones all share the same reality and are meant to be taken just as literally br br bakshi never just shows ugly caricatures just for shock value he always has something to say nor is black face is <UNK> here unlike in spike lee's <UNK> he seems to be using it to try and really say something br br like 99 9 of all of bakshi's films this one <UNK> animation and live action usually at the same time <UNK> isn't just being <UNK> here all of this technique is all <UNK> <UNK> together while saying something br br somehow this one feels inevitably dated many of these types of films bakshi's included are very <UNK> very <UNK> of the moment they reflect the certain trend for the day but looking back of them years later there's just an <UNK> feeling of nostalgia as well as timeless truth br br even though the music clothes <UNK> and the city clearly looks like photos that belong in a time capsule the attitude the spirit and the heart remain the same no matter what f king ear it is anyone who's really seen the movies the state of things and has been in company of the people know what i'm talking about br br even some of the of the black characters are a bunny <UNK> a big ol' bear and a fox one of the most sour and <UNK> racist characters is a dirty harlem cop who's hot on the trail of these dirty n s after the death of a cop but for him it's not just business nor is it for the rest of the brothers who wear the shield it's just pure sadistic racist pleasure of hurting blacks br br the sequence involving the godfather and his lady is one of the most moving pieces in the whole film of which there are many it plays out like an opera or a ballet br br the <UNK> line warning this film <UNK> everybody this is not just hype proceed with extreme caution br br you have been warned br br by <UNK> <UNK>
<START> really really i know if you make a political war movie you will get noticed but this movie was just garbage horrible in every sense terribly inaccurate in so many ways i have an easier time believing the president of the united states <UNK> up flying a jet fighter and shooting down aliens it is easier to note the few things that were right my jaw dropped when i saw some one say that this movie was the best in the last 25 years it was <UNK> seemingly pointless plot <UNK> and had questionable cinematography at times br br x box youtube <UNK> <UNK> did anyone check that these things did not exist in 2004 it's not like you had to do extensive research it was only five years before this movie came out i am an iraq war veteran and if you spent one day with an <UNK> platoon or an <UNK> squad you would realize how b s this movie is to compare this to platoon or saving private ryan is ludicrous why don't you just throw <UNK> and red dawn in there too i think those might be more accurate br br if for some reason you can see past the unbelievable plot the historical and factual <UNK> then this movie might just be ok nothing more if you keep on hearing oscar buzz and have to add your own pompous review go right ahead as for me i am writing the director to see if i can get my <UNK> minutes back
<START> cameron diaz is a woman who is married to a judge played by harvey keitel whose life is fine until an ex shows up and things get a little complicated while i was watching this movie there were several times i asked myself why i was doing so because the movie is so ridiculous and blah and poorly scripted without any believability nor does the audience really car what happens even the lovely cameron can't save this one on a scale of one to ten 2
<START> this is a warm funny film in much the same vein as the works of <UNK> sure it has a 10 year old boy sucking milk from breasts but the style is so playful that i can't understand at all those readers who found it sick or perverted but would i be willing to let my 10 year old son play the part not so sure br br spanish cinema is often quite sexual but in a very open and healthy way that leaves the viewer without any sense of <UNK> or <UNK> i think that we if we northern european types had the same attitude we'd be much better off as a result br br this liberal attitude is also seen in the hilarious <UNK> <UNK> character as his lover says to him <UNK> people are embarrassed about <UNK> you turn it into an art form '
<START> surprisingly good early effort from alfred hitchcock one of the only original screenplays written by hitchcock himself this film shows remarkable story structure it kicks off with a rousing boxing match in which carnival <UNK> one round jack loses to a <UNK> from the audience who happens to be a professional <UNK> the movie then slows down to develop the characters and introduce a love triangle between jack his girl and the professional boxer the rest of the film is a dramatic <UNK> to the <UNK> between the two men this time for the <UNK> crown even in this early film hitchcock shows his talent for meaningful cinematography and prop placement an <UNK> bought for the girl by the boxer continues to pop up throughout the movie as a symbol of her <UNK> the only big <UNK> of this film is that the art of filming a boxing match had not yet been <UNK> in <UNK> the final match as a result ends up being somewhat <UNK> the story though is what carries this film through
<START> this is a very good spanish movie but i am worried that many out there will feel lost because many around the world have no idea what the spanish civil war was all about or when it was fought being a history teacher i had a big advantage but could easily see how the film could be confusing until you piece together all the pieces i doubt if this would be a big concern in spain where this film was made but for other audiences they may be a bit confused until later in the film br br the movie begins with 12 year old carol and her mother returning to her mother's home town years have passed and you gather that they are coming to spain from new york city despite the <UNK> carol speaks reasonably good spanish and much of the film is about how she <UNK> as for why her and her mother are alone i'll <UNK> it now for those who don't pick up on the fact that <UNK> father is fighting in the war on the side of the <UNK> who eventually lost in this very bloody conflict br br the movie gets exceptional marks for its lovely camera work and music the rather slow and rambling pace isn't bad provided you are someone who can accept films this way i have seen several other spanish films about this war and this <UNK> pretty well to them not better or worse just a decent slice of life film about those who are left behind as well as a nice coming of age flick br br ps if you don't know which side is which the <UNK> were mostly <UNK> and they were backed by the soviet union and mexico as well as <UNK> from many countries including the usa the <UNK> were led by franco and were aided by <UNK> and the fascist states of germany and italy
<START> the complaints are valid to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women i am okay with these night time <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> or ugly betty or west wing because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end however when the idea parallels the daytime <UNK> aimed at just putting hunky men <UNK> <UNK> tim <UNK> and chris <UNK> into sexual tension and <UNK> and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so called little hospital it seems like general hospital or a female counterpart to <UNK> that was what men wanted and they had it so if this is what women want so be it but the idea that this is a high brow show or something men will watch is unrealistic
<START> so back when <UNK> made his first appearance i was perfectly happy watching dean jones <UNK> away i only wanted to be entertained for a few hours and eat overly <UNK> popcorn now unfortunately i have expectations of a riveting delightful story whenever i watch a movie if i'm not on some sort of <UNK> and this is another good movie for the <UNK> there are no major laughs no complex plot lines no difficult twists <UNK> fully loaded is great for the fully loaded br br this was the first time i had seen la <UNK> on the screen since she <UNK> places with jamie lee curtis i thought she was excellent in that and i can't say i was terribly impressed this time around aside from her constantly changing and <UNK> unnatural hair color she just didn't ring true as the kid next door who had spent a lifetime hanging around road <UNK> her <UNK> for <UNK> wasn't portrayed consistently in the film perhaps it was elsewhere she looked older than her part and seemed to always be looking for something a party designer <UNK> new place to spend money off set i couldn't see any chemistry with justin long that romance seemed obligatory at best the only time lindsay appeared engaged was when she was <UNK> with matt dillon who i thought was appropriately over the top as evil bad guy trip murphy br br it was great to see <UNK> again and i loved the movie intro with material from the old movies if disney had popped out with some car <UNK> jewelry i might have worn some just to be loyal his new feature was a little inconsistent does he channel the thoughts of his driver does he now <UNK> but whatever we all knew how it was going to end but i do wish he had ended up with someone a little less dopey than maggie and my head still hurts from that lesson maggie and we viewers had <UNK> home br br what would have made the movie worthwhile have the old <UNK> in a real story with a real plot at the very least <UNK> as good as <UNK> but clearly that's asking too much why is it that disney always goes back to the same well as <UNK> goes <UNK> and the computer that wore <UNK> shoes when it comes to <UNK> br br i'm sure this was a great movie for kids and those with no expectations for the rest of us it's for when you have the <UNK> and just can't take the suspense of rear window
<START> <UNK> from <UNK> bar started making realistic films which some people called dry br br he made <UNK> which was another realistic though <UNK> film but a great film br br <UNK> men at work was a formula film by him which <UNK> br br he returns with his <UNK> page 3 br br a film which <UNK> into the lives of <UNK> and it's a brilliant film br br the film is well narrated though the half baked romantic portions of <UNK> could be avoided but that is forgiven br br the entire <UNK> <UNK> track is superb too br br while the <UNK> <UNK> track is great too br br the <UNK> between <UNK> <UNK> and his friends are funny at first but repetitive at times br br the subplot of <UNK> tara is brilliant and so is the entire hospital scene and also the final child abuse which shocks you br br the film has a open ended ending which is nicely handled br br <UNK> does a great job music is okay br br <UNK> excels as <UNK> using her expressions to the best tara <UNK> is decent except her voice <UNK> <UNK> is good as usual <UNK> <UNK> excels in his part as the cop one of the talented actors sadly he isn't used well <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> too is good in his small part <UNK> <UNK> is restrained and does a great job rest are okay
<START> the storyline is absurd and lame also sucking are performances and the dialogue is hard to keep your eyes open i advise you to have a <UNK> <UNK> friend handy to wake you in time for a couple gore effects why they bring <UNK> in in this case becomes increasingly difficult to swallow all the while i wondered who this film aimed for chock full of lame subplots such as the <UNK> us army captain this is low grade in every aspect btw this movie is banned in germany
<START> <UNK> of the swamp was made by low budget studio <UNK> and is certainly one of their best movies i've seen br br a man who was <UNK> for a murder he didn't commit returns as a ghost for revenge on the people who accused him he uses a rope to <UNK> his victims and after several deaths including the old man who <UNK> the ferry across the swamp he disappears the old man's <UNK> takes over the ferry herself and also falls in love with one of the local men and they decide to get married br br this movie has plenty of <UNK> <UNK> which makes it very creepy too br br the cast includes <UNK> la <UNK> blake <UNK> and charles <UNK> flash gordon as the <UNK> br br <UNK> of the swamp is a must for old horror fans like myself excellent br br rating 3 and a half stars out of 5
<START> <UNK> <UNK> facial expressions are great again in this movie when you enter 40 and have been single for a while or all your life you may feel you are wasting away the movie is a sweet reminder that love can be found just anywhere if your <UNK> is <UNK> active i liked the quick sexual encounter which must be out of character for a normally reserved school teacher <UNK> her ex student is cute enough still carrying a crush on his teacher for so long br br there are some parts that i thought rather unrealistic or <UNK> though for example at a scene where the other women's jealousy <UNK> and a scene was set up to make <UNK> <UNK> dump the young man would a mature police officer the other friend of <UNK> allow her friend to do such a sinister act is it so easy for anyone to not stop in front of a car of course <UNK> happen all the time but i hoped to see the heroine get happily married with the first man she got involved with that was the hardest part to believe for such a beautiful woman to stay single for so long br br maybe the movie producers are aware of the fact that many romance between an older woman and a younger man do not last for long beside they know that a happy ending would not appeal to the public especially to jealousy women over 40 who are waiting some <UNK> to happen the sad ending with a glimpse of hope for the sad woman who lost her true love is sweet but if the man continued to live would that last for how long nobody knows nonetheless it's a movie to make you want to watch it again sometime later a year later maybe
<START> the 4th pokemon movie made me cry when <UNK> died don't you dare say that pokemon sucks i don't like it when people say that i've liked pokemon for 5 or 6 years so everyone should enjoy pokemon including this movie and other pokemon movies so without further <UNK> please say that pokemon is great and should be enjoyed by people for all ages and also why do pokemon <UNK> give low ratings for all or most of the pokemon movies i don't understand they shouldn't do that there's absolutely no reason why people should just vote without proving that pokemon sucks besides the fact that 1 pokemon is for little kids only 2 pokemon is stupid and 3 people shouldn't like pokemon i think this is why people don't like pokemon
<START> i found grey <UNK> to be a gripping film an amazingly intimate br br look at too <UNK> who basically have the right idea forget br br society and live in a <UNK> house with no <UNK> and a huge br br <UNK> of cats and <UNK> <UNK> their own interests rather br br <UNK> all the while <UNK> at the camera br br big edie and little edie are the two <UNK> that the <UNK> bros br br have chosen to document they seem like characters out of a br br fellini film only stranger if that makes any sense old edie is br br almost fully <UNK> a pile of papers clothes and dirty <UNK> br br growing around her little edie is even more interesting she br br <UNK> around the house always wearing a <UNK> like br br <UNK> around her head completely covering her hair we br br never see her hair throughout the film nor do we ever get a hint br br that she still has much at age fifty eight though she is still br br beautiful and full of life br br in grey gardens we get the sense that both of these women's br br lives have become much less than what they once were little br br edie is probably the <UNK> of the two while her mother in her br br earlier years got married made a family lived <UNK> and br br even made some <UNK> the scene where at <UNK> she sings br br along with a recording of tea for two she made decades ago is br br one of the films best scenes edie left her <UNK> career as a br br model to take care of her <UNK> mother at <UNK> she still <UNK> to br br find her prince charming if anything little edie is still a little girl br br full of dreams of <UNK> and fame and of domestic and romantic br br bliss that have yet to be <UNK> br br highlights of the film include the opening moments where little br br edie explains her outfit to the camera the tea for two sequence br br the birthday party the climactic argument the <UNK> deliver br br scene and the scene in the attic the whole thing is incredibly br br <UNK> and <UNK> and it's made all the more <UNK> br br since it's all real br br i suggest seeing grey gardens back to back with the kenneth br br anger short <UNK> moment the <UNK> dvd is 35 00 but it's br br worth every penny
<START> having read the other comments on this film i would like to share my own view that this is one tough movie to see unless you are a total <UNK> i am not br br when looked at by a purely objective <UNK> the film is an <UNK> narrative that presents us with more <UNK> <UNK> than are capable of being absorbed in one sitting it is quite difficult to watch the brooks character robert cole is so unsympathetic and unpleasant that it is hard to relate to him let alone root for him as he stumbles from one dysfunctional self absorbed situation to the next and he should never do a topless scene and expect to be taken seriously in a romantic context no man could have that much exposed <UNK> and be supposed to turn on a babe like kathryn <UNK> unless of course he is albert brooks in an albert brooks controlled production br br modern romance has its amusing moments but they are <UNK> and <UNK> more often than not i felt as if i were on a confined journey with a thoroughly <UNK> person and wishing that it would end already it <UNK> the problems that can develop when too much control of a film is placed in only one person someone who lacks the self discipline to be able to step back from it and see what is clearly happening br br as most people probably know james l brooks who played the director in this film is in fact what he portrayed six years later he cast albert brooks in the very successful broadcast news james showed us how albert can shape a credible and entertaining comic performance albert allowed us to see james generally not cast as an actor do a rare comic turn in a surprisingly effective manner br br fans of modern romance will by now have moved on to the next <UNK> comment about it to you i say there is enough pain in the world without having to find it in a film intended as an entertainment
<START> opening the film with a bach <UNK> is an <UNK> hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama all the <UNK> devices bach <UNK> to keep his <UNK> and the performer intrigued and entertained applies to this film there isn't a mutual <UNK> between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene i feel is justified in stating she was raped even though her <UNK> feels she was <UNK> that he was a <UNK> mamet <UNK> explores the emotional <UNK> and differences between the <UNK> but i feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment one another given a healthy sense of humor if mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the <UNK> i wonder how this work would have ended as it exists it is very somber and mean spirited
<START> i've always thought that most huge box office <UNK> usually have something to recommend them but after the remake of around the world in 80 days and thunderbirds i'm beginning to doubt it for those not familiar it's based on a puppet show about a family of <UNK> who use state of the art rockets <UNK> and <UNK> to rescue people from various disasters falling bridges stricken planes burning buildings etc each week well the puppets are gone replaced by far more lifeless teenagers and so is the premise only one <UNK> staged rescue and a plot shamelessly ripped off from spy kids without any signs of imagination wit or entertainment young alan <UNK> feels left out of all the <UNK> we never see the other <UNK> do because dad won't let him play with a real rocket until he passes his <UNK> grounded on a beautiful <UNK> island some punishment his chance to shine comes when the rest of the family a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who look like a gay neo nazi boy band without a single bit of characterisation between them are stranded in space and he has to have the day by er running around the jungle making a phone call firing a <UNK> at the inept comedy relief villains and <UNK> them in <UNK> for bad measure br br the good points are few and far between one of them is that the film is mostly in focus the other is they all got to go to the <UNK> which looks nice br br the bad points where to start ben <UNK> career <UNK> performance the aforementioned inept comedy relief <UNK> who would disgrace the children's film foundation at its worst the almost complete lack of action or effects in a <UNK> sci fi film the terrible script the lifeless direction the <UNK> <UNK> but most of all is the fact that the film is so <UNK> in every possible way forget the life lessons and off the <UNK> sentiment this is a movie aimed straight at the under <UNK> by people who know they're making a kid's movie and are constantly talking down to their intended audience throwing in fifth rate jokes and routines that would insult most children who had only recently <UNK> the art of speech this film could replace being sent to bed early without their dinner as parents' favourite punishment for kids br br the biggest flop in british film history it didn't even cover the cost of <UNK> and marketing it's just about watchable if only as an object lesson in how not to make a summer movie
<START> br br filmed just after the war this story was made in order to highlight <UNK> american relations after the war it ended up receiving the honour of being the first royal premiere after wwii br br remarkably the film <UNK> together the royal air force <UNK> <UNK> psychology the <UNK> fathers of america and various others up the long stairs special effects in its <UNK> and beyond the heavenly gates without losing any of its integrity br br although sounding absurd this clever script leads and dances the viewer between heaven and earth with the skill of a mountain goat and a presents a charming ease rarely matched in cinema since br br be prepared to have your heart <UNK> by this sweet innocent and charming love story roger <UNK> acts like a man possessed to steal the show br br british cinema should cry when it remembers how good it used to be in those early post war years br br
<START> the movie was sub par but this television pilot delivers a great <UNK> into what has become a sci fi fans ideal program the actors deliver and the special effects for a television series are spectacular having an intelligent interesting script doesn't hurt either br br stargate <UNK> is currently one of my favorite programs
<START> if this film strikes you as it did us and apparently others <UNK> the theater as <UNK> thin it may be because the subject herself is mildly disappointing the film <UNK> presents us bettie page as she probably was a playful almost innocent from the rural south whose career as the <UNK> queen of the universe was for her just goofy natural fun her eventual moral <UNK> religious <UNK> and sudden departure from nude and bondage <UNK> are <UNK> accurate yet hard to understand given how <UNK> she seemed by her <UNK> br br there are many reasons to see this film even so not least of which are the amazing b w noir cinematography of w <UNK> <UNK> iii complete with old fashioned <UNK> and <UNK> the 1950's faithful acting of the cast under the direction of mary harron pitch perfect performances by some of our most underrated supporting actors including chris bauer <UNK> taylor sarah <UNK> austin <UNK> dallas roberts and victor <UNK> not to mention the oscar worthy and technically difficult lead performance of gretchen mol br br ms mol does several scenes fully naked and most others in amazing period <UNK> and <UNK> costumes <UNK> assembled by costume designer john a <UNK> yet she astonishingly maintains bettie <UNK> <UNK> pleasure in her lush body to watch ms mol as ms page an aspiring actress <UNK> through degrees of <UNK> less bad <UNK> and student acting scenes is to see a truly fine actress in complete control of her craft br br the script does effectively bring us into 1950's america where childhood sexual abuse <UNK> <UNK> and rape and the legal <UNK> of <UNK> of pornography which today seem laughably tame is a reality 50's new york is <UNK> with <UNK> inter cut news reel footage 50's miami comes alive in super <UNK> <UNK> style color the real bettie page seems to <UNK> smile and pose before us and yet the effect is curiously lightweight barely <UNK> and not at all dangerous br br how odd that <UNK> greatest icon should be so lacking in <UNK> and that this technically excellent biopic should have so little <UNK>
<START> a common <UNK> in films consists of the main characters leaving the <UNK> and <UNK> of the city behind and finding themselves in the <UNK> of nature in power of <UNK> <UNK> we are shown two stories of individuals doing just that trying to find themselves through a trip to the popular korean parks in the mountains of <UNK> <UNK> however rather than <UNK> moments we have two characters whose trip into nature was just another form of escape br br the pace of this movie is slow <UNK> we learn in the end what really brought each to <UNK> <UNK> and we learn how they're connected for those who want hollywood <UNK> and for a movie to give them a definitive answer this movie will not satisfy but for those who want a movie that leaves them thinking wondering affecting them years after this movie will more than <UNK> that longing
<START> this is a movie that i can watch over and over and never ever get tired of it it has <UNK> of laughs guns action crime good one liners and a decent plot with an over the top donald sutherland in a rather comedic role as an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> looks as hot as she ever did and can act too thomas ian <UNK> is great in this as the lead character max a <UNK> agent diane is the fbi agent played by <UNK> and john <UNK> from <UNK> on tv plays the bad guy <UNK> the plot centers around max and diane trying to capture <UNK> while they fight and argue with each other about who gets the money for the respective <UNK> throw into the mix the <UNK> sutherland who pretty much has all the good one liners this is the perfect crime caper there is the usual love story but played very differently than you would think by <UNK> and griffith you also have the russian mafia italian mafia and <UNK> mafia here thrown into the mix the film is shot in boston where you have some great shots and locals great photography and music in this film this movie is just the epitome of a crime comedy it has everything that one could ever want check out <UNK> toilet in a particular scene very unusual this film is a riot and will make you laugh real hard 10 plus for me
<START> well the <UNK> of cannes may have liked this film but not me i am afraid if you like the type of film where shots <UNK> for so long that you wonder whether the actor has fallen asleep or the cameraman gone for lunch then it may be for you a large part of it is like this with short <UNK> into the realm of <UNK> i did not find it shocking nor disturbing as some other reviewers have simply a little <UNK> and pointless the only reason i did not give this one star is that the acting is commendable <UNK> the film is fairly well shot the plot however has little to recommend a large part of the film just shows a grumpy woman teaching or listening to piano which might appeal to some people but <UNK> you think this is harmless enough be prepared for some <UNK> of pornography and sexual violence just to wake you up with a bad taste in your mouth not recommended
<START> once in a while in indian cinema there comes along a movie like sholay that changes the way the audience <UNK> a good movie and <UNK> just once in a while hopefully we have a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that breaks all the standards and creates one of its own a standard so low it can never be broken ram <UNK> <UNK> manages to take a melting pot of talent and create a dish so stale u can smell it from a distance to take a classic like sholay and <UNK> it is totally unforgivable and i can't believe he almost called the movie <UNK> <UNK> sholay although sholay had a lot of <UNK> elements in it the movie managed to build on its plot by merely defining the characters so <UNK> that they lived on forever what <UNK> does is take these characters and mess them up so badly <UNK> need a contest to pick the worst the realism element is totally missing and what the movie ends up providing is a bunch of actors <UNK> along in a plot less and seemingly unrelated set of events one star for this film is a ridiculous waste of a vote its time for <UNK> to wake up to the reality of his failure and <UNK> up another different plot that can be <UNK> under cinema
<START> i am ashamed to have this movie in my collection the most redeeming factor to <UNK> the dvd is the short film in the bonus features my vote for this movie is a big fat zero don't <UNK> i'm a horror girl but i want some meat behind the story not to mention i prefer the evil to happen to humans not to be tricked in to watching what seemed like forever clips of animal snuff acts of brutality <UNK> <UNK> long silence and poor acting if i was forced to make a comparison to another film the only one that comes to mind is cannibal holocaust bad boring pointless and a wholly uncomfortable watch
<START> the movie is absolutely silly br br but were you expecting a high brow intellectual film based on a comic called slam <UNK> really jay <UNK> acting isn't exactly the most moving thing i've ever seen but i certainly enjoyed the movie was it somewhere near the level of awesome that someone like jet li or stephen <UNK> can produce no not really was it thoroughly entertaining if you're just taking it at surface value absolutely it's a movie about some chinese eye candy <UNK> and musicians who can play basketball at an unreal level of expertise there's an evil <UNK> style dude and a wacky scheming guy who gets jay <UNK> involved in all of this a love interest it's formulaic but really suspend disbelief for a while come on it's called kung fu <UNK> what do you really think you signed on for do yourself a favor if you watch it i found myself a copy with some <UNK> subtitles that made the movie <UNK> <UNK> conversation wise but we got a great laugh out of it they would appear to be extremely <UNK> on <UNK> and the numbers 1 10 br br i laughed i cried i <UNK> i'd watch it again br br especially for that fight scene in the bar well choreographed and well shot i especially enjoy the <UNK> lit pool table i'd love to play on one of those br br slick enough for me but i dig on trash cinema
<START> moon child was one of the more symbolic movies i've seen what i really liked about it was the <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> and the obstacles and <UNK> through life the movie depicts a great deal of vampire <UNK> having the power of <UNK> and the <UNK> to it whether if it is having supernatural abilities or <UNK> life these are what humans usually wish for moon child shows the pain and <UNK> of being immortal since the feelings towards loss <UNK> almost all the characters especially to the main characters sho and <UNK> the meaning of the title <UNK> <UNK> reveals as the film comes close to the end where it clearly shows that everyone is a moon which shines other people's way giving <UNK> i personality quite like that moral the movie depicted on the weaknesses of the film lies in some parts of the acting and special effects since it made the film less authentic the scene where character <UNK> dies could have been more powerful and realistic if more authentic emotions in the acting were put into it some scenes with special effects like the gun shots also could have been more authentic without making it seem too much like an action video game the sparks that came out of the guns appeared too fake and i think that could have been eliminated or fixed nevertheless i think moon child should be a movie everyone should consider watching the symbolic ideas and images the movie brings out would be easily accepted by everyone and may interest many viewers it is quite a thoughtful film and also entertaining to watch
<START> ok anyone who could honestly say that this movie was great or even good is either <UNK> or knows the director writer and producers and is trying to boost the buzz on this film i watched the movie because a friend of mine worked on it and it was horrible i'm an actress and have worked in the industry for a while now on big films and even <UNK> and this movie bored me to tears the reason i'm being so harsh is because this film was clearly a different take on of mice and men and they should sue because it is such a horrible rip off of the story in an industry where hollywood seems to be <UNK> <UNK> for someone to take a classic book and film of mice and men and destroy it with a new spin bugs me so much the actors the accents the dialog and the direction were amateurish and the writing was dismal i mean if your going to take a new spin on an existing story make sure its just as good or better than the original to make the new spin justified did not like this movie at all
<START> having read the reviews for this film i understandably started watching it with a great deal of doubt in my mind that it would actually be any good however this is one of the best films i have seen in a long time the majority of reviews that i had read said that the complicated plot made it too hard to follow and whilst some parts do leave you confused the ending ties up so many loose ends that you feel like kicking yourself because you've missed so much it's not like lock stock or snatch in the sense that it isn't that funny in fact it's pretty dark and it is a lot more intelligent in the way that you see parts of scenes from different <UNK> and in one of the best scenes of the film jason <UNK> spends five minutes in a lift having an argument with himself the way in which it is similar to the two films i just mentioned is that it is full of memorable characters specifically <UNK> who gives a fantastic performance as the lead and ray liotta who spends most of the film in <UNK> but gives a great performance none the less if you've got time and have time afterwards to think about the film and even watch it again you really start to see all the symbolism and hints that are laid out through the film i think it's fantastic and that guy ritchie is a director on top of his game
<START> incredibly muddled off putting and ultimately ludicrous the horses oh my god the horses thriller it's creepy at times but it has one of the worst scripts ever written for a horror film watch how in the final 10 minutes everybody magically does exactly what the plot needs for the resolution to occur bland performances by the leads a typically eccentric one by richard lynch the video transfer is a real hack job cutting scenes in half and making the movie even more difficult to understand 0 out of 4 stars
<START> my expectations were quite high for this film everyone i know who saw this film at the cinema told me that everyone there stayed through the credits because they were so touched my expectations could not have been any higher anything short of wonderful would have disappointed me br br i was anything but disappointed by this movie i loved how it dealt with difficult subjects without going through the usual steps a hollywood film tends to include in this film characters worked through problems they had had for decades they worked through <UNK> they learned to open up but it did not come easily and not just by singing a song or two it was painful it took arguments it took <UNK> it felt like real life br br one scene that really stuck out to me was the scene in which <UNK> sings her song helen <UNK> is one of my favorite singers her voice is lovely and you could tell that she was not just lip <UNK> to a previous recording during filming which i often find in other movies she really sang with her whole body and soul you could feel what <UNK> was feeling in that scene had this movie been made in hollywood her song would most likely have been sung toward the end and it would have made her husband open his eyes and see the error of his ways as well as making the other people in the village realise a thing or two instead it came halfway through and it did not bring any <UNK> her husband did not become overwhelmed and realise what he's putting her through and it didn't seem to make anyone else in the village more open minded it was beautiful it was pure and it was touching but it did not magically solve all her problems that felt real to me that's probably what would have happened in real life the whole movie felt like real life to me nothing neatly wrapped up but everything with a sense of joy and happiness you rarely find a movie which feels so realistic br br there were a few things that bothered me but hey no movie is perfect if you haven't already you should go see as it is in heaven and be filled with a joy for life a sense of hope and the feeling that you've been touched on a level movies rarely reach you will be sad <UNK> happy and a dozen other emotions br br someone once said that if every person in the world sang in a choir there would be no more wars having seen this film i might have to agree
<START> if is the cinematic equivalent of sgt <UNK> <UNK> by baby <UNK> as the <UNK> of creation and viewed as rather a silly bit of business by <UNK> and subsequent generations now that the children of the middle classes the world over are seemingly super human due to the internet and view the <UNK> of <UNK> school as a wonderful opportunity thanks to the harry potter books films the relevance of if couldn't be further from modern concern in fact many scenes appear so alien and exaggerated as to hint at an inspiration for pink <UNK> the wall br br one should never hold personal bias against a film while reviewing and the <UNK> date of this film aside there are a few flaws which others have overlooked lindsay anderson was known to be a fan of luis <UNK> on top of generally being too smart for his own good and despite a straightforward narrative through the first and second acts the latter portion of the piece it taken hostage by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and strained attempts at symbolism anderson wasn't capable of this feat due to his over intelligent cynicism failing to see that <UNK> was <UNK> in his work i have not found a critic whom <UNK> the <UNK> in a <UNK> and am almost certain it still gets <UNK> looks from those who adore this film the ending is not so much a <UNK> punch to the established class values system as a wet slap on a moving target br br the british public school system was firmly for the middle classes the upper <UNK> being educated at home by private <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> of if was to check the boxes of public school life which lindsay believed had been <UNK> in film thereby <UNK> middle class <UNK> homosexuality <UNK> <UNK> cold <UNK> et al in reality such issues had been covered in many other great british films if merely brought them to the <UNK> the <UNK> version was a more <UNK> <UNK> of such <UNK> to name but one br br if is oddly quaint and simply can not be viewed with modern especially american eyes kudos to anderson for avoiding mick and <UNK> in favour of african <UNK> and a few <UNK> points for the <UNK> <UNK> overtones points <UNK> for <UNK> establishing characters who disappear and <UNK> a <UNK> revolution which came to <UNK>
<START> yes it was a little low budget but this movie shows love the only bad things about it was that you can tell the budget on this film would not compare to <UNK> and though the plot was good the film never really <UNK> into it's full potential strong performances from everyone and the suspense makes it worthwhile to watch on a rainy night
<START> what was this supposed to be a remake of fisher king why do we care about <UNK> character what a slow dreary boring who gives a damn about these people movie just simply painful to sit through i turned it off before it was over it's so obvious that cheadle needs help as much as sandler like i said can you say fisher king and how does this psychotic character function in his daily life we aren't supposed to think that deeply i guess why does cheadle continue to give sandler a chance to turn violent on him if they were such good friends how did they grow apart if cheadle is so in control why does he keep seeking the advice of the shrink on the street we are never told that's why fisher king was a better film on so many levels and why this just sucks nearly 8 out of 10 average score i don't agree at all even the top films are lucky to get such a high average rating and this crap doesn't deserve to be in the same universe with them
<START> ok forget all the technical <UNK> or the physical <UNK> of the space <UNK> accidentally being launched by a quirky robot with a heart of gold forget the hideous special effects and poorly constructed one dimensional characters just looking at the premise of the story the very reason for the film to exist in the first place and you will see just how badly this film was <UNK> together br br i know 9 year olds that look at this insult to the intelligence and just laugh at it the story is horrible the acting is comical and the message its trying to show is incomprehensible and whats worse is that the cable movie channels keep showing it its on twice a day every two or three days why does anyone in their right mind think that people would want to see this painful piece of celluloid multiple times much less to see it at all br br my <UNK> is dont even bother spending the energy to watch this thing its just not worth it
<START> <UNK> <UNK> was exceptional but <UNK> <UNK> comes too late we already have enough of this and we want something new br br big directors should have no problems seeing beyond their time not behind why people see romania only as a <UNK> country br br we are just born not <UNK> and nobody gives a s t anymore about old times most people dont remember or dont want to remember and the new generation of movie <UNK> dont understand a bit this should be the first day of romanian movie not the final song <UNK> maybe younger directors should make the move
<START> what is it is a <UNK> mash of bizarre recurring <UNK> <UNK> shirley temple <UNK> and overtly racist music among others <UNK> by any sort of narrative or plot or character development the whole thing struck me as self <UNK> freak show and i don't mean only the unusual casting decisions it has the feel of a bad acid trip far beyond any level of drug use one might <UNK> to hunter s thompson or william s <UNK> the only movie to which i can compare it is <UNK> my second least favorite film of all time which was by intent much more depressing but i still found what is it a total waste of my time it's one thing to give me a <UNK> into the inner <UNK> of someone else's mind even someone else's <UNK> altered consciousness but quite another to just throw weird visuals at me purely for the sake of weirdness
<START> i sat through almost one episode of this series and just couldn't take anymore it felt as though i'd watched dozens of episodes already and then it hit me there's nothing new here i've heard that joke on seinfeld i saw someone fall like that on friends an episode of happy days had almost the same storyline <UNK> none of the actors are interesting here either some were good on other shows not here and others are new to a profession they should have never entered avoid this stinker
<START> this collection really sucks br br i rented it thinking <UNK> really would enjoy some good fighting man this sucked quick flashy cuts an extremely annoying <UNK> and the fights them <UNK> were heavily edited and <UNK> <UNK> thinking especially of jet <UNK> fight in <UNK> of legend and jackie <UNK> fight from drunken master 2 br br and <UNK> the deal with those <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> so cool about that <UNK> seen more interesting fights on martial law br br this a stupid collection of cuts for stupid people br br do not ever buy this film do not encourage the people who made this crap to make more of this crap br br instead go buy the movies the fights were from and <UNK> the fights in their uncut glory
<START> the story deals about jet li who has to fight against his old br br friends but there is one problem the friends are <UNK> the film is filled with blood super action and the best stunts forever and <UNK> <UNK> wan is a great co actor of course the movie has the typical hk fun but i love it in germany black mask is uncut
<START> david duchovny and michelle forbes play a young journalist couple who want to go to california but can't really afford to so they <UNK> share with another young couple brad pitt and juliette lewis to save on <UNK> the idea is for them to stop at various murder sites along the way sites where serial killers did their thing since brian duchovny is a writer and carrie forbes is his photographer what they don't know is that pitt <UNK> and lewis are serial killer and girlfriend who just goes along with whatever he says i don't care for pitt as a rule but he does justice to psycho roles the scary thing is that he does them so well i've actually known people like him before no not killers but with pretty much the same mindset anyway as the road trip goes along carrie <UNK> that the others are about out of money but <UNK> seems to always come up with the cash somehow never mind that he leaves someone dead here and there to do it though lewis does her role well one that she excels at a not too bright <UNK> that has a good heart but doesn't understand that she doesn't have to put up with being beaten up by <UNK> when she does something he doesn't like as things begin to get more <UNK> carrie insists that the other couple be put out at a gas station and unfortunately it's at that point where she's inside that she sees a news <UNK> that tells her exactly who they've been ride sharing with after which things go downhill for them at a rapid clip this is not the greatest flick in the world but it's not bad i watched what was supposed to be the <UNK> version but i wonder how much was cut out of the rated version because this seemed fairly tame to me really not that this makes it family fare or anything unless it's maybe the <UNK> family 7 out of 10
<START> it was a serious attempt to show the developing sexuality of two <UNK> and did not try to exploit its <UNK> even by today's standards the film is interesting and <UNK> br br <UNK> and isabelle are both attending the same girl's <UNK> <UNK> is energetic intelligent and becomes a mentor for the innocent naive sweet <UNK> she <UNK> her through a number of exotic experiences including a trip through an <UNK> <UNK> into her first lesbian <UNK> and <UNK> into her first <UNK> <UNK> br br the film does not exploit any sex nor is there an abundance of nudity the imagery is effective but sometimes the camera <UNK> too long and the story goes <UNK> br br the director <UNK> <UNK> went on to make a number of explicit erotic films under the name of henry <UNK> he always has extremely detailed stories good acting and very high standards of cinematography br br artistically however this is perhaps his most <UNK> his later attempts <UNK> for entertainment whereas <UNK> and isabelle was a study into the nature of youthful <UNK>
<START> an <UNK> truth is as entirely simplistic and <UNK> as the turgid <UNK> created by the <UNK> and idiotic <UNK> it <UNK> along <UNK> lines until it attempts to <UNK> something into your face namely that we'll all be dead in a few hundred years which is already <UNK> but who cares humans are selfish destructive creatures i frankly do not waste my time caring about human <UNK> i'll just call it a natural progression let the apocalypse begin but meanwhile we have to listen to the same <UNK> <UNK> politicians who <UNK> another new society well don't be fooled we'll all still be controlled by the wealthy by those in power and by those idiots who created the <UNK> in the first place nothing will ever change br br al gore whose <UNK> is quite evident in the film as he is being driven in a gas <UNK> car all alone using a <UNK> computer he also lives on huge <UNK> of land in a rather large mansion the land itself was used for destructive <UNK> purposes including cattle <UNK> pig <UNK> which accounts for <UNK> gas <UNK> and who knows what else his wealth is <UNK> on exploitation greed and his <UNK> include numerous large companies in the world with <UNK> records i hardly think this man is <UNK> to lecture the less fortunate but his <UNK> is based on his opposition to another ludicrous political party that is all meanwhile he <UNK> those very same <UNK> characteristics that make politics and politicians so appalling this <UNK> happens to be living the comfortable life and yet he's <UNK> poor people in africa about crop <UNK> and cut and burn techniques he travels across the world in first class seats in fuel wasting <UNK> uses product placed computers in the documentary and yet he thinks everything is a moral issue he's entirely absorbed in his own <UNK> nightmares he says he came to these conclusions because of the death of his sister from <UNK> induced cancer and the near death of his son by an <UNK> of all things did he fight against the <UNK> companies or <UNK> that <UNK> be banned because they are dangerous <UNK> machines no everything must serve the economy so why is he any different the answer is he is not br br his <UNK> and exhausted attempts at <UNK> philosophy are disastrous all this while he's being filmed in the forest or along a little river <UNK> stale life <UNK> quotes well mr gore why don't you try living like the common people then he is a politician plain and simple he has a career invested in the power structure my question is why doesn't he concentrate on the powerful industrial nations of the earth who are to blame for most of the complications he doesn't do that because it would be <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> br br al gore gives monotonous <UNK> about the subject in the documentary namely to wealthy white people in the audience who <UNK> on cue while showing them <UNK> <UNK> numbers and <UNK> and speaking in a dreary tone no one without a <UNK> which the <UNK> control education can make sense out of it but he tells us everything is going to hell no kidding but i think he fails to account for this problem precisely in the approach that capitalism has taken for the planet namely that it is <UNK> and a waste dump he never once mentions how <UNK> has created these problems he just wants to put mild <UNK> on them but not <UNK> the whole oppressive system its obvious he was spoiled sent to the schools for <UNK> and has the same basic <UNK> for politics as any other back stabbing inconsistent <UNK> in washington whoever made this propaganda as it is in no way different than what the <UNK> have conceived had only goals in mind that were directed by <UNK> <UNK> that is to say someone is going to benefit and it seems the new green politicians who support venture <UNK> companies who are buying up <UNK> of land in an attempt to develop the new <UNK> future with new <UNK> it's the same old story al gore is a believer in the <UNK> structure he actually believes there is a democracy in the us which i find very naive if we aren't paying <UNK> to the oil companies then we'll be paying them to the wind and <UNK> companies br br i find the speech at the end quite <UNK> along the lines of something <UNK> bush would have <UNK> over to the dumb <UNK> masses gore speaks about people <UNK> together to defeat communism in the 1990's what it had to do with global warming absolutely nothing but he attempts to get base emotions <UNK> in people with that said he didn't understand that communism never existed in the world the systems in europe and <UNK> were merely a <UNK> form of <UNK> and capitalism no less different than what controls the us interests social <UNK> was not even mentioned here which is really a travesty if you want to change the world then one must <UNK> of those <UNK> systems that are based on greed exploitation and violence
<START> once again i was <UNK> through the <UNK> video bin and picked up this movie for 4 <UNK> fifty percent of the time the movies i find in the bin are pure crap i mean horrible beyond belief but half the time they turn out to be surprisingly good this movie is much better than i expected i found it very engaging though it was obviously made by an amateur br br the direction is nothing special but the story is intriguing with some good thrills i expected it to be more of a comedy but i wasn't too disappointed br br for a thriller this movie is surprisingly good natured there's no bloody violence no profanity no nudity no sex usually these movies require all four of those elements the pg rating is well deserved not like sixteen <UNK> where the f word is used twice and there's a brief gratuitous nude scene br br i just wish the romance between corey <UNK> and his love interest could've been developed more the film does tend to be plot heavy and the potentially good subplots are pushed off to the side instead of developing a chemistry between the two of them we end up watching a <UNK> three minute montage of them on their romantic <UNK> they end up kissing at the end but there's so little chemistry that it seems forced br br the dream machine is no gem but it's good clean entertainment it's quite forgettable especially with a cast of <UNK> except for <UNK> but it's also much better than you'd expect br br my score 7 out of 10
<START> in sixth grade every teacher i had decided it would be a great idea to make this movie the <UNK> for an entire <UNK> every class had something to do with this terrible show we watched it in english and wrote in <UNK> as if we were one of the characters in <UNK> we talked about <UNK> and other sea crap in science we talked about <UNK> which was actually somewhat interesting so this wasn't a 100 waste of time all day everyday was torture not only that but they would subject us to this horror twice a day by making us watch it in study hall as well i could see if this was a new series or something but it was like <UNK> i'm still trying to block this out
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is one of the most important italian directors my parents and i watched together <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on a summer night we liked it but we didn't love it as we loved a special day i believe <UNK> <UNK> is pretty underrated we often forget to remember him maybe because his latest films were disappointing and so yesterday night my mum and i sat on our <UNK> to enjoy this masterpiece writing direction cinematography score and production design were sober and accurate but the thing i liked the most was the chemistry between loren and mastroianni they're both excellent actors and play the main roles of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is an housewife married with a fanatic fascist she has six children but her husband wants to have another child to get a prize for the huge families <UNK> is simply an anti fascist they spend together a special day that special day of 1938 when hitler came to rome visiting <UNK> i don't want to spoil anymore about the plot go looking for this film
<START> this was a <UNK> funny comedy with a great cast john ritter and <UNK> <UNK> were perfectly cast as the parents and the kids were great too <UNK> <UNK> was a good choice to play bridget who was sort of a toned down version of kelly <UNK> from married with children the writing and performances were both first rate br br sadly john ritter died during the series and it put a <UNK> on things they had to <UNK> to change the show and bring in more cast members and it was obviously an uncomfortable situation but they handled it well james garner was a good addition it could have lasted longer had ritter lived br br i especially loved it when they brought in ed o'neill in a guest spot that was great br br out of
<START> in my line of work i occasionally get <UNK> by independent filmmakers who are trying to <UNK> their film when i can i take a look at these low budget films and often they make me think that the future of hollywood is going to the dogs once in a while though there is a film that is born of pure passion and desire as if created for the purpose of reminding the film industry that good movies are still possible the short film b r o k e n directed by alex <UNK> is a genuine surprise and worth a second look br br <UNK> in at a <UNK> 20 minutes b r o k e n tries to tell a compelling but surreal story with almost no back story the audience is <UNK> down in the middle of the action with no clue as to what is happening a young woman samantha jane <UNK> <UNK> from a dream to hear a <UNK> and is subsequently <UNK> from her home when she <UNK> she is surrounded by a group of <UNK> thugs that look like they would be at home in a comic book these nasty guys and girls are larger than life they are all guns and knives there is no way out br br the <UNK> here is that despite being a low budget film it doesn't play like one from the very beginning the feeling is that b r o k e n has been shot edited and produced by professionals it looks like something quentin tarantino might have done on his day off when he was <UNK> with the <UNK> brothers the film is sharp and cool it looks good and it feels like something big br br the acting is much better than i usually see in these smaller films <UNK> and paul gordon who plays the head killer <UNK> were well chosen as two of the few speaking roles in the film it is up to them to carry the film no special effects no matter how good would have saved this film from bad acting thankfully <UNK> manages to convey true fear and gordon manages to come off as a real psycho some of the more limited roles seem to be filled by lesser talent but it hardly shows br br the downside to b r o k e n is that it's only 20 minutes long the story ends with a twilight zone twist that seems a bit contrived and is hardly subtle watching it i felt like i was supposed to have some <UNK> but there was only a feeling that it was much more mundane than i had hoped it would be the film tries hard to be one of those <UNK> that leaves audiences talking for hours at the local coffee shop but it comes off as unsatisfying i keep thinking that this is the first 20 minutes of a longer film br br my rating 8 out of 10
<START> this is the absolutely worst piece of crap i've ever had to watch actually it was so bad that i just had to watch it br br the cgi is <UNK> bad it's fun it's not even close to the <UNK> cgi animations in <UNK> that's how bad it is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br i'm amazed over the fact that some distribution company actually has put money down to release this on dvd but i guess they'll get more money out of it that way <UNK> the cost of making it can not have been more than a few hundred dollars br br it's so awful that a <UNK> class could have made it br br see it and laugh
<START> i was very surprised how much i enjoyed this film i thought it was funny sexy painful and warm <UNK> <UNK> performance was nuanced and vulnerable for once the director of a <UNK> film did not make her beauty another character in the film the romance between kate and her young man is lovely to watch and it plays out very well her relationship with her friends is both a thorn and a <UNK> in her life <UNK> <UNK> who has been a <UNK> in so many british films does a great job in this there is some tragedy in this but i think the film is saved in the end by the brilliant acting clean direction and witty writing the film quality is excellent and the music is good too though <UNK> on sound track
<START> most people who have seen this movie thinks that it is the best movie ever made i disagree but this movie is very very good tony is a bad ass guy and knows that he's <UNK> and uses it to get ahead it's about him and how he goes from <UNK> <UNK> to having a huge house and a office with cocaine all over the desk if you want a family movie then this isn't the way to go but if you want <UNK> and vengeance and stuff like that then you'll like it
<START> surprisingly good the acting was fun the screenplay was fun the music was <UNK> fun the plot was <UNK> fun this was a fun movie to watch and to give your brain some rest parts of the plot and quotes i found to be very creative 7 out of 10 actually for what it was it would deserve a 10 out of 10 you are not supposed to compare this to an <UNK> film or to a bloody slasher film
<START> i own 2 home entertainment stores and i've seen a lot of bad movies in my time but this one was so bad it compelled me to register here and comment on it how bad was it let's just say that <UNK> coppola deserved an oscar for her performance in godfather iii when compared to <UNK> <UNK> in this movie br br it was robotic and uninspired her lover has just died one month prior to her arrival at the <UNK> <UNK> he had given her once there she discovers he has cheated on her throughout her relationship but none of it seems to register with her within a day she starts a relationship with leslie dafoe the caretaker of the house even though she is married to dafoe off screen her scenes with him were cold and <UNK> br br if there was a plot i missed it not even willem dafoe could save this movie from the amateur cinematic train wreck that it is
<START> this is by far the worst movie i've ever seen from the plot though the shots the special effects the acting and did i mentioned the plot every single thing in it sucked ass br br this is a good example of what over doing means and i'll try to explain br br i understand what the creator of this movie was trying to do this was supposed to be one of those movies you can't really tell what the hell is going on up until the end you sit <UNK> not knowing who's dead and who's alive and who killed who and why and just when you think you got the <UNK> right you find out you're wrong and the movie ends leaving you with an opened mouth for the next 5 minutes something like <UNK> or the job if you know what i mean br br but <UNK> <UNK> the writer of this junk yes <UNK>  the writer director producer screenplay author <UNK> production designer art director costume designer and also a double for one of the characters is some scenes this is basically a one woman movie and when it comes to <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> productions you can't go wrong br br well this might come as a shocker but this time <UNK> over did this big time jumping from scene to scene from dreams to reality but wait this was all a dream after all or was it the picture fades and i realized none of this ever happened the girl was all alone on the ship actually there was no ship no wait there's the ship again and the guys they're alive thank god no they're calling her to join the cruise but then the ship disappears so maybe they're dead after all or maybe they never were alive to begin with br br if you understood what i just said you might like this movie otherwise it's a boring piece of work and the only reason i set through this entire crap is to find out how the hell can they finish this movie br br don't watch this if you value time ever 90 minutes are a waste in this case
<START> this could be well have been the definitive film noir of all time had not the columbia studios cut so much of orson <UNK> original what we are left with is a flawed yet brilliant film that showcases the overwhelming talent of welles as an actor director and rita hayworth as a serious dramatic talent br br 'the lady from <UNK> is film noir at it's most <UNK> and confusing welles with an uneven accent portrays michael o'hara a <UNK> <UNK> who after a <UNK> encounter with the seductive dangerous elsa <UNK> hayworth in a great performance finds himself virtually <UNK> into accepting a job as a <UNK> on her and her crippled husband's everett sloane <UNK> elsa or <UNK> as michael likes to call her plays the innocent helpless doll very well <UNK> o'hara in her web as the lovers conduct a not so secret affair at sea arthur <UNK> partner in his law firm george <UNK> glenn <UNK> comes aboard he is a weird <UNK> figure who offers michael a unique <UNK> he will get <UNK> to assist <UNK> in the <UNK> of <UNK> death so it looks murder the plan is for michael to get off a <UNK> and run off into the sun with elsa but things do not go to plan br br hayworth delivers us one of the best femme <UNK> of all time in a very ambiguous portrayal at times she seems genuinely vulnerable and child like at others brutal world weary and hard always she is brilliantly beautiful whether he situation calls for her to be dripping wet in a <UNK> or dressed in black <UNK> a gun hayworth is beautifully photographed here and she is a far cry from her famous <UNK> role her then husband orson welles cut off her trademark <UNK> locks for a <UNK> blonde crop <UNK> columbia boss harry <UNK> it was a terrific marketing <UNK> and he change suits her changed attitude wonderfully she is not the sympathetic femme fatale that <UNK> is here instead she is a <UNK> black hearted dame who sees murder as a very useful option br br the welles and hayworth pairing came at a time when the couple were having extreme difficulties in their marriage they would divorce after the film was made so this is also a curiosity for providing some view into the complicated relationship they are hateful not romantic lovers in this so it's hard to <UNK> whether or not they had real chemistry on screen certainly every encounter is potent and filled with raw sexuality with welles as the <UNK> <UNK> he even admits it himself in the film and rita as the double crossing babe br br welles character is the typical noir <UNK> with not much sense as welles voice over proves to use o'hara indeed does not use his brain very much <UNK> to be thinking of her elsa ' welles usually played intelligent charismatic <UNK> so his turn here as the dim witted michael is unusual and very interesting indeed welles was an actor of fine talent and he pulls off it well br br everett sloane is suitably slimy as <UNK> crippled husband one wonders why he hires michael it is obvious that his wife is interested in him <UNK> so why does he invite a <UNK> on board one interpretation could be that michael provides the <UNK> to his wife that <UNK> cannot in his crippled state there is definitely something to that theory with a lot of <UNK> toward <UNK> behaviour before she met her husband was she some sort of prostitute and <UNK> knowledge of <UNK> most intimate secrets being hinted at in several scenes br br this is a <UNK> convoluted film with a plot that is ultimately flawed we are more interested in the love triangle than the murder plot as with most <UNK> welles provides us with many of his usual brilliant cinematic touches including the <UNK> famous <UNK> of <UNK> climax it's a terrific scene one ending that can almost <UNK> the faults earlier on in the movie and lift it into greatness this fun house scene is visually stunning with a <UNK> like feel to the painted sets apparently orson painted them himself subtle visual imagery <UNK> throughout the film by welles enhances the plot and makes this a thought provoking experience br br the dialogue is <UNK> and confusing delivered superbly by <UNK> alternately <UNK> low voice and helpless high pitched little girl voice hayworth proves her acting <UNK> in this one and proves that she is the ultimate femme fatale of <UNK> it's a pity only a slight one as rita was a brilliant dancer that she did so many delightful yet <UNK> and often forgettable musicals for columbia in the 40's instead of darkly themed noir like this she was a brilliant actress when given the chance to show off her talent br br 9 10
<START> does anyone know where i can see or <UNK> the what i like about you season 4 episodes in the internet because i would die to see them and here in germany there won't be shown on tv please help me i wanna see the season 4 episodes badly i already have seen episode 4 and episode 18 on youtube but i couldn't find more episodes of season 4 is there maybe a website where i can see the episodes because i've read some comments in <UNK> from germany and there were people which had already seen the season 4 episodes even though they haven't been shown at tv in germany i am happy about every information i can get thanks kate
<START> the shirley jackson novel 'the haunting of hill <UNK> is an atmospheric tale of terror which conveys supernatural <UNK> in an old mansion the atmosphere is well set out and the chills are staged well a haunting masterpiece br br the 1963 <UNK> 'the <UNK> stays closely to the book but also adds its own details to the plot fortunately these are very few and so the terror of the book and the chills are executed even better on the screen the black and white photography only adds to the creepiness of the movie excellent br br and then jan de <UNK> made this in 1999 the remake of the haunting hit the cinemas if you could call this a remake why they had to make a remake of the 1963 movie is a mystery in itself but for the moment lets look at the film itself br br it starts off <UNK> as most horror movies do the set used for hill house is beautiful and oddly mysterious and for a few minutes it seems as if the film is actually going to be quite a fair re telling and then the first scare comes a loose <UNK> wire <UNK> a woman's face dr <UNK> assistant this is hilarious and truth be told it nearly had me in tears br br from then on the film just <UNK> <UNK> the acting seems to become somewhat wooden as the film goes on with owen <UNK> character being particularly irritating so it's such a relief when he's decapitated by the <UNK> br br the special effects practically make this movie which is a shame because most of them are incredibly cheesy and look very dated examples of these are many so i won't bother listing them br br so all in all i along with hundreds of others strongly recommend that you watch the original <UNK> or as an alternative buy the novel by shirley jackson but please stay away from this and if you do decide to watch this watch it on the tv as a lot of the channels love to screen this film and not the original or rent it cheap but please don't buy it whatever you do don't waste your money br br final rating 4 10
<START> this movie made me very happy it's impossible not to love the smart and sweet orphan girl who changes the heart of a selfish lawyer only interested in pursuing success in her career this is a very optimistic movie and i sincerely believe that we need more films like curly sue it touched my heart
<START> a christmas together actually came before my time but i've been raised on john denver and the songs from this special were always my family's christmas music for years we had a <UNK> <UNK> made from a record that meant it was christmas a few years ago i was finally able to track down a video of it on ebay so after listening to all the music for some 21 years i got to see john and the muppets in action for myself if you ever get the chance it's a lot of fun great music heart warming and cheesy it's also interesting to see the 70's versions of the muppets and compare them to their newer versions today i believe denver actually took some heat for doing a show like this i guess normally performers don't compromise their images by doing sing a <UNK> with the muppets but i'm glad he did even if you can't track down the video the soundtrack is worth it too it has some <UNK> traditional favorites but also some original denver tunes as well
<START> another episode from childhood that as an adult i look back on with a different perspective this was one of my favorite childhood episodes one that really <UNK> my <UNK> of this show however on viewing this episode after 20 years i'd say it is definitely one of the lighter ones played for laughs and amusement instead of the dramatic and well constructed story lines in previous episodes in this their first and best season perhaps this episode was written for a little fan r r too as mr spock would say the story just isn't logical but there are some amusing lines like of course mr <UNK> final one at the end when he asks the captain mccoy et al whether they enjoyed their r r and they answer in the <UNK> he raises an <UNK> and says fascinating in only the way mr spock could do that an interesting story line of course the idea of an amusement park being actually amusing instead of the fake and often annoying amusement of <UNK> for example being able to have one's wishes actually come true really a great idea but not that well executed and coming from theodore <UNK> another of the great sf short story writers they used in the first season one wonders how much <UNK> was done to the script that <UNK> turned in br br now here is a little trivia i learned on this very site in 1987 james <UNK> established the theodore <UNK> award for best short science fiction story and i'll quote the rest from this site in 1968 he <UNK> wrote the joy machine a third script for the star trek tv series amok time the other that was never shot the main reason that it wasn't used in the series is that it contained expensive special effects sequences that would be too much for their budget however the script was adapted into a book by sci fi writer james <UNK> star trek 80 the original series and published by pocket books in 1996 br br i'd sum this up to say this episode is still very enjoyable especially if one doesn't think too much about it just laugh and enjoy it and next episode we can get back to the serious stuff of protecting the universe
<START> ever since i can remember and i'm only 18 my mother and i have been and continue to watch older movies because well i find them much more rewarding in the long run but hey don't get me wrong i do love the movies we have today just not as much as i love movies of the 40s and 50s anyways now i have to say the moment i started watching the movie my eyes were glued to the tv of course my favorite character was the grandmother played by <UNK> watson but i loved the way betty davis and her family was portrayed the children did not act like children in the slightest but there is good reason for that having had to <UNK> and run most of your life seeing the awful things children saw those days destroyed their innocence so people saying <UNK> i hated how the kids acted blah blah blah read between the lines and know they saw things children should not see br br paul lukas dear paul did an amazing job now i know many people are mad that he go the oscar and <UNK> didn't but hey they both did amazing jobs so i think it could have gone either way but <UNK> performance was so amazing that by the end of the movie i was reduced to tears i loved this movie so much and recommend it to anyone d
<START> skip mission galactica and watch the original living legend episodes instead the network took parts 1 2 of living legend and <UNK> them into one plot with the awful fire in space episode although galactica suffered from network controlled writing and a lack of time to prepare for a proper production living legend is the best of the 1978 tv series fire in space on its own is one of the worst episodes as a historical note watch galactica the original star trek and then the revival trek series and you'll see the difference in quality between network produced sci fi and <UNK> sci fi
<START> this movie is very cool if you're a fan of tsui <UNK> and chinese fantasy films you should love this this film is the asian lord of the rings a high fantasy story based in actual chinese mythology i realize many critics have called this film plot less i think they probably have zero knowledge of chinese mythology if you liked <UNK> or warriors of heaven earth this one should be right up your alley this film is still very difficult to find in the u s even though it was purchased for u s distribution along with <UNK> tiger hidden dragon and iron monkey well worth the search this dvd is also worthy of <UNK>
<START> the following are some of the most <UNK> problems with this movie 1 clichés abound seriously awful twists are everywhere br br 2 the narrative jumps around in time which would be fine if done well but it's not br br 3 lame characters that don't develop so much as either remain utterly static or drastically change for no good reason br br 4 big one horrible acting over the top from nearly every person br br the following are some of the best points from the movie 1 the lead is damn good looking br br as i see it there are only two kinds of people who would be into this movie a people who can sit through 90 minutes of tripe simply because the lead is attractive br br b people who often think to themselves i like hollywood dreck <UNK> with clichés and overacting but if only i could watch it in korean there's a lot of good korean cinema out there so why waste your time with garbage
<START> the deadly wake is the perfect movie for film students to learn how not to make a film br br let's see what did the crew mess up in this flick worst music mix worst editing worst script worst all time directing worst acting worst choreography worst cinematography worst props worst sets worst lighting etc let's face it if this film had been in ultra high contrast black and white and silent it still would have been awful all scenes are dark lighting people call it black often the music score drowned out the meandering dialogs which was ok because nobody ever spoke two whole sentences without long pauses for effect the evil robot was hilarious what was that jazz dancing oh i guess it was supposed to be walking <UNK> or something i'm sure it struck fear into the hearts of the poor <UNK> and how do you edit so much footage of garbage not possible garbage is garbage no matter how you <UNK> it how did anyone ever get this thru the <UNK> br br bottom line is i couldn't stand to watch more than 15 minute segments it was so bad but i did see the whole thing with <UNK> breaks just to see if it had any good parts in it at all nope none br br a perfect example of how not to make a flick a must see for every serious film student
<START> everyone we meet influences our thinking <UNK> our ways a little bit of that person <UNK> off onto us the <UNK> day takes up this theme compare <UNK> in this film harry daniel <UNK> a businessman expert in sales psychology meets up with georges <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> syndrome child on the run winning performances from both these actors give this film its main strength the opening sequence is excellent where georges relates his theory on the creation of the world and in the closing scene we discover what god created on the <UNK> day there are some moments in the story that are very frustrating for harry for example georges who is completely <UNK> demands a pair of expensive shoes and hasn't enough money it's the kind of scene where you laugh through your tears i liked the scene where the <UNK> syndrome group on a trip to the art gallery escape on a bus and gate crash the <UNK> fun park the most humorous of all the <UNK> is the scene where harry and georges pass a horse <UNK> on the highway and looking back georges gives the driver a rude <UNK> but there are some gentle scenes as well especially the impressive use of close ups of hands hands feeling the sun wind and rain hands reaching up hands reaching out and <UNK> in love and friendship this is true cinema which touches the heart there are very moving scenes where georges <UNK> to <UNK> where georges <UNK> harry's head in his arms where georges keeps calling for his dear mom where georges teaches harry to laugh i felt there was a profound message in the film that life is beautiful the very presence of grass did you know it cries when you cut it the trees <UNK> the song of birds the little insects all <UNK> <UNK> creatures they are all there to be enjoyed if we but lie back like harry and georges look around us and listen a beautiful film
<START> zombie review 3 br br spoilers br br few films are actually so bad they're good and zombi 3 is not just bad it's <UNK> <UNK> bad in so many ways that a whole new language may be needed just to describe them all br br more than that it's a film credited to lucio fulci that even by his standards has absolutely no <UNK> sense or reason however we can't blame fulci as it wasn't really directed by him but by bruno mattei who doesn't even have <UNK> sense of style to help carry the film mattei seems to have brought little to the film but <UNK> <UNK> br br so i'm ashamed to say how much i enjoyed every worthless minute of zombi 3 it has no redeeming features in a genre known for thin characters weak story and lack of film making skill zombi 3 pushes the boat out but in doing so it's even funnier than nightmare city br br the action starts when the death 1 gas is stolen from a military base and damaged in the escape who is the thief why did he steal it and why did the us military think that creating <UNK> <UNK> of the living dead would be a good idea all these questions and more will fail to be answered in zombi 3 br br after hiding out at a hotel the infected thief goes mad from all the green <UNK> growing on his face before being <UNK> down by the army who somewhat <UNK> decide the best way to <UNK> of his corpse will be to burn it sending death 1 up into the atmosphere resulting in zombie birds who then attack people and turn them into zombie people if zombies are cannibals why don't the zombie birds just attack other birds br br then we meet our heroes a trio of horny <UNK> and a <UNK> of girls there's a couple of other guys with them too but they're not important no one is important here you'll be hard pressed to remember anyone's face let alone their name or find a reason to care about them they end up hiding out at the same hotel as the thief a week ago this place was <UNK> with life now it's <UNK> with flies but there's no escape from the undead br br by this point you'll either be completely sucked in or you'll have turned the damned thing off the script is so appalling even the greatest acting in the world couldn't save it so it's just as well they have some of the worst and not just the human characters the zombie acting here is an all time low there's no <UNK> in how the zombies behave some <UNK> about in the time <UNK> style others engage in full on fist fights or charge around with <UNK> not to mention the zombies who are still able to talk a gimmick that gives the film it's horrifying twist ending they die from <UNK> to the chest rather than the head and even get knocked out by a good left hook how can you punch out a zombie in fact the emphasis on badly done 80s action often makes it resemble an episode of v br br the zombies also spend a lot of time hiding seemingly waiting for hours in ridiculous places on the chance some poor <UNK> will pass by and get the fright of their life they hide in <UNK> in <UNK> in <UNK> on <UNK> in the water and even underneath pregnant women at one point a zombie follows a woman up the stairs to kill and eat her no to push her into the water those zombies and their wacky sense of humour br br there is plenty of gore though limbs are <UNK> wounds <UNK> green <UNK> and there's much in the way of flesh eating and people getting their faces <UNK> in there's nothing to match the originals <UNK> <UNK> but if bad make up effects are your bag you won't be let down br br all this and i've not even mentioned the awful music the inexplicable flying zombie head the scientist whose acting actually manages to stand out as really bad or the final chilling punchline in an ingenious twist on the originals radio station being <UNK> by zombies zombi 3 gives us an actual zombie dj he's gone over to their side our escaping hero's cry before <UNK> to continue fighting against the undead in a sequel that sadly never came br br zombi 3 is rubbish it would be no loss to the world if every single print was destroyed and all records of it's existence <UNK> yet somehow i feel my life is <UNK> for having seen it br br did i say <UNK> i meant <UNK> minutes shorter
<START> this movie was not so much promoted here in <UNK> even though it got good actors great script and rather good photograph was not a so called blockbuster movie in my country the movie itself is very powerful it's about the hard time that a newcomer had to go through when he returns in his home village after been released from a <UNK> prison time drugs the end is rather sad <UNK> is trying to keep up with his part and he handles it pretty well <UNK> is great and very sexy in a strange way and of course <UNK> is for one more time close to <UNK> 7 out of 10 because very few greek movies can make such an impression
<START> probably the most whimsical installment of the first season <UNK> <UNK> has its ups and downs some parts drag on too long and others are <UNK> cut short but one can't deny they threw in everything but the proverbial kitchen sink to make this an entertaining episode kirk and crew seem to have found the perfect planet for shore leave after an extended tour of duty has left everyone on board in need of rest <UNK> and so on it appears for all <UNK> and purposes to be an <UNK> earth with beautiful scenery and an ideal climate the first indication that things might go just a little awry is when mccoy leading an advance team spots alice from wonderland following a large white rabbit wearing a <UNK> kirk <UNK> down and finds the others <UNK> similarly bizarre happenings and encounters the one thing they all have in common is that each crew member was thinking about the person place thing they discovered right before they discovered it this doesn't immediately sink in with kirk or anyone else more <UNK> ensues including <UNK> of don juan a <UNK> tiger a ww2 fighter plane etc kirk meets up with ruth a gorgeous old girlfriend of course and a bully from his academy days <UNK> the chase fight scene with <UNK> goes on too long but at the same time mccoy is run through with a lance by a knight on <UNK> and apparently killed finally an elderly man appears and explains what has been happening the planet is a futuristic <UNK> <UNK> where <UNK> have only to imagine something to have it appear nothing is permanent mccoy isn't really dead once this is explained kirk decides to order shore leave for everyone after all despite the <UNK> was all a <UNK> sort of ending <UNK> <UNK> holds up as another first rate episode of star <UNK> first season
<START> once again canadian tv <UNK> itself and creates another show that will go <UNK> after its premiere episode br br last time i remember sitcoms were supposed to <UNK> a reaction we in the business call laughter how funny is it to beat the stereotype of all white people thinking that all muslims are terrorists ok maybe one joke just to stick it to the masses but not 30 minutes it's called beating a dead horse even snl would know to give up after a commercial break br br also let's have a little conflict in these scripts will she or won't she be able to serve <UNK> <UNK> to break the fast on <UNK> when will <UNK> start <UNK> this is emmy winning stuff here br br and the characters what characters they are all cardboard cut outs without anything interesting to make us want to follow them from one situation to the next that's the point of the situation comedy we need to have strong interesting dynamic characters so that we are constantly drawn to the tv set each week we have to care about these characters to worry about what trouble they're going to get into next week if i never see these characters it'll be too soon thankfully i can't remember any of their names note to cbc that's not a good sign br br and the acting is so bland it's more so a problem in casting than in the actors none of these people actually <UNK> the characters they play they just seem to act their part as though they were working on a movie of the week sitcoms require actors who live and breathe that character make us fall in love with them where they become <UNK> from the character the portray watch any american sitcom and you'll see how easily <UNK> characters are part of the problem is that the actors seem to treat this project as though it might be a platform to bigger and better things instead of being their one big character of a lifetime for whom they will spend the next 8 years portraying that level of <UNK> in the characters and the project shows but to be honest considering the lame concept and the horrible writing there's not much for the actors to do but say their lines and try not to <UNK> into any furniture as another <UNK> mentions this seems like a tv movie and not a sitcom br br and the directing or lack there of what can i say canada has so much talent look at what the comedy channel is doing with puppets who kill and <UNK> up look at the trailer park boys not the movie cause it bit the big <UNK> dog look at any american show to see the <UNK> our talent as that's where many of our stars go to find decent work br br give credit to the cbc they really know how to build publicity for a non event remember the one no well don't even try to learn any characters names in this show as it's sure to go the way of the <UNK> br br let's all hope for a full blown <UNK> strike so that nothing like this emerges from the <UNK> for a good long while
<START> should this be an american movie i'd rate it 7 we've seen this before being this an <UNK> movie and being myself <UNK> i'd like to give it a 10 since it's the kind of quality i'd been hoping rather than expecting for it's superb quality is astonishing given all the limitations <UNK> by the 3rd world br br i can't forget the scene when <UNK> forces <UNK> fiancé to confess you know what i mean if you saw the movie i think that's the key moment of the movie not surprising maybe yet original that's when the real action begins br br before watching a movie i always try to gather some previous information being this a mainstream <UNK> commercial one i press play and make a suspension of reality and logic i'd say the best state of mind to enjoy movies like this it's impossible to discuss the <UNK> of the whole plot yet it's believable in a certain way as for me i couldn't stop laughing at every single joke and commentary <UNK> <UNK> you're mean put in the mouth of <UNK> the greatest one br br i'm rather tired of seeing movies designed for <UNK> i know he's a superb actor but sometimes i feel his roles unfairly <UNK> the rest luis <UNK> role in this case i'm not very fond of <UNK> television so i haven't seen much work from <UNK> but it's pretty obvious that he's an excellent performer his physical role his stares his content attitude in this movie made me fall in love with his performance i think his role should need some <UNK> just to let him show us how great he can be br br i don't know whether <UNK> is planning to make a sequel or not i know he won't make it if it's to follow the rule that second parts were never good so if he makes it i'll surely go see it and i hope that in the future takes into account the possibility to give <UNK> counterparts the same chances to develop their roles br br great movie great performances and lots of laughs
<START> wow i love and respect pretty much anything that david lynch has done however this movie is akin to a first <UNK> attempt at making a pseudo art video br br to give you a couple of examples br br 1 david lynch is typically a visual filmmaker however this had little visual artistic content blank walls up shots with ceiling in the background br br 2 david lynch typically takes great pride in audio however in this you could even hear the video <UNK> hum br br in fact it is very hard to swallow the idea that he had anything to do with this movie unless br br this is a joke on david's part to force fans search his website for hours only to find this drivel i hope so because at least that idea is funny
<START> gandhi the great br br greatness in the world is associated with people like <UNK> the great <UNK> the great for their greatness <UNK> in being <UNK> as more than humans gandhi is called great for actually not being a great but being more human for i always believe bringing out the humanity in us is where the greatness of being human lies gandhi was a human with humanity and one who <UNK> for humanity ready to sacrifice himself in the battle for humanity but not his enemies let me move to the movie review now br br about gandhi my father br br gandhi my father is a film not about gandhi but about his son harilal gandhi on telling the story of a son whose father was one of the greatest humans to walk this earth the director succeeds in portraying the tale the film succeeds in telling the story of a <UNK> son of a father who lead a nation to greatness the movie is <UNK> as a criticism of <UNK> failure as a father to his son i would rather say it is of a sacrifice gandhi had made as a father of a son to do justice as a father of a nation br br i wish the essence of this movie <UNK> not just in india the <UNK> land but through the hearts of all the people of this world br br gandhi the true human <UNK>
<START> this movie is just like every other dutch movie so if you enjoy movies such as <UNK> fruit and de <UNK> blonde <UNK> then you might be okay with this one even though those two have much better stories and actors <UNK> starts strong enough but even that one good scene ends up having nothing to do with the storyline there's a lot of nudity but me and others just could not find that girl attractive the dialog is laughable as we did a lot to the annoyance of other movie <UNK> and some of the scenes are so completely random that this is more of an unintentional comedy than anything else like a random scene in which an owl rips <UNK> eye out it has nothing to do with anything and is only <UNK> once later in a sentence saying did you hear what happened i was there the only reason i gave it a 2 is because some of the places they are at look nice that's it and the reason i saw it was because we went to the sneak preview here in holland we have a strange system regarding sneak previews you pay less money then for a regular movie and you don't know what movie it is that you will be watching all you know is that it's a new movie that's not yet in the theaters my advice is to stay far away from this film if you really want to see a good dutch movie watch <UNK> or <UNK>
<START> along with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> other commercial directors <UNK> <UNK> is one of the best portuguese directors o <UNK> da <UNK> was his <UNK> <UNK> first movie before he made several successful commercials this title is starred by one of the best portuguese comedians of all times herman <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are great its a very funny movie 28 <UNK> 2000 br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this movie was awful in the worst way you just didn't care you didn't care what happened in the plot you didn't care about the characters everyone was devoid of heart i ended up walking out about an 45 minutes into it because i simply didn't want to subject my mind to it any more there is far too much sex in the film sex can be okay it can even make the movie hence <UNK> <UNK> but the <UNK> here was not beautiful or sexy it was just ugly don't see this film
<START> this is one of the best films i have seen in years i am not a gwyneth paltrow fan but she is excellent as emma <UNK> alan <UNK> is superb as <UNK> <UNK> and emma <UNK> sister sophie is hysterical as miss bates and check out the gorgeous jeremy northam as mr knightley what a gentleman whoever said you need sex and violence in a movie to make it good has never seen emma i think that is what <UNK> it from so many others it's classy br br if you're looking for a film that you can watch with the whole family or looking for a romance for yourself look no further emma is that movie with a beautiful setting wonderful costumes and an outstanding cast have i mentioned the gorgeous jeremy northam emma is a perfect ten
<START> <UNK> a fun fact i was the baby in the movie the one in the <UNK> i am 19 years old now my parents took me to try out for the part we lived in texas at the time i think i only made like 80 bucks for it but i wasn't in it very long my parents said i would cry when i was supposed to be happy and would be happy when i was supposed to cry i was all mixed up strange and funny fact i suppose and no i am not a child actress i am <UNK> in san antonio <UNK> at a <UNK> i <UNK> here in texas but i lived in <UNK> most my life this movie is a great movie though good concept i have seen it several times in my short 19 years
<START> this was an incredibly stupid movie it was possibly the worst movie i've ever had the <UNK> of sitting through i cannot <UNK> how it ranks a rating of 5 or 6
<START> no this is not no alice fairy tale my friends this <UNK> fable is based on the true story of the gruesome bloody wonderland murders that occurred back in 80's california at the center of this bloodbath was no other than johnny <UNK> himself yes john holmes daddy <UNK> <UNK> used other <UNK> than his infamous 13 inch milk machine besides being a legendary adult film actor holmes was as also a hardcore drug addict who <UNK> various hollywood <UNK> val kilmer was occasionally <UNK> as holmes but for once this holmes character did not milk it through completely the film possesses a who's <UNK> of supporting players josh lucas dylan mcdermott as hollywood <UNK> kate <UNK> lisa <UNK> as the women in holmes life and eric <UNK> as a menacing <UNK> <UNK> these characters do play integral parts directly or <UNK> in the <UNK> murders out of this support group it was josh lucas who was the most fierce impressive as the <UNK> ron <UNK> lucas is gradually <UNK> into a major hollywood player with such charismatic turns in a beautiful <UNK> sweet home <UNK> director james cox sometime proved to be a bit of a <UNK> by displaying a vast amount of <UNK> scenes just like <UNK> famous <UNK> holmes was eventually <UNK> of the <UNK> murders he died of complications from the aids virus <UNK> will keep you wondering what really happened that bloody night and if holmes really laid out his weapon <UNK> wrong holmes movie ok that is enough before i get <UNK> i mean <UNK> bye <UNK> average
<START> this was a highly original decent movie and a brave move for all those involved i don't care if it's not the most well put together movie of all time the fact that it has eddie murphy doing something non formulaic and that i don't know what will happen next makes it a favorite of mine i wish more movies were as imaginative as this one rather than the same old formula for entertainment
<START> i couldn't believe how lame pointless this was basically there is nothing to laugh at in the movie hardly any scenes to get you interested in the rest of the movie this movie pulled in some huge stars but they were all wasted in my opinion i think keanu reeves must've taken some acting lessons a <UNK> years after this movie before he <UNK> in the matrix uma thurman looked very simple humble luckily i got this movie for a very low price because its certainly not a movie to remember for any good reasons i won't write anything about the story of the movie but as you should know that she is meant to be the most famous <UNK> across america because of her huge thumb i would give this movie a 2 10 before i watched this movie i was wondering why this movie has only got a 4 0 10 now i know why a very disappointing movie don't buy it even if you see it for under 5
<START> i ended up watching the <UNK> with my close friends who rented the movie solely based on <UNK> <UNK> appearance a passionate fetish of theirs on the cover understandably i did not expect much i thought the movie would include the typical array of <UNK> <UNK> related behavior and imagery often seen in cliché rap videos however my <UNK> was for the most part wrong unfortunately this didn't make the movie any better br br most would describe the movie as a dark serious drama whereas i would describe it as a dark seriously drawn out boring drama flick the film tells a story of two struggling writers dylan mcdermott and <UNK> <UNK> who are trying to create their own separate masterpieces their polar opposite <UNK> end up <UNK> an unlikely but highly complex and neurotic friendship this friendship moves throughout the entire movie like a wild roller coaster most of which is contributed by <UNK> character reminiscent of someone with a severe case of split personality disorder and although the movie is a drama the acting which has a morbid and serious tone from <UNK> and company was more comical than anything else br br i wouldn't recommend this movie for those who are attention <UNK> because this one has a lot of dialogue and a lot more dialogue after that there are some mediocre conflicts but even they are mostly <UNK> down with more dialogue the end however jumped at me with a sudden surprise it was a little bit twisted somewhat unexpected and a perfect way to wrap up a movie that needed to end while watching the ending credits i couldn't help but picture the director thinking oh god how the hell do i end this <UNK> by the way the director laid out carefully planted hints and subtleties leading to the climax all of which are more visible than <UNK> in a crowded street of <UNK> wearing nothing but black <UNK>
<START> i always tell people that enchanted april is an adult movie with no <UNK> no sex and no violence one might think of it as the ultimate chick flick but i bet there are one or two <UNK> men out there who love it too don't invite the kids though this movie is very low key br br seeing enchanted april is a very healing experience the sound track and gorgeous scenery along with the <UNK> gentle manners bring to mind the peace and beauty of a pre <UNK> painting br br <UNK> anyone think yours truly only watches one kind of movie i will <UNK> a line i heard once on saturday night live and say that my two favorite movies are the deer hunter and enchanted april
<START> i notice the dvd version seems to have missing scenes or lines between the <UNK> of the <UNK> and the launch br br they are to prove they can win the right to sit in the <UNK> other than the green team br br another scene is like during their failure at the <UNK> kevin gets <UNK> to <UNK> down br br i think the vhs edition other than the abc one might have all the missing stuff br br otherwise i like to know which dvd release has the missing stuff br br the dvd i have watched feels edited for television
<START> this movie was god awful from conception to execution the us needs to set up a star wars site in this remote country this is their premise the way to gain access the us concludes is to win an <UNK> course like cross country race where the winner can ask anything of the leader and who better to win this race known as the game than a <UNK> of course a <UNK> would be the perfect choice for this mission and don't forget that his father was an <UNK> lucky for our hero there happen to be <UNK> equipment in fortunate spots like the stone <UNK> horse in the middle of a square for no reason amidst crazy town perfect br br but above and beyond the horrible <UNK> premise is the awkward <UNK> of the romantic scenes the obviously highly depressed ninjas whose only job seems to be holding a flag to point out the race path and the worst climax ever after winning the race our hero puts forth the wishes of the us government and lo and behold all the effort was worth it because the us gets its star wars site <UNK> this is your <UNK> ending wow br br but still being such a bad movie it can be great fun to watch the cover alone depicting ninjas with machine guns was enough to get me to rent this film br br but if i were ever to meet kurt thomas the <UNK> star in real life i would probably kick him in the face after a double <UNK> with 2 1 2 twists in the <UNK> position
<START> a movie best summed up by the scene where a victim <UNK> <UNK> by pulling some poor <UNK> intestines out from under her t shirt too terrible for words
<START> a great 90's flick parker posey is fabulous in this story about the <UNK> in manhattan that requires so much cash posey gives an amazing performance as a <UNK> and a night <UNK> this is a good light movie for saturday night before you go out the soundtrack rocks the outfits are out of this world the script is funny and the actors do a great job the redeeming value you can make it in this world if you try just find your <UNK> i believe parker posey is the perfect actress for this kind of character young fabulous and broke you must look up the movie <UNK> if you watch party girl you are bound to have a good time enjoy
<START> i saw this film in <UNK> recently appropriate given the location used i first read <UNK> book back in the 70's and for me it's always been a very powerful picture of the trials of aging in our society it <UNK> when i was young and it <UNK> even more now when the film came out i was keen to see if the story could survive and was thoroughly impressed especially with ellen <UNK> performance she manages to give us a complete human being even though the character is generally <UNK> and <UNK> someone that you wouldn't want to live with it's great to be able to see favourite characters come to life so <UNK>
<START> when i saw the film for the first time in the early 1970s i was in awe of this film visually it was stunning and the events on <UNK> in europe and usa made you relate with what antonioni was trying to say so well visually in the final 15 minutes of the movie blowing up in your mind the <UNK> <UNK> and big business interests the repeated blowing up of the beautiful house in the middle of a desert the lead female character enjoying the natural stream of cold water painting a plane in psychedelic designs even the <UNK> british <UNK> did it a few years ago are some of the images that were copied by advertising <UNK> all over the world for decades even pink <UNK> <UNK> their fan following after the film was released br br you see this film some 30 years later and you begin to wonder why the same film has lost its appeal today anti establishment films have more substance facts <UNK> fine performances and superb screenplays antonioni seems to be out of date a flawed genius even viewing <UNK> blow up today gives you the similar feeling that he is <UNK> br br <UNK> point has to be <UNK> for what it was when it was released it was a great film if you were to see it on a wide <UNK> screen as opposed to the <UNK> tv screens the visual and <UNK> mick jagger <UNK> richards pink <UNK> et al <UNK> of the film still remains the lead pair were not great actors but they were cute and natural one of them mark <UNK> died in prison in usa <UNK> the reality of the non <UNK> values he <UNK> in the film br br today antonioni seems out of sync but watch carefully and you will appreciate the muted sounds of the regular actors rod taylor g d <UNK> the ladies at the swimming pool the cops at the air strip the real sounds in contrast are from the non <UNK> antonioni was relevant 30 years ago but his grasp of the medium cannot be <UNK> even today he knew what he was doing
<START> as a premise this backwoods version of the dead calm storyline had promise br br however director eric <UNK> inability to render a convincing <UNK> leads to a <UNK> of continuity and lighting errors br br ultimately the viewer is more <UNK> by the bizarre weather effects than the intended storyline <UNK> <UNK> of ham <UNK> over direction are similarly distracting br br charles dance doing an <UNK> backwoods <UNK> <UNK> does his best to save the movie but ultimately <UNK> <UNK> like a pig and has more ham to boot
<START> first be warned that i saw this movie on tv and with dubbed english which may have entirely spoiled the atmosphere however i'll rate what i saw and hope that will steer people away from that version i found this movie excruciatingly dull all the movie's atmosphere is lost with dubbing leaving the slow frustration of a stalker movie i'm sorry but the worst movie sin in my book is to be slow except when the movie about philosophy i didn't see any deep philosophical meaning in this movie maybe i missed something but i have to tell it like i see it i rated it a 1 what can i say u s oriented tastes maybe
<START> this picture was banned from american movies houses in the 1930 because of nudity by hedy <UNK> eva <UNK> which caused all kinds of problems among the ladies in the 1930's but not so much for the male population this story concerns a young woman named eva <UNK> who gets married to an older man and is carried over the <UNK> on the wedding night and the husband never <UNK> the marriage and <UNK> about all kinds of very petty things like his shoes and killing bugs eva leaves her husband's house and lives with her father and tries to explain her situation on a hot summer day eva takes a ride on her horse and decides to go for a swim naked in a lake in the woods her horse runs off and she runs after him and is observed by a young man who finds her clothes and returns them to eva these two people become very <UNK> and there is a romance that starts to bloom there are many more interesting problems that <UNK> as you view this film to its very end enjoy a great classic film which was a shocker film in 1933 enjoy
<START> i saw the movie as a child when it was released in the theater and it was so bad that it became the <UNK> of a family joke if the <UNK> had a zero this movie would get it the dinosaurs were awful the storyline was ridiculous the acting really doesn't qualify to be called acting the only reason i even remember the name of the movie so well is because my family still talks about how bad it really was
<START> i think you would have to be from the usa to get a lot of the jokes but if you liked princess bride and forest <UNK> you would like this movie you can't compare the quality of the filming to those of course but having the cameraman trip was obviously done on purpose killer tomatoes is a hundred times better than <UNK> dynamite just my opinion i'm sure that people from france would not appreciate the caricatures of the french so this film isn't for a world audience and while i am not a trained film critic i know what i like i couldn't stop laughing through the whole movie my sides and my jaws were hurting at the end of the movie
<START> i never was an avid viewer of crocodile hunter but did occasionally see an episode or a bit of an episode and when the news spread about steve <UNK> death from a <UNK> attack in 2006 it certainly caught my attention this movie with steve and his wife <UNK> playing themselves but in a fictional story was released in 2002 but i didn't hear of it until several years later and even after that it took me a while to get around to seeing it well now i have seen it and after looking here first more than once and seeing its rating i was not surprised at how unimpressive it turned out to be though it could have been a bit better apparently it's supposed to be a comedy so a major problem with it is that it isn't very funny at all br br a u s satellite <UNK> falls down from space and lands in australia where it is <UNK> by a crocodile while steve and <UNK> irwin are on a mission to capture this crocodile from a place where it <UNK> the cattle on a ranch owned by the crazy <UNK> <UNK> and are unaware of what's inside it two cia agents are sent to australia to retrieve the <UNK> the agents are <UNK> by jo <UNK> and the ranch owner and her dogs might make the mission more difficult for them on steve and <UNK> mission they face other types of dangerous <UNK> not just the crocodile and since they have no clue that the croc has anything unusual inside it when steve sees the cia agents after them he mistakes them for <UNK> br br not only did i not laugh once while watching this film the only part that really made me smile was steve irwin using a big snake to scare off one of the cia agents apart from that i don't think i found anything even mildly amusing it's also a bit of an incoherent mess switching back and forth from the australian <UNK> to the cia <UNK> and it seems like clips from crocodile hunter and clips from an action thriller or something like that put together for some reason also added to that mix are the ranch scenes which also seem to be from somewhere else and as funny as <UNK> <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> is supposed to be she's not at one point we see her <UNK> so we have a fart joke a major cliché in modern comedy are they so hard to resist i also found the typical crocodile hunter scenes with steve wrestling <UNK> and holding other dangerous creatures and talking about them to viewers to be tedious but i guess the fact that i was never a <UNK> fan of the show didn't help br br steve irwin was admired by many as a <UNK> and is sadly missed by them while there are also those who say he messed with nature and had it coming to him no matter which side you're on the crocodile hunter <UNK> course is not a well crafted movie i'm sure it does help if you're a big steve irwin fan but even if you are there's no guarantee that you would like this movie as some fans clearly haven't been impressed in fact it seems that some of them have found this movie to be worse than i have so maybe it won't help like i said there's no guarantee i would say whatever you may think of steve irwin and his show this movie was unnecessary the attempt to combine what is usually seen in crocodile hunter with a fictional story unfortunately failed and a viewer may find that this film seems longer than ninety minutes
<START> horrible acting horrible cast and cheap props would've been a lot better if was set as an action parody style movie what a waste starting from the name of the movie br br the enemy <UNK> it action movie would've made it better <UNK> to the parody effect the cop looking like a 60 year old player the blond girl just having the same blank boring look on her face at all times towards the end of the movie him and her are working together to take down the bad guys and every time they exchange words it just feels like the cheap lines given before a sex scene in a porn movie horrible don't waste your time
<START> this movie is pretty good half a year ago i bought it on dvd but first i thought that it was the original film i have seen the series and it is a good film but here they have put the living legend <UNK> and 2 and fire in space together the same as they did with the first film but with other episodes but still it is a pretty good film only the ending is strange you don't see what happens with the <UNK> but i still think that it is pretty good the actors and special effects were good if you haven't seen it go see it starring richard <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> greene <UNK> <UNK> jr tony <UNK> terry carter lloyd bridges jack <UNK>
<START> the melting man a tragic victim of the space race he <UNK> melting never <UNK> the race had long gone by br br a man <UNK> <UNK> burns his hand on the kitchen <UNK> but instead of screaming something a normal person would scream he shouts something that sounds like <UNK> <UNK> this movie you've popped in isn't a normal movie you've just taken your first step into the incredible melting man the famous late 70's gore film featuring rick <UNK> wonderful makeup effects baker was just on the edge of becoming a superstar and did this at the same time as his famous <UNK> aliens in star wars for some strange reason star wars became a household name and incredible melting man did not br br it might have something to do with the fact that this movie is just mind numbingly awful from the opening credits starring alex <UNK> as the incredible melting man that's really what it says to the <UNK> nurse running through a glass door to the <UNK> head going over a <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> apart on some rocks this film provides many many moments of sheer <UNK> why did they but how come he why are they after a while you give up wondering why and watch it as what it is a very entertaining piece of garbage br br an astronaut returns to earth in a melting <UNK> condition he escapes and his mind <UNK> as well as his body begins a mad melting killing spree the authorities quickly decide that the melting man must be stopped but probably not wanting to cause a panic want him captured as quietly as possible so they send one guy with a <UNK> counter after him wow br br <UNK> surprisingly little happens during the movie the melting guy wanders around killing people a doctor <UNK> for him with a <UNK> counter various characters are introduced ask questions and leave eventually the doctor catches up with the melting man but is shot by a security guard for no reason after he explains that he's dr ted nelson the melting man wanders off and finally <UNK> into a big <UNK> of goo the end br br it's so brainless that it somehow ends up being a lot of fun despite a fairly downbeat ending supposedly a widescreen dvd release is planned a very special movie
<START> i went to the movie as a sneak preview in <UNK> so didn't have an idea what i am going to see the story is very normal the movie is very long i believe it could have cut to 1 2 without causing any problems to the story its the type of movie you can see in a boring night which you want to get bored more <UNK> <UNK> was very good kevin <UNK> is ok the movie is speaking about the us coast guards how they are trained their life style and the problems they face as there aren't much effects in the movie so if you want to watch it then no need to waste your money and time going to the cinema would be more effective to watch it at home when it gets on dvds
<START> pokemon 3 is little more than three or four episodes of the tv series strung together without the usual commercials the story is typical of pokemon conflict fighting and a resolution where all are happy in the end and there is nothing original or unusual in the animation some of the holes in the plot are filled in over the closing credits without explanation and everything is just a bit too sweet br br why see it on the big screen the only reason is to be a part of your child's world both of my sons enjoy pokemon and by my showing an interest in what they like we are closer seeing a film in a theatre is still different than seeing it on the tube and my sons enjoy the full movie going experience i gave the movie a 4 mostly from my children's point of view br br
<START> in what will probably find itself on my list of <UNK> best movies that is once i see more of them that just this and shock <UNK> pickup on south street is a film noir where the femme fatale as well as the male protagonist are not the stereotypical ones in the genre like most of his other works fuller <UNK> his own experiences and the sense of new york style that is usually absent in the hollywood <UNK> on a small budget at least for the likes of <UNK> f <UNK> fuller and his actors create <UNK> that are likable even in such a dark atmosphere the good guys are basically the ones who won't get violent with you even as they're looking for an extra buck br br richard widmark jean peters and thelma ritter are all terrific in the lead parts widmark is one only a few actors i can think of who could've really pulled off this character he's a little like bugs bunny as he can be a wise ass who is a little <UNK> on the other hand the character of skip mccoy does have a set of values in his life he doesn't go into other people's affairs and doesn't try and care about much of the working world outside of his little shack on the river after being sent away for three years he slips up <UNK> to him when he <UNK> a woman peters on the train and lifts an item that's under the eye of the government it may have some secrets that could make him a lot of money but at what cost is the <UNK> of the film as it involves <UNK> moe ritter is one of the finest and most believable character actors from the period the woman's ex a <UNK> <UNK> and the police department br br aside from the <UNK> elements which are told with a keen dramatic <UNK> style as was <UNK> previous position along with boxer the dialog is fresh and involving there's a <UNK> in many of <UNK> camera moves and what a third act this is a lean tight film noir that is worth checking out even if you're not familiar with fuller it's <UNK> less bizarre than some of his later works
<START> so every year there is at least one movie that hasn't got any chance of being a box office success because from the moment of production even before one simple shot is filmed everybody's picking on this movie there is a long list of these kind of movies and in the end some are really bad battlefield earth 2000 some may have their flaws but are quite enjoyable <UNK> 2004 <UNK> 2005 and then there are a few which actually are really great for what they are but no one admits i mean my gosh just because the wide crowd does have to have a victim each year they can pick on not everybody has to join them so <UNK> maybe those movies aren't perfect but c'mon how many movies are not every movie is supposed to be a new the lord of the rings not everybody will enjoy these movies but i bet there are more than who admit they do hudson <UNK> 1991 who is just hysterical funny color of night 1994 which may not be oscar worthy but is definitely a not dumb at all thriller with some nice twists swept away 2002 which i thought is a great mix of sick humor and a beautiful romance <UNK> 2003 which was great entertainment with some really memorable lines and not badly acted at all from the former <UNK> couple and this year it's basic instinct 2 well when i heard the rumors of a sequel to one of my favorite movies i was very <UNK> and although i really love sharon stone i stayed <UNK> until i've finally seen this movie and really i was very positively surprised i can't understand why it gets such a bad press and such a bad voting here it never simply copies the original it has a quite clever story has tension action humor and the absolutely stunning sharon stone <UNK> the role of her life with <UNK> years when shooting the movie she looks <UNK> than many stars in their <UNK> but it's more than her being beautiful it's brilliantly acted with all her looks her famous smile the way she speaks and moves from the very first frame she's in you can't take your eyes off of her it's simply a pleasure to watch her as catherine <UNK> and all of the other actors deliver solid performances too so i really can't see what's wrong with this movie it has a dark thrilling sexy and gritty look strong performances and you never felt bored maybe the story isn't oscar caliber but it never even tries to be it's an entertainment movie and by this standard it absolutely delivers in my opinion so give it a try
<START> marlon brando and frank sinatra hated each other while doing this film and in the years following it brando asked sinatra for some singing lessons but sinatra who was already upset over the fact that he was cast as nathan detroit when he wanted the part of <UNK> masterson wanted to be the star singer in the production and didn't want any one to be better than he was he told brando to get lost so to get back at him marlon kept <UNK> up the scene in the diner where sinatra was eating <UNK> so that he would have to keep eating eating and eating in the later years sinatra gave brando the <UNK> <UNK> or mr <UNK> because of the way he talks
<START> i have been waiting for such an original picture such as this for quite some time now <UNK> palace has that hard to <UNK> aspect however with the ingenious directing and screenplay <UNK> scores big br br i've really never enjoyed watching claire danes in any of her movies but i'll tell you what she really changed my mind with this one kate beckinsale joins danes on a vacation to thailand where they meet up with a young man who convinces them to take a trip to hong kong with him however he neglected to inform them that they would be carrying an obscene amount of <UNK> for him well ultimately they get caught and end up in a thailand prison i know i know how could you not know that you have 18 pounds of drugs well if you can get by that one tiny <UNK> you will find a very well written and acted out story lately i have found myself getting drawn into the <UNK> of the movies i watch and developing a personal feeling for the characters that i watch this movie is no different by the end of the movie i found myself caring more for her than any of the other characters in the film br br bill <UNK> plays hank green an attorney who lives in thailand and <UNK> in international relations as always <UNK> delivers with an excellent performance and ties the movie together beautifully br br there are a few twists and turns that will by the end of the movie have you in tears this is one of those movies that you have most likely passed by when searching for that movie to watch at home it is my opinion that the next time out at the video store do not pass by this one again
<START> i seriously love this film so much i never get sick of watching it the only line i really can't stomach in this is when riff calls herself a teenage <UNK> but other than that everything else is perfect i've never been a fan of <UNK> soles and it didn't help to hear that she didn't even know who the ramones were until she filmed this movie but i can ignore her <UNK> little face for the most part most people who watch this over and over are fans of the ramones and really that's the only reason i love it so much i never get tired of seeing <UNK> mess up his pizza lines or joey mess up the name of the teacher over and over haha one of the best parts of the film is seeing them sing do you want to dance down the <UNK> of the high school i love it the special edition dvd has a good <UNK> surprisingly <UNK> soles isn't on it maybe she was working on another project laugh anyway great film even better if you're a ramones fan
<START> ok i kinda like the idea of this movie i'm in the age <UNK> and i kinda identify with some of the stories even the sometimes tacky and meaningless dialogue seems semi realistic and in a different movie would have been forgivable br br i'm trying as hard as possible not to trash this movie like the others did but it's not that easy when the filmmakers weren't trying at all br br the editing in this movie is terrible possibly the worst editing i've ever seen in a movie there are things that you don't have to go to film school to learn <UNK> good editing is not one of them but <UNK> a bad one is br br also the shot oh my god the shots just awful i can't even go into the details but we sometimes just see random things popping up and that in <UNK> with the editing will give you the most painful film viewing experience br br this movie being made on low or no budget with 4 cast and crew is not an excuse also i've seen short films on youtube with a lot more artistic integrity joe greta i don't know what the heck you were thinking but this movie is nothing but a masturbation of both your <UNK> you should be ashamed of yourselves in conclusion this movie is like what a really lazy amateur porn movie will be if it was filled with 3 or 4 lousy sex scenes separated by long boring conversations and one disgusting masturbation scene if that's not your kind of thing avoid this at all cost
<START> the more i watch nicholas cage the more i appreciate him as an actor watching this movie now in 2005 i can see that it doesn't really fit into the genre of movies that was coming out in the early 90s i don't really think it can be considered a film noir but it is pretty dark at times due mostly to the lighting and odd personalities of the characters br br typical performances from each of the three main actors who all did a good job with their roles i thought however that hopper and <UNK> characters were left undeveloped as it was sometimes hard to understand what they were doing and why they were doing it hopper is a love him or hate him kind of guy the plot is really good and although i found some parts to be very unrealistic there were parts where i had to hand it to the director i e when he first sees the sheriff all in all this movie is definitely worth watching 1 2
<START> only the <UNK> <UNK> and please don't ask for any more details of young <UNK> can keep the rapidly <UNK> body and mind of the crazed old amateur <UNK> wife fresh and youthful since like most people except those taking part in medical trials <UNK> seldom give up their <UNK> willingly dr <UNK> bela lugosi <UNK> for them to be <UNK> and <UNK> he'll do the <UNK> himself br br what a great cheese ball of a premise for a low budget horror movie if the corpse <UNK> turns out not to be the <UNK> of horror as a plain <UNK> it leaves an interesting <UNK> br br sure the acting is almost awful except for the actors fortunate enough to be playing the crazed dwarf <UNK> <UNK> who later played the master in mad max beyond <UNK> his crazed <UNK> of a brother angel frank <UNK> who <UNK> a lot and has a fetish for the <UNK> hair the crazed mother of the two <UNK> <UNK> the crazed wife elizabeth russell who sleeps in a <UNK> coffin and of course the crazed doctor lugosi br br an <UNK> young reporter patricia hunter <UNK> <UNK> tracks down the doctor because of a strange <UNK> with a <UNK> sweet <UNK> that had been worn by the victims when the doctor and his wife invite pat to stay the night a raging storm immediately breaks out that clue tells us some raging violence is about to <UNK> inside since it's well known that in hollywood at this time all <UNK> young women were <UNK> pat may have some unpleasant surprises to deal with they include dark <UNK> a <UNK> laboratory where a near dead virgin is <UNK> a basement <UNK> and later a direct threat to <UNK> own <UNK> <UNK> if she survives what a story she'll have to give her editor br br if you <UNK> this <UNK> slice of <UNK> <UNK> and why not don't be superior don't judge bela lugosi by the company he keeps here he had a huge impact in dracula 1931 but my favorite movie of his is the black cat 1934 as dr <UNK> <UNK> he's a sad ironic man protective of his two young friends when he finally takes a <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> boris karloff and begins to <UNK> the man alive ah well it's a great scene
<START> i'm sick of people whining about ewoks true they're not the best thing that ever happened to star wars but they did happen so deal with it besides they are cute and i don't care if they're <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br this movie always leaves me in tears it's perfect the end could not be better i'm excited for the phantom menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from luke to <UNK> i love how he is revealed at the end it would be too <UNK> any other way so those of you who are complaining that <UNK> helmet was removed take a moment to think about it it's very effective vader the man who <UNK> behind a mask for 20 years is finally revealed as a sick looking man he is not entirely machine he's vulnerable br br i don't know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in a new hope they all do so well they are believable characters <UNK> does an excellent job with his dramatic character development fisher does a fine job being a female role model i mean come on she killed <UNK> even when so many others had failed harrison ford need i say more br br the music is once again brilliant it's so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie the best climax is when luke shouts <UNK> and jumps out to fight his father in the final battle john williams is nothing short of a genius what an amazing man br br already the movie has so much more meaning for me because of episode i i can't wait to finally see it in the theatres can i wait and then watch the original trilogy yet again br br bravo
<START> d w griffith could have made any film he wanted to after the enormous financial success of 'the birth of a <UNK> he chose to make the most technically ambitious film to that date <UNK> ' he took a risk with such <UNK> in film montage and form and the well known financial train wreck resulted buster keaton doesn't take that kind of a risk with <UNK> ages ' a parody of <UNK> ' this is keaton's first feature length film of his own he only acted in 'the <UNK> he had the <UNK> plan of <UNK> the three episodes in this film into three separate shorts which griffith did do with <UNK> ' keaton didn't have to chaplin had already succeeded with feature length comedies so if keaton was taking a risk here it was completely <UNK> br br chaplin had already done a parody of another film too with <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> keaton appears to <UNK> to that film as well the wrestling scene in the ancient rome episode references the <UNK> that turns into a wrestling match in <UNK> film the comical distance from the plot of both scenes is the same too furthermore <UNK> film <UNK> the glossy style of <UNK> <UNK> ' and <UNK> film seemed a tribute to that film keaton doesn't attempt the radical editing narrative structure or monumental nature in his parody but it seems <UNK> of <UNK> nonetheless at least the stories aren't told completely straightforward as in other post <UNK> films such as <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> blade <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and fritz <UNK> <UNK> der <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> there is some mild jumping back and forth between episodes br br where keaton did take risks however is in his physical <UNK> comedy that's keaton unintentionally failing to jump across buildings in the modern episode reportedly he was convinced to alter the scene rather than attempt the jump again and it wasn't just keaton who took risks the <UNK> baseball gag for example was rather dangerous thus although in a different way keaton like griffith took risks with his big film and i think they both succeeded
<START> for one of the worst swedish movies ever forgive me for being dull br br first of all i haven't seen the first one i was bored that's my reason for watching the 2nd before the 1st one well i hope the first one is better than this it was filled with weird cut scenes and very strange plot changes for the people that have seen this and think 4 10 is high <UNK> me so do i but it made me laugh a few times because it was so bizarre so bad and i still laugh thinking of the punk that came up with this idea what's next <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ii sequels not based on novel or book doesn't turning out great to often and this is a perfect example of one br br ok i'm gonna be honest with you i did laugh a bit it got a few decent jokes in it and slapstick humor but don't buy it rent it just let some other idiot do it or <UNK> it br br 4 10 this movie will be remembered and the director is probably laughed out already
<START> out of these pokemon films which are in order of best to least for me pokemon the first movie pokemon <UNK> pokemon heroes pokemon 200 and pokemon <UNK> and the unknown this is probably the one most concerning the environment arguably the most beautiful and the most <UNK> one whether these are good points for you or not pokemon <UNK> still has entertained many br br as well as the three points covered above this pokemon film includes good humour and good cgi as well as anime the time travelling theme of the film is represented in a good way and team rocket the comic <UNK> rubbish baddies end up with quite good gags and end up being more main characters than <UNK> br br the flaws are as always the rather unnecessary violence and action and the baddie is pretty uninteresting even more so than a few pokemon film baddies br br a strange pokemon is being <UNK> down by a pokemon hunter in a forest a young boy tries to save the pokemon and it takes him somewhere br br meanwhile ash <UNK> and misty are entering a large forest br br curious watch the rest br br good for all pokemon fans and american anime movie fans enjoy pokemon <UNK>
<START> though the title includes the word zombies this film is not what you'd expect from a movie made today though for 1936 the concept is played out about as well as would probably be expected dean jagger portrays <UNK> <UNK> an officer in the french army of world war i who has stumbled upon an ancient tale of soldiers turned into <UNK> or zombies who are <UNK> in battle and may hold the key to victory in the war though on whose side is not certain at first he has trouble convincing his superiors of this phenomenon but eventually french general <UNK> george cleveland orders a non military expedition into the ancient <UNK> city of <UNK> to find the secret of the zombies and destroy it br br the story is played out against the backdrop of a love triangle involving <UNK> <UNK> daughter claire dorothy stone and <UNK> grayson robert <UNK> all a part of the expedition when <UNK> <UNK> over his lack of <UNK> and resolve grayson offers him advice to go after what he wants in life with all his power that advice begins to <UNK> <UNK> particularly after he's successful in <UNK> a stone <UNK> resembling a photo from the ancient city having followed a temple priest into a swamp <UNK> now appears to hold the secret he had been seeking though it's not made clear how he has <UNK> been able to command the power of <UNK> all it takes is placing his right fist to the <UNK> <UNK> a third eye and casting his thoughts out to those he wishes to control this comes in handy for winning back his girl and taking <UNK> early advice as he comments to his servant <UNK> we're learning to be ruthless br br fans of early b horror flicks will recognize the use of bela <UNK> signature eye stare <UNK> from the 1932 film white zombie also from director victor <UNK> of the two movies white zombie is preferably superior both in story content and in it's depiction of the undead where the zombies have a more sinister appearance and are more threatening in revolt the zombies are enemy soldiers with a <UNK> over look that merely react to their <UNK> <UNK> in fact the actual revolt of the title occurs only when <UNK> releases the soldiers from his mental command in <UNK> to his love for claire they <UNK> his compound and kill him in the process br br not to be too harsh on the film it plays out <UNK> within the <UNK> of it's story outline but if you're thinking zombies within the traditional context you'll probably be disappointed if you want to <UNK> an early treatment of the subject the aforementioned white zombie with bela lugosi is the way to go
<START> take young pretty people put them in an exotic locale stick in a few bad guys have the two lead characters find romance after a couple of heavy breathing scenes create the <UNK> of plots then work out a happy ending for everybody other than the three or four who get murdered of course that's the classic and successful format of the <UNK> romance it's not very good but then it's not very bad either like most of the little yellow pocket books and the location stuff in <UNK> is especially interesting even if they didn't use the wonderful old train station designed by <UNK> <UNK> or show the city's famous <UNK> <UNK>
<START> a repressed housewife an annoying <UNK> angie dickinson whose body double treats <UNK> us with an extreme <UNK> of her <UNK> is sexually bored by her husband and decides to branch out this directly results in a string of murders that soon involve a high class prostitute nancy allen clearly i am in the wrong business if she can bring home <UNK> a night and her psychologist michael caine if you are going to watch de palma rip off excuse me pay homage to hitchcock watch sisters instead of this dressed to kill while loaded with style and technical skill is one of the <UNK> thrillers i have had the <UNK> of sitting through the plot is absurd and tired it does feature some surprisingly effective jump scares and nasty graphic murder sequences that should please any horror fan as long as they can get past the silly story line that must have been dated even in 1980
<START> i wouldn't call we're back a <UNK> story simply a kiddie version of jurassic park i found it more interesting than that like the former it calls into question the security of bringing beings from one era into <UNK> but it really opens my eyes when i see who provided the voices john goodman <UNK> <UNK> jay leno walter <UNK> julia child kenneth mars <UNK> smith martin short and larry king to <UNK> that a given actor the cheers woman the tonight show host the most trusted name in news a famous chef the young frankenstein police chief lisa simpson one of the three <UNK> and the <UNK> guy br br but i guess that i shouldn't focus only on the cast i thought that this movie had something for both children purely fun and adults natural history true it's <UNK> but the <UNK> kind i would actually say that john goodman doing <UNK> voice here is sort of a <UNK> to his voice work in monsters inc worth seeing
<START> ever heard of a <UNK> horror movie or any <UNK> movie <UNK> for a reason this one was a really boring one even though it has black magic including <UNK> baby bodies and people exploding from the inside with thousands of <UNK> br br having read other peoples thoughts i was looking forward for some violence and gore but there's not much at all some blood <UNK> and other lame stuff if you are waiting for graphic gore or any gruesome effects you will be disappointed they clearly didn't use the <UNK> exploding and other things to their maximum potent br br pretty much nothing good about this movie a single character that wasn't completely bland and a few ok black magic spells like the <UNK> one the plot was confusing and boring the characters were thin and annoying including the main character the horror aspect didn't work at all the most horrifying thing was an <UNK> girl not that scary really this is the worst asian horror movie i have ever seen
<START> after the reasonably successful <UNK> which was tad better <UNK> kumar returned again with a comedy <UNK> <UNK> based on the hollywood film see no evil hear no evil br br the film reminds you of hum <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1994 where <UNK> and <UNK> play the blind and deaf br br this movie is a tedious exercise br br the film has jokes of such nonsense that you don't feel like laughing like <UNK> <UNK> head getting stuck in the back of the horse and all those type comedies which we don't laugh at now but mock br br the film starts off in a clichéd manner and some scenes are funny sadly such moments don't last long as the story never moves in this half even the comedy gets boring the twist is well handled and the second half becomes an action film where the blind guy and the deaf go to rescue the <UNK> and we have all <UNK> chase scenes and fight scenes br br direction by <UNK> kumar is bad music is okay one song stands out i love you my angel br br <UNK> is awful in the comic scenes his timing is very bad and is okay in serious scenes for some reason he keeps doing comedy and ruined his career <UNK> khan is tad better but too wooden amongst the rest <UNK> and amrita are the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> here <UNK> <UNK> is okay
<START> i've just lost 2 hours of my life watching this mindless plot i could make a better movie with my <UNK> camera how do they manage to get actors to play in those movies porn movies have better scenarios and effects i wish i had those 2 hours back br br the only good thing about this movie is the cast even though their acting skills in this one could not lift this movie to passable the rest was just way too bad br br it's the type of movie that i'd recommend using to torture prisoners into <UNK> them straight br br even worse i saw a translated version of this flick imagine a bad movie with an even worst translation <UNK>
<START> a truly frightening film feels as if it were made in the early <UNK> by a straight person who wanted to show that gays are good normal mainstream aspiring people <UNK> to the point of being offensive <UNK> suggests that <UNK> and marriage are the preferred path to salvation for sad lonely sex crazed gays wow who knew the supporting characters are caricatures of gay stereotypes the <UNK> <UNK> the bitter lonely queen the <UNK> <UNK> etc and the main characters are <UNK> middle class <UNK> <UNK> of little interest br br as far as the romantic <UNK> struggles of the main couple are concerned there's not much to say we've seen it all before and done much better
<START> it's a <UNK> to <UNK> such great actors in such a weak and boring movie besides all the unanswered questions posted in the other comments what's so difficult about capturing the robbers just eliminate the bank workers see who was at the bank from all the <UNK> footage angles prior to the robbers entry and you have those extra 4 remaining robbers among the <UNK> where is the suspense every body is talking about it was so obvious the moment the <UNK> were asked to change into this identical uniform that they were all going to walk out the front door seen it many times at least mr spike lee could have seasoned the movie with some good music score and artistic shooting the movie is not worth it <UNK>
<START> a brilliant chess player <UNK> a <UNK> and falls in love with a woman he meets there on itself this would be a pretty bad angle on a story so there is more there is the fact that the chess player is also completely <UNK> from the world because of his brilliance at the game and the fact there is some history haunting the player br br this film steps back and forth from romantic <UNK> to <UNK> tension to historic events that shaped the chess player and works quite nicely it's easy to grow attached to the two main characters and easy to believe they might hit it off together like the way they do in this film the added effect of the <UNK> is very good too and creates a nice tension setting br br i have no idea of the strength of the chess players as i don't play the game myself but it looks nice and believable all in all most of the film goes down very easily it is also forgotten again very easily though so it's nice to watch but nothing more than that br br 7 out of 10 chess players caught between a <UNK> and a hard place
<START> samuel fuller is an interesting filmmaker mainly because he had some very inconsistent politics in his films while shock <UNK> and the naked kiss represented the <UNK> and <UNK> of america and the big red one was an effective portrait of the horrors of war <UNK> <UNK> painted war as necessary hell and pickup on south street is about the dangers of communist spies all of his films make for very entertaining viewing and even though he was often <UNK> as a b filmmaker fuller was just as good as any of the major studio <UNK> pickup on south street is no exception and despite the dated themes the film making style is remarkably ahead of its time its also a very quickly pace tight and occasionally brutal film noir br br the acting across the board is fantastic richard widmark makes for a great anti hero and jean peters is quite sexy as a girl who works for her communist spy boyfriend the show <UNK> is <UNK> ritter however in an absolutely delightful performance as a police <UNK> the angles fuller employs are great making the acting sequences all the more exciting and brutal this is very violent for its time the camera continuously moves around just as tarantino and his school would do forty years later pickup on south street is a great action paced noir thriller shock <UNK> remains my favorite fuller film but this is a very close second 8 10
<START> it was <UNK> bad movie it will eat your heart out while you watch it i beg you don't watch this movie you will hate you losing 1 5 hours of your lifetime it's not as some movies that are so bad that you can watch those and enjoy this movie is boring as there is nothing as boring as this movie you will hate yourself after watching this movie till the end and you will hate yourself that you didn't listen to me br br i hate myself i tortured myself and i did watch this movie to the end now excuse me i will shot myself i have seen all br br please read this very carefully don't watch this film br br please
<START> if you enjoy the subtle yes i said subtle actions and reactions of john candy you can't help but like this film <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> watcher always saw candy as a broad actor a big <UNK> and sometimes he was see <UNK> and <UNK> but when given the opportunity he could really be razor sharp and quite subtle it's too bad he was cast in so many roles that only showed his broad side because we'll never get to see more of the other oh yeah the movie one can watch going <UNK> over and over i know i have with the <UNK> of <UNK> it's just that good the plot although a little convoluted is actually fairly deep for a farce of this kind it allows candy and the always under rated joe <UNK> and eugene levy to <UNK> off of candy and they <UNK> hard definitely worth a glance for anyone who enjoyed <UNK> or <UNK> other work
<START> night of the living homeless is a funny spoof of the 1978 film and the 2004 remake of dawn of the dead only this time with the homeless the episode has homeless people all coming to south park and the people cannot figure out why they treat the homeless like zombies who want change and a few of the parents end up on the roof of a supermarket like in the movie so now it's up to the boys to find out where they came from and how to get rid of them this is a fairly funny episode with some good moments like the boys singing their own version of the <UNK> dr <UNK> song california love overall a good episode br br 8 10
<START> <UNK> 3 is bad awfully bad bad to the point where it is funny how matter how much i try to convince myself i just can't believe anyone in this world could find this entertaining for serious reasons i mean come on even the cover is bad ok the special effects are absolutely ridiculous those <UNK> are really ridiculous a scientist tells the soldiers that they move incredibly fast yet when you see them run they run at the speed of an actor in a rubber suit trying to run as much as he can and the explosions are funny there is no other word to describe it at the beginning a bullet hits a <UNK> after a guys says what was that and the other explosions are also laughable but the worst thing is the screenplay and the so called story you don't expect a good story or i don't think anyone renting this movie expects a good movie but at least the story has to try to make sense i mean how hard is it to make a story about dinosaurs killing people at least coherent incredibly hard if you look at this oh and if you think that it's easy to makes believable <UNK> as your characters tell it to the writers of this awful awful piece of crap i mean what sick human being would make cheap jokes after one of his buddies is dead and they do lots of it and if you think that a movie about dinosaurs killing soldiers can only be at least action packed wake up this movie is incredibly dull the <UNK> who invented this lame name anyway attack in boring action sequences where you don't see much happening the soldiers think of how to beat them in incredibly funny scenes where they try real hard to be serious but can't seem to convince even just one second so then they attack the <UNK> but their idea doesn't work another laughable action sequence back to planning with a few lame jokes thrown in in another ridiculous scene and this goes on and on and on and let's not forget the acting which is about as convincing as the special effects and the story oh ok this movie simply sucks from a to z br br
<START> laughs adventure a good time a killer soundtrack oscar worthy acting and special effects <UNK> like none other what else could you want in a movie if you see this will be on the telly watch it otherwise run out now to rent it
<START> i tuned into this by accident on the independent film channel and was <UNK> i'm a professional actor and i was <UNK> by the performances they felt totally <UNK> absolutely without <UNK> i could not tell if it was scripted or how it was shot and waited until the very end to see credits and then spent a half an hour on the imdb to find this film do not miss it i see that the writer director also did a very fine film called everyday people which i enjoyed a lot the shame of the film business is that projects this excellent do not get the distribution and advertising that they deserve and live under the radar this film deserves to be <UNK> high and proudly i urge people to look it up and watch it
<START> <UNK> is the most original movie i've seen in years if you like unique thrillers that are influenced by film noir then this is just the right cure for all of those hollywood summer blockbusters <UNK> the theaters these days von <UNK> follow ups like breaking the waves have gotten more acclaim but this is really his best work it is flashy without being distracting and offers the perfect combination of suspense and dark humor it's too bad he decided <UNK> cameras were the wave of the future it's hard to say who talked him away from the style he <UNK> here but it's everyone's loss that he went into his heavily <UNK> dogma direction instead
<START> henry thomas showed a restraint even when the third act turned into horrible hollywood resolution that could've killed this movie that kept the dignity of a redemption story and as for pure creepiness <UNK> babies
<START> i haven't seen bsg i tried to watch it once in the middle of the show but couldn't get into it however i saw caprica <UNK> yesterday i felt a little lost so i decided to watch the pilot today and i must say i was pleasantly surprised i think this is a promising show and the only side effect it had on me is that now i want to watch bsg as well br br but what i really liked is that i didn't have to be a hardcore bsg fan to understand what's going on in caprica from what i have read in the net they were trying to reach the female population since bsg reached way more men and at least in my case it worked br br however i suggest that if you are trying to watch the show do it from the beginning starting with the pilot
<START> this movie was way too slow and predictable i wish i could say more but i can't if you enjoy action adventure films this is not one to see i'd suggest you go see movies like behind enemy lines with owen wilson and iron eagle with louis <UNK> jr
<START> world at war is perhaps the greatest documentary series of all time the historical research is virtually flawless even after a quarter century it is the most accurate and definitive documentary about ww2 an <UNK> historical work that includes interviews with some of the most important and fascinating figures from the war i highly recommend it as a learning experience
<START> i haven't always been a fan but the show grew on me it wasn't until after season 5 that i started to see the <UNK> of the show they finally brought daniel jackson's search for his wife to an end and finally most of the go <UNK> system <UNK> were killed by rival <UNK> sg 1 or others br br towards season 5 stargate sg 1 was beginning to become stale with the new writers and the close attention by <UNK> peter <UNK> the show became more and more solid br br the characters had become stale as well colonel jack o'neill was the stereotypical hero with emotional <UNK> after his son charlie was killed in a shooting accident with <UNK> weapon he had decided to end his own life by going to <UNK> in order to face off with the <UNK> <UNK> the character offers little growth for any actor and actor richard dean anderson chose to play him straight raising emotional <UNK> to protect himself only allowing his close friends in br br amanda <UNK> joined the cast as captain samantha carter she was a feminist on the edge ready to battle any man who would doubt her ability to do her job though this character had little area to grow <UNK> has done a great job of <UNK> on <UNK> strengths she has taken the time to get a basic understanding of some of the things carter talks about in order that she can present the character intelligently br br christopher judge joined the cast playing the alien <UNK> <UNK> was an alien called the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> snake like creatures would <UNK> themselves into the <UNK> until they had grown to the point when it would be inserted into another life form the <UNK> would die <UNK> was the first prime of <UNK> army knowing that <UNK> was not a god like <UNK> pretend he realized the <UNK> that their <UNK> had <UNK> on the galaxy finally having had enough he and jack o'neill freed their team along with quite a few innocent people after arriving on earth he realized that earth was the planet he was looking for who would help him fight the <UNK> christopher judge has done quite a bit with a limited character <UNK> is a wise warrior much of which he learned was from his teacher master <UNK> the show would not be complete without master <UNK> played by tony <UNK> he is also a rock in the end he became <UNK> to most of sg 1 especially daniel jackson br br don s <UNK> was there from the beginning playing major general george <UNK> davis has done an incredible job with <UNK> making him sympathetic and normal he does his job has a wife sons and daughters and <UNK> you can really say he is the anchor of the base simply i would die for that man if not allowed by his superiors to provide troops to support teams off world he will go himself he doesn't leave anyone behind br br i saved dr daniel jackson for last because this character i believe has grown the most in the ten or eleven years it has been on in choosing <UNK> i don't think the producer realized how strong <UNK> would be and now when people talk about jackson they don't talk about <UNK> they talk about <UNK> in the early years the jackson character came off as a <UNK> that's why i probably wasn't a fan as the seasons <UNK> the character became stronger this gave him confidence in the end as of season 10 the jackson character has <UNK> to the point that he has become a self <UNK> hero he still <UNK> the groups <UNK> he still is lead at providing information that can move any mission forward <UNK> history culture and exploration are part of his very being he is determined though a man of peace he has <UNK> to the point that using his weapons may be the only way to solve a <UNK> br br other characters include most recently <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> black and colonel cameron mitchell ben <UNK> new lead of sg 1 both actors come from a series called <UNK> and why they were put together is any bodies guess i see little difference between mitchell and <UNK> <UNK> character <UNK> character is simply off the wall definitely different from her soldier like character <UNK> soon
<START> flavia the <UNK> is an <UNK> work of art and probably my number one recommendation to state that the euro exploitation cinema is severely underrated and not to be ignored this is an intelligent and complex film beautifully realized and  surprise  pretty damn accurate this is more than just meaningless sleaze or gratuitous violence and it's about time those <UNK> film <UNK> who <UNK> flavia as forbidden trash <UNK> this as well flavia is a beautiful <UNK> century adolescent forced to live the life of an <UNK> nun in a strict convent she refuses to accept her being inferior just because she's female and she <UNK> her fellow sister for being so <UNK> about this after a <UNK> attempt to escape she befriends another rebellious nun and she even <UNK> a <UNK> of <UNK> muslims into the walls of the convent br br flavia is a downright mesmerizing film almost impossible to believe that director <UNK> <UNK> managed to make it appear so realistic and so disturbing i challenge you to come up with a title that centers on the topic of <UNK> <UNK> more intensely than flavia does several sequences are quite shocking on the verge of nightmarish actually as the camera <UNK> in on brutal rapes torture and <UNK> yet all this raw footage isn't just used to satisfy perverted <UNK> mind you i'm strongly convinced that they're part of the statement <UNK> is trying to communicate humanity the catholic church in particular historically proved itself to be a <UNK> and <UNK> race and there's no use in denying it any further films like flavia the <UNK> have the courage to question and openly <UNK> our precious <UNK> and i truly admire them for it flavia is an outstanding and fundamental exploitation film because of its substance but it's even brought to an higher level by the wondrous cinematography the glorious costumes scenery and a breathtaking musical score by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is very convincing as the ambitious and <UNK> nun but it's <UNK> <UNK> who steals the show as sister agatha she's a man hating and loud mouthed nun who likes to <UNK> in the open field <UNK> sister
<START> a memorable line from a short lived show after viewing the episode where that line was introduced my <UNK> <UNK> flag football team started using the line to break our <UNK> on offense instead of ready break our quarter back said football and the rest of the squad <UNK> you bet a fun way to break the <UNK> that had our opponents scratching their heads as very few of them had watched the show using this line added a unique element to our season that i'll never forget we had our best season during my time in college that year and in a small way it was due to the fun that we had using this line the show was pretty much a stinker but it lives on in the memories of the 1977 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> flag football squad at west virginia tech
<START> as a lover of the surreal in art and film i was pleased to discover this film on <UNK> it is definitely a keeper most of the other reviews tell the general plot not all correct so i won't bother to bore anyone with that the main thing is the alternate worlds concept which is brought on by <UNK> impending illness and the way she manages to link with someone else after being so alone and finally with her family which i believe is still at least a little troubled it only can be called a horror movie in that it has frightening scenes but is a fantasy with a little hint of coming of age only because <UNK> is a pre teen who hates boys i <UNK> recommend it to those who appreciate the stretch of their imagination
<START> to <UNK> the drama of this <UNK> <UNK> ward story it's set in a special ward for difficult cases the main story is loretta <UNK> she's on leave from a long prison stretch for murder will the doctors save her baby at the cost of her life or <UNK> her husband's <UNK> for the opposite melodrama and sentiment are <UNK> and they're not the honest sort to say the least for example just to keep things moving this hospital has a psycho ward next door to the <UNK> ward and lets a woman with a hysterical <UNK> wander about stealing babies br br there are just enough laughs and sarcasm for this to be recognizable as a <UNK> film mostly from glenda farrell who <UNK> <UNK> from her hot water bottle while she waits to have twins that to her <UNK> she finds there's now a law against selling an example of her <UNK> be careful farrell it's too late to be careful <UNK> <UNK> is of course wonderfully <UNK> as the chief nurse but don't expect her to be given a dramatic moment br br the main theme of the film is that the sight of a baby turns anyone to <UNK> even given the obvious limitations this film should have been better than it is
<START> the original with barbara <UNK> is saved only by <UNK> performance the story and the other performances are too <UNK> sweet and the film itself is too dated to be really enjoyed today bette <UNK> version is much more interesting she is stella claire an independent free spirited single woman who gets pregnant and refuses help from her boyfriend stephen collins or her friend john goodman in an underrated performance she raises her daughter jenny played so <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> and then comes to the conclusion that <UNK> father can do better for her and ultimately makes a life <UNK> decision through out the film there are plenty of laughs tears and memorable moments mostly between midler and <UNK> <UNK> mason co stars as <UNK> would be stepmother who though wealthy turns out to be a very good influence on her if you like midler goodman or just good films with plenty of emotion you'll enjoy bette <UNK> version of stella
<START> dr <UNK> torture <UNK> is about a journalist who travels to an insane asylum to write about a new technique they use with their patients however the journalist soon finds out that things are not what they seem to be and the asylum is being run by the patients and the doctors are in <UNK> first of all some parts of the film are just plain boring and just makes you want to fall asleep and the interesting parts are interesting for all the wrong reasons a guy who thinks he's a chicken for instance i have to admit that the story is actually pretty good but the film itself bombs the music of the film is really odd and like something you would hear in some insane comedy and yes there is a scene involving dancing chicken men which pretty much made me want to shut off the screen watch this film at your own risk br br rated r for violence and nudity
<START> god what an awful thing oliver stone probably wanted to experiment or something see the terrible use of music and pictures here but what for really the whole thing behind natural born killers seems to be a clever look at how <UNK> can turn into complete trash but unfortunately the movie turns into trash itself please mr stone next time you want to criticize the <UNK> of tv shows using violence to get high rates avoid doing the same with your movie michael <UNK> said quite cleverly about this film that it was <UNK> media <UNK> with fascist cinematographic ways how true only he forgot to tell us about the massive headache you get after sitting through this overlong load of crap
<START> i happened to catch this movie on cable one afternoon i have to admit that i've never been a big baseball fan but i can sometimes get into a good sports related movie what i found more interesting was the depiction of the foster family system as a <UNK> who has seen both the good and the bad of the community mental health and foster system i though it was rather refreshing to see a movie that showed both the ups and downs of this system people jumping from family to family <UNK> parents not always taking an active involvement and transitions that can be but heart wrenching and heart melting joseph gordon <UNK> and danny glover are the anchor of this film and both bring very believable performances maybe it was just my emotional state but i did find myself <UNK> a tear at the end of the film
<START> this is a visual adaptation of manga with very little dialogue what dialogue there is appears in word <UNK> as it would in the manga the plot of this is existent but only vaguely <UNK> for there is an issue of the manga on which this is based available in english in the blast books collection <UNK> underground <UNK> and it has actual <UNK> dialogue that explains the plot a bit more than here i recommend checking that volume out if you liked this as it explains some of the plot of the movie which is otherwise inexplicable animation wise this is pretty decent good <UNK> use of computers and the images are for the most part realized well it jumps in and out of episodes as the characters a cat and his brain dead older sister cat wander in and out of a series of odd images a boat a circus a desert for a mere half hour they go through a number of semi plots and settings which leads me to believe that the director chose a number of issues of the long running manga to adapt at random but <UNK> selected visually knowing what's going on might somewhat increase appreciation this reminds me mostly of the kind of stuff they used to play on the mtv show cartoon <UNK> in particular a short that features a cat chasing a man's severed butt cheek around the house only in this case the cats resemble hello kitty more and their adventure is expanded to include death and reincarnation and a number of other themes though not all that easy to tell what's going on the dvd of this has director's commentary and a making of features but i cant comment on those because i didnt get around to them i'm giving this a 8 10 for now here <UNK> much to compare it to in anime and i hope for more like this
<START> i am afraid it was a movie that you have to actually watch to get anything out of it i t is not a mindless movie like <UNK> weapon part <UNK> you know the one where <UNK> is really crazy it is not a movie that is pretty much the same at the end as it is a the beginning you can run everywhere talk on the phone do what ever and enjoy it in any way i have noticed in the past that most people that do not like this type of movie are the type that will do most anything but watch a movie and then slam it because duh they don't get it or understand it or what happened br br don't let your <UNK> take a shower
<START> i picked this title up from a friend who had it sitting in his <UNK> dvd video <UNK> collection so luckily i didn't personally have to pay for it i had an <UNK> that it would be a bad film but i know what a truly bad film is after watching <UNK> like children shouldn't play with dead things and the incredibly strange creatures who stopped living and became mixed up zombies and now there is truly nothing that <UNK> me unless it is <UNK> bad br br <UNK> crisis is bad but it doesn't reach that sweet spot of absolute pain that some movies are at br br anyway the general plot is that the sun is about to <UNK> a huge <UNK> <UNK> towards the earth that will essentially destroy it in order to counter act this <UNK> threat humanity has assembled a spaceship and crew whose duty it is to fire an <UNK> bomb which the opening describes as the biggest explosive ever into the sun which through some convoluted sci fi logic will cause the <UNK> to shoot out at a different angle leaving earth <UNK> br br never mind that what i have just described to you sounds like a bad episode of the original star trek even with an ensemble cast charlton heston peter boyle and jack palance <UNK> crisis can barely manage that level of mediocrity thanks to a plot that starts simple yet becomes increasingly nonsensical as time wears on br br the <UNK> achievement of this <UNK> of a movie is the addition of a villain character played by boyle who insists on <UNK> the mission through means that are never explained he sends an evil <UNK> with an embarrassingly bad <UNK> to exercise some sort of vague electronic mind control over the space <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> scientist played by female lead <UNK> <UNK> why is he <UNK> the mission because by his moronic viewpoint he believes the <UNK> won't happen and that when it doesn't he will become <UNK> wealthy because he has <UNK> his evil <UNK> into the stock market in effect you have a villain with the most <UNK> stupid motivation imaginable br br the film's plot becomes amazingly convoluted and develops very slowly in time <UNK> the use of characters who have only vague or <UNK> brief roles in the storyline i could sit here and explain in detail precisely what happens to demonstrate the sheer inability of the screenwriter to make a plot that actually <UNK> or holds your attention but i am sitting here writing this review on <UNK> word and i know for a fact that this would take three pages and i would only succeed in losing your interest but then again you would probably get the same effect from watching the film br br anyway the film is miserably <UNK> down with exceedingly poor dialogue imagine if all that ever happened on the star trek enterprise was that the characters <UNK> sci fi <UNK> back and forth at each other yes i know they already do that but imagine if that's all they did and that they used said <UNK> to set up vague and near nonsensical scenes that produce no excitement tension or interest in the viewer whatsoever br br this is best <UNK> at the point when a character in a zero g environment <UNK> a <UNK> back onto a metal box before <UNK> to cry in agony for a couple of minutes before suddenly exploding the script <UNK> previously to the character <UNK> an explosion but doesn't bother to give any solid answer as to why or how this occurs nor why he can't really escape in <UNK> you have a sorry cross between the bizarre and the laughable br br then we have several scenes where dramatic build up leads to nothing jack <UNK> performance is wasted on a character that serves only to drive the boy hero don't ask around the desert before getting <UNK> up and killed by a bunch of suits on his death bed palance finally tells our boy hero his last name while wearing a horrible <UNK> makeup job that makes it look like somebody put a balloon under his <UNK> which he kept quiet about before colonel travis j richards the boy repeats it quietly after he <UNK> giving viewers the impression that the name is of some significance later on in the film perhaps charlton <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> character knows him and the plot will advance thereby once his name is repeated something anything br br nope sorry any hopes you have will be <UNK> when this moment turns out only to be another of many pathetic failed attempts at creating <UNK> a character so flat and hackneyed that it will forever be a <UNK> on <UNK> career just as those of the rest of the cast are similarly marred br br <UNK> the film is a painfully abrupt ending featuring <UNK> <UNK> the bomb into the center of the sun in an effort to redeem her deeds while under the <UNK> spell a climax which features another of the film's considerably well done visual effects sequences that even for the <UNK> elaborate care put into them still always manage to make the film look just as <UNK> as it really is the saddest part about this film is the obviously large budget <UNK> wasted on a stinker of a script and a supporting cast behind boyle heston and palance that manage to nail the coffin shut with pure over acting br br grade d
<START> i saw this movie in sixth grade around christmas time and i was really excited about seeing it and when i heard that george c scott was in it i was really excited because i really love george c scott when me and my class were watching this movie i was really into it and when it was over i was really impressed i thought that it was totally fabulous this is the best version of charles <UNK> classic novel that i have seen so far george c scott's performance as scrooge is something else i thought that he was the perfect choice he was scrooge he is the definitive scrooge i've seen two different versions of a christmas carol the other is the one with patrick stewart but this is the better one br br what it really great about this is the acting i thought that the actors were fabulous everyone was the spirits tiny tim bob <UNK> everyone they could not have found anyone better than the ones they had doing the parts but the best part of the movie was george c scott when i saw him i thought that he was the absolute best he is the definitive <UNK> scrooge i do not think that they could have found someone better i don't think that they could have found anyone better to replace anyone in the movie br br this movie is probably the definitive movie adaption of the classic by charles dickens and i really think that you will agree you will think that this movie is fabulous i am probably going to have to buy this movie on dvd because i thought that it was totally fabulous i totally recommend that you see this masterpiece this is the best version of a christmas carol period br br 10 10
<START> this was a classic case of something that should never have been gloria was now a single mother her husband had left her because she wouldn't live in some <UNK> with him he was mad that reagan had been elected and wanted to turn his back on society right then and there i had problems with the series come on i say to myself is this the same noble michael <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> right <UNK> <UNK> the series went on but it just didn't have any <UNK> whatever momentum sally <UNK> gained from all the family was long gone maybe if the series had been given another name and presented as being totally independent of all in the family it might have worked out ah well that's show business
<START> this movie is a total dog i found myself <UNK> to find anything to laugh at just so i wouldn't feel like i'd totally wasted my money and my time the writing in this film is absolutely terrible it's a shame it's not up to the standards of other hale storm movies br br they should have saved the money on getting d list actors like fred <UNK> and gary coleman and spent the money working the script until it was right even gary coleman wasn't properly <UNK> for his role br br this movie leaves you wondering what the point of most of the plot was including the subplots after viewing this movie i'm left with the impression that the producers were hoping to capture some kind of <UNK> dynamite like humor where it's not so much the lines as the character and the delivery unfortunately this movie fails to deliver the lines the characters the delivery or the humor i should have gone to the dentist instead
<START> i had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago but its concept interested me when i heard it an american man meets a european woman on his last night in europe and they spend the night together talking it <UNK> my interest but i never expected it to be this great before sunrise is a masterpiece and it's also one of the most romantic films on record to my surprise it completely lacked the cynicism of the 1990s it's impossible to really talk too much about it since there is no real plot so to speak although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about it is sort of like my dinner with andre where there is a conversation but it's not just the conversation that matters but let me just say see it see it
<START> <UNK> have shown us that they can make a classic <UNK> agent and make you feel in the 60's world the graphics of the game are outstanding and also the voice recording is very professional i got this game april 2007 two years after release and i am still impressed with the <UNK> it's a shame that <UNK> will no longer make <UNK> games br br i give this game 10 10 for the levels it contains especially the <UNK> level i would recommend this game to anyone from the age of 13 and over the only thing i didn't like in the game is the russian boat level it was too much pressure on the whole i like the game a lot
<START> have you ever in your life gone out for a <UNK> activity tried your best and then found yourself in an important segment of it where for a brief moment you were given a chance to be a hero and a champion and failed i believe many of us have had that moment in our lives this is the premise of the movie the best of times in this story a middle age <UNK> named jack <UNK> robin williams suffers from the deep melancholy of a football mistake which happened years ago is inspired to re play the game again in order to accomplish this he must convince the once great football <UNK> reno <UNK> kurt russell to make a comeback for reno who is satisfied with his present lot in life <UNK> no need to change the past record which <UNK> better as he ages added to both their problem is the fact years have passed and in addition both their <UNK> are <UNK> and in need of re <UNK> not easy when his father in law donald <UNK> <UNK> reminds him of the biggest drop nevertheless <UNK> is <UNK> and will do anything to try and correct the greatest <UNK> of his life great fun for anyone wishing to enjoy their youth again
<START> there is a reason why certain films go straight to video and of course the obvious reason is that if its too naughty for theater audience then release straight to video of course it really wouldn't be fair to the films that are good and yet they are also released straight to video this one is not an exception although the film has good actors or at least actors with potential amy adams am oscar <UNK> and talented actress robin dunne who deserves better or at least a better agent and sarah thompson who deserves roles that are a departure from teen <UNK> the film is also <UNK> this film takes place before cruel intentions so therefore this film is actually a prequel and rather stupid one at that this was a waste and its really a film that is in the same level as soft core porn and pay per view masturbation films fortunately for the actors hopefully they will be able to <UNK> this from their <UNK> so if you are looking to see something naughty but don't have the courage to buy porn then rent this film as a <UNK>
<START> i'm a male not given to women's movies but this is really a well done special story i have no personal love for jane fonda as a person but she does one hell of a fine job while deniro is his usual superb self everything is so well done acting directing visuals settings photography casting if you can enjoy a story of real people and real love this is a winner
<START> one of the serious potential <UNK> costs of most mining <UNK> is <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> rivers and <UNK> with excess <UNK> and <UNK> one of the most serious examples in 19th century usa of excess river <UNK> was caused by <UNK> mining of gold bearing <UNK> hills on the sides of the <UNK> valley in the period from the <UNK> to the early <UNK> this process involved directing a high pressure jet of water onto the <UNK> causing the material to wash downhill where the gold could be separated from the <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> then <UNK> in a <UNK> or stream and most found its way to the <UNK> river or its <UNK> the <UNK> that stayed in the river bed <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> fields and towns and created permanent <UNK> in some areas some of the <UNK> <UNK> over onto the <UNK> fields where it might cover a standing crop or cover more <UNK> <UNK> or make <UNK> difficult thus the <UNK> interests of the companies that used <UNK> mining and of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> affected by these <UNK> is the subject of this nearly forgotten 1938 color film by warner br br first we might ask why warner decided to shoot this film in a rather poor technicolor a very rare treatment in 1938 a story about <UNK> <UNK> and gold <UNK> wouldn't seem to justify the expense and difficulties of color filming at this time the answer seems to be the <UNK> film time spent <UNK> with fancy colorful clothes and <UNK> then we might ask why <UNK> george brent was chosen as the leading man and ultimate hero to be paired with olivia de <UNK> among other things this film really needed a charismatic leading man to carry it even the usually colorful <UNK> hayes in his small role seemed unusually subdued unfortunately i fell asleep before the apparently more dramatic last part of the film the portion i saw spent too much time establishing a complicated set of relationships between too many people at the expense of <UNK> portraying the plight of the chosen <UNK> baron and perhaps nearby town folk and their attempts to deal with their <UNK> and <UNK> problems it needed to be more like the good earth released just the year before just maybe it would then have been suitable for a charismatic leading man such as errol flynn finally there is the matter of the inane title surely warner could have come up with a catchy or more appropriate title gold or grain is short and to the point incidentally i understand there is still plenty of gold in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> waiting to be <UNK> by means other than <UNK> mining
<START> the film concerns a classic theme in fact it concerns the theme exploited by batman from beginning to end but in real data and details the mayor of new york appreciated and very <UNK> and dynamic in order to get some project through slightly faster than normal <UNK> to some pressure from some private business <UNK> about a criminal drug dealer who should have been sent and kept in prison and he <UNK> the judge in his turn to set him free on <UNK> in spite of a negative <UNK> report that disappears but is not destroyed be it only because of the political value it represents and what was to happen happens and a few people including a black <UNK> is killed in a shoot out between a police detective and that criminal the city may explode because of it racial tension because of the black school boy and social tension because of the <UNK> such criminals free to <UNK> around and go on with their criminal activities represent to the public <UNK> the film does not show that tension very well and follows the investigation of the first deputy mayor who wants to find out the truth and does find it out but along the way a few witnesses are killed and those who had played some role in the whole business are forced to <UNK> the judge to end their career and life the <UNK> or the <UNK> go between a public officer who was ready to deliver the disappeared <UNK> report and some shady character after he provides some crucial information the mayor himself <UNK> and takes a long vacation but the main interest of the film is in the exploration of the <UNK> the mayor is doing to cover up the problem and the <UNK> he remembers having done in the past that led to the mistake about this <UNK> case the political philosophy that nothing is pure white or pure black and that everything is grey which is never comfortable to decision makers is <UNK> as an excuse for wrong but <UNK> decisions we are not speaking of necessary <UNK> to get to some <UNK> in some <UNK> that are crucial to public interest we are speaking of considering as less important to take a bad decision about some petty or supposedly petty criminal than some <UNK> or economic project in the city that is not typical of new york that is true in any <UNK> office it is just more significant in <UNK> and in quality in a big <UNK> area like new york and of course in a city or country where police <UNK> are <UNK> and are controlled by political <UNK> the young deputy mayor is thus pushing the old mayor out of the way and he <UNK> his ambition to be the <UNK> of new york in order to become the president of the us the mayor is perfect due to the <UNK> al pacino offers us since he is able to express ten minutes of dialogue with one facial expression that makes the whole dialogue useless i find the end slightly <UNK> with the ex deputy mayor <UNK> in his own name that seems to mean that he was so attached to justice because he saw his chance to push the mayor out of his own way hence he is not better than all the others just still too young in his ambition br br dr jacques <UNK> university paris <UNK> university paris 1 <UNK> <UNK> university <UNK> saint quentin en <UNK>
<START> one of the great mysteries of life suffered from daily is why nice girls so often are more interested in the <UNK> and heels than in the nice guys br br worse when the nice guys even want to marry those girls the girls still prefer the <UNK> and heels even after the <UNK> and heels have shown their contempt have shown they're just interested in using the girls br br <UNK> <UNK> is the nice guy who continues to be nice after being <UNK> to and cheated and even after losing the girl completely br br clark gable is the jerk and he is perfect in the role rather a sad note to his fans br br jean harlow comes across as a more <UNK> mae west even sounding like la west in some of her cynical throwaway lines br br somewhat puzzling is that so many of the other characters intended to be bad guys i mean heck they're locked up so they must be are so obviously nice people br br in fact there are lots of nice people here people who in a lesser film or story would be <UNK> and back stabbing but here go out of their way to help someone else br br so maybe the story is rather clichéd at least by modern standards but ultimately the viewer will be glad to have watched br br the biggest complaint i have is that so many really good actors are not given credit once again we can say a <UNK> thank you to imdb com
<START> it's amazing that actress p j soles didn't become a big star after playing riff randall 1 fan of the punk rock group the ramones in rock <UNK> roll high school soles is so <UNK> you don't mind she's obviously too old to still be in high school that fact is <UNK> out by having all the kids look 24 the movie is a fast paced <UNK> that doesn't cop out everything gets blown to <UNK> at the end and that's just as it should be mary <UNK> an <UNK> kinky and funny presence as the nazi like principal gets a great one of a kind bit at the beginning where <UNK> fly dangerously close to her head how many takes did they use on that or was it a <UNK> and <UNK> young is very appealing as <UNK> best kate <UNK> the weakest link ironically enough in this high school chain gang is the ramones they can't act they're not funny and their concert segment goes on too long one ramones song i want you around is treated as a fantasy and is well captured other incidental songs are good particularly a rare paul <UNK> <UNK> heard near the beginning did we meet somewhere before great fun from
<START> mirror mirror 1990 is a flat out lame movie why did i watch movies like this when i was younger who knows maybe i was one for <UNK> myself by watching one terrible movie after another i don't know i guess i needed a <UNK> during my teen years a teenage <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> seeks <UNK> in an old mirror soon she learns about the horrific power this <UNK> mirror has and uses it to strike out against those who have <UNK> her movies like these the power <UNK> has a nasty side effect this one changes her inside and out if she likes it or not br br a mess of a movie that for some reason was restored on d v d a few years back i don't know why they should have left it on the shelf and collect dust people love this movie <UNK> some reason if you do i would like to know why until then i dislike this movie and i have no reason to ever watch it again br br not recommended at all
<START> i'm surprised how many people give this move less than 7 stars br br but they just don't understand the movie br br the story is about growing up in a difficult situation br br there is a crazy grandmother who really wants the best for your <UNK> br br and there's good reason why so many critics like this movie br br and the reason is because they understand the movie br br i feel sorry for the low scores given by some people br br i wish i could just write a brief summary of a movie but imdb requires you to write 10 lines br br i frankly don't have anything else to say
<START> definitely definitely the worst film i've ever seen no questions asked <UNK> of this opinion might argue that this title should not be judged by the same <UNK> as others since it's an independent low budget film but c'mon already  the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is horrifying br br <UNK> with everything that has been said about this film for example the mind numbingly weak acting when it's this bad you take another go at shooting the scene god damn it the thing i found the most annoying was the total lack of common sense in the script assuming such a thing existed during the production there was an obvious absence of a dialogue with respect for the viewers the girls switched personalities several times and they seemed to show absolutely no sing of any <UNK> or even brains five relatively fit girls against one slight female psychopath  gang up on her why don't you br br the only thing that can be regarded as somewhat of a conquest for this title is the camera not leaving the van at any time thus the viewer seeing everything from inside it which is as the rest of the film a good idea executed <UNK> dreadfully br br <UNK> and by the way this movie is nothing like the blair witch project or <UNK> or any other title filmed with a hand held camera  this is an effect and not a <UNK> used cleverly it can be breathtaking but in this case it's an excuse for <UNK> cinematography
<START> i have to admit that for the first half hour or so of this movie i was basically lost there had been some mildly amusing humour but at best a <UNK> plot and a general sense of <UNK> that was on the verge of making me think that i was wasting my time then for no apparent reason i suddenly realized that i was enjoying this there was no <UNK> moment of realization and no suddenly dramatic scene that grabbed me in fact nothing very exciting happens in the entire movie it was as if i just all of a sudden realized that the movie was meant to be largely pointless and that in its very <UNK> was its charm br br morgan freeman starred as an <UNK> actor who finds a <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> his career he's going to play a supermarket manager and spends the day in a <UNK> supermarket to research the role while there he meets and bonds with scarlet played by paz vega a <UNK> who wants more out of life he helps her prepare for a job interview as if she's <UNK> for a role while she introduces him to real life it's truly funny watching <UNK> for that's how the character is identified in the credits be overwhelmed by a visit to the local target store br br freeman and vega were great together with a strange but completely believable sort of combined romantic but father daughter chemistry if you feel lost at the beginning stick with this in the end it turns out to be a delightfully charming movie 7 10
<START> this has got to be the worst horror movie i have ever seen i remember watching it years ago when it initially came out on video and for some strange reason i thought i enjoyed it so like an idiot i ran out to purchase the dvd once it was released what a tragic mistake i won't even bother to go into the plot because it is so transparent that you can see right through it anyhow i am a fan of <UNK> gordon lewis so i am <UNK> to cheesy gore effects and bad acting but these people take this to a whole different level it is almost as if they are intentionally trying to make the worst movie <UNK> possible if that was their goal they <UNK> if they intended to make a film that was supposed to scare you or make you believe in any way shape or form that it is real then they failed miserably avoid this movie read the plot synopsis and you've seen it
<START> higher learning says its ok for blacks to torment white people because they're all <UNK> most blacks in this movie are portrayed as ignorant <UNK> stunning that this is supposed to be a positive movie about race incompetent acting direction and production values all contribute to this <UNK> of a flick an appalling piece of trash the <UNK> of this dreck should be ashamed higher learning says its ok for blacks to torment white people because they're all <UNK> most blacks in this movie are portrayed as ignorant <UNK> stunning that this is supposed to be a positive movie about race incompetent acting direction and production values all contribute to this <UNK> of a flick an appalling piece of trash the <UNK> of this dreck should be ashamed
<START> a magical journey <UNK> by alexander <UNK> and michael powell these two <UNK> of the british cinema have mixed some fabulous ingredients to produce a movie masterpiece some of the most ravishing early technicolor a sublime and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> musical score along with the youthful <UNK> of <UNK> the theatrical and <UNK> <UNK> of conrad <UNK> and the exquisite beauty and voice of june <UNK> as the princess all work wonderfully well miles <UNK> who plays <UNK> father the <UNK> of <UNK> also wrote the perfect screenplay which is appropriately <UNK> don't miss this one since <UNK> the above comments i have <UNK> the recently released dvd and can honestly say i'd never seen the picture properly until viewing this dvd version the clarity and resolution is so precise and the colors are so vivid that i was stunned this amazing classic can be watched time an again and never fails to charm and delight the viewer again a must see
<START> as a fan of notorious b i g i was looking forward to this movie i am unfortunate to see it is a terrible movie <UNK> <UNK> is not convincing or realistic enough to portray notorious b i g a lot of the story follows notorious b i g 's real son christopher jordan wallace as notorious b i g as a kid unfortunately he is not convincing enough to pay tribute to his father derek luke is just as unconvincing as sean <UNK> combs in a nutshell no one is convincing enough to play their roles here the big problem with this are these are actual people they are playing it was boring and did not give any information about notorious b i g that fans and non fans alike did not already know i was especially disappointed with angela <UNK> a very good actress wasted here as <UNK> wallace the movie slugs and slugs along thinking that notorious b i g fans will spend tons of money on it i am unfortunate to say that that happened it's nowhere close to a good movie i was expecting so much out of it but unfortunately i didn't get anything i wanted from this i think you should definitely skip this one
<START> this movie shows life in northern <UNK> from the perspective of a young french girl france <UNK> whose father is an official for the colonial french government and whose family is one of the few white families around it gives a sense of what life was like both for the <UNK> and for the natives with whom they associated it's a sense consistent with another movie i've seen about africa in a similar time period <UNK> in <UNK> 2001 but i have no way of knowing how realistic or typical it is it's not just an impression things do happen in the movie but the plot is understated the viewer is left to draw his own conclusions rather than having the <UNK> forced upon him although the framing of the story as a flashback from the woman's visit to south western <UNK> as an adult provides some perspective
<START> i have been an <UNK> for years and was really looking forward to this show i had it set to record all episodes because i thought i could really learn some great new things i probably could if i could get past <UNK> br br i'm sure a lot of this is staged to seem like a reality show and appeal to that class of viewer it doesn't work for someone who's really interested in <UNK> the planet br br this show should be called <UNK> with <UNK> br br since ed is such a great <UNK> of information maybe a second show that's really serious about the environment would be a good idea <UNK> things down is not necessary for some of us br br i no longer record episodes or watch the show but do let me know if a real green show may be in the works
<START> skip mccoy is a three time loser pick pocket unable to <UNK> his instincts back on the street he picks the purse of candy on a subway train what he doesn't realise is that candy is carrying top secret <UNK> <UNK> that is of high interest to many many <UNK> br br director samuel fuller has crafted an exceptional drama set amongst the seedy underworld of new york city communist spies and shady government <UNK> all blend together to make pickup on south street a riveting viewing from first minute to the last based around a dwight taylor story called <UNK> of glory fuller <UNK> this adaptation with heavy set political agenda something that many at the time felt was over done but to only focus on its anti communist <UNK> is doing it a big <UNK> br br digging a little deeper and you find characters as intriguing as any that fuller has directed the main protagonist for one is the hero of the piece a crook and a shallow human being his <UNK> are not born out of love for his country they are born out of his sheer stubborn streak it's quite an achievement that fuller has crafted one of the best anti heroes of the 50s and i'm sure he was most grateful to the performance of richard widmark as mccoy all grin and icy cold heart his interplay with the wonderful jean peters as candy is excellent and is the films heart however it is the oscar nominated thelma ritter who takes the acting <UNK> her moe is strong and as seedy as the surrounding characters but there is a tired warmth to her that ritter conveys <UNK> br br it's a b movie in <UNK> but an a film in execution pickup on south street is a real classy and entertaining film that is the best of its most intriguing director 9 10
<START> sucks that's all i got to say about this sorry excuse for a film sucks sucks sucks i mean what the hell were they thinking the idiots involved should never be allowed to make another films the acting was so bad that it even failed to entertain on a bad level the attempt at a lesbian scene was sad i felt so bad for the ladies involved this movie sucks sucks sucks br br i heard rumors of a sequel br br god br br help br br us br br all
<START> from the excellent acting of an extremely impressive cast to the intelligently written and very <UNK> script from the lavish cinematography to the beautiful music score by carter <UNK> rob roy offers a <UNK> in movie going experiences one that is <UNK> impossible to find fault with in any area br br there have been several comparisons made with braveheart which came out the same year with all due credit to mel gibson braveheart struck me as too much of a self conscious and preachy epic to rival rob roy as the kind of movie i would care to see more than once while braveheart works hard to be a serious epic rob roy just grabs you and <UNK> you into its tightly edited storytelling not a single scene is wasted br br rob roy contains the perfect balance of dramatic tension action and even occasional humor the characters are well fleshed out perfectly conveying <UNK> and mannerisms that anchor them in their authentic period setting br br further they are not caricatures of good and evil as we all too often observe in even modern film br br for example while we hope the heroic rob roy <UNK> we realize his <UNK> are products of his own pride and sense of honor tim roth plays one of the most hateful bad guys in the history of cinema yet there are moments when we can understand how the events of his life have shaped him into becoming what he is rob roy employs a level of character development that makes its story even more believable and gripping br br rob roy is a delightful treasure featuring one of the greatest sword fights ever choreographed and a climatic ending worthy of all the tense anticipation
<START> the movie actually has a fairly good story but gets <UNK> down in several key places it's almost as if the director threw the movie together without taking the time to make some essential cuts in the film dennis quaid does a fairly decent job in his role but something is clearly missing from several key scenes br br this 2 5 hour movie could have been reduced to about a 2 hour movie and probably would have been a much better film had it not had the feel as if it was thrown together br br
<START> if you were a director that was looking to cast female victims for a slasher movie then surely it would make sense to add a couple of porn stars it's not as if they're inexperienced in front of the camera they have no <UNK> with the requisite nudity and how many unattractive porn queens can you name christian <UNK> obviously recognized the potential of mixing hardcore actresses with hard gore effects and so he cast four of adult <UNK> <UNK> and most notorious stars jenna jameson <UNK> <UNK> ginger <UNK> allen and taylor hayes all turn up for cameos in arguably the most intriguing slasher flick to be released since scream <UNK> the genre br br <UNK> was originally intended for a cinema release in october 2002 thus keeping in check with the halloween based synopsis unfortunately the shoot was plagued by numerous problems which have thus prevented the feature from achieving the exposure that it deserves last i heard it had been signed by film 2000 here in the uk and was penned for a late october release direct to dvd unfortunately that label has got a <UNK> abysmal track record with <UNK> slashers not content with <UNK> our shelves with camp blood and its follow up they were also responsible for <UNK> <UNK> bleed and the <UNK> paranoid could <UNK> finally be worthwhile <UNK> to their <UNK> <UNK> cannon br br five canadian american students and their teacher head to southern ireland as part of their history course upon arrival they are told the legend of a <UNK> clan that <UNK> the hills of scotland and murdered locals for food the cannibals were eventually caught and burnt at the stake but it's <UNK> that one of the tribe escaped and headed to the <UNK> of ireland to find <UNK> after the kids have settled and begun doing what all massacre fodder does in these flicks the mandatory <UNK> two shoes and definite heroine candidate begins to be <UNK> by a shadow <UNK> around late at night could it be that the flesh hungry maniac is still at large in the

acting <UNK> like a drugged out <UNK> finally to add insult to injury the producers got cold feet just before the flick was about to hit shelves and began talking of re editing and <UNK> all the gore reports have said that they were unhappy about the <UNK> amounts of violence and they wanted to <UNK> scenes down so it would achieve an r rating <UNK> of course <UNK> seeing how his entire synopsis was <UNK> by its <UNK> graphic display eventually after months of arguments the director <UNK> company with warehouse productions and the feature was once again locked in the <UNK> br br despite countless <UNK> <UNK> slasher <UNK> is still one of the best genre pieces to be released since the new millennium the copy i was sent was the pre release <UNK> which was obviously a test press without sound effects or the complete soundtrack but still it <UNK> a few credible jump scares some superb cinematography and a couple of the <UNK> set pieces that i've seen for some time one guy is <UNK> via his <UNK> before being <UNK> with his own <UNK> jenna jameson is stripped naked and <UNK> in <UNK> close up and <UNK> <UNK> ends up <UNK> her <UNK> after an unfortunate rescue attempt from her boyfriend richard <UNK> even though the murders are <UNK> gruesome <UNK> never feels mean spirited which is basically due to the characters being <UNK> portrayed as basic slasher clichés in all honesty the script was perhaps the movies biggest downfall because the dialogue was not so much inspired by wes craven's scream movies as it was <UNK> cut and <UNK> from them br br certainly the inclusion of the mouth <UNK> jenna jameson was a great move by the producers her fans will be excited to know that she does whip off her top as expected and so does <UNK> <UNK> and taylor hayes but <UNK> is no soft porn movie and it benefits from sticking to the structure that it set out to produce it's worth noting that the aforementioned <UNK> stars almost out perform the supposed <UNK> of the feature which isn't much of a <UNK> ginger <UNK> was at least notable if you ignore the shameful <UNK> accent and her battle with the <UNK> killer was superbly performed and choreographed by alan <UNK> taylor and jenna delivered <UNK> poor <UNK> which could have been caused by the numerous problems on set <UNK> direction of the cinematography was excellently constructed and he provides some much needed <UNK> of suspense exciting and crisp photography is mixed with a good flair for storytelling and the net result is a slasher <UNK> to satisfy even the most critical gore <UNK> br br it will be interesting to see what kind of final cut is released of <UNK> <UNK> has it that a second director was <UNK> in to shoot a different ending and i'm curious as to how much of the explicit gore will remain intact for worldwide distribution if the end result is only half as good as the rough print that i watched then it's still better than nearly all of the genre pieces that have been unleashed over the past ten years this one is certainly worth checking <UNK>
<START> this entry is certainly interesting for series fans like myself but yet it is mostly incomprehensible the plot is confusing as is the sequel continuity some striking effects to be sure but we never find out what it all really means br br try to see the <UNK> 17 <UNK> version which contains the gore that was cut to be re rated r
<START> normally i'm quite <UNK> to like low budget <UNK> films but darkman iii is so <UNK> <UNK> that i feel nothing but contempt for it br br it looks and feels like a tv show and a particularly shoddy one at that the sets are sparse the lighting flat the score and effects disjointed and the <UNK> is film school 101 there's no plot to speak of the characters are one dimensional and the actors are <UNK> most of the cast look like they should be doing soft core porn in fact the only reward that i got from this mess was <UNK> the startling <UNK> faced <UNK> <UNK> dawson <UNK> from star trek voyager without her <UNK> <UNK> head makeup on her skin tone is about two shades lighter than it is in voyager either she's been <UNK> down for this role or <UNK> up for voyager very strange either way
<START> trite clichéd dialog and plotting the same kind of stuff we saw all through the 1980s fantasy movies hokey music and a paint by numbers characters knocks this out of the running for all but the most hardcore fans br br what saves this film from the junk heap is the beautiful <UNK> of bakshi's work the <UNK> and the fact that frank <UNK> taught the animators how to draw like him this is <UNK> in motion the violence is spectacular and the art direction and animation are unlike any other sword <UNK> movie of the period br br i like to watch this with the sound off playing the soundtrack to the first conan movie instead
<START> the <UNK> never judge a book by it's cover was <UNK> as a warning to those who fail to look beneath the surface br br as i viewed the artwork to king of the ants i instantly thought horror the <UNK> imagery proudly displayed on the cover back spoke of a dark vision the synopsis promised a story of murder betrayal <UNK> instead what i discovered beneath that surface was less interesting than what you can find under your average rock br br king of the ants features chris l <UNK> as sean <UNK> an average guy ready to make a name for himself in this world even if it means murder except sean <UNK> is someone you don't care about never once did i feel any compassion or sympathy for this character in fact he's downright unlikable but not as much as daniel baldwin ray <UNK> who turns in an uninspired performance as a made all the worst by the utterly laughable dialogue he is forced to <UNK> throw in <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> widow who apparently has <UNK> trust <UNK> in the homeless and little to no common sense and george <UNK> as duke which is basically a sober norm from cheers but mean br br now there are a couple of interesting <UNK> sequences in this film the source of the cover images but this film never <UNK> further into that world it prefers to <UNK> you with <UNK> characters bad dialogue and unlikely event after unlikely event oh the horror
<START> i love henry james books and washington square was no exception i was very excited to see a new movie coming out based on the book of that title jennifer jason lee is an exceptional actress and ben chaplin good enough to play the lead roles albert finney is miscast and doesn't carry the role well i wanted to shoot maggie smith or rather her silly insipid role the real problem and what's lacking in this latest version is a good script music and direction br br i fell asleep in the theater watching this long drawn out and exceptionally boring movie there are more pauses in the dialog than a <UNK> play in the book i felt a deep caring for catherine <UNK> and her life the movie had just the opposite effect i also disliked the twist where her aunt has a sexual attraction to morris <UNK> <UNK> br br watch it if you can't sleep it's a definite <UNK> don't watch it if you're depressed you'll need <UNK> after this br br sure the <UNK> was exceptional with olivia <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in the title roles the actor who played her father was on the mark as the <UNK> cold father still <UNK> for his dead wife and hating catherine for it the movie was not faithful to the book but neither is this one br br this movie was a box office flop i have no doubts as to why
<START> white noise had potential to be one of the most talked about movies since the exorcist i think seeing as <UNK> is supposedly true it really had an easy passage to be a feared true fact not many movies come along that really <UNK> fear into the minds of people like i said this movie could have but did not the movie <UNK> itself to a low class pg 13 scary movie nothing compared to the ring or the sixth sense by any means someone really needs to just take charge in the horror movie industry and just make a movie that not only makes us think but it makes us jump scream everything a horror movie should do i'm honestly sick of the pg 13 horror genre because its becoming a genre of its own we need the old days back the blood and gore days the freddy <UNK> the jason the mike myers days few movies can pull off a think about this mentality being so not scary so why try to pull it off a few good jumps in this movie amount to nothing but one of the stupidest endings in movie history with no resolution at all don't waste your money on this movie
<START> the funny sound that you may hear when you <UNK> this <UNK> version of jules <UNK> classic journey to the center of the earth is <UNK> spinning in his grave the only thing about this 80 minute <UNK> that has anything to do with journey to the center of the earth is the title otherwise everything else in this lackluster production is new and not worth watching in fact the director has written here at imdb com that he directed only eight minutes of journey to the center of the earth and the studio tacked on part of <UNK> <UNK> albert <UNK> sequel to his own alien from l a with kathy ireland evidently the producers ran out of money and to satisfy overseas <UNK> <UNK> they <UNK> <UNK> sequel onto director rusty <UNK> movie please don't rent or buy this wretched piece of garbage br br unlike director henry <UNK> period piece journey to the center of the earth 1959 with james mason and pat <UNK> <UNK> journey to the center of the earth takes place in contemporary times in hawaii two <UNK> a british <UNK> and a dog are brought together for the adventure of a lifetime purely by coincidence richard paul <UNK> of blind date and his comic book obsessed brother bryan <UNK> mitchell smith of weird science are going out to explore a cave the heroine <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of underworld works for a domestic service called <UNK> r us ' being a <UNK> has been <UNK> life long dream but she has made a less of all five of her <UNK> jobs nevertheless her sympathetic <UNK> ms ferry <UNK> marshall of africa express sends her to hawaii <UNK> new client rock star billy foul jeremy <UNK> of <UNK> who is <UNK> one last concert to revive his <UNK> career has a dog named bernard foul wants <UNK> to take bernard to a <UNK> day <UNK> <UNK> is waiting on the arrival of her taxi when a <UNK> motel attendant accidentally puts the basket that <UNK> bernard in <UNK> <UNK> you see foul has hidden his <UNK> in a basket because motel management strictly <UNK> pets on their premises foul has disguised the dog as a human baby anyway <UNK> catches a cab and tells the driver follow richard br br after she catches up with them to get her dog the <UNK> <UNK> away and <UNK> her <UNK> demands that richard drive her back to town but he has other plans <UNK> <UNK> joins the guys and they get lost and then find themselves in the lost city of atlantis a police state ruled by a dictator at the center of the earth the <UNK> of atlantis repeatedly <UNK> their citizens that life on the surface does not exist our heroes and heroine stumble onto atlantis quite by accident atlantis resembles a disco and everybody looks like they are straight out of a punk rock opera the <UNK> of atlantis general <UNK> janet du <UNK> of operation hit squad is <UNK> a raid on the surface with <UNK> of the first human <UNK> <UNK> kathy ireland of necessary <UNK> to visit atlantis predictably general <UNK> <UNK> to rule atlantis and <UNK> the earth fails and our heroes and heroine save the day br br journey to the center of the earth is an abomination the movie seems to be a comedy despite its superficial satire about <UNK> albert <UNK> is one of my favorite low budget action directors but he blew it on this lightweight <UNK> of a science fiction saga
<START> otto preminger directs this light as a <UNK> story <UNK> jean <UNK> and her equally <UNK> widower father david niven holiday in the south of france with nutty <UNK> <UNK> things are fine until family friend deborah kerr shows up <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> finds the conquest of kerr too hard to resist that's fine with <UNK> as long as niven loves her and leaves her as he's done with all the women in his past including <UNK> when it appears as though she's becoming second banana in <UNK> life <UNK> exact revenge on kerr preminger tells the story in flashbacks from <UNK> perspective and cleverly combines black and white with <UNK> color scenes the cinematography by georges <UNK> is stunning the film features some of <UNK> least heavy handed direction although he rarely allows any close ups which makes it difficult to make out what the actors are really feeling arthur <UNK> wrote the script and it's full of <UNK> dialog and funny scenes mostly involving bird <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> herself fairly well but niven is at his least appealing and he shows no chemistry with either <UNK> or kerr preminger really <UNK> steps with that casting it's a role that seems <UNK> made for someone closer to charles boyer with geoffrey <UNK> as <UNK> would be <UNK> and <UNK> hunt as his <UNK> mother juliette <UNK> playing herself sings the title song in a paris nightclub the great titles are by preminger regular <UNK> bass
<START> i only recently found out that madeleine <UNK> novel had been turned into a tv movie by disney and ordered the dvd the book was a favorite of mine when i was a child and i read it several times br br despite some of the child actors not resembling the characters as described in the novel the <UNK> family is well cast with a likable if too pretty meg at the center and a charles wallace who is convincing as a child <UNK> without becoming irritating br br the first half hour is promising enough doing a good job in establishing the relationships between the lead characters and at setting the scene unfortunately as soon as the non human characters appear the adaptation starts to unravel and once the children leave earth the whole thing falls apart <UNK> <UNK> is too youthful looking and much too regal as the eccentric mrs <UNK> think <UNK> <UNK> or joan <UNK> instead and kate <UNK> face is so mask like and <UNK> she must have visited faye <UNK> plastic surgeon in recent years for some reason they make her mrs which look like <UNK> from the wizard of oz when she should have <UNK> a <UNK> wicked witch of the west br br in the end what lets this down most badly are the terrible special effects and art direction i understand that this is a tv movie but the cgi looked like something that could have been done 15 years earlier mrs <UNK> <UNK> incarnation is a disaster as is the <UNK> like suit for aunt beast who in the novel is a <UNK> elegant creature instead of the <UNK> big foot like thing shown here i could go on and on nearly every artistic choice is a disaster presumably because there wasn't a large enough budget to do this justice but also because the design work lacks imagination and good judgement br br this really would have needed the sense of wonder spielberg brought to his early films what a shame that with the current popularity of adapting children's literary fantasy series nobody thought of adapting a <UNK> in time and it's sequels for the big screen giving it the scope it deserves
<START> what a disappointment admittedly the best of the <UNK> but the story is weak the plot is rushed and the end result is just a collection of set pieces poorly realised and tacked together <UNK> there are numerous continuity errors that clash <UNK> with the original films and the <UNK> of darth vader was handled so terribly that what could have been a legendary moment in modern cinema is now instead a cheesy goof that will be <UNK> for many years i won't complain about the abysmal dialogue as this is star wars the original three films had style cult feeling and cracking stories and the strange dialogue added charm the <UNK> were shallow attempts to make more money and this lack of love shows in <UNK> utterly disappointing
<START> this is very dated but that's part of the charm with this 1933 movie you can say the same for most pre code films they're just different and usually in an interesting way br br it was the short running time the great acting of spencer tracy and the beautiful face and <UNK> of loretta <UNK> character which kept me watching and enjoying this <UNK> but intriguing film br br you'd be hard pressed to find a <UNK> girl than <UNK> played by the 20 year old young who was already into making her <UNK> movie she started acting as a small child that and the fact they made movies quickly back in the old days the camera although in soft focus throughout much of the film <UNK> in on <UNK> face and eyes many times and i was <UNK> by her beauty br br playing a <UNK> man with a cynical <UNK> on life <UNK> bill slowly transformed into a loving man thanks to <UNK> spencer delivered his lines here with such <UNK> that you hardly knew he was acting br br although they have small roles supporting actors walter connolly <UNK> <UNK> arthur <UNK> and glenda farrell leave lasting impressions long after viewing this 75 minute film i was particularly fascinated with <UNK> role as the minister father figure of the camp br br the story is a little far fetched but hey that's the movies this story is about two lonely great depression victims trying to survive in a <UNK> type camp and it winds up to be a very touching tale
<START> just below the surface lies what a simply awful movie is what br br as other viewers have <UNK> commented the storm sequences are just plain ridiculous <UNK> already <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> rain now that's smart menace foreboding sexual tension for those read dull contrived dull contrived and dull overly contrived br br i want to say thank god for <UNK> <UNK> shower scene but in retrospect i think the producers of the film having seen the completed mess realised that they had to put something in to make it half way worthwhile at all so it just becomes yet another <UNK> do yourself a favour and give this a miss
<START> i didn't know if i would laugh or cry seeing this only addicted fans of <UNK> filth could have a taste for this this is supposed to be a horror movie but there's only filth in this the most cool scene is the car accident with real special effects from the best of hollywood avoid this movie at all costs see this only for studies of how bad can be a movie
<START> the film is about a young man michael who cares for the elderly one day he decides to kill some of the relatives of his <UNK> around the same time he decides to model his killing after the zodiac killer of the 60's he gets in touch with the author of a book about the zodiac killer and they form a friendship michael has a gun <UNK> the only gun as it seems to be in the hands of some of the other actors only not portrayed as the same gun and he goes out a <UNK> original br br this is a great film if you like b movies i thought the idea of the movie was good but the editing and the acting really drowned the plot i thought the <UNK> was just too fake the lighting was horrible in some places and the dialog was just too standard the movie was shot on video which is okay but the editing of the film just made for some weird <UNK> <UNK> scenes not a bad movie for fans of the b movie genre but if you want something with a bit more polish move on to something else
<START> just re saw this movie after thirty seven years i was eleven years old and caught this flick on south beach at the long gone cinema theater on washington <UNK> in 1969 i thought where it's at was a very good movie now however after almost forty years it's not as good as it was times have changed and this movie is now a tired old re <UNK> of the war between the generations it did however catch a place in time which is just a memory it's really interesting to see the <UNK> fashions the old vegas a slim don <UNK> chain smoking and a hip opening song the acting was decent the script somewhat out dated but the memories were still fresh where it's at may not be where it's at for you but for me it was still a nice and entertaining trip down memory lane
<START> br br so not being a poet myself i have no real way to convey the beauty and simplicity of this documentary the <UNK> motion of goldsworthy as he <UNK> <UNK> beauty into his own work is captivating watch him stick <UNK> together in a web hanging from a tree in a close up for a few minutes while he speaks of his work and then receive the payoff when the camera cuts to the wide shot be amazed by the ease with which he <UNK> and then realize the <UNK> when a slight <UNK> knocks down the entire web br br the genius of goldsworthy seemingly knows no <UNK> as his inspiration is nature itself it is in the essential change of nature where his work though complete in its own <UNK> is made whole
<START> this is a very enjoyable film with excellent actors and actresses <UNK> a range of emotions it contains some really excellent humour which the whole family can enjoy you get to know the characters quickly and experience their ups and downs and it ends very upbeat
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> more style and grace just moving from standing to sitting on the floor than you can find in most other movies the director has produced more memorable scenes of touching beauty than it would seem possible the music and dancing is of the highest possible quality you may notice in the first dance scene the director has all sorts of things occurring in the background other girl dancing a drunk falling down stairs much activity but he knew that we would be watching <UNK> dance and i'll bet unless you viewed this many times you didn't notice all in all perfection j q
<START> bill and ted are back only this time an evil dude from the future has sent back an evil bill and ted to destroy them thus destroying <UNK> <UNK> and the basis for human society in the future this time bill and ted have to travel through the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and save humanity <UNK> br br with much of the same zany humour and some wonderful new characters like the grim <UNK> station and robot bill and ted stations creation bogus journey once again entertains and is worth watching for its soundtrack alone br br 7 10 br br a most <UNK> sequel br br party on <UNK> <UNK>
<START> chinese ghost story iii is a totally superfluous sequel to two excellent fantasy films the film delivers the spell casting special effects that one can expect but fails painfully on all other <UNK> the actors all play extremely silly caricatures you have to be still in <UNK> to find their slapstick humor even remotely funny the plot is predictable and the development is sometimes <UNK> and often slow towards the end the movie begins to resemble old godzilla films including <UNK> larger than life special effects and a well yet another ghost with a godzilla head maybe i would have <UNK> if i was expecting camp br br it is astonishing to see what trash fantasy fans have to put up with in this case because somebody thought they could squeeze a little extra money out of a successful formula they won't be able to do it again the cash cow is now dead as a <UNK>
<START> <UNK> out of heaven a gang of horny naked female angels with big plastic <UNK> have taken up <UNK> in a spooky forest where they feed upon any hapless souls who should wander by it's not long before a group of friends on a road trip are falling victim to the <UNK> <UNK> an independent low budget horror made in the uk forest of the damned takes an interesting premise and <UNK> it down the pan with some of the worst acting effects and direction i have seen in a long time br br director <UNK> roberts shows some occasional flair behind the camera  the scenes in the <UNK> house are fairly tense and there are some <UNK> handled <UNK> moments but for the most part the film is technically amateurish throw in some truly awful performances from horror icons tom <UNK> and shaun <UNK> and you have one real bad movie on your hands br br some fun may be derived from the film's sheer <UNK> and there is loads of female nudity for the guys to <UNK> but most will find this a chore to sit through
<START> in rosenstrasse <UNK> von <UNK> <UNK> two stories to create a vibrant <UNK> of love and courage the film depicts a family drama of <UNK> between a mother and her daughter and the story of german women who staged a protest on rosenstrasse to free their jewish husbands from certain <UNK> in addition to the <UNK> of historical events the focus of the film is on the saving of a child from the holocaust by a german and the result of the child's experience of losing her mother while ms von <UNK> shows that the courage of a small number of germans made a difference she does not use it to excuse german society indeed she shows how in the midst of torture and <UNK> the wealthy artists and <UNK> of german high society went on about their lives and parties oblivious to the suffering br br rosenstrasse opens in new york as a jewish widow ruth <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> decides to sit <UNK> a seven day period of mourning that takes place following a funeral in which jewish family members <UNK> full attention to remembering and mourning the deceased when her daughter hannah maria <UNK> is forbidden to receive phone calls from her fiancé luis <UNK> van <UNK> a non jew hannah questions why her mother has suddenly decided to follow an <UNK> tradition that she previously rejected when ruth <UNK> rejects her cousin hannah questions her and learns about a woman named lena who took ruth in as a child when the <UNK> mother was <UNK> and murdered by the nazis and she <UNK> to find lena and discover the secret of her mother's past br br her quest takes her to berlin where she finds lena doris <UNK> now ninety years old and interviews her on the <UNK> that she is a journalist <UNK> certain aspects of the holocaust with <UNK> memory lena tells her story of how as a young 33 year old woman <UNK> <UNK> she searched for her husband jewish <UNK> <UNK> israel <UNK> martin <UNK> who disappeared and was presumed to have been imprisoned despite the protection normally given jews in mixed <UNK> lena in a <UNK> performance by <UNK> discovers that her husband and other jews are being held prisoner in a former factory on the rosenstrasse br br standing together in the <UNK> night german women whose husband are missing <UNK> outside the building their numbers growing daily until they reach one thousand shouting give us back our husbands lena finds ruth <UNK> <UNK> a young girl whose mother is in the building she takes care of her protecting her from the <UNK> and raising her after her mother is killed lena comes from an <UNK> german family and her brother recently returned from <UNK> is a <UNK> officer after being refused help from her father to free <UNK> she <UNK> the aid of her brother who tells a fellow officer i know what they do to the jews i saw it given his support she is bold enough to <UNK> channels and go to the top where her beauty and charm prove irresistible for the minister of culture joseph <UNK> a known <UNK> while this fictional part of the film has been criticized as <UNK> to the women <UNK> it is a historical fact that <UNK> was very active in making the decisions affecting rosenstrasse br br the director <UNK> von <UNK> an <UNK> feminist and intellectual is no stranger to political drama she directed a film about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> a story of the relationship between two sisters one of whom <UNK> to political violence to accomplish her liberal <UNK> in rosenstrasse a film she worked on for eight years she had to make <UNK> adding the present day fictional element in order to have her film produced that it works so well is a tribute to ms von <UNK> artistry and the beautiful screenplay by pamela <UNK> whose father was a <UNK> from <UNK> the events at rosenstrasse give the lie to germans who say there was nothing we could do now von <UNK> has shown the opposite to be true that something could be done to resist the nazis it is tragic that the example did not catch on
<START> i first rented this film many years ago and was completely enthralled by it just recently feeling a strange need to <UNK> some of the way too few films that i've immensely enjoyed in my lifetime i decided to give <UNK> another look and i'm glad i did as i soon discovered that even the passage of time has not in the least <UNK> the shine of this film br br the story is about a <UNK> girl <UNK> played remarkably by <UNK> <UNK> in some respects she resembles <UNK> <UNK> who accidentally burns down her <UNK> mansion after which the grandmother played downright <UNK> by irene <UNK> forces the girl into a life of prostitution on the road to <UNK> the <UNK> br br the viewing is at once fascinating and compelling though <UNK> of the basic premise which deals with prostitution is <UNK> void of gratuitous steamy sexual content the story revolves more around the interactions between the girl and her grandmother and the various other colorful characters with whom they come into contact on their <UNK> which by the way is in the rough and <UNK> part of rural mexico br br the film is very atmospheric <UNK> enigmatic with a decided <UNK> quality it sometimes borders on the bizarre but not to the point of say a david lynch film it's also worth mentioning that the film is very <UNK> in nature read the comments from previous viewers below br br often in the background you hear the sounds of a lone <UNK> quiet and melancholy adding just the right musical accents to highlight the mexican setting the cinematography of the rural places many of which are in the desert is quite superb br br the film moves at a nice pace neither too fast nor too slow and after every scene i felt i had to <UNK> the tape and play it over again just because it makes you want to do that for me anyway it really is that compelling br br hopefully you will see the film in its spanish language version with subtitles i studied spanish in high school as well as in college and i was happy to be able to understand much of the dialogue <UNK> <UNK> el <UNK> no <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the world's not as big as i thought i e it's a small world br br this film somehow reminds me of stumbling upon a dusty old bottle of vintage wine which upon drinking is immensely satisfying however you are left with some sadness upon realizing that there aren't more <UNK> just like this one
<START> was it a thriller as i thought when i saw the cover at the video library no was it a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as the author was maybe trying to make it not really so what was it it was a very average movie that had great potential and was nicely directed but let down by a confusing story without strong points beginning middle and end with poor acting expect from the serial killer guy who although he seemed <UNK> at some points delivered the best performance of the cast overall it was nice cinematography with good colours cool hi <UNK> stuff beautiful <UNK> but leaves you lost about where it's going and where it has just been and with a feeling of let's just quickly wrap it up in the end ok to watch if there's nothing else on tv
<START> i can enjoy a guilty pleasure vigilante flick but this is just bad and not bad in a way you might enjoy seeing mst3k make fun of it it's just <UNK> bad like you can't find anything to enjoy about this no matter how hard you try i truly regret wasting 2 hours of precious life on this crap you can tell by watching it that no one was asked to act and everyone in it knew this film would only bury their careers apparently walking tall has garnered enough <UNK> that someone decided they could make a buck off their investment if it's not the worst film i've seen it's so bad that it's <UNK> the worse films from my memory
<START> this is a very bad western mainly because it is historically inaccurate it looks as if it were shot on a back lot in california instead of where jack <UNK> lived and died <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and montana it <UNK> everything that is known about this mysterious <UNK> man ' <UNK> man ' the script is horrible there is very little direction and lousy acting dorothy malone is completely wasted as his wife mark steven never seems to know how to portray this mysterious jack <UNK> in real life jack <UNK> was a very good stage line <UNK> he was feared by his local <UNK> for his hard drinking when drunk he would start fights and cause other problems in virginia city montana to <UNK> that he could never <UNK> them again <UNK> <UNK> jack <UNK> after he ignored their warning to leave town immediately this is a horrible movie i can not recommend anyone to watch this movie other than to see how hollywood <UNK> history at will even to this day
<START> i am a fan of the previous best of the best films but this one was awful no wonder i had such a hard time finding it i tried 4 video rental stores until i found one with a copy of this movie the acting was terrible the plot was a joke and the action was bad as well br br i really miss alex grady travis <UNK> and the original <UNK> characters and theme that this film had with the first 2 movies br br john
<START> deliverance is the fascinating haunting and sometimes even disturbing tale by james <UNK> turned into a brilliant movie by john <UNK> it's about four <UNK> driven by <UNK> and macho behavior <UNK> spending a <UNK> weekend high up in the mountains up there they're faced with every darkest side of man and every worst form of human misery poverty <UNK> and even physical <UNK> these four men intended to travel down the river for adventure and excitement but their trip soon changes into an odyssey through a violent and lurking mountain land completely estranged from all forms of <UNK> all these elements actually make deliverance one of the most nightmarish films i've ever seen just about everything that happens to these men you pray that you'll never find yourself to be in a similar situation pure talking cinema deliverance is a very important movie as well john <UNK> best closely followed by <UNK> and <UNK> was and still is a very influential film and it contains several memorable scenes that already featured in <UNK> other movies just think about the terrific <UNK> <UNK> musical score and of course the unforgettable homosexual <UNK> like a pig rape scene all the actors deliver haha perfect acting performances especially jon voight a must see motion picture
<START> this show was absolutely terrible for one george isn't funny and his kids are <UNK> little <UNK> he also treats his mother with no respect as a hispanic i am highly offended by this show and the way the characters are portrayed br br plus the dysfunctional family <UNK> been done to death for once i want to see something original what makes this show funny when other shows have done it millions of times i thought abc would come to its senses and pull this piece of garbage off the air but sadly we're going to have to stomach this until they jump the shark br br in my opinion they already did

<START> simply well written directed and acted <UNK> best of the <UNK> if not his best since the 80's hugh jackman was the perfect pick for his roll scarlett <UNK> banter with woody proves how well rounded an actress she has become br br it's refreshing to not being in a romance on screen with the leading lady he plays the perfect bumbling magician br br there have been a few reviews <UNK> this movie don't let them stop you from seeing the wonderfully done film people in the crowd i saw this with were laughing so loud at some lines i missed the next line if you like woody allen films of the 70's you'll regret missing this one br br i suggest you go to watch this film with an open mind if you do you might walk out smiling
<START> oh the hilarity oh the joy another film that is so bad it's good or so i thought in actual fact this one misses the so bad its good phase and goes sadly straight to the could have been so bad its good but they screwed it up and made it plain bad br br for a start its way too long cut half an hour and it might have been more <UNK> then put in such ludicrous plots as the man who is <UNK> the mission to save the earth because he has all the food <UNK> and he'll be rich if the mission fails duh or the talking bomb plot device last seen in dark star guess what just like in dark star the bomb has a <UNK> <UNK> add in a dash of we can't act our way out of a <UNK> play and you have <UNK> crisis in a nutshell br br light relief is to be had in the form of jack palance or jack pants as we called him in this flick whose sole purpose in the film is to drive a kid around the desert and <UNK> the kid's dad to come pick him up eventually between driving and <UNK> jack <UNK> pointless drivel and <UNK> and <UNK> a lot but contributes little to the story such as it is in short he's the best bit of the movie br br my award for the most ironic line delivered straight faced goes to charlton heston who when meeting his <UNK> son for the first time in ages comments that his son looks a little out of shape whilst he himself is standing there with his gut <UNK> over his <UNK> and in dire need of a captain kirk <UNK> br br also amusing is the bad guy's top henchman who has a bright white <UNK> that kept making me think of andy <UNK> for some reason br br apart from these <UNK> there's little to recommend this movie the ending is a sequence copied from but mercifully shorter than the end sequence from 2001 br br <UNK> for enjoying this movie more if you are foolish enough to watch it like i did br br 1 any time the bomb speaks imagine it's called <UNK> trust me it works br br 2 whenever chuck heston is on screen and about to speak pre <UNK> him by <UNK> a line from planet of the apes such as get your filthy <UNK> off me or similar br br 3 whenever the female lead is looking <UNK> this is most of the time keep hoping against hope that she's having an <UNK> and will die soon br br 4 during the interminable the <UNK> broke again scenes keep hoping the tech engineer guys will <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> like you <UNK> change the laws of physics or some such crap br br other than that do what it takes to get you through this one i <UNK> off half way through and woke to realise i hadn't missed anything nor had the plot laughable though it is advanced any so don't worry about <UNK> out for a few you won't miss anything
<START> this movie is very entertaining and any critique is based on personal <UNK> not the films quality other than the common excessive profanity in some scenes by murphy the film is a great vehicle for his type of humor it has some pretty good special effects and exciting action scenes br br as a <UNK> of lost children murphy's character starts off looking for a missing girl which leads him on the path for which others believe he was chosen to protect the golden child the young boy is born as an <UNK> one destined to save the world from evil forces but whose very life is in danger if not for the help of murphy and his beautiful mysterious and mystical <UNK> guide <UNK> br br also there are moments of philosophical lessons to challenge the audience members who are interested in <UNK> deep thoughts one such scene is where the golden child that murphy's character is <UNK> to protect is tested by the monks of the mountain temple an elderly monk presents a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> for the child to choose from and the child is tested on his choice br br this is a fantasy comedy that is based on the notion that there are both good and evil forces in our world of which most people are completely unaware as we accept this premise of the plot we must let go of our touch with a perceived daily reality and prepare for the earth and walls to <UNK> away and reveal a realm of evil just waiting to destroy us br br this is an excellent movie with a good plot fine acting and for the most part pretty decent dialogue combining a serious topic with a healthy balance of martial art fighting and eddie murphy humor

<START> after buying the dvd in a bargain bin due to the impressive amount of features listed on the cover i popped it in the dvd player and everything looked good nice animated <UNK> and a whole lot of extra features but when i played the movie itself what a let down it is the worst thing i have ever seen and i have seen some bad movies in my time the comment that <UNK> the movie here at imdb is actually from the people who made the film so don't believe it unless you like to waste your cash

<START> wow a truly fantastic <UNK> movie that has tons of super surreal imagery dark intent and a black pretty strange sense of how cartoon animals must see the world it's populated with a very cute off world bunch of characters that bend and flow with <UNK> backgrounds as with all cool fantasy the wandering plot is secondary to the eye popping visuals and we follow a little cat and his zombie sister as they encounter death <UNK> water elephants samurai <UNK> and pigs that fish i'd never heard of it but now i love it probably because it reminded me of the surreal <UNK> work of american <UNK> bill <UNK> it's a demented delight for fans of odd pretty things and it had me glued to the screen for fear i'd miss something amazing simply put it's <UNK> <UNK> without the <UNK>
<START> branagh is one of the few who understands the difference between a film and a play hamlet is probably the most faithful adaptation of shakespeare to a film and yet is a very dynamic film almost an action thriller the scene of <UNK> meeting with his father's ghost won't leave your mind
<START> this movie was crap with a capital c the opening scene showed promise but that promise was broken shortly after the viewer learns where the plot is going br br and the wooden statue <UNK> who was rather creepy in the original film looks plain goofy in this one it was so obviously just a guy in a cheap plastic costume and by the way who else thinks <UNK> is one of the most un scary names on planet earth it ranks right up there with jimmy or fred when it comes to horror value or why not just name the wooden <UNK> henry <UNK> <UNK> run it's dr <UNK> <UNK> be about as scary as <UNK> br br and then there's a scene where the hero hits his father's <UNK> with a <UNK> you might guess a two by four someone might venture no he <UNK> beats his father's <UNK> with a <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> but worse than that once the characters walk away the <UNK> actually and inexplicably <UNK> oh brother br br there's also a native american guy who lives with the main character's grandparents but apparently does nothing except <UNK> <UNK> he <UNK> creepy <UNK> legends warns those who <UNK> and even <UNK> <UNK> arm when it becomes damaged during a childish prank but for all his respect for and <UNK> toward <UNK> does <UNK> give a <UNK> hairy behind no br br the movie drags on and eventually several people die in ways that <UNK> to their worst fears sort of this film is a real <UNK> don't rent it
<START> never having seen this movie based on the entertaining novel by nicholas <UNK> and taking into consideration the first rate cast assembled for the production we decided to take a look just cause while not a horrible film takes too many liberties with the original material that <UNK> stuart didn't quite succeed in his treatment <UNK> <UNK> directed br br the first thing we think when a young black man is <UNK> to the local <UNK> for <UNK> is police brutality after all sheriff <UNK> brown and police officer <UNK> show no mercy in beating bobby earl who is accused of killing a young white girl we feel horrified by what the officers do to the prisoner br br then the scene changes <UNK> bobby <UNK> grandmother is sent north to ask a distinguished <UNK> professor a retired lawyer the young man wants paul armstrong to defend him she old woman is convincing enough for armstrong to take a look at the case he is also convinced of the young man's innocence br br things are not exactly what we thought they were when blair sullivan a man who is serving time in the same facility as bobby earl comes forward to tell about how he is connected to the young girl's murder and changes the dynamics of the case the way it plays in the movie it serves to confuse the viewer and distract armstrong from arriving at the truth br br this thriller is made enjoyable by sean connery who plays armstrong laurence fishburne an intense actor makes a fine impression as the sheriff who as far as we can see is guilty of <UNK> his prisoner ed harris has a wonderful opportunity to show why he is one of our best actors blair <UNK> kate <UNK> ruby dee and the young scarlett johansson are seen in supporting roles br br the film even with its faults will not disappoint
<START> what seemed as a good premise for a movie unfortunately it fails to deliver on nearly every level very hard to follow at the start of the movie i actually found myself fighting the urge to turn it off the biggest problem from a visual aspect is the fact that the camera work is simply over the top with so many arty <UNK> and semi <UNK> cuts throughout the movie that actually <UNK> you from the from the overall story it really tries too hard to <UNK> you in the moment and build to a suspenseful ending but the movie just has so many half conceived characters and non relevant script it just leaves you feeling disappointed and confused as to why they tried to go so deep with it
<START> if you didn't enjoy this movie either your dead or you hate adam sandler or don cheadle br br an excellent cast all of who gave good performances this movie proved that adam sandler is good actor despite what critics say adam sandler is becoming a very well respected actor it all started with his performance in big daddy then he did a couple bad movies then he broke through with terrific performance in 50 first dates the longest yard then click and now reign over me br br back to the movie adam sandler plays a man who has lost everything the closest thing to family he has are a mother in law and father in law after his old college roommate cheadle ran into him he seems to turn his life around i will say no more because i do not want to ruin the movie but i strongly recommend this movie one of the best movies of 2007
<START> this film resembles in many ways enemy of the <UNK> with will smith and gene hackman as we have an innocent black man being pursued by the <UNK> with all the modern technology known to man usually when storyline is copied like this the result is a disaster that does not apply here of course i love everything david morse does so maybe my comments are not fair but there were more good things about this film then that the main <UNK> played by doug <UNK> was brilliant and the story <UNK> with excellent extras such as david <UNK> and robert <UNK> our hero alvin sanders played by jamie foxx was however irritating most of the part he is so out of place cracking bad jokes <UNK> no sympathy from the audience or not to begin with the strange thing is that he kinda grows on you and on his followers as well i didn't expect much when i rented it but was surprised with a good solid action movie with comedy bits 7 10
<START> it's one of those dramas that's so bad that it almost hits the point of being very funny the script is absolutely dire direction appalling lighting purely <UNK> the only thing letting it down from a true so bad it's good feel is that the sound design is only quite bad it adds no suspense to the story although trying hard but doesn't at least destroy any speeches there's continuity problems of seasons of out door shots throughout and finally last but not least the acting is appalling for a professional production it very much has the feel of a university media project you have to feel sorry for the sorry for anyone who had to put their names to this
<START> an interesting change from the first one there was more mystery to this movie then the first even when it ends your asking yourself what happened who was the killer there are some good parts through the movie the first half starts off slow and then in the last half the pace picks up all up the movie is enjoyable the story is 22 years after the events that <UNK> in the first film norman bates is out of an asylum and back to the bates motel but when a woman turns up claiming to be his real mother things start going wrong <UNK> plays an aged norman well again and the scene at the end was excellent he <UNK> that spade awfully hard
<START> anyone who had never seen anything like the fight scenes in the matrix has never seen this movie the fight scenes were choreographed by action scene psychopath <UNK> woo <UNK> who also did the fights in the matrix and the fight scenes are <UNK> br br li plays a <UNK> who feels no pain who now lives a life as a <UNK> <UNK> ya got me when other evil <UNK> begin killing off local drug <UNK> to take over the drug trade li teams up with his cop buddy to help stop them br br there are some absolutely crazy things going on in this movie one <UNK> gets his arm <UNK> off with a <UNK> of glass and hardly notices the fights scenes are filled with flying kicks and punches the body count is way up there li has seldom been better and he has surrounded himself with a <UNK> of beautiful female <UNK> <UNK> kicks some serious ass as a fellow <UNK> anthony wong even makes a cameo as a drug lord no <UNK> there he makes a cameo in every hk movie it's unfortunate they don't make action movies like this in the us i wouldn't have to sit through all of these horrible dubbing jobs to see that action that i <UNK> so much recommended
<START> i love the comics although i do have problems fully understanding the stories  the visual style is unique with all its dirt dust and <UNK> so i thought i knew what i was up for surprisingly i understood the main plot  but some extremely poorly decisions where made for its visual style br br i mean really bad looking cg human actors in close ups <UNK> it did not work at all <UNK> and the other <UNK> gods was successfully made in cg and very close to the comic version br br i think with real actors this movie could have been a cult movie br br what a shame
<START> 1st watched 8 3 2003 2 out of 10 <UNK> brad sykes mindless 3 d movie about flesh eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie <UNK> and yes we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3d wow not that has been done time and time again in <UNK> in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh eating that's what made the original zombie classics good the flesh eating was just thrown in as an extra we're actually bored throughout most of this 3 part <UNK> because of the lame twilight zone like easily understood and slow <UNK> revealed <UNK> the last story is actually the story the movie started with having a reporter investigating a so called ghost town and of course we get to see flesh eating <UNK> in that one as well well i think i've said enough watch the classics not this 3d bore feast
<START> this so called prequel is just a badly made remake to to a better version of dangerous <UNK> the plots are identical as is most of the script i loved the book its based off of and i loved the first movie but i'm not even going to bother with the 3rd movie the pointless banter between the two main characters in the prequel was completely predictable and unoriginal and i just can't stress how bad the movie was if you don't want to take my word for it just watch it and you'll see what i mean if you've read a review that says that <UNK> you likes the first one you'll like the second <UNK> the only reason that is is because it is the exact same movie although the plot is not even as good they took so many lines from the first movie its hard to tell which movie you're watching
<START> this movie is one of the funniest saddest and most accurate portrayals of the mentality that seems to have <UNK> the <UNK> yet again 45 years after the time depicted all the usual characters and conflicts are presented with such anger sadness and love combined that it is impossible to decide whether crying or laughing would be the more appropriate response the accuracy of portrayal and the <UNK> of the types however make it for a great film to watch if one wants to understand a little bit of what drove ex <UNK> to its madness in fact no <UNK> dealing with the region should attempt anything until they saw this movie and its twin <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> did i mention it is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen
<START> this was surprisingly intelligent for a tv movie and quite true to my own experience of <UNK> it was actually well <UNK> and i can only assume it was written by someone who's gone through a similar experience because it had all the little details the characters were quite well drawn and the performances by <UNK> <UNK> and alison <UNK> were great i think what i like most was that they made them specific and smart and there was no <UNK> down of the reasons for <UNK> <UNK> it wasn't some <UNK> gone out of control caused by the <UNK> placed on girls by the media <UNK> we're not actually going to address her mother wasn't completely clueless too often on television they'll take an issue that everyone has some awareness of and try to tell us that their protagonists are the last remaining people on earth who don't <UNK> what's that oh my world is all <UNK> doctor please explain it all to me as if i'm a small child etc it was brilliant that her mother was a psychologist and even she didn't see the signs and the scenes where beth was throwing up weren't overly melodramatic and <UNK> and concentrated more on <UNK> need for <UNK> and their out of <UNK> the scene where beth tells her mother she's <UNK> would've made me cry if there hadn't been other people in the room br br okay so i liked those bits what didn't work for me so well was the ending which headed back to the tv movie territory we know and don't particularly love but i guess they had to wrap it up you too can cure your child's eating disorder if you have lots and lots of money and live in america br br and can i just say again that i really like <UNK> <UNK> she's great
<START> i am and was very entertained by the movie it was my all time favorite movie of 1976 being raised in the 70's i was so in love with kris <UNK> look and demeanor of course i am no movie critic but for the time era i think it was very good i very much like the <UNK> of streisand and kristofferson i thought they worked very well together i have seen the movie many times and still love the two of them as esther and john norman i am a very huge fan of kris and see him in concert when i can what a talented singer song writer not to mention actor i have seen him in many movies but still think back to a star is born
<START> the intruder <UNK> a film directed by french director <UNK> denis is the <UNK> of film it follows its own spirit across time space and character there may be a plot but what i understood of that i picked up from the description on the netflix dvd <UNK> honestly it's probably better to know nothing about the film before watching it because then the viewer can set aside any and all expectations the film demands that the viewer think but also <UNK> the fact that he or she will not gain full understanding br br the human heart is the film's <UNK> every image questions its role its nature and its form the heart is the intruder that of the viewer and that of louis <UNK> character is played by michel <UNK> with the peace and mystery required by such a character honestly anyone could've played <UNK> character if he or she possessed a wandering willing and comfortable heart yet <UNK> is the one featured here he becomes the film his identity is <UNK> from it many of the film's images lingering in my mind <UNK> around his expressions vocal but mainly physical br br the intruder is poetic in its ability to capture the <UNK> and <UNK> of movement but more fluid than any literature in the shape it refuses to take <UNK> has been a term used in describing this film but perhaps <UNK> is a more adequate term nothing in the film exists outside of the possibilities of reality the simple <UNK> score <UNK> that by imagining in music the connection between <UNK> and dim light br br watch the trailer a few times if you're attracted to visual imagery see the film to see the consequences of the combination of <UNK> and a <UNK> for freedom
<START> as with a bunch of guys at school we must give this a thumbs up even the grim <UNK> made us smile those two alien things made me laugh bill and ted were the stupidest yet the <UNK> in the entire movie this is a lot better than the first one and yet for some reason i feel that it misses something something big something important made a better house and girlfriends no i'd say better villains use <UNK> instead of robots i gave this a 7 out of 10 because of those two robotic <UNK> br br the grim <UNK> don't be scared he's not the <UNK> kind is funny when he fell from the sky i split a gut <UNK> i'm not sure about those aliens what where they scientists no way
<START> this animated movie is a masterpiece the narration music animation and storyline where all remarkable my girlfriend and i saw it again for a second time and we got more insight from it we invited a couple friends to see spirit with us and they really enjoyed it a lot when i asked them to come along to see it they thought it was a movie about horses but afterwards they realized it was more than that i liked <UNK> spirit rain and <UNK> creek who reminds me of nathan chasing horse who is smiles a lot in dances with wolves spirit has deep symbolic meanings and <UNK> that i found to be <UNK> and inspirational br br i saw spirit for a third time and i want to go see it again i enjoyed spirit tremendously because its portrayal of american indians is realistic <UNK> and non stereotypical unlike the movie the road to el <UNK> which was a total farce because it portrayed american indians in a <UNK> and stereotypical way but <UNK> has redeemed themselves by making spirit a great movie that i found to be acceptable i hope they continue to make more animated movies like spirit and i would like to see sequels or <UNK> to spirit if its done <UNK> and without stereotyping american indians br br i highly recommend this to others who have an open mind to go and pay to see spirit <UNK> of the <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> what can i say that hasn't already been said about this great show nothing this is without a doubt one of the most well written shows i've ever encountered live action or animation the newer stuff is way too <UNK> down for my tastes and some of the mature stuff i have to <UNK> kids out of the room for but not <UNK> br br the stories are engaging and very plausible some of them could even be stretched out to an hour or two for a movie episodes like <UNK> weather and her chance to dream are very dramatic while still being enjoyable for kids and adults alike then there are the pure comedy episodes such as the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> and stuck on you where the emphasis is on hilarity i can laugh myself to tears in a few choice ones br br the drama aspect is very lacking in most shows nowadays at least those which aren't specifically <UNK> toward it especially in cartoons in the episode <UNK> weather for instance <UNK> <UNK> decides that he's going to join an air circus but <UNK> believes that it would be too dangerous in the biggest fight of the episode <UNK> yells at <UNK> to stay away from daring dan to which <UNK> screams no you can't tell me what to do <UNK> not my dad and <UNK> his face in his <UNK> the next day he leaves for the air circus this kind of drama is a <UNK> in a cartoon and would be most welcome in the ones created nowadays br br the characters have a lot of depth to them <UNK> is pretty much the way he is in the jungle book plus or minus a few degrees of <UNK> rebecca is a cunning business woman whose ideas on getting money while good in theory are seldom good in practice molly is a cute little girl but you can't let that <UNK> you she can be a real <UNK> sometimes <UNK> <UNK> is a darker character than the rest he doesn't trust adults much unless they appeal to him and he has a tendency to break off relationships watch his expression in <UNK> and lightning when he grabs the <UNK> hook he looks as though he's prepared to put it right through a pirate br br in the end it's the drama combined with the very real chemistry between the characters that makes this show 1 in my book the relationship between <UNK> and <UNK> is very real almost father and son this is demonstrated well in <UNK> whale that ends whale when <UNK> takes <UNK> word for it that seymour is <UNK> the animals in his <UNK> instead of <UNK> with the other adults <UNK> and <UNK> relationship is also realistic due to <UNK> motivation for working comes from wanting to buy back the ol' sea duck not necessarily a desire to help rebecca but something tells me that if he did get the duck back he'd still do jobs for rebecca br br the sea duck not to mention all the other planes in the series is pretty realistically designed the <UNK> functions don't change once throughout the series continuity like that is hard to come by also and unlike most other super planes of other cartoons it doesn't have one single weapon on board unless you count <UNK> and relies instead on it's cunning <UNK> great skill to get out of trouble it's hard to think of a hero vehicle that doesn't have some sort of gun <UNK> laser cannon or even a <UNK> somewhere on board and the fact that they use their heads to get out of trouble is so hard to find in a cartoon nowadays plus it's just such a darn cool design br br this is definitely the best cartoon ever period definitely worth all ten stars
<START> if you like to be entertained do not go see this movie if you like to see <UNK> of war do not go see this movie if you like to see good acting and an excellent screenplay do not go see this movie if you like typical hollywood war films that end just in time to give a politically charged appeal to the public about the greatness and glory of war go see this movie otherwise don't waste your time i am always interested in war movies because i think that if they are done well they can teach us something about the <UNK> and worthless qualities of war this film shows a bunch of guys running around the countryside saying <UNK> cliche lines doing the most predictable things and defending the <UNK> with the same exact force and brutality that was being given to the <UNK> this film is a disgrace to filmmaking and to the united states of america can you imagine being a person from europe or africa or any other country and watching this being told that this is how americans truly are no wonder everyone hates us please please please don't waste your time on this piece of junk if you must wait and rent it 4 10
<START> unfortunately this film has long been <UNK> as other posters have noted but this is one of the essential dramas of the great depression a lyrical and touching drama of love set in a <UNK> town it features performances by spencer tracy and loretta young that are just about the finest of their careers and it's a <UNK> example of how the director frank <UNK> was able to create an almost fairy tale aura around elements of poverty crime and horrendous social <UNK> which just proves that how truly romantic and spiritual his talents were this film shows how love survives amidst <UNK> and desperate need and it is totally life <UNK> this is a real masterpiece of the period and is a movie that deserves to be more widely known
<START> <UNK> <UNK> one of the most <UNK> and grand directors we <UNK> citizens have is not yet available on dvd it's summer 2001 right now mysteries to <UNK> the mind br br this grand classic returned to the theaters in my home town thanks to a sophia loren summer <UNK> and to see it again on the big screen after all these years of viewing it on a video tape it is a true gift br br to avoid a critique but nonetheless try to prove a point i took my reluctant younger brother with me to see this film he never saw the film before and doesn't like those italian <UNK> like all the others in the theater he was intrigued by this wonder even during the end titles the theater remained completely silent br br this special day is truly special a wonder of <UNK> and a big loss if you haven't seen it yet

<START> let me begin by saying i am a big fantasy fan however this film is not for me many far fetched arguments are trying to support this film's claim that dragons possibly ever existed the film mentions connections in different stories from different countries but fails to investigate them more thoroughly which could have given the film some credibility the film uses nice cgi to tell us a narrated fantasy story on a young <UNK> life this is combined with popular tv show <UNK> style flash <UNK> to make it look like something scientific which it is definitely not in many cases the arguments clues are far fetched in some cases clues used to show dragons possibly existed or flew or spit fire are simply <UNK> to see this just makes me get <UNK> in my <UNK> even a fantasy film needs some degree of reality in it but this one just doesn't have it bottom line it's a pretentious fantasy <UNK> documentary not worth watching
<START> <UNK> is put in a <UNK> by teen ape when she <UNK> she's considerably <UNK> the parts played by debbie <UNK> in this sequel and out for revenge on those that did her wrong as the sub title and box art implies this is indeed a take off on the kill bill films but this being a chris <UNK> film it's a wildly incompetent satire and i use that last term extremely loosely i'd love to say this is better than the first film but truth be told i was so <UNK> drunk off my ass when i saw the previous film that i can't even hope to compare the two at this point in time but i must have enjoyed it since i bought the sequel see when i'm drunk i like for lack of a better word complete and total crappy movies there are a few laugh out loud moments very few but i do remember <UNK> being funnier though well at least at slightly over an hour it is over mighty quickly for what it's worth br br my grade d br br dvd extras audio commentary by director chris <UNK> actress debbie <UNK> and the <UNK> gang second commentary by <UNK> <UNK> minute making of <UNK> lloyd <UNK> 6 minute tribute to low budget pictures fake 2 minute <UNK> commercial stills gallery <UNK> trailer and trailers for <UNK> <UNK> for the egg <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1 2 3 the <UNK> man the <UNK> midnight <UNK> demon summer splatter rampage wrestling
<START> witchcraft <UNK> la <UNK> 4 and whatever else you wish to call it how about <UNK> br br a gathering of people at a <UNK> island resort are <UNK> by the black magic powers of an evil witch killing each individual using cruel <UNK> methods photographer gary david <UNK> is taking pictures for linda catherine <UNK> whose voice and demeanor resemble <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> the poo cartoon a virgin studying witchcraft on the island resort without <UNK> rose brooks annie ross portraying an incredibly rude bitch is interested in perhaps <UNK> the resort and along with husband <UNK> robert <UNK> who is always <UNK> other women much younger than him pregnant daughter jane linda blair and <UNK> tommy michael <UNK> who just looks bored throughout probably wanting to watch <UNK> street instead of starring in this rubbish go by boat to the resort being treated to a look at the property by <UNK> tony <UNK> son jerry rick farnsworth obviously a <UNK> in the business getting his feet wet along with these folks is architect leslie leslie <UNK> whose character is a <UNK> who might help rose re design the resort the <UNK> captain is killed by the lady in black <UNK> <UNK> wearing her make up and lip stick extra thick and a storm is <UNK> the boat drives off by itself guided by the invisible power of the lady in black i guess with everyone stuck in the <UNK> resort which is in dire need of <UNK> most of the victims before meeting their grisly <UNK> are carried through a type of red <UNK> whose <UNK> leads to another dimension perhaps a type of hell or something where they are tortured by these <UNK> dressed in <UNK> clothes with a crummy <UNK> one victim has her mouth <UNK> before being hung upside down in a <UNK> <UNK> as the others light the <UNK> one poor soul is tortured by harsh <UNK> of rope wrapped tightly around her flesh before being found hanging from the <UNK> of a <UNK> <UNK> through her neck one fellow is slowly <UNK> as his <UNK> <UNK> and bleed and <UNK> blood <UNK> burst <UNK> in <UNK> face one fellow is <UNK> with nails <UNK> into his hands before being hung upside down over an open flame <UNK> pregnant victim becomes possessed with her hair standing on end speaking in another woman's voice one is raped by this demonic man with a <UNK> mouth as the <UNK> <UNK> stand nearby <UNK> cheering the film despite it's <UNK> is mostly dull fodder for those who really wish to see the lowest point in the careers of <UNK> and blair who deserve better than this almost unbearable at times building little to no suspense clumsy execution of the death sequences which look cheap and laughable sure some gore is okay but most of the film shows victims after they've been run through the <UNK> we do get a chance to see pregnant women who look exactly like <UNK> in costume with bad <UNK> jumping out three story windows oh and the lady in <UNK> reflected face often pops up on <UNK> objects for characters to see tommy has a little <UNK> street <UNK> which tapes the lady in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> obviously used for later for some reason the lady in black likes to visit little tommy he's not at all scared of her for <UNK> just too bored to show any expression on his face much less fear need i say more this one's a real stinker ugh
<START> make no bones about it there are a lot of things wrong with this movie it's clichéd the whole way not very funny predictable and illogical let's start at the beginning characters there's the boring <UNK> guy giving stiller another notch in his boring <UNK> guy belt the allegedly wild but in reality just fairly normal love interest whom aniston plays well but really needed no effort to do so the fat <UNK> friend and then the assortment of clichés an annoying <UNK> australian guy a confident spanish guy etc the storyline the beginning is slightly unusual but thereafter goes into the standard any movie style with every plot turn as predictable as your average knock knock joke the biggest problem was that <UNK> character's development really seemed to come from nothing like your average school play the writers knew where he started and where he ended but didn't put enough stock into properly telling the middle bit finally the alleged <UNK> were nothing but highly watered down versions of standard gross out humour there was a <UNK> <UNK> scene <UNK> fat men etc br br in conclusion the simple fact about this movie is that learning the meaning of the word <UNK> was the only good thing <UNK> really <UNK> up a <UNK> dinner here and the sugar <UNK> of stiller and aniston may have <UNK> the viewers but the taste left at the end was just as <UNK> br br final comment this film may have been dreadful but aniston still picked a better between friends seasons movie than <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> x '
<START> this is a refreshing enjoyable movie if you enjoyed four <UNK> and a funeral <UNK> friends etc you will see a number of familiar and talented actors made me laugh made me sad i view movies for entertainment and english set movies generally fit that bill for me enjoy
<START> if you've ever been <UNK> on the underground by a christian who says jesus is the answer what's the question then perhaps you should thank god if you've never met a <UNK> <UNK> zizek the most <UNK> of <UNK> would surely exchange the word jesus in that statement for <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> star burns <UNK> at the moment no doubt because we generally view films and pop culture purely as entertainment for our <UNK> so it seems impressive when someone anyone comes along and says hang on films may say something about ourselves br br the ideas zizek <UNK> in this film are true purely because he says so for example zizek explains that three marx bros are the ego <UNK> and id god knows what happened to <UNK> or <UNK>  perhaps they're the <UNK> or is that movies themselves this is simply what they are in <UNK> <UNK> culture is not there to be <UNK> but merely to be held as an example of his ideology people may object that he certainly has something to say but how different is what he says from the christian <UNK> everything to god's will br br what's wrong with taking examples from films or anywhere to illustrate theory well nothing at all as zizek seems to believe they may even serve as a proof however it is merely cant and propaganda when these examples are isolated from their context without context you can say and prove anything you want for zizek <UNK> is the answer  so he goes and makes an example of it everything but everything resembles the <UNK> of the master and culture is there to bear this out to serve this ideology for instance <UNK> <UNK> of the fantasy position of the <UNK> is taken from a scene in vertigo when jimmy stewart spies on kim novak in a flower shop but in the context of the film this is not a <UNK> fantasy position at all stewart has been deliberately led there by novak this presentation of examples isolated from their context continues throughout <UNK> two hour and a half cinematic <UNK> br br his analysis of the baby wants to f scene in blue <UNK> is laughable touching lightly on what he appears to consider to be the horrific to the <UNK> truth of feminine <UNK> zizek says that <UNK> <UNK> character not only demands her <UNK> but is <UNK> in charge of the situation this is an example of her <UNK> well possibly but sorry to be <UNK> where is the evidence for this in the film she partially <UNK> her <UNK> because hopper has kidnapped her son zizek may object that she also evidently enjoys rough sex with kyle <UNK> but this may be due to any number of things isn't that the point of so called feminine <UNK> according to <UNK> feminine <UNK> unlike <UNK> <UNK> cannot be <UNK> it is beyond the <UNK> capture and <UNK> of language if this is right then no example can be made of it it also means that the entire concept is non <UNK> and entirely mystical it can only be <UNK> by <UNK> such as zizek there's feminine <UNK> for you why is this feminine <UNK> because i say so br br what example can really be garnered from these films only <UNK> psychology why does he keep <UNK> himself into his favourite films even to the point that when in a boat on <UNK> bay he says he wants to f rod <UNK> too is this not the wish <UNK> of someone who spends his life <UNK> films as the saying goes <UNK> would have a field day with the <UNK> guide to the cinema but with zizek himself nobody else br br <UNK> theory that films show us how we desire may be right on the face of it but these films cannot be strict universal examples of <UNK> laws this film illustrates how zizek desires and only extremely vaguely as to be almost useless how the rest of us desire for as any <UNK> knows how we desire and what we desire cannot be fully separated and cannot be easily <UNK> if at all <UNK> love of making everything an example of <UNK> answer bears this out how do we desire like this this is how i do it problem is in <UNK> desire everything and everyone else is <UNK> into his desire but zizek is a <UNK> and they certainly don't like letting the subject speak for itself br br the <UNK> guide to the cinema is a <UNK> <UNK> love of dogma and is entirely <UNK> even if it remains very political what dogma isn't zizek has never <UNK> exactly what his motives might be when <UNK> on an analysis what he is trying to discover because the terms of his exploration and therefore his <UNK> in doing so are never put into question br br zizek is extremely prolific but all his books and this film say the same thing he's a kind of henry ford of cultural theory mass production and any colour as long as it's black he is perfect for today's highly <UNK> society supposedly critical while giving people the same c <UNK> over and over and pretending that it is something different this is popular because people largely prefer <UNK> answers to their problems which capitalism always claims to provide rather than investigating things with any serious consideration at all which is kind of like being brain dead for me <UNK> third matrix <UNK> is a suicide capsule br br ps i loved <UNK> <UNK> remark presented as a revelation about cinema and humanity that music in films can greatly affect people's <UNK> did this only occur to zizek after he watched jaws
<START> kid found as a baby in the garbage and raised at a martial arts academy has a knack for sinking <UNK> with the help of the man who found him he gets in to college and is promoted to the championship as he <UNK> for his real parents infinitely better in pieces action comedy is a real mess as a whole it seems to be <UNK> for a <UNK> basketball version of shaolin soccer but the comedy is <UNK> shot its focus wanders more than a <UNK> with add on <UNK> <UNK> i kept asking what am i watching i watched it from start to finish and i still don't know what the hell happened its a shame since there are some great action scenes some amusing jokes and the occasional moment but nothing none of it ever comes together i'd take a pass
<START> at first you think another disney movie it might be good but it's a kids movie but when you watch it you can't help but enjoy it all ages will love this movie i first saw this movie when i was 10 and now 8 years later i still love it danny glover is superb and could not play the part any better christopher lloyd is hilarious and is perfect for the part tony <UNK> is so believable as mel clark you can't help but to enjoy this movie i give it a 10 10
<START> i'm beginning to see a pattern in the movies i give a 1 to they are almost all movies that my wife made me watch maybe i should stop having faith in her taste in movies anyway this is typical drivel aimed at pre teen girls but done even more poorly than usual once again the writer broke the <UNK> rule of any movie he she made the main character unlikable she starts off by being a complete b <UNK> to her friend at the beginning and then finds out when she becomes 30 that she's basically a sh <UNK> person having affairs etc why the f would we feel for this person ok let's say we can get past that jennifer garner is about as far from attractive as you can get without having some sort of <UNK> i don't know if it's her or the writer's fault but her character goes well beyond my <UNK> for annoyance here's a tip for future filmmakers 13 year olds are not entertaining they're annoying far and away the most embarrassing moment in the movie came when they <UNK> to thriller holy crap that was painful it showed her practicing that dance at the beginning that explains why she knows it but an entire club full of people <UNK> the <UNK> would be more believable all of a sudden she's completely incompetent and has no clue how to do her job and no one notices at least tom <UNK> character on big had a job that made sense to a child these body switching child becoming adult overnight movies are really getting out of hand and this is by far the worst one yet
<START> before the internet this movie could never have been made but the idea that the web is full of evil is the idea behind it unfortunately thats all it was the generally opinion that nowadays the web in the <UNK> hands can create as much chaos as anything in real life since the late 90s somebody found out that you could create a virus which would <UNK> a computer the point just to do something plain evil by remote control so its the <UNK> equivalent of robbery with violence which is basically what <UNK> is without the violence its <UNK> you into <UNK> with your money and has been going so long its a wonder anybody takes any notice of it nowadays so they get <UNK> and use real names as doing something illegal isn't a <UNK> we see the internet get worse by the week the social <UNK> sites or chat room which lead to evil and the child porn sites which are illegal so the idea of a movie which invites people to click a name is just the same old thing there actually is a site called <UNK> which is a porn site but this one kills the people who enter its <UNK> the story though is so disjointed its boring with it and comes to no conclusion the definitive movie on this theme of destroying an internet service <UNK> has yet to be made but clearly many do need destroying as they won't be shut down when there's money to be made calling this a horror film is rather misleading as it <UNK> not <UNK>
<START> man on fire is definitely one of the best drama crime thrillers i have ever seen despite having a slow beginning the story is so amazingly complex and sensitive that it sticks together rather well this is denzel <UNK> perfect role in which he plays a body guard called creasy that is tormented by his past and is an alcoholic but never gives up on his duty to save his latest <UNK> pita <UNK> fanning plays pita the very smart enthusiastic little girl that loves so many things and acts in a very convincing manner she has a great future ahead of her as i said the story is somewhat complicated in order to fully understand it you must watch it a couple of times br br this film is made in two parts there's the first hour where everyone is happy <UNK> wrong everyone's just living their lives happily until the kidnapping of pita occurs and where creasy is almost killed and then there's the second part the rest of the film where suddenly everything becomes complicated and somewhat gruesome and disturbing when <UNK> <UNK> from his severe injury and starts chasing and killing the numerous criminals and la <UNK> that were responsible for the planning and execution of the kidnapping of pita br br denzel washington shows us his most up to date acting talents alongside many other talented actors which have a great future ahead of them it is a real shame that this film hasn't been acknowledged enough washington really deserved another oscar for his performance and so did fanning and the director and even maybe the visual effects which were of very high quality br br if you like excellent slightly deranged suspenseful thrillers this is the one to see the most amazing thing is that elements of this film are actually based on a real story and real characters 10 10
<START> just too many holes in this movie to be enjoyable and worse of all a bizarre almost hollywood like ending that is completely out of context with the rest of the movie this is not a spoiler as you will never guess how it ends br br you will also need to be thick skinned to all sorts of politically correct undertones the conflict between whites and blacks was highly contrived and one sided i didn't understand why the author had the local black <UNK> behave in such an <UNK> manner is he she trying to be racist br br a truly <UNK> movie only watch if you like to be really annoyed by holes in the plot and like to debate all the things that may or may not have supposed to have happened br br but on the positive side the filming and acting is excellent
<START> i was pretty surprised with this flick even though their <UNK> was obviously lacking still you have to be impressed that this movie took 7 years to make and still turned out good the acting was pretty impressive and the story really captivated me my only complaint would be that the ending really was a little too abrupt for my taste but hey if your audience is left wanting more then this movie has succeeded br br i would really recommend anyone in hollywood to look up <UNK> <UNK> who is an excellent spanish talent something hard to find now days with all the bad <UNK> over acting <UNK> <UNK> truly is a star on the rise
<START> this film is probably pro <UNK> br br why do i write that the main character has a muslim father and a christian mother he lives his first 20 years in a christian village in the end of the film he seemingly is a muslim because of his head wear that he has kept his <UNK> and his general clothing he has a six year old child who wears the same head wear and therefore is probably a muslim although the mother is a christian the main character thus chooses to it seems to be a muslim and his child becomes a muslim no one of the other male main characters which are christians seems to breed a child there are more muslims in the world of this movie at the end of it it therefore seems
<START> this is definitely an appropriate update for the original except that party on the left is now party on the right like the original this movie <UNK> against a federal government which <UNK> its <UNK> with regards to personal liberty it is a warning of how <UNK> our political liberties are in an era of an over <UNK> and over powerful federal government <UNK> serves as a metaphor for <UNK> and ruby <UNK> where the us government with the <UNK> of the mainstream media threw around words like white <UNK> and right wing <UNK> as well as <UNK> up drug charges to <UNK> the most fundamental of its' citizens rights with the willing <UNK> of the general <UNK> that message is so non pc i am stunned that this film could be made at least not without bringing the federal government via the irs down on the makers like they did to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the western <UNK> center and countless others who <UNK> to speak out live free or die is the <UNK> on jason <UNK> hat as he brilliantly portrays the voice and that sums up the dangerous to some message of this film br br
<START> this film is brilliant it touches everyone who sees it in an extraordinary way it really takes you back to your youth and puts a new perspective on how you view your childhood memories there are so many layers to this film it is innovative and absolutely fabulous
<START> the final season of <UNK> was a roller coaster ride of crazy this final episode does just what a previous comment says it tells us that as much as we might have thought we knew the characters we did not <UNK> reaches back to season one and tells us that this show has been her rendition of her life she says in this final episode that she changed events and people as she sees fit scott was not really with leon but he existed mark and david married opposite wives in real life and dan died when she made him live as events happened in her life she changed them in her writing don't we all wish we could do that don't we all have a moment in time that we wish we could just use an <UNK> and change to our liking this is what she did with the entire episode and to another comment i would say that i don't feel cheated the family was real in my mind she just changed the way that events happened in their lives an a ending to an a show
<START> as seems to be the general <UNK> of these comments the film has some stunning animation i watched it on <UNK> ray but it really falls short of any real depth br br firstly the characters are all pretty dull i got a hint of a kind of laputa situation between <UNK> <UNK> and the main antagonist <UNK> however maybe my mind <UNK> and this was <UNK> thinking laputa being my favourite <UNK> original <UNK> dub the characters are not really lovable either and as mentioned in another post they fall in love exceptionally quickly leaving poor old <UNK> jealous and rejected she loves <UNK> who seems oblivious of this however she promptly seems to forgive <UNK> at the end with no explanation for the change of heart other than it makes the ending a little bit more happy br br there is also a serious lack of explanation like who are the <UNK> really are they people and who are the weird women girls who seem to hang out with them and run the forest there is nothing explaining why they are there and how they can give regular humans <UNK> the plants coming from the moon still does not fill in the <UNK> about this it is almost like a weird version of the day of the <UNK> br br and who does call <UNK> why bother with this if it wont be explained br br i really wanted to like this film but i found the plot no where near as deep as a film like ghost in the shell or having any real character like those of miyazaki i do not <UNK> watching it but i do sort of wish i hadn't bought it my advice give it a go if you have a couple of hours to spare but borrow it or buy it cheap perhaps if your new to <UNK> films and don't have much to go by you will enjoy it it certainly is visually pleasing
<START> where to start if this movie had been a dark comedy i would say it was <UNK> <UNK> unfortunately for me and anyone else with free time and a buck to spare mind you that was the price i paid got it from wal mart this movie was meant to be a thriller the only thrill i got was watching <UNK> lousy rendition of anne <UNK> from misery sans snowy <UNK> area if you want a good laugh on a rainy friday night with some friends then i highly recommend this movie but if you want to watch something at least half way decent then don't even bother br br i for one enjoy crappy films the worse the better in most cases but wow i meant wow the only person in the entire film that didn't stink it up was the little boy played by vincent <UNK> the only reason why i even give it 3 stars is because it gave me something to do
<START> don't even waste your time let alone pay rental for this piece of dreck how it got made is beyond me i don't know why there's a minimum of 10 lines i've already <UNK> this trashy movie but oh well the acting was awful like they all needed lessons the plot was weak the ending <UNK> i think the cinematography was the only thing that didn't totally suck well maybe the sound was <UNK> ok the one good thing is if they could make this movie even make some money with it there may be hope for any screenwriter with a real idea so you all take heart i guess the same holds true of actors if these people actually got paid then you can too
<START> this is a great film for <UNK> and beatles fans a splendid time is guaranteed for all the audience feat some celebrities such as nicholson <UNK> michael douglas is as always quite amazing from small children to old <UNK> of the sixties they know the words to all the songs by heart and some of them are crying when paul breaks into <UNK> yesterday all my loving and all the <UNK> of his <UNK> who except john lennon and dylan can claim such a <UNK> there are two particularly moving moments br br the double tribute to lennon and harrison first here today performed solo the title was included in <UNK> of war 1982 and was its best track then something when paul uses an <UNK> br br the long and <UNK> road rendition a key moment when paul's voice cracks as he is moved to tears by the hearts the members of the tour crew hold in front of the stage br br i remember in the early seventies when people used to despise paul cause he was not involved in politics as his ex partner was they had to change their mind for paul is a committed artist fame is great cause it allows charity the film shows different aspects of paul's activities an artist who is anything but selfish
<START> this one is bad a really bad and boring crime movie that has nothing out of the ordinary in it a series of crimes the killer that you do not see throughout the whole movie the classic <UNK> and also the classic tale about a cop who figures out what's going on and isn't believed by anyone so he has to fight by himself to reveal the truth not too much in this one vote 4 out of 10
<START> this move is slow plodding cold dark and without a plot or hope it follows that tried and true european formula that they love to <UNK> that is never seen but that the critics think makes an important point br br the movie is valuable if nothing more than to show the huge difference in the thinking between americans and europeans regarding <UNK> in this movie the men are still <UNK> their wounds from years ago and feel it's the <UNK> duty to provide them with work whereas in the u s we know we have to go out there and create value for someone br br spain never looked so <UNK>
<START> one of the best love stories i have ever seen it is a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion but lovely nonetheless big edie and little edie seem a bit like family members after watching this movie repeatedly and are infinitely <UNK> it's a <UNK> beautiful day now will you just shut up the opening explanation of little <UNK> costume only promises that the movie will live on forever and so will big edie the world famous singer and little edie the world famous dancer
<START> this is a fascinating account of the hunt for the soviet <UNK> first known serial killer i had tuned in just expecting a half decent tv movie but found myself drawn by the compelling way the story was told as others have said there is much to admire here that is sadly lacking in many big screen releases br br much of the credit must go to chris <UNK> whose intelligent screenplay and direction draw the viewer in until it is impossible not to feel emotionally involved the acting by the whole cast is also superb especially that of the two leads stephen rea and donald sutherland their convincing portrayals give their character <UNK> a great deal of credibility and the scene where they have their first <UNK> meeting after <UNK> is genuinely touching br br if you prefer your crime films with a bit more depth and a little less sheen i strongly recommend you look out for <UNK> <UNK> br br
<START> the british public school system did not <UNK> solely with the idea of <UNK> the upper classes despite that popular and <UNK> <UNK> it was designed to produce <UNK> and <UNK> civil servants and military men to run the british <UNK> these people were almost entirely <UNK> from the middle classes when the public schools had begun to show their worth the <UNK> of the <UNK> were sent to them rather than be educated at home by <UNK> and <UNK> as had previously been the case they tended to favour the schools <UNK> town so <UNK> and <UNK> became particularly popular with that class of parent the vast majority of public schools took their <UNK> from lower down the social scale tom brown perhaps the most famous public school <UNK> ever was the son of a country <UNK> not a <UNK> earl thus in late 1960s england a country in the <UNK> of post colonial guilt and <UNK> the last of its <UNK> to its former <UNK> as quickly as harold wilson could slip off his <UNK> mac lindsay <UNK> if was <UNK> with <UNK> joy by the <UNK> classes and mild <UNK> by everyone else it must be remembered that the so called summer of love was followed by the october revolution a non event that left a few policemen in london with <UNK> heads and the u s <UNK> with one or two broken windows but achieved absolutely nothing so when mr <UNK> film reached the cinemas the disgruntled former <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in what they saw as mr malcolm <UNK> glorious victory over an <UNK> them despite the fact that he was <UNK> <UNK> down at the end a fate that would have undoubtedly <UNK> them had they succeeded in their attempts to get into the u s <UNK> the film told us nothing new about public schools homosexuality bullying cold <UNK> <UNK> sarcastic teachers silly traditions an all too familiar list it was <UNK> to be an allegory comparing britain to the corrupt <UNK> society represented by the school well nearly forty years on the same schools are still <UNK> the british social system has not changed the october revolution has been long forgotten except by those involved on one side or the other and mr anderson has completed his state of the country trilogy to no effect whatsoever if by any chance you should wish to read a book about <UNK> who did buck the system rather more successfully than mr mcdowell and his friends and furthermore lived to tell the tale find a copy of <UNK> co written by the man whose much <UNK> poem if <UNK> it's name to mr <UNK> film a man born in colonial india a man whose work is quietly being <UNK> out of our literary history and do it before the <UNK> classes succeed in <UNK> him a non person perhaps somebody should start a revolution about that
<START> i came home late one night and turned on the tv to see <UNK> and ebert <UNK> their picks of the week i didn't hear anything about red rock west except two thumbs up and see it before it went away it wouldn't stay in theaters very long because of the <UNK> money problems and lack of promotion but they said it deserved better br br the next afternoon i followed their advice they were right it was some of the most fun i have ever had at the movies as some readers point out there are a few plot holes and the last 10 minutes don't ever seem to end but it's well worth it for the fine <UNK> that went into the first hour it's the best role that i have ever seen for nicholas cage but almost everybody seems perfectly cast dennis hopper goes almost over the top which gets silly but <UNK> how well everything else works the sets and the music contribute a great deal to almost every scene br br when i rented it later for my family it didn't work as well the long scenes that built the tension in the theater were difficult to appreciate with the <UNK> at home it deserves your full attention turn off the phone make sure you won't be disturbed watch and listen to every scene especially in the beginning
<START> the shining starts with jack <UNK> jack nicholson driving to an isolated hotel named the <UNK> <UNK> high in the <UNK> mountains for an interview with it's manager stuart <UNK> barry nelson about becoming the winter caretaker <UNK> tells jack that he will be responsible for the basic <UNK> of the hotel but will be almost totally isolated from the rest of the world for six months as the harsh winter sets in together with his wife wendy shelley duvall young son danny danny lloyd jack moves into the hotel at first everything seems fine it's a beautiful hotel absolutely huge whatever they need is at their <UNK> however the overlook hotel has a murky past with a previous caretaker murdering his entire family before committing suicide danny has the ability to <UNK> which means he has psychic powers that let him see hear things <UNK> people can't as the days weeks months begin to pass jack become more more insane danny keeps <UNK> things people while wendy becomes frantic as she doesn't have a clue what's happening to her family as a heavy <UNK> leaves them trapped jack finally loses it br br this english production was co written co produced directed by stanley kubrick is a fine horror film it appears that the shining is another film that exists in two distinct different versions the one i will be commenting on is the shorter european cut that runs just under 2 hours in length the script by kubrick diane johnson is based on the novel by stephen king which i have not read so i can't compare them goes for psychological horror rather than visual with only one murder during the entire film there are very few character's in the shining with jack wendy danny the only ones that really matter since the film concentrates on them almost exclusively you care for them become involved with them what they go through the pace is somewhat slow but this is one film that didn't feel that long keeps you interested throughout on the negative side i don't think the reasoning behind jack going crazy wanting to kill his family was strong enough to convince me the fact that jack escapes from the <UNK> without any explanation bugs me i don't know if i missed something but that ending didn't make any sense to me whatsoever i'm still trying to work out what that picture is all about there is very little in the way of violence or gore a couple of rotten zombie ghosts someone is killed with an axe but the shining is a horror film that doesn't need to rely on blood special effects as it has a gripping story with a budget of about 19 000 000 the shining is technically flawless as you would expect from an obsessive filmmaker such as kubrick the cinematography is brilliant with some fantastic free flowing smooth <UNK> shots as the camera effortlessly follows the character's around the <UNK> of corridors the sets look absolutely real instead of clichéd old haunted house themes like dark <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kubrick brings things right up to date with <UNK> lit corridors massive open <UNK> spaces a modern <UNK> well 80's modern just check that red toilet out the acting is good from everyone involved although as usual in horror films the little kid is highly annoying nicholson seems crazy from the very start the shining is an absorbing film that i enjoyed watching although i'm not sure i'd watch it again anytime soon for those looking for explosions fancy special effects you will be disappointed for those looking for a good haunted house type horror with a strong story i definitely think the shining is for you well worth a watch in my humble opinion
