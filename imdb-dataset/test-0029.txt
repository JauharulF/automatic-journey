<START> i found my tape of this long forgotten <UNK> besides the theme song <UNK> from outer <UNK> this show is barely watchable you will be flipping through channels just like the couple flipping through the tv channels this is a parody of tv br br the <UNK> is cool the homosexual dracula the chick discussing her experiences and the lady with the overly big lips discussing homosexuality show us everything that is wrong with tv it is all bad just like the <UNK> from outer space who seems to be lost in this new world you will be too out of
<START> as someone already said the living dead dolls were cute and if they came out as a new series of wicked little things i would buy one or two well basically this film was dark not in the scary sense but in that i cant see kinda way and it was boring three females in a house the youngest told not to go into the woods under any circumstances well that didn't sink in and it would have been better if that advice had involved their death and doesn't anyone do any cleaning or <UNK> or something you would think a lot of <UNK> would ensue a sexy young mum where you waste your time trying to figure her age by my <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> and it looked like it had been longer than 20 years since someone had lived there so what was with the fathers young adult photos on much older album i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast teens getting stoned and drunk in car and well you know where that leads death and apparent <UNK> too as tim seems oblivious to his friends scream i mean i have pushed many a car where the <UNK> driver did not scream and i heard them cliché weird man in the woods who no one believes <UNK> who has lived in them there parts for years and this is his first experience with said children so that driving along he avoids wielding <UNK> in dead of night run him over you idiot cliché <UNK> about in woods without a clue about where you are going armed with knowledge that pick axe wielding kids yes them again are out and about senseless scene the of pig why do so many directors see no problem with animal <UNK> and slaughter i would have much rather seen the <UNK> run up and bit people on the <UNK> than this zombies don't appear to have that much energy in other films the villain well how <UNK> was he his big part was in the shop in and demanding to be served first what a none <UNK> man he was why not kill him earlier before the family got there and avoid the movie being made or remake it differently i give my marks to the house the woods and the little <UNK> i want one
<START> just what is the point of this film it starts off as one film then changes track cheating us of a resolution to that film and ends as another movie which is nothing but a pale pale imitation of so many other schlock horror flicks you've ever seen the overall impression is confusion in every respect and a great deal of <UNK> screenplay by tarantino direction by rodriguez two guys who have previously shown talent but who now seem to believe their own hype and assume that whatever they do must be good merely because they did it but it doesn't quite work that way you're only good while you continue doing good things there are so many questions to ask just what are george clooney and harvey keitel doing getting involved in such pointless dreck clooney initially makes an intriguing bad guy  utterly ruthless and efficient  and it would have been interesting to see where that was going but of course we never do and the clooney of the vampire film changes into a completely different character that's not clever or witty that's just bad bad work keitel looks thoroughly ill at ease throughout and no wonder did no one in the studio take a look at the script before this project was given the go ahead tarantino is utterly unpleasant as a murderous sexual <UNK> and why did he as writer assume we would find the rape gruesome murder and <UNK> of an <UNK> hostage funny on every level  except the technical  this film stinks avoid
<START> the title refers not to a questionable poker hand but to six comic players they come in <UNK> charles and mary <UNK> as a couple driving to california for a second honeymoon george burns and <UNK> allen as another couple who go along to share <UNK> and w c fields and alison as a sheriff and a hotel owner in a tiny <UNK> town no attempt is made to fashion a coherent a collection of comic bits strung together all the first couple want to do is spend time together but burns and allen's characters aren't married so the men <UNK> together as do the women there is a bit of a plot a bad guy plants <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> is taking out of town but because the expedition is being guided by <UNK> the <UNK> cannot be found the bad guy shows up in <UNK> and fields accidentally captures him a bunch of pleasant bits confused expression <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> talk and fields playing <UNK> with a <UNK> cue and doing a <UNK> craven backwards stepping double take when he's threatened and his wonderfully distinctive way of lingering over words and trying to remember the name <UNK> he tells hmm starts with a k she answers oh no no no no <UNK> no no no no no oh <UNK> yes that's right
<START> this picture is an interesting saga of the struggle of <UNK> led by daniel <UNK> in the wilderness of gap while being threatened by hostile indians a <UNK> frenchman is the cause of all the trouble between the <UNK> and the red men while <UNK> tries to convince the indians that the <UNK> only want to build homes and live in peace the film has a certain appeal because it is not a polished production but there are good action scenes although somewhat violent for its time the cast is comprised of b actors but they are all good especially <UNK> <UNK> as the indian chief bruce bennett is okay as <UNK> but is a bit too clean cut and soft spoken to be believable as a <UNK> the dialogue is rather trite but the scenery lends itself to the realism of the kentucky backwoods
<START> i doubt whoever wrote this screenplay has ever actually read <UNK> park or if they have it was not very well none of the characters are what they should be <UNK> is lively and conscious of her <UNK> while sir thomas who treated her very well seems to have accidentally fallen into aunt <UNK> personality additionally a first person narrative by <UNK> is highly inappropriate to both the story and her character <UNK> is not an entertaining heroine and i would <UNK> that she is not meant to be additionally in the movie version <UNK> <UNK> shamelessly with edmund from the very beginning when they have been raised as brother and sister <UNK> <UNK> would have from <UNK> of any sort and the novel paints the <UNK> edmund pairing as highly uncomfortable as it should be unlike some other jane austen novels p p emma <UNK> park does not rest on the strength of its female protagonist it is a very different sort of novel than the others it is not meant to be a love story i watched this movie because i have just now finished reading <UNK> park and i am absolutely horrified by what i see miss austen is rolling in her grave
<START> this movie has made me upset when i think of cat in the hat im thinking of cat in the hat books you know the one from a few years back that parents read to <UNK> children well i though that this movie would be a lot like that but much to my <UNK> was nothing like the books <UNK> it is more like young adult humor movie in one part cat is talking to a <UNK> tool <UNK> cat talks to it like it is his <UNK> <UNK> adult humor the <UNK> of his car i all so though was a little <UNK> for a kids movie under the rating you'll find mild <UNK> humor and some double <UNK> i think in short this means adult humor i wish i could return this movie wal mart said they wouldn't because the movie has been opened if you are thinking about buying this i suggest that maybe rent before you buy
<START> this is a very visual film by that i mean that the dialog is sparse almost to the point of being a silent movie for some very long takes beginning with the opening shot br br the <UNK> however are broken by a stunning sound track that <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> beats to a haunting mix of <UNK> and interspersed with <UNK> that sound like dreams it's a feast for the ears as much as for the eyes one of the early visuals being a man walking along a street so <UNK> with his interest in a <UNK> woman that he walks into a <UNK> one of the consequences of love and a metaphor for what lies in store br br a long time ago another movie  love story 1970 said that love is never having to say you're sorry this narrative turns that idea on its head in a number of ways beginning with the main character toni a seemingly <UNK> long term resident in a <UNK> hotel somewhere in switzerland everyday week in week out he sits at the same coffee table enjoying the passing world his <UNK> his coffee his <UNK>  and he's been doing it for ten years he sits he <UNK> and once a week he <UNK> in three very surprising activities that you'll find out about when you see this little masterpiece br br love is explored in another way in a direct <UNK> to <UNK> and reserved nature two older residents of the hotel are still much in love but the man wants to die in a spectacular manner when his time comes while his long suffering wife <UNK> him for cheating at cards with the other guests one of whom is now knows about their <UNK> their love the man's cheating his apologies to his wife and his whining how in a surprising and black comedic manner one of those surprise activities i mentioned br br but this is no comedy in reality although it does touch upon the idea of the human comedy in a sense the irony of life and what to do with it that decision had been made for ten years earlier when he left his wife and began to live in the hotel he keeps in touch occasionally and it is clear that he still loves his children now grown up and the sorrow in his voice speaks volumes but there's something more than just sorrow br br such a life as would obviously seem to be utterly boring and it actually is from many perspectives it is only when we learn what lies beneath his almost death like <UNK> however that the horror of his situation hits the viewer between the eyes but not before we know that the female bartender <UNK> olivia <UNK> is very interested in and goes out of her way to <UNK> interest in her br br and that's when things start to unravel for he eventually <UNK> to her <UNK> and in doing so discovers once again the consequences of love ironically in doing so he finally realizes what he must finally do with his life and in a most spectacular fashion br br i know that all of the above is somewhat <UNK> but to say more would spoil the film and story for you if you like italian cinema  i love it  i urge you to see this one the acting is superb the sound track chills the spine the camera work is truly innovative the direction shows the maturity of a true artist br br i know i'll see this movie again and again
<START> if you're one of those people who doesn't really like sci fi because of their sometimes far fetched ideas and surreal world perspectives you better stay away as far as you can from stuart <UNK> space <UNK> it truly is an absurd space adventure stuffed with eccentric characters colorful <UNK> and ludicrous plot twists in all probably never would have cared for this film if it wasn't for <UNK> name on the credits this guy comes pretty close to being a genius in the horror genre with <UNK> <UNK> like <UNK> and on his <UNK> apparently stuart gordon likes his humor as twisted as possible he already went completely over the comedy top once with re animator but with the slight difference that the bizarre humor was effective there something that isn't really the case for space of the gags lead nowhere and the entirely exaggerated atmosphere only works in small doses in the end all that remains is an occasionally amusing but completely unnecessary mess dennis hopper and charles dance or at least a semi charles dance are always a joy to look at and the still stunning barbara <UNK> has a small role near the end of the film <UNK> was stuart <UNK> regular heroine in previous horror films the story of space <UNK> is as silly as they come dennis hopper plays the self made loner who's fed up with his job who wouldn't be when you're <UNK> pigs across the galaxy for a company named he sees his change to flee while bringing his <UNK> to earth they <UNK> into space pirates and find out their <UNK> is meant to wipe out half the universe stuart gordon wisely returned to making horror again after this little <UNK> since space <UNK> he already made the sublime king of the <UNK> and the absolutely brilliant
<START> a notorious big budget flop when released this robert altman inspired comedy has some terrific moments and an occasionally inspired cast although it goes on to long an loses its focus completely there are enough funny moments that will keep a curious viewer watching until the end if you are a fan of character actors and actresses this will be a treat for you you will recognize so many terrific little known performers throughout this movie you may not know their names but you know their faces heck even the kid from a christmas story turns up in a small part rent if from netflix if you read this i bet you will enjoy it
<START> if this film had been directed by <UNK> griffith or stanley kubrick it would be recognized for what it is a cinematic masterpiece told with depth and subtlety and passion a film with no equal in the visual realm it is <UNK> stunning and also very brutal in its depiction of our great <UNK> of greed and <UNK> and of course what the reviewers could not <UNK> is it doesn't tell a simple narrative dick and jane tale like 99 of hollywood <UNK> its characters are complex and confused by their passions and thoughts fears and emotions they even appear to be thinking something your average movie reviewers do not understand and cannot <UNK> so they destroyed it see the original uncut wide screen version it is stunning
<START> a scientist george <UNK> wants to create wolf men out of american soldiers to fight the nazis but is <UNK> as mad he uses a <UNK> <UNK> glenn strange to experiment on by mixing his blood with the blood of a wolf strange constantly his dialogue with the tones of <UNK> <UNK> jr in of mice and men has no idea what's going on only that he <UNK> the victims begin to pile up including a little girl which modern viewers might find rather disturbing and two of rivals there is some good dialogue on how man should not mess with nature still prevalent today and play god motives may be honorable but his methods are most questionable and then there is his daughter anne who is <UNK> nice to strange yet has no idea of her father's deeds johnny downs is a reporter who gets on bad side by questioning him but wins heart thus creating the usual and always dull romantic subplot in classic horror films at <UNK> minutes this is about 15 minutes longer than usual for a horror film of the early 40's particularly one out of <UNK> who released this one so the romantic story could have been <UNK> for costs and to speed things up a bit <UNK> fortunately is never hammy he left that to bela lugosi who always <UNK> in a deliciously theatrical manner which <UNK> him to audiences and <UNK> todd slaughter but try not to think of bride of the <UNK> laboratory while looking at the one <UNK> works in or some of <UNK> dialogue in that now classic cult film mad monster lacks a cult following more because it is not delightfully bad just has dull pacing in more than a few spots for <UNK> and <UNK> lovers i would recommend the corpse <UNK> or fog island higher than this
<START> the plot outline of this movie is similar to the original someone gets kidnapped the prince is incest with saving her turns into a <UNK> the turtle frog first the bad magician as best they can and in the end anyways there is not much new here with the exception of a lack of well known voice talent sorry no palance nor <UNK> and thus jean bob was a
<START> the <UNK> has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with art to more post modern approaches that like to <UNK> the play along post colonial feminist gender or lines the reason why version left me fairly cold is that i didn't have a clue what he was on about what is the underlying vision idea concept behind this rendering of shakespeare the previous reviewers do not get much further than revenge tragedy punk show but surely there is more to it isn't there this is not to say that there is no vision here just that i was hard put to discover it be that as it may there are still things to enjoy the punk <UNK> is refreshing and funny <UNK> as miranda and jack as are wonderful i did not much care about williams as <UNK> not enough magic i suppose the switches between the old monastery castle and the very english world outside can be a little unsettling at times but i guess that is intentional all in all interesting but not quite the success i had hoped it might be particularly after seeing <UNK>
<START> a majority of exclusively made for video low budget fright flicks from the 80's <UNK> stink worse than raunchy old <UNK> this particularly dismal and amateurish no budget chicago set bargain basement nasty <UNK> <UNK> on the loose bloodbath serves as a depressing <UNK> of this borderline fact a <UNK> <UNK> long haired <UNK> and flower shirt wearing wild eyed psycho hippie <UNK> <UNK> on your standard random gruesome killing spree <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> young couples who are engaging in <UNK> <UNK> whenever the deranged lunatic attacks hmm do i <UNK> a fairly obvious and self <UNK> <UNK> have sex and die message here gee could be man boy is this mentally <UNK> <UNK> one real way gone <UNK> after his female victims our <UNK> <UNK> killer enjoys making love to their <UNK> <UNK> bodies warning possible spoiler ahead towards the <UNK> end the corpse <UNK> crazy gets <UNK> interrupted by the cops while he's in the middle of doing the <UNK> with a <UNK> <UNK> thereby provoking the foul <UNK> to cut loose with an understandably <UNK> and ear splitting cry of <UNK> now ain't this <UNK> guy a definite sweetheart and a half br br too bad this flick is so poorly done if it had only been made with a <UNK> of flair and <UNK> it could have been a sleazy little gem of a horror exploitation item alas <UNK> <UNK> ham <UNK> direction <UNK> larry <UNK> static and <UNK> cinematography frankie hollywood insipid <UNK> head <UNK> hard rock score the <UNK> cheap and unconvincing make up f x flat <UNK> uneasy <UNK> acting by a <UNK> all thumbs and unappealing non pro cast <UNK> pacing too much screen time is <UNK> <UNK> on the <UNK> drab efforts to catch the <UNK> an especially lame would be shocking surprise ending the mystery killer's true identity is guaranteed to have you <UNK> in disgust the uniformly boring <UNK> <UNK> and positively <UNK> characters and a steady succession of dull soft core sex scenes that are about as erotic as watching two slugs mate for 90 minutes straight all add up to one profoundly <UNK> and <UNK> limp <UNK> <UNK> of a crummy <UNK> however to be fair this film does possess one stellar virtue the mad dog slasher has <UNK> excellent taste in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> than thunder day <UNK> <UNK> shirts
<START> retro puppet master is complete and utter crap in particular the puppets look stupid and crappy the acting was unforgivable and the story was <UNK> this movie goes back into the the past where the dolls where first created thats not puppet master retro puppet master is rated pg 13 the first puppet master to be rated pg 13 the movie contains no horror or suspense the fact that this movie was a puppet master film <UNK> the mind because this installment <UNK> have the <UNK> of blood good acting or any like the previous movies did dont see this movie dont rent it and dont even watch it f its on tv because this film is stale not violent and completely crappy 2 out of 10 as a puppet master fan i am disappointed seriously
<START> this show really is the broadway american idol it has singing the british guy a guy who's sometimes nice and a super nice woman br br of course it is different because there is a sing off and there's dancing and some acting we just don't see some of the acting br br i gave this show a 7 because there are a couple <UNK> that i know a lot of people including me would make if they were working for the show the first thing that really needs to be changed is the judges deciding who goes home i know they want to find the right danny and sandy but america should have the power to decide who does home there's really no point to the sing off the person with the lowest number of votes usually goes home anyway another things i'd change is to see them actually act on the show what's broadway without the acting the last thing that need to be changed is the song the eliminated people sing at the end the eliminated danny always sings the same song and the eliminated sandy always sings the same song as they exit since they sing it every week those songs eventually get annoying br br i admit to not being a fan of the movie grease but for some reason i am hooked this show is very underrated it has so many memorable performances and moments
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> incredibly impressive romance that is to me perfect set in 1960's hong kong as we are shown this is set in a <UNK> time tony <UNK> and maggie cheung play <UNK> mo wan and <UNK> li <UNK> chan a man and a woman who meet each other in a hong kong apartment in which they both move in <UNK> mo wan works for a newspaper company <UNK> li <UNK> chan is a secretary two very different people <UNK> mo wan and <UNK> li <UNK> chan create a special bond after they both find out their <UNK> constantly away are committing extra marital <UNK> with each other br br the characters of <UNK> mo wan and <UNK> li <UNK> chan are nothing short of amazing both <UNK> and cheung manage to strike such amazing chemistry with one another it's better than any hollywood romance that is put out today combined the film is all about the focus of the two leads and their feelings after the <UNK> of their partners <UNK> <UNK> wong manages to create such strong character development between these two characters you really start to feel for them <UNK> and cheung are both wildly amazing are better than any hollywood pairing shown on the screen today combined br br there's nothing much else to describe <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> other than beautiful energetic romance that also features a moody atmospheric piece with gorgeous cinematography so much elements of this movie help create it to be flawless as well as <UNK> <UNK> wong and the acting the cinematography from both christopher doyle and pin bing lee is haunting beautifully understated the shots from <UNK> <UNK> wong help makes your mind create a world of it's own a world that creates these characters original <UNK> and nostalgic this film is incredibly unforgettable br br the costumes created by <UNK> <UNK> wong regular william chang are absolutely beautiful cheung who wears an elegant <UNK> deep beautifully <UNK> dress in every scene she's a scene <UNK> her costumes say a lot about her character and an emotion is <UNK> in all of her dresses colours which are vividly and <UNK> used highly original chang also the production designer creates a brilliant setting for the movies moody piece especially with the help of the marvellous music used in scenes and masterful film editing again by chang william chang seems to be incredibly versatile and is an <UNK> hero for this movie br br overall this movie is one of the best from this millennium incredibly compelling and filled with nostalgia the shots are <UNK> and haunting <UNK> <UNK> wong somewhat proves to be a master at the top of his game the acting music cinematography editing production costume and direction all help create one small little perfect film a masterpiece in romance film making visually spectacular overall a masterpiece to film making a film that reminds me of old classic hollywood was the one that never was never forget <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i know i won't
<START> after seeing the previews awhile back i looked forward to seeing steve martin in a comedy that i thought might be a keeper unfortunately i was wrong problem was the previews were the only funny parts to the movie the rest of the movie was pretty much a bunch of junk scenes that have been done to death and characters we've all seen a thousand times br br this movie was proof positive that if you put enough cash on the table you can talk anybody into anything steve martin is a favorite of mine but this one was a big <UNK> the only actor in the movie who was worth watching was eugene levy he was the best of a mighty lame group
<START> before i saw this masterpiece i never would have guessed that a devastating and <UNK> <UNK> virus could be defeated by the use of <UNK> and <UNK> performance is <UNK> the realism <UNK> i was so inspired i'm flying straight to tomorrow to crack out the and get my hands together for third world <UNK> god bless this film br br seriously i'm going to have to watch <UNK> 2 and <UNK> just to believe that it is possible to <UNK> more clichéd dialogue it's so tortured that taking a to your <UNK> might well be <UNK> to sitting through it the only subtlety it manages to achieve is in its <UNK> disguised racism as the poor <UNK> turn to <UNK> dumb ass collective <UNK> which achieves nothing until the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hero with his direct line to <UNK> can provide a blood <UNK> which the horn blowing <UNK> scientists can get to work on and save the hapless natives this movie sucks
<START> i had the <UNK> to watch <UNK> last friday and i am still shocked by its beauty the powerful work of every single actor and actress and <UNK> unbelievable ability to <UNK> the story of <UNK> who was well known in spain for asking for a legal <UNK> lost the court cause and eventually died in front of a camera drinking a glass with poison <UNK> all our hearts with his determination not to go on living forever because of an accident br br before watching the movie i was already <UNK> by the strong in its title which i would translate as into the sea and not as some suggest out to sea and which is taken from an original poem written by the man this story is about then i watched the movie oh my friends this is cinema with a capital c the narration flows to take you to the heart of every single character <UNK> in a <UNK> that you forget from the very beginning is in the center as a man full of sense of humour and full of hope and his hope is to die because for him the life he is living is not worthy to be lived the rest of the characters but one dance around him and respect his decision because they see him as a human independent being forgetting he depends on the others for everything even though they do love him so much and this is what the movie is about love you can feel it you can breathe it in the skin of every character you witness the growing of the feeling within three women who meet him in the movie the member of the association that defend his right to die with dignity his friend her story in the movie is the hope for us the lucky ones that can live a normal life in this world <UNK> the woman who meets a good man in the middle of her list of broken relationships and pain in the hands of all the men who used her and <UNK> her julia the woman who shares a tragic destiny with <UNK> and eventually acts in a way we cannot but only understand br br however before meeting these women <UNK> knew what was love like because you cannot meet him without loving him and he is deeply loved by his family four characters unique in their <UNK> and bravery each with their own thoughts about his decision each thought respectable in its own way because the terrible thing about this story is that nobody is to blame for what happened that sadly life sometimes is that terrible from this familiar <UNK> i specially liked mabel <UNK> work as sister in law a terrific performance br br i would like to draw attention to three episodes that are for me the best climax points i have seen in a long time and if you haven't seen the movie don't read this pass over this paragraph and read again from the next one starting <UNK> let the movie show its secrets to you the episodes i loved were 3 the best love scene i have seen in a movie when i really felt love <UNK> the screen is when <UNK> dreams awake that he is flying to meet julia in the beach and they kiss each other 2 speaking by phone with <UNK> the day before he is going to do it and he tells her it is better they say goodbye at that very moment not to put her in trouble with the authorities and then she knows it is the last time they are going to talk and she has fought for his right to die but she does not want to lose him because she loves him as a true friend and even though she is <UNK> his decision at all cost 1 the best a young <UNK> in the beach looking at his girlfriend under the sun jumping to the water from the rocks to a sea that is <UNK> we see the crash we hear his voice <UNK> what happened and claiming he should have died that very moment the face of <UNK> face <UNK> shown to us from the bottom and the hand of a friend who pulls him from the <UNK> and brings him back to a life that will be a hell for him in the next 30 years there are many others like the impressive ending in spite of the fact that in spain we know too well what <UNK> did br br <UNK> did not <UNK> me <UNK> never does but this time he has to thank the actors that took part in the project and who maybe took it personally because this is not just a movie it is an to a man who died alone when he was asking to die <UNK> which meant for him as <UNK> pointed out dying with the people he loved and who loved him around
<START> it is amazing what you can see if you wake at 2 am and turn on the telly i didn't know they showed films like this i immediately thought of roger corman who <UNK> locations for movies or used other films locations for his own movies br br the makes of this film could just move the camera angles and add some time and they would have an <UNK> film br br there was no story just minimum dialog that led to <UNK> and sex i bet there wasn't 100 words in the whole film but there sure was a lot of very large <UNK> and hot lesbian action there was male female action too but it was only about 25 of the movie br br another interesting thing came to mind in watching this film that may interest those who are buying hi <UNK> dvds <UNK> refused to license <UNK> to adult film makers and adult films came out on vhs you can guess what happened to <UNK> max as the adult film industry makes millions of videos <UNK> has again refused to license <UNK> ray to the adult film industry and they have just signed a deal with you can guess which high <UNK> system will disappear
<START> cuba gooding jr is back on top jesus he did a great job in this film i loved this movie its one of those feel good movies that makes you want to run out and <UNK> at a mission or something anyway i would recommend seeing this movie in a <UNK> well worth the price of admission and as for cuba gooding jr just give him his next oscar right now
<START> some may go for a film like this but i most <UNK> did not a college professor david suddenly gets a <UNK> for <UNK> he pretty much takes the first child offered a bad choice named adam as it turns out adam doesn't have both in the water which almost immediately causes <UNK> stress and turmoil for dr this <UNK> story played out with one problem after another all centered around <UNK> and <UNK> why wanted to <UNK> his life with an unknown factor like an <UNK> child was never explained along the way the good doctor managed to attract a to share in all the hell the little one was <UNK> out personally i think both of them were one beer short of a <UNK> <UNK> this <UNK>
<START> these guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class the <UNK> of this band is amazing and we should all be very thankful we live in a world where rush exists future generations will never be able to see such <UNK> live and in person get this dvd and you will enjoy it <UNK> i was recently able to see these incredible musicians play in <UNK> <UNK> and was blown away i have not missed a show since power windows and i have to say that they are better than ever everyone should embrace these guys and teach others what real <UNK> is there will never be such a tight and well put together trio again in our lifetime lets just hope and pray that they do not <UNK> anytime soon
<START> this movie turned out to be pretty much what i expected of course it's sappy of course it's predictable we all know the fairytale but knowing that when you go to watch it it's enjoyable enough to watch it was funny and sweet i did find it annoying that they showed <UNK> as either kids who didn't wash there hair or kids who loved <UNK> and joined <UNK> about <UNK> and wore t shirts about <UNK> i was an <UNK> in high school and i didn't do these things it goes much deeper than that having to do with many things some of that being how much money your family has how much you are willing to hide your <UNK> and how mean you are willing to be to other kids anyway i won't get into it i don't agree with other opinions that drew isn't convincing as a geek with <UNK> no make up and <UNK> hair i don't think too many people would be <UNK> over her and even when she goes back to high school and <UNK> those things she's still wearing the wrong clothes wrong hair and has the wrong attitude to be considered cool and her other geek friend may be beautiful but it doesn't matter where i come from you can still be an <UNK> and be beautiful inside and out
<START> this movie is so bad they should burn the master you cant spoil the plot because this movie doesn't have one the graphics are less than fake they're horrendous then you've got the rambling through the countryside star work a <UNK> who <UNK> between his own <UNK> the mad <UNK> of the crazed preacher when he finally makes it to <UNK> they don't even have the decency to kill him the monster which you don't know at the time is already <UNK> but how who knows of course it has the ultimate sappy ending everybody else on the planet is dead or <UNK> but his family a handful of survive imagine that this will be the movie that c thomas <UNK> will go to his grave <UNK> he ever starred in it probably gives him nightmares
<START> i'm surprised with the amount of negative reviews on this film if you don't like this movie for what it is a silly over the top mob story then you are simply reading too much into it this film is a classic tale of a mob wife trying to escape the life and the troubles that follow her michelle pfeiffer is <UNK> 80's who is an uncertain uncomfortable mob wife while matthew <UNK> is an <UNK> <UNK> like mob tracking cop who falls for her the plot is mostly predictable and <UNK> and <UNK> steals the show as the queen of mob wives if you aren't looking for something too dynamic and complex this movie is absolutely entertaining and an 80's cult classic you won't be able to stop watching if you start
<START> okay so gus van <UNK> wanted to remake psycho in color so that he could bring it into modern audiences who would probably go into <UNK> arrest if they were ever forced to see a movie in black white while they conveniently forget that both <UNK> and <UNK> list were filmed in black white and are great movies br br unfortunately the same narrow minded people who wouldn't want to see a great movie just because it's in black white are the same people who wouldn't like psycho anyway because it doesn't have a murder or sex scene every two minutes and the murders are not the grisly blood guts gore bone <UNK> that people are used to from having seen halloween friday the 13th and nightmare on elm street this is why <UNK> psycho almost exactly as it was originally was destined to not work because it's really only of interest to people who are fans of the original everyone else is just watching it to tide them over until the next scream sequel comes out and for that reason they will be disappointed psycho relies on suspense and mystery not blood and guts and just so nobody thinks that i must be a senior citizen if i like older movies let me set the record straight by saying that i am 21 br br so if doing the movie in color was all that van <UNK> wanted to change why not just <UNK> the movie and it i mean what's the point of <UNK> a movie if you're not going to change anything the least he could have done was to put his own director's spin on it rather than just <UNK> hitchcock's or even better hired a new writer to adapt a new script from the original psycho book but it seems that van <UNK> couldn't decide whether he wanted to remake psycho exactly or not this should have been an all or nothing project either remake the movie exactly or do it differently but as it stands this movie is about 95 the same but with a few touches thrown in that don't seem to have any purpose such as having norman <UNK> while he spies on marion <UNK> it doesn't serve the plot at all and the only reason he put it in was because he could he wanted to say <UNK> couldn't show people <UNK> in 1960 so i'm going to do it <UNK> big deal like i'm so shocked at seeing someone <UNK> and what on earth was the point of showing single frame shots of clouds and farm animals spliced into the murder scenes and then he leaves out an important scene where <UNK> and sam meet the sheriff outside the church br br plus by using the almost exact same script the entire movie seems a bit of an <UNK> the opening credits say that the year is 1998 then what's with <UNK> 60 ish looking dress or the <UNK> she carries with her why do marion and sam have to have their <UNK> in a hotel room when these days nobody would be shocked by what they are doing why are there no air in <UNK> office why does the bates motel have no tv's in the rooms and apparently no automatic locks on the doors why does the sheriff have to ask the <UNK> to connect him to the bates motel this was why using the exact same script was a mistake just changing a few words here and there was not enough to <UNK> it it needed a whole <UNK> br br while vince vaughn turned in a good performance as norman he just didn't seem right for the part part of what made the original psycho so creepy was that norman had that innocent boy next door quality so nobody could believe that he was capable of such horrible crimes with vince vaughn playing the part is anyone really surprised that norman was a <UNK> killer br br that said i can understand that gus van <UNK> was obviously a fan of the original psycho movie and wanted this to be a tribute this isn't a bad movie but the problem is that this may be some people's only exposure to psycho i really think you should see this movie only if you've seen the original since i am a fan of anything to do with psycho i bought a used copy of the remake which i may watch occasionally the original movie was a <UNK> <UNK> whereas the remake is a <UNK> but even <UNK> <UNK> would get boring if you had it everyday so it's nice to have a <UNK> once in a while for a change
<START> this movie was release when i was 15 and i could easily relate to the themes the film portrayed br br that was over 24 years ago and i haven't seen the movie since this time around i <UNK> at some of the acting but still appreciate the film for what it is br br life is not always fair and the good guys don't always win in fact i think the movie did well to reflect that especially as a teenager the <UNK> always did better with a lot of girls also it doesn't matter how nice you are you cannot make someone like you girls boys like who they want to like no matter how hard you try otherwise sometimes you just gotta let go and say next br br gary does a good job showing the intensity of his feelings for karen this is so true of teenagers when they get <UNK> on someone br br i remember sitting around with mates laughing our <UNK> off at some of the antics the acting is not quite there compared with fast times at high but it kicks ass over this movie simply because has a lame viewer friendly ending where as this movie has a realistic ending nice guys finish last gary comes across as pretty lame cringe worthy material but we all know guys like this who are far to sensitive we all know a david fun guy who makes you laugh br br some people on here bag the ending but hello the ending is exactly what can happen in real life some chicks just go back for more no matter how bad the dude treats them especially at that age i have experienced that first hand br br great sound track too <UNK> i will follow jesus is it that old
<START> i bought the dvd out of a big bin for 4 99 thinking i'd <UNK> into some documentary pearl that would actually show extensive footage of the mountains and in particular fast <UNK> through the film i reached the climactic scene in which the <UNK> catch their first sight of <UNK> <UNK> to all of 13 <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> range at least one of the several <UNK> <UNK> up to climb clearly has no idea what the real mountain actually looks like he has to be assured by his friend and climbing partner that he wouldn't have been brought by said partner to an ugly mountain given that one of the film's premises is that 27 or so people have lost their lives on you might think that the jerk in question might have taken a minute or two to bone up on a few basic facts but the clown seems to think that <UNK> on this scale while good enough for the likes of <UNK> are beneath him to be honest i haven't watched the whole thing what i've seen makes me cringe they say that you get what you pay for at 4 99 i've been ripped off
<START> this is the award that made me lose all respects for the br br if such a distinguished <UNK> can't see or care about the obvious story telling problems of battlestar galactica then what worth is their award the answer not much br br award winning shows should be examples of creativity and excellence neither of which are in evidence in <UNK> in this episode or any other that i've seen br br shooting in drab video is not artistic it's just cheap shaking the camera is not creative it's vomit inducing and lazy as can be br br all <UNK> has shown is how corrupt most award giving <UNK> really are and how easy it is to buy awards with a lot of <UNK> money
<START> as to be expected there's a pretty good reason why this film is so obscure and unknown in spite of dealing with the always popular premise of zombies and starring the 80's b movie queen linda blair namely it sucks the chilling is trying enormously hard  way too hard  to be a story with depth and factual background whereas it should have just been a light headed and gore packed horror flick about frozen zombies it takes an incredibly long time before anything remotely interesting or significant happens there's a lot of drivel about which i learned in my physics class is the study of products and their behavior at extremely low <UNK> so naturally in this film a bunch of people are studying the behavior of human corpses when deep frozen needless to say this is extremely boring until two dim witted night <UNK> decide during an electric power failure that it's a good idea to put the metal constructed cool cells outside at the heights of a <UNK> the are struck by <UNK> obviously and the bodies <UNK> <UNK> and come to live to go on a murderous zombie rampage the chilling is a boring and surprisingly for a late 80's effort at least gore free horror film that doesn't even use up a quarter of its potential all the painful attempts to build up an atmosphere of suspense and <UNK> fail tremendously and i can't think of any reason why the zombie attacks had to be so <UNK> even in spite of the low budget available they could have done better the set pieces make up effects and costumes are <UNK> the research lab for example looks like a proper apartment flat whilst the zombies couldn't look less menacing with their green faces and foil wrapped outfits how linda blair managed to get involved yet again in such an embarrassing low budgeted horror flick is a complete mystery she's attracted to lousy b movies like <UNK> are to honey
<START> that's how i'd sum it up there were other who said naked gun meets james bond i think mine is more accurate but i'm not neutral on that point o br br this movie is kind of a blast from the past it reminds you of the old movies from the <UNK> '60s and that's not only because it plays in that time period 1955 to be exact with the flashback exception but it's the mood the movie is made in and it shows on screen the main actor here who is as i've been told very popular in his <UNK> france is perfect in his role here he's the spy with the number <UNK> attached to him there is one character who sums him up in the movie by asking a question about if he's good or not you'll see when you watch the movie br br very funny indeed this is and if you like your spies mixed with comedy with old school flair but not taking itself or anything else for that matter seriously than you need to watch this o
<START> normally movies stay out of the realm of domestic drama and for good reason who wants to intentionally seek entertainment from a story about what they or those close to them have to deal with in real life divorce hurts an incredible <UNK> of american families of all classes and custody battles are ugly and necessary parts of it that's not <UNK> the number one reason the average person turns to movies that's sad reality br br normally divorce or custody is simply part of a greater story and affects the way we understand it or relate to its characters kramer vs kramer focuses on it and asks us to understand why we do it and why that makes it so <UNK> that's a challenge for both this film and its audience turn something so real into something that can capture our attention and then make us not feel <UNK> as the mirror is held up to our face writer director robert <UNK> definitely achieves both and in impressive fashion in adapting this novel by <UNK> corman br br the story as one would expect is quite simple big business advertising man ted kramer dustin hoffman comes home to find his wife joanna meryl streep is leaving him and their 7 year old son billy justin henry ted then must quickly learn to be an active father in the <UNK> life and as soon as he does joanna brings a custody suit upon him br br to make an oscar winning drama about something so generic and particularly dialogue heavy first takes tremendous acting talent you don't get much better than hoffman and streep hoffman is in his prime in this role his first oscar win after three other notable nominations he creates a <UNK> character one whose self centered and quick <UNK> ways clearly change as he learns to be a better father and the sole care <UNK> streep wins her first oscar in only the second major role of her career as a woman who doesn't get much screen time but must communicate both inner torment at her decision to leave as well as <UNK> sense of identity when she returns to take custody streep does so effortlessly the young boy justin henry who at his age was the youngest <UNK> category <UNK> in academy awards history plays the <UNK> of all 7 year old children exceptionally well br br writing and direction takes these performances to the level where we see deeper into this family's troubles than we do our own and thus <UNK> our thoughts about love and raising a family previous notable credits bonnie clyde and superman wouldn't indicate a strong command of family drama but the man can flat out write numerous scenes give us strong visuals that show us much more than the typical family scenarios they depict the first morning that joanna is gone and ted <UNK> billy french <UNK> is a classic that perfectly demonstrates all the talent going into this movie in a scene that happens in <UNK> <UNK> every morning br br you'll rarely see a story as straightforward as kramer vs kramer done better there aren't any surprises at the end or twists and turns that will keep us desperately glued to the screen the film then has to rely on its talents and they are all sure fire delivering a new understanding of a subject that's so familiar

<START> this could have been a good biopic but what a mess i had this film when i was a theater manager when i put the film together and watched it i thought i had some <UNK> out of order as it turned out i didn't and if i did nobody would have noticed i couldn't figure out what's going on everybody who walked out pretty much felt the same way
<START> we went to see <UNK> from heaven my husband two friends and i and we all enjoyed the film the characters are funny the story is amusing and so much like real life i think that is what i liked most just seeing something believable no murders no sci fi just good clean fun it is something you could take your children or elderly parents to and not worry how many of those are around anymore

<START> well here we have a zombie movie that perhaps isn't even being much of a zombie movie the entire movie is set in a zombie plagued near future but yet the movie does very little with this concept instead it focuses on a zombie hunter who is trying to get revenge and his money back from a group of other bounty hunters what good is money anyway when almost the entire world has gone to hell and towns are mostly desolate and why pay money to people for killing zombies in the first place as if people would not go on to kill this dangerous threatening monsters when they are not getting paid br br needless to say that the story for the quick and the undead is far from a tight one it of course also isn't being filled with the most logical and interesting moments characters or dialog br br still it's not a completely horrible movie it certainly ain't as bad as some people try to make you believe it is it's a rather good looking one or rather said the movie at least doesn't have a cheap look over it it's effects may be a bit <UNK> but nevertheless they are quite good looking as are the make up effects as well br br still the movie was not what i hoped of it its title might suggest that the movie is set in the wild wild west during the days of the <UNK> but its title is just a misleading one no doubt picked to cash in on it i fell for it expecting this movie to be a combination of a western and a gory zombie horror flick br br for the fans of the zombie movies this movie will mostly be a disappointment to watch it of course adds nothing new to the genre but it also doesn't has enough of the genre itself in it to be considered a good one to watch br br not totally unwatchable but also far from a <UNK> one br br 4 10
<START> <UNK> started out moderately interesting but never went anywhere except tedium city a low rent affair with no name actors and laughable effects not recommended for any reason the best thing that could be said is it looks like they really filmed it on location in the <UNK> desert that's it i can't think of one thing good besides that about this stinker the finale is supposed to be some kind of revelation but falls flat like the rest oh i thought of one other good point about this cheese it <UNK> in at just over an hour although it still wears out its welcome long before then when the girl starts walking around in the desert at night it seems to last forever and just keeps getting worse from there the attempts at horror aren't effective in the least the story is an attempt at a twilight zone style feel but fails badly check out for a good science fiction b movie
<START> this is an exceptional film it is part comedy part drama part suspense the dialog is exquisite most of the actors and actresses were very famous in their time and for good reason you will probably recognize someone even if you don't usually watch older movies they are also each in a role that particularly suits their talents br br one <UNK> to make on another users comment is that two people not one are announced to die in the accident maybe the unlucky two are a reflection of what the writer considers important in life the movie is too engaging to worry about who it is until it happens br br the story is ahead of its time but it does not lose the quality of an older movie time and effort was spent <UNK> the <UNK> view and the soundtrack something modern movie makers tend to forget
<START> this movie came aside as a shock in the eighties far from <UNK> that is to say in the heart of sincere creativity stands as one of the finest movies of its time <UNK> the wonderful actress of her ex husband claude <UNK> greatest achievements le la <UNK> les <UNK> <UNK> all <UNK> <UNK> for movie buffs gave a lifetime performance to see her prepare with love and affection her meal is a feast for the eyes all the people who saw this masterpiece actually <UNK> ate <UNK> <UNK> triumph but the most moving part of the story is its conclusion <UNK> was a great french chef she was famous now she found a new <UNK> but her <UNK> is behind her and she won't never be allowed to come back to her dear france so the two old sisters do comfort her in heaven there will be huge <UNK> where she <UNK> for eternity while sharing her fortune with her new friends <UNK> changed their life she gave them pleasure and a magic evening they would remember forever in this simple but extraordinary screenplay human warmth is everywhere and i wish everybody a <UNK> feast would it be only for one <UNK> night

<START> clint eastwood plays a wounded union soldier found by a girl from a <UNK> <UNK> school and he's taken in and <UNK> back to health instead of turned over to <UNK> soldiers seems that the women folk at this place have <UNK> motives <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> not turning him into the <UNK> and even passes him off as her cousin of course when the man gets to feeling better he becomes quite the <UNK> man and is pretty much making the rounds but when he gets <UNK> he really gets <UNK> in fact so badly he gets his leg cut off but it's for his own good of course not out of <UNK> things get carried a bit further though when certain women don't get what they want i haven't seen this for years and it still has a certain creepiness to it that by today's standards is still pretty strange not typical eastwood at all if you haven't seen this one it's worth seeing 8 out of 10
<START> despite all of the comparisons to house of frankenstein this movie <UNK> its predecessor and is one of the <UNK> monster movies in the universal monsters series and sadly the last o k so it doesn't exactly stack up to something like the bride of frankenstein as one a classic to <UNK> by fans of all movies but with a cast of dracula the wolf man and <UNK> monster what no mummy you can't help but enjoy this schlock fest and unlike house of frankenstein the monsters in this movie interact a lot more but this movie also offers some unique story lines for both dracula and the wolf man who both go to dr for <UNK> of their <UNK> while the wolf man actually does find a cure dracula <UNK> his blood into the doctor and that's when the real fun begins i highly recommend this movie to fans of classic horror movies but remember i never said it was good just fun

<START> first of all <UNK> <UNK> doesn't look anywhere near old enough to play <UNK> daughter and in fact she isn't only ten years apart br br i understand this is supposed to be one of those magical moonstruck type supernatural romances but this is beyond the pale very very weak in terms of acting script and direction br br the only one who really shines here is ellen <UNK> who makes this film watchable if not really believable herself as she's cast as a bit of a <UNK> sex <UNK> but endearing nonetheless actually <UNK> and the skin shots of the young guy <UNK> with together make this watchable but no one can really tell if <UNK> is really in love with the young guy or not neither the script nor her acting pull it together for us and we're left to wonder how she really feels
<START> since the <UNK> is a confusing puzzle that really has no solution one should sit back and enjoy the scenery set on a remote greek island it stars a very uptight michael caine as a teacher working at a school for boys who gets caught up in mind games with local <UNK> mystery man anthony quinn and his <UNK> girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> quinn looking like <UNK> <UNK> with white hair and <UNK> sailor shirt is actually pretty good but caine looks like he's ready to explode <UNK> although stunning should not put on a british accent ever she's not very good at that type of thing guy <UNK> direction is fine but unless you have <UNK> patience with the <UNK> logic of the film you will not enjoy it a real sour note is the casting of the <UNK> anna in the completely <UNK> role of <UNK> girlfriend after seeing her in the likes of a woman is a woman and a band apart her presence here is quite jarring
<START> i'm warning you this movie is not scary if you're a horror movie fan especially a child's play fan you'll think it's incredibly funny but you won't be scared it's not a bad movie but it's not scary
<START> an excellent sleeper of a movie about the search for carlos the international assassin am surprised this film didn't <UNK> in 100 million plus because it's much better than most films that do so rent it now
<START> hong kong filmmaker chang chang <UNK> 1972 martial arts movie epic five fingers of death is widely considered by a great many film experts and kung fu movie fanatics to be the martial arts movie that started it all br br being released in 1972 it was phase two of the three step process that would lead to the explosion of martial arts movies in the west billy jack 1971 with its famous showdown in the park was released the year before and bruce lee starred in enter the dragon 1973 two years later thereby martial arts <UNK> place in western cinema br br but what is all the <UNK> about regarding five fingers of death the movie with its terrible dubbing explosive if not highly improbable action sequences and technical flaws and all has a plot albeit a very thin one <UNK> the late lo <UNK> is a young and dedicated student of chinese <UNK> fu who is selected to represent his school in an upcoming martial arts <UNK> his teacher offers to allow him to self train in the iron fist style of fighting a style so deadly that it could very easily kill a man with only one blow br br additionally <UNK> arrival at the school <UNK> with a violent conflict with a rival school its students and a trio of murderous heavy <UNK> from japan before you know it a major <UNK> threatens <UNK> training and his ability to represent his beloved school in the upcoming <UNK> br br let me just say that five fingers of death is in fact the movie that started it all as another viewer mentioned five fingers of death helped to set a lot of standards in martial arts movies over the next three decades asian european and north american martial arts movies such standards include the dedicated student the learning of patience and <UNK> conflicts between rival schools the intense ethnic <UNK> between the chinese and japanese and learning a system of fighting for that good old fashioned action movie motive revenge five fingers of death would also serve as a major influence on american filmmaker quentin <UNK> kill bill movies tarantino borrows quite <UNK> from this project among many others just so you know br br the acting is pretty good considering the fact that this is a martial arts movie from the early 1970s the best of which is lo <UNK> as the <UNK> student of the martial arts his performance is quite groundbreaking though upon first glance at this movie you wouldn't really know it because of how that particular character arc has been done to death so many times over the years he's quite humble in his acting doing anything he can to <UNK> over his enemies and not fight them in anger or <UNK> to their level of stupidity or arrogance also when he suffers his major <UNK> it does make your heart sink a little bit because it's so brutal and you wonder if he's going to recover enough to realize his life long ambition br br five fingers of death is a classic in every sense it's by no means perfect and viewers would be crazy to expect something on the caliber of the godfather of martial arts movies what it does offer you is the ultimate example of eastern hand to hand combat from the time before eastern cinema was a major <UNK> in the west br br 7 10 br br p s enter the dragon <UNK> <UNK> also appears as the <UNK> street fighter near the beginning of the film
<START> you can't watch this film for a history lesson this was the first i had heard of the ma barker saga but i could tell almost immediately that the facts were way off and with a little internet research i realized i was of course right ma barker sure as hell isn't the sexy <UNK> woman the movie portrays her as and apparently did not <UNK> all the bank robbing schemes and murders that her criminal boys carried out br br but don't expect a brilliant crime drama the script and the acting are adequate the <UNK> are excessive and mostly unrealistic and there is a very laughable slow motion death scene so why did i give it a 7 out of 10 br br because it was damn entertaining the <UNK> are fun to watch but there are some deeper themes that emerge between them the movie has a strong sense of ego <UNK> among it's cast of <UNK> males each of whom has his own agenda and i appreciate the minimal use of <UNK> for the period the set pieces are great <UNK> a convincing 1930s era br br so watch this film like you would a cult film and take the excessive <UNK> and <UNK> in <UNK> with the cheesy ultra serious comments from the fbi man who wants to take the <UNK> down at any cost don't take it too seriously just have fun with it and if you like this you'll love serial mom
<START> i really tried but this movie just didn't work for me the action scenes were dull the acting was surprisingly poor and some of these characters were too stereotypical to even be funny pam <UNK> tries but when you have nothing to work with even her considerable talent cannot prevent a disaster even by the standards of this weak genre this film is pretty bad
<START> intruder in the dust 1949 <UNK> clarence brown br br production mgm br br excellent tale adapted from the <UNK> novel about a black man accused of the murder of a white man who asks a young white boy he has <UNK> to help him prove his innocence lucas <UNK> is something of an <UNK> in this small town he's a black man who owns the land he lives on and doesn't think much of the <UNK> social order that mostly keeps the peace here and in many similar small towns so when lucas is found holding a gun over the dead body of <UNK> shot in the back no less young chick claude <UNK> who lucas once saved after chick fell through the ice while hunting on his land fears that the town finally has the chance to make lucas a n arrested and with a very real chance of being <UNK> before the night is through lucas reaches out to chick for help as the only person he knows not <UNK> with notions chick asks his uncle john a lawyer to defend lucas and while the man is initially bothered by his own notions he agrees and they race against the gathering mob to save <UNK> life br br the film has an <UNK> <UNK> for its time and is mostly free of <UNK> the lawyer character has a tendency to speak incredibly self aware dialogue that sounds mostly like something from the <UNK> page but it has minimal impact on the tone that's a credit to the rich characterization of everyone else <UNK> who had mostly appeared in oscar <UNK> films is superb as the proud lucas porter hall as the murdered man's father in maybe the best role i've ever seen him in and elizabeth <UNK> as a <UNK> old lady sympathetic to <UNK> case standout in support roles the setting is perfectly realized it is actually filmed in <UNK> <UNK> hometown brown also uses the crowd in an effective way it's always an anonymous mob against a single person like lucas when he's arrested or john when he's going up to his office that is very threatening or the of the whole town gathering at the <UNK> to witness the <UNK> like it was a parade of note is an absolutely riveting scene when chick and his friend <UNK> go evidence gathering in a cemetery robert <UNK> the bad and the beautiful thirty seconds over tokyo ben <UNK> shot the picture br br 1 2 out of 4
<START> <UNK> <UNK> not a country i've ever given much thought to i have to admit i didn't even know it was near india let alone that there has been a bloody civil war going on there since 1983 it seems that the rebels of the <UNK> minority have been in an ongoing conflict with the military regime that runs the country for many years causing many deaths and <UNK> suffering on the island br br <UNK> latest film a peck on the cheek tells the story of a young girl named who is separated from her <UNK> <UNK> parents by the war and raised by a young indian couple is a bright and mischievous girl whose life is turned upside down when her parents tell her that she was adopted as a child although her adopted parents love her as much as could be and have raised her without prejudice along with their <UNK> children cannot help but want to learn more about her <UNK> family br br <UNK> <UNK> is probably best known for his 1998 film <UNK> se which hides a story about terrorism and politics inside a love story or is it the other way around a peck on the cheek <UNK> similar territory but is perhaps more ambitious in the ground it covers the central theme that <UNK> the movie is of love between all the various members of a family and especially that between a child and her adopted parents it's a pretty honest and open look at feelings that can be extremely touching and heartwarming at some times and quite painful at others it's an emotionally complex film with characters that are somewhat <UNK> but still behave in a very human way br br the film revolves around 9 year old played with charm and <UNK> by young actress p s in her first and only acting role she's a princess and a monster always getting into trouble but so <UNK> charming nobody can stay mad at her for long the young actress is perfectly cast for the role and does a tremendous job in the various and often difficult emotional scenes required of her br br a peck on the cheek has such an innocent name i was quite <UNK> for the intensity of the experience never has such a small act come with such an enormous emotional impact i dare say the film is a bold and artistic effort to explore issues that are not frequently covered on the silver screen br br <UNK> direction is superb very confident and mature the most sophisticated work i've seen from this director yet the film is visually very stylish with some excellent <UNK> and imagery a r <UNK> provides the film's soundtrack which is not as good as his classic <UNK> se or <UNK> music based on first impressions at least but still shows his great musical talent br br i'm not aware of a dvd release for the film yet i saw it in <UNK> with english subtitles thanks to the san francisco international film festival of which the film was undoubtedly the highlight the production is a truly world class effort and i am sure it will be popular with western audiences as it begins to receive wider exposure br br recommended
<START> this movie is basically a spoof on hitchcock's strangers on a train which i thought was overrated anyway the plot has danny <UNK> going to see strangers and then thinking billy crystal wants them to <UNK> murders for crystal to murder his mother and <UNK> to murder his wife both <UNK> and crystal are great and so is <UNK> mother this is <UNK> directorial debut and it's better than the war of the <UNK>
<START> every time i watch this show i just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time week after week the dialogs or monologues rather as everybody just <UNK> on endlessly about nothing are just becoming so tedious for example the episode i watched yesterday began with a seemingly <UNK> rambling about how a particular dish i forgot what it was <UNK> with <UNK> perhaps always manages to turn the <UNK> family dinner into all out war and these were just the few seconds or so br br so it seems every time lots of lines with absolutely zero content the scripts they use must be enormous br br but then every once in a while something happens the <UNK> stops and suddenly there are these wonderful silent emotional moments for example this week it was breakdown at the estate <UNK> i just thought it was the best piece of tv i have seen for a long while br br almost makes everything worthwhile
<START> i'm sure there is a documentary amongst the ruins of this yawn fest somewhere given enough time maybe the producers could find it i do not connect with any of the characters this is a problem for a documentary that soon <UNK> into a complete <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> although because of the poor story flow i'm not really sure what is happening to them and what are the consequences of whatever it is they are trying to do the story and faces jump around so quickly it is very hard to completely understand what is going on the 3rd <UNK> that takes them for is introduced so late into the film and tom have to <UNK> to explain oh yeah this guy created the idea too and just when i thought i had a slight grasp on who all the <UNK> characters were some crazy woman in <UNK> about getting a puppy what's up with that also did tom really have to give all those awkward speeches to the staff i can only imagine the boredom they felt when it was really happening actually i think i feel for them
<START> one of the better made for tv <UNK> i just wish it had told us more i have read many <UNK> and seen other things about the <UNK> and this movie did what it could based on the constraints placed on it by the family did a wonderful job trying to bring karen to life one of my <UNK> is that there was not more insight into <UNK> <UNK> in the reading i have done about the disease especially <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wonderful book starving for attention <UNK> appears to be a disease of control karen saw her weight as one thing in her life that she could control she felt that she was being controlled in every other aspect of her life don't get me wrong i believed she truly loved the music but she felt she had little control over her career she truly loved her family but they did not express it well and she didn't know how to make her family understand her the film could have touched so much more on that i treasure the music i have of the <UNK> and wish she was still alive to contribute more to music today
<START> a total and utter travesty of a movie <UNK> the kind of film even troma would be embarrassed to release the script direction acting and action <UNK> are so dire as to be almost painful to watch and one cant help thinking that it's mere 75 minute running time could have been better spent the above reviewer must be related to the director as that's the only reason i can see for his her <UNK> of this rubbish some might call it b movie fun or <UNK> bad it's <UNK> just to excuse there enjoyment of it but when the lead actor and most experienced cast member cant deliver his lines convincingly you know you've got a very very bad movie avoid at all costs
<START> all of the trials and <UNK> of making a no budget movie right from the mouths of those involved you feel all of the sweat guts determination and dedication put into this labor of love and the frustration of being left hanging after all his work the clips of interviews with all involved provides a great flowing narrative and conveys the balls out hardcore punk almost <UNK> attitude it took to film <UNK> and subsequently the documentary and company deserve all the props in the world for not giving up when the going got tough and getting a texas tale of <UNK> out so we can see what it's like for the budding filmmaker on the street
<START> the danish <UNK> is <UNK> stated on the box are you kidding me this film is a complete drag when i'm <UNK> and go for a <UNK> in the kitchen i usually pause the vcr so i won't miss anything not this time i actually found myself looking long and hard in the <UNK> just so i wouldn't have to go back why the hell is there not one scriptwriter out there who has the <UNK> clue about how computers work it's one of the premises of film is that our hero who's a <UNK> has a little to help him the <UNK> office <UNK> finally caught on in the future when he loses the assistant in the movie he's helpless and can't get into any computers he's a <UNK> it's like saying that you can't drive your car if you don't have your lucky driving cap on i won't even go into the lightning effect when he <UNK> <UNK>
<START> ugh stephen baldwin i never noticed until i got the dvd home and saw his name in the credits double ugh what's worse he's the name in this low budget mindless wandering wannabe <UNK> up i mean where did they find the guy to write this refuse driving a <UNK> in the la city dump while hoping to break into the movie game the whole plot is ridiculous situation <UNK> on ridiculous premise baldwin is as convincing as a poster boy for american gothic sans <UNK> his whole acting <UNK> is looking like he needs the <UNK> and then looking like he found it br br so there you have it folks bad script bad acting by no name actors low budget setting and a hero that's about as convincing as a girl <UNK> looking for a cookie <UNK> as an action hero it's too late for me to get my money back on the dvd but you can spare yourself unless you're one of those who likes to look at the dogs for a laugh frankly this one is too boring to be funny
<START> last time i checked in here i think there was no more than one comment i'm very glad that more people have caught on this flick now and even more so about you all digging it as well i caught this the night of christmas 2004 and i found myself unable to change the channel on my tv even though it was an asian flick and i'm sadly but truly very used not to give any chance to any off hollywood products i did that night though and i thank god deeply for it i've not been able to shake that movie out of my system since not that i've tried to or wanted to and it still <UNK> me in an extremely grateful way that such a great beautiful experience came in such a way completely unexpected like a christmas miracle please if you got the chance go see this movie buy it or rent it of <UNK> it or whatever but watch it i guarantee it will affect you i'm out of time but i'm far from finished with my here so ill be back as soon as i can
<START> like most i thought <UNK> crocodile <UNK> so far we've had <UNK> and rogue in the last 12 months what can they do that's new where both those films were about action and violence this one's about fear and tension br br the performances aren't oscar worthy when there's nothing going on but in times of distress or terror these people suffer so much it's like torture there are holes in the plot and maybe <UNK> don't really behave like this as others have pointed out but the fear is so effective it's a stretch to say you'll enjoy this movie it'll leave you feeling as uncomfortable as the passion of the christ
<START> a remarkable film bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings i had when i was much much younger i loved it and the <UNK> john music i remember seeing in in the movies when i was a kid and for some reason limited release i've never known anyone else who saw this film when it was released br br the dreams it inspired in me from decades ago have never left me and seeing the film again recently brought it all <UNK> back i confess however that my kids in their <UNK> have not experienced a similar emotional rush a <UNK> thing br br why is it not on dvd
<START> just once in a while you see a movie so mind numbingly awful that you have to comment on it this was that movie poorly scripted acted and totally unbelievable it's movies like these that show you how good the banal hollywood trash usually is
<START> quick summary of the book boy billy <UNK> about 12 years old is <UNK> main trouble maker and if he gets kicked out of one more school he'll be sent off to <UNK> school his <UNK> boy's school in switzerland or somewhere like it gets taken over by arab terrorists why i'm not really sure billy has no friends and likes to use his <UNK> to hack into his <UNK> <UNK> he with the help of two teachers <UNK> the <UNK> plans and save the entire school the book wasn't bad but was <UNK> cliché br br now about the movie they switched arab terrorists to cuban terrorists and make billy about 17 and the leader of his group of friends they like to get into trouble but normal teenage stuff this movie was believable maybe not realistic but the characters are real you can watch billy joey and the rest of the guys and see real kids acting out the way they did or at least wanting to br br great action scenes not everything goes as planned for either side <UNK> the terrorists was messy and good guys did get hurt i won't say who but it is heart wrenching i know i use that word a lot sean <UNK> is excellent as a teenager he usually played the dopey best friend this movie proved once again that he could play the leading man kid whatever the only performance that may have <UNK> his was <UNK> who played the only son of a new jersey mafia man he hated his father and everything he stood for a far cry from wesley <UNK> usually this genre of film is one i watch for the soul purpose of making fun but not toy soldiers the story line flows the dialogue is usually believable i can't think of a single moment where i found myself shouting at the tv oh that would so not happen great movie that should be in everyone's collection
<START> the creepy demons the gentlemen capture the voice of the population of <UNK> to steal human hearts without scream find that in <UNK> with a legend if a lady screams the creatures will be destroyed but buffy and her friends including <UNK> have to fight the monsters speechless br br <UNK> is certainly the best episode of the fourth season of buffy up to this moment having lots of humor and funny situations i liked a lot spike is hilarious the romance between <UNK> and <UNK> is cool but i loved the intense dialog between buffy and <UNK> in end the gothic scenario of the final battle against the gentlemen recalls the environment of dark city my vote is ten br br title brazil silence
<START> the <UNK> history making the evil marquis de <UNK> a semi heroic romantic is mind <UNK> enough but the atrocious acting amateurish cinematography and terrible dubbing make this film <UNK> bad the only reason to keep watching is that almost all the women in the film are gorgeous and amazingly being tortured for days with hands bound <UNK> apparently doesn't detract from a woman's beauty <UNK> and makeup my guess is that the producers filmed mostly in russia choosing women for their looks and <UNK> to work cheap rather than acting ability if you decide to watch this because you have nothing better to do or are a film student looking for bad examples fast forward through every scene not involving nudity
<START> i don't even like watching those late night talk shows but i found this one really interesting i imagine it's probably close to the truth it feels like an honest account if that means anything kinda feel for the people somewhat when you watch it a nice movie for a saturday night
<START> this is arguably the worst of the major <UNK> <UNK> films yes she is gorgeous but that can wear thin over time especially after the corny and predictable movie ending br br in this turkey robert walker has to pretend that he's eddie <UNK> which surely embarrassed him <UNK> san juan plays the jane powell <UNK> gee part dick plays a sort of dim sidekick and eve <UNK> plays helen <UNK> and a host of other wise cracking female semi comedians yes the film contains a major popular song speak low but check out the other entirely forgettable pieces dick sings very well of course and so does the uncredited <UNK> dubbing for <UNK> br br the sets are cheap the script is filled with clichés and failed humor and tom <UNK> looks as though he has been battling with <UNK> as indeed he was in short if you want to see <UNK> in her prime buy a photo and stay well clear of this movie
<START> this was something i had been looking forward to seeing the ultimate <UNK> movies had both <UNK> my expectations and since iron man has been one of my favorite marvel characters i thought that this same production team would be able to do some really great stuff with an iron man solo title but the final film was unsatisfying i wasn't expecting them to spend most of the movie paying tribute to iron man gray armor the red and gold armor is seen for maybe ten or so minutes all together not a major complaint but not what i expected from the ads and box the worse thing however was the story the acting and the cell <UNK> cgi animation for the monsters and iron man armor that was not convincing it didn't blend in well with the cell animation at all even on it's own it seem stick like and lifeless tony character arc as incredibly slow as it takes is so forced and unconvincing i wanted to see this movie because i love iron man but after forcing myself through the film i wondered if they couldn't have come up with something that had been as good as the ultimate <UNK> movies
<START> having seen this without knowing all the <UNK> surrounding the lead character indeed without even knowing that it was based on real life events i must say i am impressed murder in <UNK> is an above average production for a made for tv movie the acting is uniformly great christopher <UNK> in particular putting in a stand out performance and the teen actors <UNK> in what are difficult roles the idea of the dead girl <UNK> the movie is a stroke of genius which <UNK> the movie from merely good to excellent the script is <UNK> for what is essentially movie of the week fodder and the cinematography is beautiful
<START> three is a seriously dumb <UNK> movie <UNK> as a psychological thriller it's closest relative is the <UNK> superior dead calm also featuring billy zane dead calm provided well drawn characters to root for in the form of sam neil and nicole <UNK> <UNK> parents attempting to re define their relationship on an ocean cruise they end up being <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> psycho killer it provided sharp increasingly suspense a scary feeling of <UNK> in open <UNK> as the cat and mouse game of life and death <UNK> br br three suffers from poorly drawn characterisation the audience doesn't care what happens to any of them a stupid and unnecessary voodoo plot device a total lack of suspense or excitement and some <UNK> hammy performances from the principal players zane in particular goes way over the top in an <UNK> mannered fashion in dead calm he was menacing <UNK> and <UNK> with barely controlled sexual violence here he is <UNK> <UNK> slimy and <UNK> and where does he get his seemingly <UNK> supply of dry <UNK> and <UNK> and how come his lighter stays full of juice for over a year ms <UNK> is very <UNK> stunningly pretty but both her chest and rear appear to have been wildly over <UNK> by some sort of life raft <UNK> they do however succeed in acting with more skill and conviction than the rest of her dramatic actress in the <UNK> sense of the term she is not the guy playing the voodoo <UNK> the third <UNK> of this sorry triangle could have been replaced by a <UNK> of <UNK> no one would notice in fact judging by his complete lack of ability to deliver dialogue in any meaningful or dynamic way <UNK> represents a potential improvement in the casting stakes excuse pun br br plus sides the scenery is nice and the cinematography above and below the water is credible br br i'm guessing this had a very limited if any theatrical release or went straight to rental and <UNK> dvd the reason for this is it's not very good if you want something decent along these lines get dead calm it was made by people who knew a bit about cinema
<START> i have really nothing to add to all the other comments save this to me the film looked like a silent film slowly being adapted to sound the text boards bringing the story along <UNK> that impression i suppose along the way the actors were allowed to leave the stilted theatre like acting <UNK> <UNK> very much looks like a typical early silent movie heroine at the beginning of the film but at the end is allowed <UNK> expressions gus the <UNK> reminded me of the comic characters of shakespeare plays and <UNK> sounded to me like an early donald duck br br it truly amazed me that it was all filmed <UNK> on location and even though the dust of all the <UNK> horses and cattle <UNK> the view it must actually have been like that for the real <UNK> it also was clear to me that many of those indians must have been real and i didn't <UNK> any overt racism towards them and john wayne looks so incredibly young as someone who became a real wayne fan through the <UNK> trilogy by john ford and thought that stage coach was wayne's first as a leading star this film was a revelation the plot is very simple again reminding me of a silent film but the <UNK> is very real indeed an amazing film to have been made with that technique and under those conditions in 1930
<START> i have the good common logical sense to know that oil cannot last forever and i am <UNK> aware of how much of my life in the <UNK> revolves around <UNK> products i've been an avid <UNK> of new technology and i keep running out of space on so i know that even the energy <UNK> associated with peak oil will change my life <UNK> br br the end of <UNK> shows in a rational and entertaining manner just how much my whole family's lifestyle will have to change in my lifetime i am particularly concerned for the future generations who will have to pick up the <UNK> for our <UNK> however the film makers do offer a <UNK> of hope in that they acknowledge human <UNK> and determination and the sense of community that tends to be <UNK> by shared <UNK> br br there is no point in trying to pretend that peak oil is <UNK> propaganda or in treating it like the approaching <UNK> cloud in on the beach i e with suicide <UNK> at the ready even with our best efforts times will get harder all over and i'm hoping there's enough compassion and humanity to go around
<START> i absolutely adore this film about a lady <UNK> barbara stanwyck for a major magazine who delivers a <UNK> article each month that includes details about her awesome home life as a wife and mother in a beautiful <UNK> home the trouble happens when the owner of her <UNK> <UNK> demands that she have him and a ww2 hero as guests during the christmas holidays why is she worried because she lives in a small new york apartment isn't married and doesn't have a baby and can't cook at all hilarity and romance ensues when she tries to put on a believable act in an effort to save face keep from being fired by the magazine owner played by sydney <UNK> this is a delightful comedy one that i highly recommend to classic movie lovers
<START> admittedly i tuned into this in the hopes of seeing some <UNK> shots of james <UNK> unfortunately there was only one early on and the rest of the movie was very tame and ultimately made little sense br br the story what there is of it centers on nick and julie <UNK> a couple whose marriage of many years is beginning to grow stale nick a successful businessman is focused on work to the point of <UNK> julie who tries to fill the void by going back to school <UNK> longing for the passion that she and nick had early in their marriage begins to take shape in the form of powerful sexual fantasies which block out reality for minutes at a time causing her to do things like burning breakfast and her husband's papers at first she <UNK> about her husband but as the movie progresses she begins to <UNK> about other men and about encounters with random strangers whom she meets this <UNK> in her acting out her fantasies with disastrous consequences for her marriage can she and her husband <UNK> their relationship is it worth saving br br this could have been an interesting premise but the execution is so bland that you wonder why they even bothered characters aren't developed motives aren't explained background information isn't given no exploration is made of how julie got to the point where she couldn't control herself and no explanation is offered as to how she will do so in the future the end product is a muddled mess which is just as confusing as <UNK> fantasies which are surprisingly underdeveloped br br the acting is a mixed bag donna mills as julie does well with the material she is given although her <UNK> self pity does become <UNK> after awhile james <UNK> acts as though he is reading his lines from cue cards and even his anger over his wife's infidelity is hard to buy into he shows so little passion over the whole issue the supporting roles are mostly forgettable br br disappointing treatment of what could have been an interesting story <UNK> the pity since it doesn't even offer the eye candy it promised
<START> run don't walk to rent this movie it is re released on an excellent dvd version it is <UNK> acting directing cinematography in the world of suspense film noir tribute this to the <UNK> american director jules <UNK> who also plays the italian safe cracker see it
<START> i saw this film at the new festival in new york it was by far the worst film there it's use of full frontal nudity and a <UNK> <UNK> script and direction that neither commits to a re make of nor decides it's a neil <UNK> flick left me feeling <UNK> would anyone ruin a perfectly good cast like this ' it lacks irony and fills the <UNK> with sentiment which causes the times when the movie turns on itself to make you want to wipe your face as your mind and heart search for what could be going on in the film but isn't i wish the director and editor had re edited the film because maybe there's more story there that could be released from an otherwise unpleasant experience
<START> <UNK> and indians is an excellent film the writing acting directing could not have been better this was a story that <UNK> to be told and this group of talented individuals and teams did a superb job of doing so stories like this one are not pleasant ones but serve to remind people of the social <UNK> that exist all around the world it is my hope that when this film is seen that attitudes and prejudices will be changed a film that can do that is a rare a special thing andrew is an excellent writer and his talents and expertise in this field came shining through in this film br br thank you for telling this story br br ruby
<START> the <UNK> squad gets started the <UNK> of the without even bothering to develop any of the characters or show us why anyone is doing what they are doing br br moreover most of the events in the movie seem <UNK> to the plot without even a <UNK> of character development the plot <UNK> from gen x club scenes to action scenes and back again br br
<START> journey through the final days of <UNK> <UNK> with flashbacks to a sexually active and diverse childhood br br it's definitely not a feel good romance movie it is a romance movie but one without <UNK> everyone's an adult here not your cup of tea if you want another <UNK> in seattle or <UNK> hill
<START> it couldn't have come out at a worse time just as the nation was entering the reagan years the boom boom 80s the time of no regrets no concerns it got no word of mouth and opened poorly the studio <UNK> it but hair is possibly the best musical ever made with <UNK> directing and <UNK> it's a <UNK> beautiful well acted well written triumph that few people remember the casting is perfect the musical numbers unforgettable and even the <UNK> of an ending doesn't <UNK> the film's <UNK> spirit br br if you haven't see this movie you haven't seen the best musical of all time seriously
<START> it's important to check your expectations when you see <UNK> the buzz that has been generated on this site far surpasses the real impact of the movie what may help someone about to see the movie is to realize that it is not supposed to be scary it is pure camp and an attempt at fun it is not funny just campy don't expect something like shaun of the dead nor something like friday the 13th part ii through <UNK> br br <UNK> does possess passable actors the cinematography is straight ed wood creature effects and make up are silly probably on purpose gore and blood is something between romero and dead alive <UNK> is a movie of it's between shaun of the dead and leslie <UNK> it's between campy and comedy there's a difference it's between ultra violent and violent comic book br br instead of capturing the essence of american horror or whatever other silly <UNK> that has been used to describe the movie it tries to capture something between <UNK> american horror like friday the 13th and new horror like shaun it thankfully stays away from torture horror br br in the end <UNK> is between a bad movie and a decent movie br br i think it is happening more and more that people involved in movies are <UNK> to sites like imdb to rate and comment on the movies that they are involved with at very least there is <UNK> going on for people associated with the associates to leave positive <UNK> and ratings there is no other reason for this movie to have <UNK> out in the high with <UNK> votes and quickly fall after wide release this movie is on just better than the <UNK> releases and should not be so <UNK>
<START> this thing directed by french sensation patrick <UNK> is worst than all the <UNK> that you may have seen forget independence day <UNK> the <UNK> etc you get the picture this one's the <UNK> <UNK> is a tv celebrity in france if you need an equivalent let's say he's jerry springer with an i q of 13 this is his first movie let's hope it's the last i hope troma or someone would <UNK> this film in the states so that you guys out there can the french <UNK> at it's worst let's cut this short this is the masterpiece of s t
<START> anyone who correctly <UNK> the opening images as god killing himself without reading the end credits certainly deserves a free ticket to a rest home in <UNK> i would imagine this as being a favorite movie at twin peaks dark <UNK> on movie night if time existed there i would think that a better title might have been how much fun can you have with someone who's almost dead in the forest with only <UNK> technology the answer it would seem is quite a bit so despite the silly god killing himself the uber <UNK> an apt phrase taken from a previous letter the more clearly <UNK> <UNK> hi i'm the beast deal with it than christian i can't believe another viewer had the thick <UNK> to see the <UNK> christian bible in this despite all of that this is a daring important work that most people should not see i am both impressed and <UNK> out that it was made at all
<START> scooby doo and the monster of mexico was no doubt the weakest of the modern scooby doo animated features <UNK> <UNK> monster is a considerable improvement br br this time the gang head off to scotland to see the <UNK> games and visit blake castle <UNK> <UNK> home and wouldn't you know the castle happens to be in the <UNK> fishing village of on the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> br br during their stay they meet a few interesting folks first there is <UNK> a scientist who has drowned all of her money into finding the <UNK> <UNK> monster br br sir ian the boss of the national <UNK> museum of scotland he is <UNK> non believer of br br the the own a <UNK> <UNK> on the <UNK> of the <UNK> the sons are a couple of local <UNK> always into <UNK> br br del a wild paranoid hippie dude who is convinced the monster is out there and will stop at nothing on find her br br and finally <UNK> the <UNK> master who has seen too many times to count br br most of these characters are stereotypes which gets a bit annoying as this is teaching younger audiences a load of crap and giving the wrong impression however if you can <UNK> yourself to it you'll be alright being from scotland i can't help but <UNK> at the awfully <UNK> scottish accents fact we don't sound like that br br soon enough looking rather more demonic than shows up and causes havoc looks like the gang have another mystery on their hands the usual chase scenes clues and <UNK> wacky <UNK> follow there are plenty of laughs the animation is splendid with some atmospheric scenes and locations and the plot a lot better than monster of mexico br br the only bad thing this time around is the music i miss louis <UNK> and the songs here are pretty rotten too where are the <UNK> girls when you need 'em br br the region 2 dvd is in crystal clear 1 <UNK> 1 <UNK> widescreen the region 1 ain't with <UNK> 5 0 sound some okay extras are included definitely worth getting
<START> a film like <UNK> puts another film that <UNK> around its social consciousness i e the recent film crash almost to shame not necessarily because either one puts forth its message of <UNK> is rotten more significantly although i'd <UNK> crash throws the hammer down much more <UNK> in comparison with this but because of how the storytelling and <UNK> never get much in the way like with crash maybe it's not really necessary to compare the two as <UNK> is in its core all deep into the film noir vein like its going out of style it was interesting actually to see what the director edward said on the dvd interview where he mentioned that the budget for the photography was significantly lower on purpose so that more could be spent on the actors and the schedule went through at a very <UNK> quick pace but then what comes off then as being incredible about the picture is that you would think looking at many of the lighting set ups that it took a lot to do just for a small scene like when robert <UNK> first goes in for questioning under the captain robert young the <UNK> of shadows <UNK> in the room is exquisite that there are many other lighting set ups that go even further with so little marks this as something essential in the realm of just the look of the noir period just take a look at a shot of characters on a <UNK> the bars <UNK> against them and see what i mean br br but back to the substance part of the film it's really a story that consists of a murder mystery but one that we as the audience don't take long to figure on the answer it's then more about something else then in the mind and soul of a killer that wouldn't be found in a common crime picture then as there are really no <UNK> for the most part in the film there's a very <UNK> risk with this then that characters could be too thin just to prop up the worthwhile message against anti <UNK> but direction of his top shelf cast along with a really terrific script by john paxton <UNK> out the characters least of which for what they should have to not seem too thin alongside the message and what would a noir be then without some attitude to go along with it mitchum helps that along even in scenes like between him and young where its very much based in the situation of the story's moment i e a detail in the plot by <UNK> a little sly wit into some of the dialog it may already be there in the lines but he helps make the character with a good edge for his scenes br br then there's also robert ryan who excels at <UNK> as a man who you know you don't like much at first just through his b s demeanor but you're not totally sure about either then once it starts to come <UNK> ironically through a <UNK> view point of the suspect mitchell george cooper at the apartment of the soon to be deceased his performance becomes a great <UNK> act of being full of crap and also rather frightening in his blind way it's a good performance when also <UNK> with cooper who has actual personal issues that he faces and comes forward with regret and <UNK> it's really after the film ends that one thinks about a lot of this however and while you're watching the film it's more about getting into the dialog and the flow of the scenes and in the sometimes stark <UNK> camera moves on the actors so the message is in a way secondary not that it isn't an important one especially for the time period coming right off of ww2 but years later its seeing the actors even the ones that don't get the big <UNK> status like gloria <UNK> as <UNK> the femme fatale of the picture if it could've had time for one which it doesn't and william <UNK> as <UNK> the <UNK> working off one another that sticks much strongly in the <UNK> screenplay br br is also very wise in choosing to limit the musical score is powerful too as for very long stretches we hear nothing and mostly when it does come up it's incidental to the character's surroundings he could've just as easily gone with added musical notes on some dramatic scenes for emphasis most specifically the opening audience <UNK> into the film by sticking clear of that and getting the right attitudes and nuance in camera and cast it standards in genre material to a very fine memorable level my favorite scene would probably go to story about an irish immigrant he tells to <UNK> where all such elements come into place well it might not come in very high at the top of my favorite <UNK> and i'd still throw down murder my sweet as the director's masterpiece in this kind of picture but it's <UNK> higher in quality than something of the b level too
<START> a film is beyond all expectations an excellent insight into the human condition what exactly drives <UNK> to have her ass painted what could push a human so far that there only way to escape is to have there rear passage repeatedly painted by strangers br br this film is not afraid to <UNK> in the face of the ass painting issue simply breathtaking roll on the sequel or whatever comes next from the geniuses who made this
<START> i guess they reward idiocy today because whoever came up with the concept for this movie was not shot on sight br br this is a morons delight the worst <UNK> types of every ghetto and high school movie is dragged out twisted around and made even more unbearable every character in this movie has a <UNK> story beyond sympathy lets pray for a remake where the whole school gets <UNK> br br spoiler how does a school so run down have the internet in the first place
<START> i really like this movie i like it not just because it's a great early 80s movie with a great soundtrack but i found that it has some thought provoking moments they are just moments not the entire film it's definitely not like less than zero br br the scenes deal with typical <UNK> pressure and also with more difficult problems like the betrayal of trust these problems are not easily resolved or forgotten by the characters certain scenes will stand out and invite reflection on one's own teenage experiences and how those experiences may have affected one's character and <UNK> as an adult br br you can watch this movie and think about the problems young adults must face and about your own experiences or you can just pay attention to the <UNK> quest to de themselves either way it's a good movie
<START> utterly ridiculous movie which makes fun of the college admission process while it is true that the <UNK> is not everything in <UNK> a student for admission to college what the movie talks about is utterly ridiculous and not worth repeating nor viewing br br college officials are made to look like stupid people who have an extremely narrow view of the entire process the film is an insult to hard working high school students who work hard and then have to suffer through a long process until they receive that letter of acceptance or <UNK> from the schools they have applied for br br this movie certainly deserves <UNK> on all levels
<START> although i totally agree with the previous comment regarding the marvellous acting of toni as <UNK> i would also like to add the beautiful filming and montage which turns this movie virtually into a painting the young director <UNK> had the courage to experiment with different types of camera techniques which reminded me of darren <UNK> for a dream they both used the same mtv style filming combined with modern alternative <UNK> music making the film  le stand apart from the other crime mafia movies in its genre even though the movie may start of very slow paced almost <UNK> compared to the faster hollywood productions it should be enjoyed cause of its <UNK> marvellous character portray and splendid ending definitely a must see for people who enjoy the european italian cinema ps toni keep on acting like this we need an <UNK>
<START> i <UNK> like a little girl during the ending of this movie and i dare anyone else to hold it together without a <UNK> absolutely heart wrenching stuff yet uplifting at it's core br br a great effort on the part of ann margaret who plays a <UNK> ill mother of ten who knowing her <UNK> steel working husband won't be able to support the family when she is gone <UNK> the of her children before she <UNK> off the role really deserved an oscar br br you truly feel for this poor family as the dying mother gives her all to ensure that her kids don't end up in a poorly <UNK> state <UNK> system br br if you haven't seen it get it if you can
<START> ladies and gentlemen allow us to introduce to you  the this ancient latin american tribe even <UNK> the <UNK> supposedly had the most <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> yet they get their <UNK> <UNK> by a couple of college <UNK> and a one hundred and seven year old <UNK> with a whip but before you get to see this however you have to struggle through more than 40 minutes of sheer boredom <UNK> pranks and sleazy sequences that don't contain any actual sleaze in case i haven't made myself entirely clear yet the dark power is an <UNK> cheesy and inept piece of 80's horror crap that still manages to be amusing because of its sheer and somewhat charming stupidity factor writer director phil intentions were obviously admirable but he  as well as the rest of the cast crew  lacked the talent and financial means to deliver something even half decent carefully watched the evil dead and other similar demonic themed movies and somehow must have thought he could pull this off as well the movie opens with an old indian guy dying in his isolated countryside house barely speaking out his last word above a <UNK>  his <UNK> promptly <UNK> out house to a bunch of college chicks including a typically 80's <UNK> babe a cute black girl and a racist redneck gal soon they will discover why exactly the old indian lived like a <UNK> as he was actually the guardian of an ancient burial ground <UNK> buried themselves alive only to emerge again thousands of years later and feed on the flesh of the living and honestly is there any better <UNK> flesh than that of <UNK> as hinted at before already the first half of the dark power is terribly lame and sleep inducing the clichéd pranks the retarded dialogs and the ridiculously overlong footage of <UNK> <UNK> swinging around his whip seem to go on forever then the movie loses its last <UNK> of credibility when the <UNK> emerge from the ground instead of menacing they look like drugged out hard rock stars with <UNK> masks and drunken gestures exactly one gory moment is worth mentioning when a guy's lips are stretched out over his entire skull but overall even the carnage aspect of this movie is disappointing the only remotely worthwhile moments are utterly senseless like when a 9 year old kid named <UNK> goes <UNK> with his <UNK> truck or when the vulgar naked chick beer in the <UNK> after working out seriously unless you get turned on by the sight of a 1940's western veteran swinging around his whip at nothing i'd advise to skip this film
<START> just a few words it's a good thing george a romero is still among us cause if he were dead he would be forced to rise from grave to vote against the people who made this <UNK> and the saddest thing of all is that i actually agree with these people's sentiments yeah there's zombies in it and they do have a good reason to come back from beyond the grave to vote oh and one of them finishes off the doctor from <UNK> voyager that's about as scary as it will get people if you are looking for a horror movie i suggest you keep on looking and if you are looking for a witty political satire you're also in the wrong place and not just because this series is called masters of horror but don't let me hold you back maybe you see something i've missed though chances are you'll be wasting your time with it just as i have let's just say i prefer my zombie movies with the zombies standing in of the camera
<START> i tired on several attempts to sit down and watch this program <UNK> girls it <UNK> me for i just couldn't put my finger on what this was about was this about a young woman having a baby young in life and never growing up was this about the daughter being more responsible than the mother was this about a rebellious rich girl and her non rebellious daughter what the heck is this show about finally i just didn't care the cast makes me want to scream the writing is neither smart or intelligent it's <UNK> and tedious br br so why did i watch because i heard so many good things about this and i am not one to voice an opinion until i have watched <UNK> jerk reactions are usually wrong so i watched a few times the first time i watched this i saw the mother running around like she was 12 and the daughter acting like she was 40 maybe that is what didn't attract me i never liked any of the freaky friday films not to say this is like that but there are some similarities br br also i have a friend who watches this show every week so i asked her what is this show about a very bright young lady usually <UNK> she never could give me a straight answer so i asked others who rave about it they really don't know either br br <UNK> girls is turning out to be a tv program that's like an art house movie many of us wont get it but those that go try desperately to find a meaning where there really isn't one just to be hip yes i find lauren <UNK> annoying <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a whole hour of that wow and the rest of the cast is about as memorable as <UNK> cheese <UNK> the town is hokey the men are <UNK> the grand parents are boring and sadly i find nothing redeeming about any of these characters or care about anything they do it's like watching paint dry on the wall
<START> the <UNK> is one of those under seen films in the careers of a director or actor that ends up playing better than expected in the same year that clint eastwood and don <UNK> <UNK> on dirty harry they also worked together on this little psycho sexual drama set in civil war era <UNK> country it's almost a <UNK> from what <UNK> had for audiences here is a film that is under the radar and with a low budget to almost no business when compared with what dirty harry pulled in it is also a story where eastwood is not surrounded in a world full of dangerous men but women who despite their first appearances have darker sides to them and there's even romance in it in between some of the <UNK> and more complex scenes but in this kind of <UNK> to make the film <UNK> therefore actually has a little more freedom to do things with the style of the picture that <UNK> into something more european i'm reminded here and there of <UNK> work in the 60's it all works though pretty well even with the initial doubt that these two figures of <UNK> film making eastwood the obvious and <UNK> having made his <UNK> in b noir and low budget thrillers can pull off material that could possibly be made for a lifetime movie br br it was also captivating and really darkly comic here and there to see eastwood's performance working off of these girls he's doing something a little <UNK> in his performance by still having the sort of eastwood <UNK> if there is such a thing close to his clichéd movie image by being a step ahead of this little school for young women at times and not at others to see eastwood in a performance like this as with play misty for me the other eastwood work of 1971 shows how cool he can act <UNK> with very good actresses particularly here are the four main female characters each of varying ages and each with varying <UNK> to their man while <UNK> work directing all of the actors has its moments in the first half it's really once the story crosses the half way mark in the dream sequence less successful than the director could be capable of that the real <UNK> scenes start to pick up a lot of this is the best that <UNK> directed dramatically pushing the psychological and emotional edges of scenes where not expected br br it's a difficult film all of this praise aside as it doesn't paint anyone as being too respectable only the character of <UNK> the slave on duty played by mae <UNK> is sort of separated from what <UNK> between the all too curious women and along with this here is acting in a role that is and isn't what he's usually seen as during this time of his true <UNK> years in the movies he's an anti hero here which was his trademark of the westerns and other thrillers he was doing at the time but unlike those films he's not really in a mode where he's than <UNK> to put it in a way as he is both <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> even in his most charming and <UNK> moments if it's not one of his best acting jobs which is hard to really put together considering his <UNK> it is one that is worth a look for fans who might want to see another side of him it's a credit to him but also to what <UNK> with his <UNK> with <UNK> as they both took chances at this time in hollywood
<START> i only gave this film a 4 because i saw it in 3 d if you don't see it in 3 d i give it a 2 this movie is so bad it's not funny anyone can make a film like this for a weeks pay bad acting effects and story but it was cool to watch in 3d why can't they make good movies in the 3 d format
<START> i was very impressed with with this film which was directed by <UNK> the story was about a young woman <UNK> who suddenly has lost all memory of the last three days and has suffered nightmares about <UNK> on the moon she can not explained how this has happened to anyone one day a <UNK> arrives for her from the island of where she goes to visit strangely though people seem to know her even though she has never been there before also her dreams of <UNK> on the moon come back to her br br i thought that this was a very strange italian movie that seemed very haunting at times and there was also strange images in the film that seemed to stay with you throughout the the time you were watching the film i would recommend this film to people just to see how good it is highly recommended
<START> am i right in thinking i went to see the same film as everyone else this film was terrible i'm a fan of all 3 series of the league of and have always respected the originality of the writers even when the format changed in series 3 this film however was a blatant half effort the plot was extremely poor having the characters going into the real world made this film see more like the last action hero there was about 5 moments in the film that got a mild chuckle but the rest of the time i was wishing it would end this would have been better as a 10 minute short on the dvd it was more of an explanation of what they planned to do and looked like some of the writers <UNK> on the fate of the characters and they made a joke of this by killing him off in the first 30 minutes br br if your a true fan of the league of <UNK> ability to stay fresh then you'll hate this film if you only watch it cause there was nothing better on tv then <UNK> love it br br someone back me up
<START> br br i first viewed this film shortly after it was put out on video in 1995 i <UNK> it <UNK> saying that julie was no daniel never really giving it a chance and saying it was horrid br br but here it is 5 years later its on disney and im watching it again and i'm finding that it <UNK> as bad as i made it out to be <UNK> is still <UNK> just as <UNK> as ever the musical score is still there pleasant as ever and <UNK> character <UNK> that bad her acting is pretty good considering the script it beats the third installment by a wide <UNK> so my original rating of 4 has been raised to 7
<START> i don't know how expensive was the creation of this movie but the effects were awful half of the movie was filmed on stage in front of a movie <UNK> that's sure that blue box wouldn't look so artificial when they traveled on a boat the background <UNK> was moved imitating the movement of waves but the characters weren't moving the cgi effects terrible i am not sure but i guess the effect were created with paint and made a sequence of them next time the creators should hire a professional cgi maker team it looks like the cgi creator would have drawn on the picture strip with shaky hands awful that's sure when i first saw the trailer i thought it was created in 1983 one of my friend told me the correct date 2005 my jaw dropped i was so shocked i thought he was kidding people i recommend you to skip this movie the story is also twisted you won't enjoy it
<START> i think it's the first time that i go inside a theater and go out so disappointed there were two reasons why i went to see et les <UNK> first as a film buff and second as a big fan br br in the end the film doesn't satisfy any request it's simply a big animated mess and it proves that the franchise is going from bad to worse br br in fact it has been this way since the death of first <UNK> <UNK> in 1977 his faithful <UNK> <UNK> albert took his place but the following books were clearly lacking of the quality that was present during the years br br et les <UNK> is based on the book et les which was published during the reign the basic story is the same arrives to the village and et must turn him into a real man while the <UNK> come to in order to discover what fear is because it seems that fear gives wings br br the similarities end here what follows in the book is a non stop series of laughs gags and hilarious dialog with the result that the <UNK> do discover fear and they flee the movie is silly unfunny fast paced corny well just name a <UNK> and it has good chances of being applied br br the difference between the book and the movie could be more acceptable if the movie was good but the new ideas simply crashes it in a <UNK> pit even older movies such as le which almost transferred the lines one by one without changing them are easily better br br animation has the quality of other 21st century movies but it has its faults and any film <UNK> could find the mistakes the greatest example is the continuity mistake where the day follows the night after a <UNK> of second in the same sequence br br imagine they took animation studios from numerous countries and they still can't get adequate film making br br the changes of the original story are simply unbearable and they still could be even if there was no original story in the movie has a pet <UNK> named and who act as his cell phone the <UNK> chief has a rebellious teen daughter named <UNK> and she constantly defies her father's authority there's also a stupid <UNK> wizard his cartoonish dumb and muscular son the faithful bride of who is obsessed with decoration her name is and well i can't stand that much longer br br we're far from the original gags from the original book the biggest problem is the difficulty of <UNK> the images to the big screen mainly because the greatest laughs in the books come from the verbal jokes and visual gags which do not have the same appeal on a theatre screen i remember that the greatest moments in the book were laughing at the names which all finish in and tries to scare them in ridiculous ways br br and if everything wasn't enough somebody in the publicity staff decided to write on the movie poster that there's an already existing <UNK> <UNK> song which would be featured in the final credits if it was a new song i could have understood but using an old song is only another proof that the movie is so badly made that they're ready to do anything in order to attract film goers br br the only good point for this movie is that it is so stupid and the end is so bad that we just can't walk out of the theater without being left cold in a summer release it just can't hurt br br the only other acceptable point of the movie is how becomes courageous his psychological transformation in the book is too spontaneous and not credible while it's better <UNK> in the movie and the motivation point is more believable br br so if you haven't seen the movie yet don't waste your money on it grab the book instead br br oh <UNK> why did you leave us
<START> one of the worst theatrical movies of the year if not all time anthony hopkins <UNK> himself by even appearing in this joke i can't believe david mamet and <UNK> scott's name appear on this travesty the best career move <UNK> foster ever made was turning this one down <UNK> moore was as <UNK> throughout as a female keanu reeves gary <UNK> was of course his brilliant self he is a crippled victim of <UNK> and the make up is so good i didn't know it was gary until the final credits but eaten by trained <UNK> give me a break <UNK> has it that he didn't want his name even mentioned in the credits and <UNK> and feeding his own brain to ray liotta i was laughing at the absurdity no make that stupidity of this flick at this point i haven't seen so many people walk out of a movie since who's that girl br br pay someone else to go for you if you must but miss this one at all cost
<START> my two daughters ages 11 and 13 and i were lucky enough to see a screening of this movie last night we were all pleasantly surprised to see how entertaining and funny this movie was david duchovny was very appealing as the male lead and <UNK> driver gave her usually competent performance some of the scenes are laugh out loud funny especially one scene <UNK> driver has with a fellow transplant i liked the fact that it was a movie that i could watch with my children and i wasn't embarrassed by any scene whatsoever everyone in the movie theater was laughing and enjoying themselves thumbs up bonnie hunt

<START> just caught the rain people on turner classic movies late one night the film was released in 1969 shirley knight stars as natalie a long island housewife who exact reasons unknown leaves her husband and <UNK> on a road trip not knowing exactly where she is going natalie is also newly pregnant which <UNK> things along the way she picks up a brain damaged ex football player jimmy james <UNK> who has been kicked out of his college and is <UNK> there are many twists and turns along the way between these two as natalie struggles to take care of jimmy and she begins to realize he is mentally limited and cannot take care of himself she is going through her own struggles needless to say and in no position to care for him natalie appears to be a woman on the edge of a nervous breakdown at times she makes some odd phone calls to her husband who begs her to come home natalie tries to dump jimmy several times only to have him re enter her life through circumstances a young robert duvall plays a strange and troubled cop who befriends natalie you get the sense all along that this film is going to end badly and it does this film is certainly uneven at times and the script is somewhat lacking francis ford coppola directed this and of course he would soon become immensely famous in the next few years for directing the godfather the actors are good ones needless to say as they all would have <UNK> ahead of them in film shirley knight is the least known of the three although she is also underrated as an actor james <UNK> is especially effective here and he seems to just inhabit this character this film remains little more than a curiosity now no doubt because it is an early movie of <UNK> and i confess i had never heard of it so god bless turner classic movies for bringing it to a new audience
<START> oddball black comedy romance featuring a great cast and a less than stellar script brenda <UNK> lovely amazing is the title character a woman trapped in a <UNK> marriage with a man who is obviously having an affair with his beautiful blonde secretary guess who's playing this minor role <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> drive must of <UNK> this project in before her superstar status was <UNK> with the blockbuster thriller the ring br br on the male side of the cast list there's the woefully miscast alfred <UNK> <UNK> an old fashioned undertaker who suddenly decides to reveal his desires for which have <UNK> <UNK> for decades perhaps <UNK> is hoping <UNK> turn in the upcoming spider man 2 might generate some interest in this little <UNK> which belongs on the dvd rental shelf br br but the award for <UNK> <UNK> performance goes to christopher walken catch me if you can who goes completely over the top as <UNK> undertaker with his vegas style <UNK> in a small <UNK> town his character must have into the village because there's little reason for him to exist in this script br br that said if you'd like to see some top notch actors engage in some low brow humor then this one's for you and if this isn't your cup of tea then try renting harold and <UNK> the ultimate funeral movie that's still funny to this day
<START> when jurassic park first came out it was revolutionary in <UNK> and special effects for the first ever time people cold go to a dinosaur movie and be convinced they were looking at real dinosaurs brought to life however whilst some dinosaurs were almost perfect examples of what the real creatures could have been like t rex <UNK> etc some were altered to fit the movie <UNK> and the film took place n the present on a <UNK> island where they were not in their natural <UNK> walking with dinosaurs shows us the real animals in their real <UNK> all those millions of years ago the amount of detail and scientific information used in this is great now we can view sights such as a grim desert a whole herd of an give birth a massive sea monster a eye view dinosaurs <UNK> in the south pole two lock <UNK> t rex roaring at the camera and the impact of the <UNK> that spelled their doom these dinosaurs walk run feed fight breed hunt and swim but the series also reveals the other creatures that they shared the world with two episodes are mainly focused on two different kinds of animals the flying and the marine <UNK> that lived beneath the waves the locations and scenery are spectacular and look all the more unique when a cg <UNK> walks onto screen and as for the cgi and <UNK> the movements of the cgi dinosaurs look totally and completely natural the <UNK> is bright and vivid and the <UNK> have taken careful steps to ensure that the cg animals interact with their <UNK> in any way an actual creature would by making <UNK> in the water <UNK> by <UNK> kicking up dust and casting shadows on the ground admittedly the cg isn't perfect with a few brief instances where the animals look too but the rest of the time it looks breathtaking the <UNK> is poor in some cases but it has its moments particularly the scene with the in the first episode the narration by kenneth branagh is pretty good as well giving us vital bits of information and drama at the same time but of course the true pleasure is seeing a living dinosaur doing what they did all those years ago and also seeing some truly cute moments with <UNK> <UNK> hybrid <UNK> baby and t rex chicks yes even t rex can be cute and then reminds us that nature can be brutal and was even more so back then all this adds up to a <UNK> nature masterpiece that lets you see a real dinosaur and take your breath away all from the safety of your living room if you like nature dinosaurs informative learning amazing visuals or just to have a truly good viewing and be entertained then walking with dinosaurs is definitely for you easily recommended
<START> is not a terrible movie but it is quite forgettable the lighting is intentionally poor in many scenes and unintentionally poor in all the rest so you are likely to come out of a viewing with a headache or eye strain special effects are imaginative but obvious the gratuitous nudity essential for teen slasher flicks is there of course along with the <UNK> teenagers but the whole movie just doesn't <UNK> what was needed was some dialogue and more tongue in cheek humor br br i can't really recommend that you use your time watching this movie i often give a nod to a movie based on just a scene or two that demonstrates imagination or humor but these are sadly lacking in this film
<START> this film is really a big piece of trash trying to make itself look like a hollywood production poor story outline stupid robot story ultra bad acting by <UNK> pop <UNK> and they are trying to fight my goodness those miserable actors uses <UNK> to make them look like they are good fighters and i hate that arrogant edison <UNK> the worst actor i have ever seen i will never touch his movies again avoid this movie at all costs i wanted to give it a negative value out of ten not even worth a 0 10
<START> this movie is perfect for any aspiring screen writer actor or director by watching this movie you will see all the things that are wrong with the film industry as it is today there are so many clichés that it <UNK> me to sit through this movie nothing about it is original and every single line spoken has been ripped off from those clichéd movies that we all saw in the 90's although it does have a few cheap laughs overall it is wrong wrong wrong i was so immensely bored and the movie was so predictable and pathetic i actually noticed how much make up was <UNK> onto tara <UNK> face to hide those massive <UNK> and <UNK> from her endless <UNK> seriously she was wearing so much foundation you could literally <UNK> it off and an entire bottle of it br br what shocked me though was that so many of the talented and popular cast would sign on for this piece of junk and i do not know how i sat through that horrible screaming that <UNK> <UNK> does you know when he's like angry or something and he shouts his words in this annoying manner horrifying talking <UNK> face being ten shades darker than her neck a drugged up owl a script that seemed like the work of a three year old br br seriously in my whole life there has been no movie that i have watched that i did not in <UNK> enjoy no matter how bad it was this deserves an award for being the first bad bad bad i don't think there is a single word in the english <UNK> that can possibly describe this trashy movie today i was trying to re watch it but i had to turn it off like ten minutes in because i was about to cry from the overwhelming amount of clichés br br don't even bother to rent this at your blockbuster it's not worth a <UNK> as a matter of fact i am willing to pay anyone out there considering to watch this movie so they can go do something decent with their lives
<START> oh my oh this is a really bad movie the acting is absolutely atrocious the script is god awful and the photography is simply dreadful br br what does make this movie stand out however is that you never once care about a single soul good guy or bad guy living dying or dead in the entire <UNK> minutes oh s he died huh figured they would was the best reaction i could <UNK> after each murder characters are so black or white that with the volume turned off you could still figure out who was who while the <UNK> voices had an odd <UNK> quality throughout their faces give the impression that you're looking at an old silent movie with a lot of <UNK> exaggerated <UNK> and <UNK> looks each character is a <UNK> <UNK> one dimensional one trick <UNK> once they fulfill whatever their particular role in this fiasco <UNK> their creation they are <UNK> <UNK> br br it vaguely made me think of what would happen if thomas <UNK> director writer of american title decided to do a low budget version of american psycho and got kind of distracted along the way br br this isn't a particularly gruesome movie the cold <UNK> cast <UNK> that it isn't an offensive movie the director plays it so safe that no one could possibly find it so it is simply and after all a bad movie br br avoid it we were not so fortunate and actually paid to watch this bomb on pay per view as part of my <UNK> i'm writing this review br br enough said
<START> this movie was well done but it also made me feel very down at times as well for anyone that is considering show business this is a must see as it shows the raw deal in what goes on for these struggling workers the soundtrack was definitely cool and the acting and dancing <UNK> it nicely some of the <UNK> attitudes might have been a little far fetched like <UNK> especially because i'm sure someone like that would've been kicked out immediately for <UNK> to read and such if this was the real high school for performing arts the <UNK> screen test is hard to watch for any people out there with weak <UNK> please <UNK> my warning while it's very gritty i know it's the truth on what happens so in this respect the movie is right on overall it's entertaining and even though some parts drag on the majority goes by really quickly br br final <UNK> br br movies probably would've <UNK> this one br br dvd purchase not something i'd need to see again and again br br rental worth renting at least once in your life
<START> yes indeed we have a winner a winner in best dumb action movie br br the only reason i chose to vote a 10 for this movie is because it's so incredibly bad made that it actually becomes funny br br night hunter is basically about jack cutter a vampire hunter vampire hunters have been in his generation for centuries apparently and his mission being that he has to kill the last remaining vampires br br this movie contains one of the <UNK> scenes i have ever seen in my life not to mention the really bad gun shooting scenes when people are shot in this movie blood <UNK> thick as <UNK> all over the place this makes the movie seem so cheap and lame that you just lose interest a constant shaking of the camera is what <UNK> me the most during the fight scenes this is i suppose done to create an action effect though in my opinion it gives no effect whatsoever its completely ridiculous br br all stunt scenes are done extremely badly e g a scene where the dead vampire leader gets thrown off a roof when the corpse hits the ground it <UNK> like a <UNK> rubber doll a scene where jack <UNK> the ground getting a vision was so lame it got me laughing hysterically br br lame music cheesy scenes bad acting and plain dumb filming techniques are obviously the functions that make this movie such a <UNK> to state that this is a good movie would be the same as stating that nuclear bombs are good for humans clearly those of you who say that this is one of the best action movies haven't seen many in your life br br this is basically a b class vampire action movie that deserves 0 10 but which i'll give 10 10 just for its ability being the <UNK> action movie i have ever seen of making me laugh and because i just can't live without it
<START> you've got to think along the lines of last tango in paris for this one because the mood and emotion runs along the same lines and maintains the same heights the difference being that in this exceptional intense and <UNK> depiction of love among the ruins of a <UNK> the setting is a gay <UNK> perhaps even one that is set to <UNK> in time and not the equally <UNK> but <UNK> context of <UNK> own film br br the last third of this film depicts a passionate love never seen in gay cinema to talk of pornography or gay self misses the point and intelligence of this work this film though on first impression appears to take us into the familiar often depicted underworld of gay street life then <UNK> to <UNK> the rules of this genre by <UNK> it to a super real degree the result is a hyper charged emotional <UNK> an exceptional <UNK> that <UNK> the drama to one of big universal themes and giant gestures br br this film <UNK> the high ground because of the brilliant performances by it's actors notably a young jean <UNK> <UNK> and the directing a tour de force of cinema outstanding in ambition and it's <UNK> <UNK> into the depths of human emotion as a contribution to gay cinema this film <UNK> this difficult ground and makes it it's own triumph
<START> propaganda pro american war effort film that came out in 1942 has the east side kids getting tough against any japanese they spot in their own neighborhood when they learn they're too young to <UNK> ultimately they learn they were mistaken in their <UNK> of some individuals but also happen to stumble across a spy ring they then set out to bust the film is harmless enough in its fashion although some may well take offense given how innocent <UNK> really did get <UNK> out during the second world war overall though it's a pretty generic effort and both leo <UNK> and <UNK> hall would have better moments the best of which tend to come here when they ad <UNK>
<START> this is by far the worst thing i have ever seen on film my <UNK> home movies have more talent in them then this piece of crap br br the plot summary is basically that these twin kick <UNK> are playing some sick survival game with a man and his private army on some island the man has a very cheap paper looking hand br br the acting is atrocious in this movie there are scene changes at the drop of the hat for instance for at least 30 seconds we see some guy <UNK> a song to himself which adds nothing to the movie this has the worst dialogue i have ever heard of in my life i don't think this movie could get any worse then it already is i would describe it as a want to be chuck norris action film gone wrong and i hate chuck norris
<START> i love this film it was made just before the la punk scene changed for the worse it perfectly <UNK> the mood and attitude of that time and place i feel really lucky to have been present at the filming of four of the bands at the <UNK> that night the only part that doesn't fit in too well is the sections with catholic and their <UNK> political commentary i didn't see too many people who were into that at all the rest of the film shows attitudes that i witnessed a lot people dealing with hard lives or taking a swing at the music industry and or lousy hippies i don't think i've seen a documentary that captures so <UNK> and personally the subject matter being covered
<START> his john dark kevin connor fantasy adventures were a <UNK> of summer holiday movies in the days before star wars they weren't masterpieces they didn't <UNK> state of the art special effects but they were exactly what an audience of kids wanted from a film back in the mid 70s br br at the <UNK> core catches just the right tone for the appropriately named <UNK> pulp adventure about victorian <UNK> peter cushing and the inevitable doug <UNK> ending up in the underground world of and battling its evil <UNK> fighting dinosaurs this time the puppets are gone in favour of men in monster suits which is a lot more fun if you're willing to suspend your disbelief and if you're not there's always caroline <UNK> <UNK> to look at aside from what may well be peter <UNK> worst performance an irritating but rehash of his movie dr who you can't me i'm british it's easily the best of the john dark kevin connor doug <UNK> fantasy adventures surprisingly well directed and <UNK> an atmospheric use of colour never especially good at exterior scenes alan <UNK> photography <UNK> immensely from the control a studio set gives him the film was shot entirely on <UNK> to paint a <UNK> vivid world worthy of a pulp novel cover not high art but definitely great saturday <UNK> fun
<START> i just saw this film again i believe for the sixth time i will <UNK> see it many more times this is one of the most brilliant french films ever made although the film is mysterious even more mysterious is what happened to the writer and director <UNK> for ten years he has not made another film and this was his only one the story and execution of this ingenious film are perfect and it is clearly paying homage continually to both hitchcock and buster keaton the split second timing of the movements is just as carefully controlled as the scene where the side of a house falls on keaton in <UNK> bill and he is only not killed by <UNK> in this film people <UNK> and turn and pass one another <UNK> and if they had been one second off they would have <UNK> the storyline thus walks a <UNK> of chance events to such an intense degree that you cannot take your eyes off the screen for even a <UNK> or you will miss something crucial the haunting albeit intentionally repetitive music by peter chase is reminiscent of hitchcock's and the whole film has the same eerie quality but whereas hitchcock had one woman be two women has two women be one woman thereby <UNK> the plot structure there are passing references to other hitchcock films but it is which is central to the inspiration of this film the theme may seem <UNK> to be obsessive love but the film is really about the magic of everyday chance events the invisible threads behind the <UNK> the <UNK> everything is hyper charged with passionate love and desire but the desire <UNK> its object and struggles towards something behind and beyond the object that is why it is so easily from lisa to alice when it is realised that it is alice who is more mysterious than lisa and it is alice who truly <UNK> the eternal mystery the film is ultimately by she is so fascinating that she <UNK> monica <UNK> which is really something to pull off considering that <UNK> is a <UNK> beauty whereas is what the english call however had even at this early date more than <UNK> the art of <UNK> beautiful girls fall by the <UNK> and don't get noticed because is being so fascinating you can't take your eyes off her long enough even to look at the beautiful girls and you end up only thinking of her most of us remember i'm sure her father richard lying in a <UNK> listening to opera in the film many years ago i would rather watch than richard lying in a <UNK> but there seems to be some genetic secret to being fascinating because richard is <UNK> too and he isn't even a woman looks as if she may turn into anna <UNK> when she is much older and that means she will get an oscar if someone can only write another for her the girl has so much passion inside her she could set the <UNK> on fire wouldn't it be wonderful if she and julie <UNK> teamed up this film made wonderful use of paris locations but where is this in the it looked like place to me maybe i missed something i must watch the film another six times just to study the <UNK> of the timing and who <UNK> past whom and make sure i've got it right the whole thing is like ten gigantic <UNK> chess games played <UNK> by a <UNK> how thrilling it all is you can look through my window anytime come on over let's discuss <UNK> coincidence <UNK> everything that is going on that is invisible and how it effects the visible and once again we have here the spirit of novel <UNK> in a great french work of art more more more
<START> feeling <UNK> is not really a road movie but that's still the best i can generate a road movie does not primarily depend on a great story line and since the plot of this movie is truly pathetic it does <UNK> that description to be interesting such a movie must rely entirely on moving and intriguing characters and on the chemistry between them unfortunately the staff of feeling <UNK> fails utterly in producing this excitement br br the presentation of the characters is unsatisfying and confusing i can for example not figure out whether keanu reeves did grow up in the house of his mother and brother or not it is said by his mother <UNK> <UNK> that he must live with his father but nothing in the film suggests that it ever happens the same goes for the rest of the characters i never get to know them they appear irrational and no real explanation is given to why they do so br br the bottom line is that i leave the movie without any feelings for the characters except <UNK> and perhaps a tiny kick of attraction for the cute cameron diaz
<START> i was still living with my parents when they aired this on dutch tv usually i was the one watching movies with the other's not caring but somehow we all sat down and watched this movie this kinda movie used to be aired at <UNK> evening it is the story of a woman <UNK> die soon but before she dies she wants to make sure her many kids will have the best possible foster parents so we were watching this and my dad the most emotional of the four of us started to cry i followed almost immediately and before long my sister and mother were <UNK> up too there we were totally moved by this simple but heartbreaking story if you want a good cry this is the one for you
<START> br br oh my word i have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or consideration for anything other than the death of the <UNK> michael winner here makes a valid observation of human desires in displaying a <UNK> ho world of deep and damaged execution not only does he <UNK> feed us with utter hell on earth seen through the face of the bronson but he also shows us the <UNK> he's feeding us with and says look at what your watching now look at your self and ask the question are you enjoying this and even though you'll tell yourself no it can't be you'll know that deep down inside you'll know it's a masterpiece
<START> to begin with i have to admit i've never been a big fan of the dutch movie genre unfortunately watching de hasn't made me change my mind it shares some common flaws like having a plot that's too predictable and linear for my taste br br worse however is that the cast has their dialogues as if they were stage actors in a play unfortunately this is common too in many dutch movies and at least to me makes it impossible to feel any kind of involvement with the main characters br br the actor that plays i'm sorry i forgot his name at the moment is at least delivering a decent performance and is one of the reasons i don't rate this movie even worse another reason is the fact that at least it seems to have had some budget and the production seems professional br br ironically the fact that the acting is often too <UNK> might not be so much of a problem if you don't speak dutch although i already warned you that the plot isn't spectacular either but at least it might make it an acceptable movie to watch
<START> i watched six of a kind for w c fields he's only in it for around 10 minutes and has one long scene the infamous pool sequence he made famous in vaudeville and several other great moments the <UNK> minutes are also delightful thankfully mostly due to the hilarious charlie as the bumbling <UNK> j he is everyone's foil he <UNK> and stumbles about to our pleasure also his comedy partner mary <UNK> plays his wife <UNK> joining in the proceedings are george burns and <UNK> allen <UNK> is particularly funny near the beginning and near the end but <UNK> and use up most of the picture <UNK> funny quite but she can also get <UNK> and poor george burns has absolutely nothing to do except repeat <UNK> all the time i don't remember laughing at him once although he has one great scene with where tries desperately to get george to take <UNK> and leave him and his wife alone for a while and one with fields where he asks fields to sell him a <UNK> that bit is exclusively <UNK> though the situation is constantly funny the are going to drive to california but to help them with <UNK> george and <UNK> are <UNK> 8 10
<START> i watched this film with high expectations but was somewhat disappointed although i like this film and was <UNK> by the story i did not find it moving and think the ending falls flat br br the story consists of the friendship between a man running a photo shop and his best <UNK> who is a traffic <UNK> the location is a quaint korean village br br this film is in some ways realistic as there is an element of tragedy and yet it is not melodramatic however i was not ultimately moved by a film depicting a man who is loved so much by a woman yet does not even give her the choice to enter his life in my mind he is a sweet noble loser br br good points excellent acting by the two main leads enjoyable <UNK> of village life br br cons flat ending br br overall good but i prefer the before sunrise and after sunset films or is it before sunset and after sunrise
<START> having worked <UNK> with young girls on the run i found this film surprisingly authentic i would never have found it had a friend not <UNK> his <UNK> there are classic themes here coming of age mother daughter <UNK> the limited choices of the <UNK> who is the good <UNK> tragedy is in every life the many layers or relationships flashbacks are meaningful when alice <UNK> a gun we know she has some <UNK> with how to use it and it does not end in cliché the cast really sells their roles it is adult material and the audio is a bit too grainy allow it 15 minutes to so to draw you in
<START> brought to you by the following among others br br 1 <UNK> is the president and <UNK> of the middle east media research <UNK> br br career br br colonel israeli army intelligence from 1968 <UNK> acting head and <UNK> on arab affairs civil administration in and 1977 1982 br br 2 <UNK> shore is an israeli canadian film writer producer and <UNK> employed full time by <UNK> he is the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> a non profit organization that seeks to advance the idea that the united states faces a threat of radical islam shore is also a regular critic of the media coverage on the israeli palestinian conflict coverage which he is regularly anti israel <UNK> br br 3 anti <UNK> league funny how supports this hateful propaganda you can never tell by reading their anti <UNK> name title br br use your mind and see how objective these people are they have their own agenda br br i think therefore i am
<START> the best of everything just what is the best of everything it is different for everyone but for most of us it is love but alas not everyone knows where or who to look to for real love this story goes the whole <UNK> of looking for love sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons but as the saying goes we are the <UNK> of our own ships and so it goes for our lives we are responsible for the choices that we make in our lives once we make those choices then we must live with them as we watch this story and as we see these women making choices that most likely change their lives forever we wonder would we make the same choices as these women or would we be <UNK> who knows
<START> <UNK> just felt like another teen oriented knock off of the i know what you did last summer trend and is painfully dull a high school <UNK> who is heavily into witchcraft and black magic is accidentally killed during a cruel prank carried out by a group of bullies who secretly bury her in the woods <UNK> to tell no one the next day the supposedly dead <UNK> arrives at school with a completely new image and <UNK> her would be killers and has a little revenge this is basically a combination of carrie the craft and every other straight to video <UNK> <UNK> turkey that hits the shelves these days the actors are absolutely atrocious and look about ten years too old to pass off as high <UNK> there is some gore which is actually nothing all that interesting since the movie is so boring and i couldn't wait for it to end if you like modern garbage than i insist you seek this one out otherwise don't bother
<START> i didn't want to write this movie off on the reviews and critics in the western world i mean how wrong have they been about asian cinema that has now become a <UNK> <UNK> of the hollywood remake monster plus jet l is pretty damn cool and he's made some interesting movies in asia so with an open mind i was surprisingly <UNK> out by this movie br br there are good points the story is very clever using m theory as a base to bring forward the plot that there are multiple <UNK> each with their own versions of worlds and most likely you each time one of you is destroyed the rest share the energy and power amongst them the idea that someone might try and <UNK> become the only version of themselves in all the <UNK> to find out if they become a god br br there's also jet li and he's not a bad actor and pretty <UNK> as a martial artist plus jason <UNK> who is an all round good actor as for the special effects some of them are really cool a mixing of bullet time and slow motion with normal speed very cool to watch in places br br the bad points well <UNK> accent is appalling and some of the effects aren't as comparable as others so it's quite apparent that money was spent on some of the main shots and not on others that were probably deemed as too short on screen or they just plain ran out of budget br br a big sore point for me is the close <UNK> camera action that hollywood has long <UNK> something that jackie chan has often talked about filming fight scenes close up serves two purpose it gives greater emphasis on a single punch or movement making it look harder and more real than it really is and it also hides what is going on around the camera lens for example people holding a fake arm or the face of a stunt double etc br br what chan always said was that he tried to open out the camera and show the audience what was going on let them see the people fighting properly rather than a close up of a face and a fist cutting to someone falling into frame showing the whole picture is more effective and it's more impressive br br so the close <UNK> shots were just more annoying than anything you failed to see the <UNK> of <UNK> fighting skills and you found it hard to see some of the action slow the cuts down and pan out the camera hollywood directors the biggest problem was the story though despite having such a strong base on which to build they seemed to loose the sense of the plot and concentrate on the action scenes there are some serious plot building and <UNK> moments that are just totally overlooked and covered in the space of a few sentences yet these could have formed some excellent and complex character development br br it just all held together too <UNK> and not enough was made of the story all in all not a great movie and it's potential was badly spoiled
<START> this world war ii <UNK> cartoon had some very good sight gags in it and its decidedly above average for its genre it was nicely drawn too with some great angles good detail and well lots of interesting sights br br what it amounts to is <UNK> out at sea in his little boat and accidentally running into a small japanese boat with two guys on it incidentally why were the <UNK> always <UNK> with big round glasses and <UNK> teeth br br anyway these harmless looking japanese sailors want <UNK> to sign a peace <UNK> oh boy thinks the <UNK> <UNK> wait until the <UNK> sees this in one of those great artwork scenes i was <UNK> to above we slowly see how that little japanese ship is really a big <UNK> and <UNK> is in deep um water why you double crossing <UNK> <UNK> yells our sailor man br br how he gets out of the situation is fun to watch
<START> i thought this movie was good i loved the plot i loved the shoot out scenes except for a few they were not needed and i also enjoyed character she was a rider i liked that i do have to say that in this gangster movie the actors were picked well because sometimes some actors just don't fit the role however though i hate to say it but i hated the ending i felt as if it should have went in a different direction also it would have been better with a little more details its based on a true story but there was so much of the facts left out but other than that it was good if you enjoy movies on the past gangsters you'll enjoy this movie
<START> the greatest tarzan ever made this movie is done in a way that no other tarzan ever has come close in doing it has every thing in it that you would want in a tarzan movie no other tarzan movie ever has or ever will portray the character this well i would say that if you have seen a tarzan movie and liked it you should see this one you will love it and if you have never seen tarzan you should see this one and forget the rest of them
<START> i'll say it again one of the worst films ever made and it was made by the director that made one of my most favorite films <UNK> i was <UNK> to see it got a grade of over six this movie sucks it looked terrible it looked like it was shot in 18 days and <UNK> must've been sleeping when he directed this arquette didn't do anything just plain terrible rotten unbearable and probably the only <UNK> in <UNK> celebrated career br br 1 10
<START> straight to video and with good reason its like the neighborhood kids putting on a play in the backyard but worse a young man don <UNK> a farm in west virginia that has been <UNK> for generations he decides to take a few friends to check the property out this <UNK> used to produce good corn <UNK> even during the great depression the secret being that the owner was murdering folks and <UNK> the fields with their blood then hang their bodies out as scarecrows the special effects are pretty lame and the the horrible dialog is full of unfunny one liners and the banter so ridiculous the sound may better be turned off cheap gore and a <UNK> of a horror flick along with in the cast <UNK> cheek b w york <UNK> and jessica
<START> it is not surprising that this film was made by i'm at the time it was i'm examined the early beauty and tragedy of <UNK> life in and delightfully explored a well known korean folk tale in and these comprised his last two films what is most surprising is that <UNK> <UNK> his 2002 offering is not presented in the style of those previous two films br br nonetheless the experienced hand of i'm comes through we explore together the life of a real person a late <UNK> century <UNK> painter who rides on the edge of <UNK> but who is not a noble and who because of that causes a stir in contemporary korean society with his fame and his public and artistic expressions of disdain for the old korean noble class and his contempt for would be japanese <UNK> <UNK> alike the painter chang <UNK> up known <UNK> as oh won performed <UNK> by <UNK> min the famous star of park chan already legendary <UNK> becomes more and more influential and therefore more dangerous throughout the film contemporary korean audiences will back a hero like this despite the fact or maybe because of the fact that he was so <UNK> in his time sense of <UNK> beauty and tragedy in history remains intact i'm is a master at capturing his country's past <UNK> and in this film he almost <UNK> himself as expected in an i'm film the cinematography is breathtaking the editing is precise and the story is central br br plots are set against <UNK> up family ties are tested and broken <UNK> behavior is alleged and is sometimes real all to bring down the man who painted fire but against all the <UNK> of detailed but sometimes convoluted account of <UNK> <UNK> life <UNK> up himself somehow manages to survive he becomes legendary because of his ability to perfectly copy famous chinese paintings after only one look art dealers and agents then <UNK> him and try to make money off oh won in other words lines of people who wish to take advantage of the real <UNK> up an artistic star begin to form but he refuses to be manipulated his <UNK> in off both the massive <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the audience if not the cast br br what does <UNK> up think he possesses powerful emotions and opinions about painting such as the aesthetic belief that paintings are living things and are never truly finished he <UNK> those who would try to turn art into profit and he cares not for politicians who use their might to bring artistic beauty around them and then cast off the artist as <UNK> but he also thinks that painting plays a role in the coming <UNK> horrid scenes involving foreign <UNK> from france and japan are presented signature historical epic <UNK> and his influence in the realm remains on prominent display in this multi million dollar epic br br the protagonist causes greater grief for himself and those who care for him when he refuses to paint this is when the story takes on a whole new meaning one that is not just political but social in nature i'm takes on the issues in <UNK> <UNK> fashion br br he oh won becomes a jesus figure the people believe him capable of artistic <UNK> and the government feels it needs his artistic support but the protagonist remains <UNK> independent and <UNK> of what others want him to do or be eventually both government and people come down upon <UNK> up in a manner taken straight out of the bible his <UNK> becomes human his humanity is not accepted he dies for or escapes from the sins of the <UNK> the art critics the politicians who <UNK> him br br but does he die as with most of films a question remains in this case does <UNK> up really become an immortal <UNK> the film does not tackle that question it merely presents a possible end for the real man of chang <UNK> up or oh won no death is depicted because no death is known br br it is difficult to find fault with this film but i'm has become so good at presenting various historical <UNK> in his culture that when he does it hardly surprises anymore as usual for films the cinematography the editing and the writing are all first rate it's a well crafted film <UNK> with uncanny story telling ability granted he may be best at doing this through the ancient korean musical art of still the film contains stretches of this admirable art form and by the end viewers feel as if they have become <UNK> to a great <UNK> story and they have because that precisely is gift
<START> i think it is a brilliant show with cool talking heads and very cool action 2 guys who pretend to be masters in women seduction demonstrate their skills at different night <UNK> and 4 experts pickup artists themselves comment on them choosing the winner their jokes are amusing and some are really fun to watch more so this show really teaches men how to get in touch with women lots of <UNK> comments are useful while you may see how it works in the field actually i think this is one of the best tv shows and i totally recommend this to all men who like women br br ps <UNK> for my broken <UNK>
<START> first of all ignore the comment about how south park should make fun of <UNK> everyone is doing that now why should south park <UNK> follow what the rest of the media is doing and what the <UNK> are doing is more serious and less funny than al gore and his global warming <UNK> br br but all that aside this episode is just plain funny al <UNK> portrayal has to be one of the best caricatures of a politician i've ever seen it was original and it was based on peoples opinions of the man i don't want to give anything away but it had me rolling on the floor br br there are also has some of the best <UNK> kyle moments ever br br all in all i'd say that this is one of the best episodes the show has ever had and i would highly recommend it to anybody
<START> if you have a chance see this russian how should i call them gems masterpieces hidden <UNK> war movies like this one or the <UNK> here are quiet or <UNK> and right after that watch again the american war movies or the international productions those one with the allies and the germans etc or even worse watch the italian war movies everything from the west will seem shallow contrived ridiculous in comparison with the russian movies i am <UNK> stunned by the quality of the aforementioned russian war movies that i cannot find the words to praise enough their shattering <UNK> over <UNK> <UNK> war movies
<START> according to the budget information given on this web site dark <UNK> had an <UNK> budget of <UNK> 000 where this money was spent i'm not exactly sure let me see costumes no location and sets hmmm think not special f x not acting lessons ah no dark <UNK> tells the epic tale of a young man who <UNK> a family farm in the hills of west virginia his girlfriend talks him into taking their friends up there to check the place out once there our <UNK> hero learns that his great grandfather used a unique method for getting his <UNK> to grow and now it's revenge time killer scarecrows out for revenge <UNK> scary well no not really we all know there have been some terrific movies made with very little money but this is not one of them this film contains pretty much some of the worst acting and dialog i've ever seen terrible clichés with terrible delivery all in all do not be fooled by the half way decent cover and avoid at all costs i'd like to give the film makers at least a d for trying but i'm afraid they didn't even do a good job with that grade f
<START> after watching the first movie in new aztec mummy collection it's difficult to believe how excited i was about the set and how upset i was when the release date was pushed back i've watched a lot of mexican horror in recent months some great  the curse of the crying woman some entertaining despite obvious flaws  night of the bloody apes and some cheesy  pick any <UNK> movie one thing that all these movies have in common is that none can be called dull well that's not the case with the aztec mummy it's been awhile since i last watched something so sleep inducing i wasn't hoping for or expecting a great movie but at least entertain me the aztec mummy takes every situation that could be interesting and sucks the life out of it through repeated scenes of people doing nothing and then <UNK> those scenes for what <UNK> like an eternity i guess that's what happens when you make an 80 minute movie with only 30 minutes of material padding <UNK> for example for anyone who has seen the movie what purpose does the bat have other than to bring a masked wrestler type to the screen and to <UNK> the runtime by 15 or so pointless minutes br br i can only hope that the other two movies in the collection are more entertaining than this one
<START> i have lost count as to how many times i have watched this movie i've never grown tired of it since this is a movie that can be enjoyed and interpreted on so many levels they just don't make movies like this anymore br br after recently finally watching the riveting documentary on the making of this film hearts of darkness a filmmakers journey into madness i'm even more amazed that this film even got finished yet alone turn out so great br br the fact that they actually filmed this movie in the <UNK> of the <UNK> is the film's greatest asset you actually feel like your in vietnam br br all of the actors are fantastic with my favorites still being robert duvall i love the smell of <UNK> in the morning martin sheen and the great marlon brando br br a lot of people complain that the film gets too murky weird and cerebral near the end well what said about this movie this film is not about vietnam it is vietnam what he means is that this film is about madness and not the war br br this movie is based on the short story heart of darkness by joseph conrad and is set against the vietnam war instead of the civil war as in the book i think that was a brilliant combination in my opinion br br this is perfect challenging film that is dark violent humorous at times and well done in every single possible way br br a true classic br br rating 10
<START> <UNK> hardcore horror hybrid doesn't really live up to its extraordinary title and intriguing premise <UNK> various vapid contemporary types are attacked by a monster on an <UNK> previously used for nuclear experiments but for the most part the film is so slow the action so dreary and the cast so clearly <UNK> to be having to have sex with each other that the film becomes a chore to watch br br this is a pity because the film sets up a promising idea a group of scientists are taken to the <UNK> by a naval officer in a small <UNK> the scientists  three women and two men  are an intriguing cross section of sexual types suffering to various degrees from <UNK> co <UNK> and there's even an intriguing <UNK> into the world of female sex <UNK> where one of the women stops off at a <UNK> to get <UNK> by two hunky <UNK> <UNK> for hire the creature himself  a <UNK> native <UNK> with a horribly <UNK> face and an long  bears some <UNK> with the old creature from the black <UNK> and is the kind of nuclear nightmare that has over <UNK> man since the cold war <UNK> despite those of us in the west having <UNK> into <UNK> and science br br porno holocaust certainly is a film which shows the post sexual revolution <UNK> coming across their mirror image in a nuclear monster yet the with which it unfolds really lets down the <UNK> of the idea there is a promising interplay of action shots with <UNK> shots which suggest that the monster who looks stalks on as horror monsters from their <UNK> position tend to do is akin to the <UNK> in the audience getting off on the sex between the beautiful people the sight of the monster forcing a gorgeous young woman to suck his over sized member certainly throws the target audience's ugly fantasies in their face but <UNK> has developed similar ideas better in other films and porno holocaust is a potentially fierce idea let down by the execution even <UNK> usual cinematographic skills let him down with much dreary camera work
<START> this adorable dog called various names during the film is seemingly loved by the whole town but he's alone he is friends with two children cindy and paul played astonishingly bad but their father won't let them have a dog then <UNK> meets <UNK> another adorable dog they instantly fall in love and it leads to a hysterical montage of the two of them <UNK> in the grass drinking from a <UNK> in slow motion no less also <UNK> lives in the <UNK> abandoned house i've ever seen then the two kids are kidnapped by the most inept <UNK> <UNK> i've ever seen and wouldn't you know it they hide the <UNK> in the exact house <UNK> lives in br br wow was this bad a huge hit for some reason in 1974 which led to many sequels which i will not see the film is just terribly acted with humor so unfunny and badly done that you just stare at the tv in <UNK> the film also has a song that is played <UNK> during the movie so much that you want to scream it was inexplicably nominated for best song at the oscars it didn't win yeah the dogs are adorable and much better than the human actors but i need more than cute dogs to keep me interested br br you might think i'm being a little hard on a kids film but i saw it with my 5 year old nephew within 20 minutes he was bored silly and basically stopped watching i kept watching in hope that it would get better it didn't really lousy but very patient kids or dog lovers might like it br br note to parents it's g rated but a dog is <UNK> kicked a few times you don't see it you just hear it and the dog survives but this might bother real young kids
<START> i really wish i had read everyone's review before going to see the movie it was one of the most excruciating films that i've ever seen i was ready to leave the theater 5 minutes into the movie i should have followed my instinct the movie offered nothing new or clever it was boring and very cliché i was surprised to find that it was directed by a woman the characters did not represent any women that i know they were boring bitter and melodramatic the movie was unrealistic and depressing and a waste of time and money and the actors looked tired poor make up and hair <UNK> it was recently compared to the sex and in the city movie it was not even half as good my suggestion do not see this movie
<START> how would you feel if you had only a few weeks left to live this film helps you to know through the eyes of one guy who is faced with that situation it is told with sympathy and without too much emotion some might feel it rather slow but i think that adds to the realism of the film some might see it as a love story but i think that is secondary to seeing his last days through his eyes the loves of his life are part of the end of his life and give it more impact low key and gentle the film rolls out the story much as life does without clichés and with unexpected events set against a backdrop of getting by if you like your films gently emotionally realistic this may be for you
<START> i did enjoy watching <UNK> jerk around the crew in this episode though after a while the whole thing just seemed a little too long sure the <UNK> were kind of funny for a while and the ending was a pretty good way to wrap the whole thing together i think the problem was that i enjoyed seeing when he was full of <UNK> and fun the fun seemed to <UNK> when became <UNK> and nasty talk about a mood killer going from the obnoxious but <UNK> host to the guy <UNK> kirk to death but despite this the episode was enjoyable and worth my time for die hard <UNK> this is a must see for others it's just a pretty run of the mill one
<START> i saw what i believe to be the best australian film of the year so far jon <UNK> br br <UNK> is a stylish thriller with a killer premise get <UNK> and <UNK> teens discover a local serial killer in their <UNK> and then set about <UNK> him to kill the bully who <UNK> them <UNK> has picked a top notch cast including excellent new <UNK> sebastian gregory payne and <UNK> lawrence to play the teens add to that three yes thats right three great <UNK> lead by joel <UNK> in an outstanding performance of serial killer du <UNK> <UNK> his deranged <UNK> and michael as the teen <UNK> bully with <UNK> <UNK> once you add these teens and these menacing adults all hell breaks <UNK> has crafted a balls to the wall serial thriller thats damn original and accomplished you can see the influence of larry clark and david lynch's twin peaks but <UNK> makes it all his own in a <UNK> suburban back water always <UNK> with the <UNK> of <UNK> the script by <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> is tight br br if <UNK> correctly this film could be a break out hit with teens the next wolf creek it could well be it makes all the right moves the teens are real ala larry clark they don't suck and have an attached pc agenda they are non <UNK> good looking and hip the killers are dark with real menace joel <UNK> steals his scenes as the mild mannered local ted <UNK> who sports a <UNK> on his spare ala john the collector <UNK> head rapist <UNK> on the menace that tops suburban mayhem and provides a creepy thug who you can't wait to see buy the farm br br the film is fast paced tough and brutal not only that it displays a confidence and directorial <UNK> from <UNK> that is surely to win him an if or <UNK> nomination if not award its nuanced and poetic <UNK> en scene brilliant sound design excellent cinematography and tight structure mark it as clearly one of the best directed oz features i have seen so far this year br br the film leaves you <UNK> thinking and <UNK> its a truly great edition to the return to genre going on in australian cinema at present it will surely garner the interest of hollywood oh and did i mention it got into toronto what other oz feature films can say that much the world should get ready for a new auteur jon <UNK>
<START> seriously all these satan comes to earth movies always involve the <UNK> why doesn't <UNK> ever mess with the other <UNK> br br the plot is that played by former jason <UNK> kane <UNK> has a plot to become human but wasn't he always a demon by getting this young girl who is his sister pregnant with his child except maybe she isn't his sister the plot isn't clear on this and they inter <UNK> these scenes where he is seeing a shrink about his problem br br the lead girl gets pregnant while still a virgin with an incredibly creepy scene of her father giving her a <UNK> to prove her <UNK> is still intact her sister played by a washed up and looking much worse for wear denise crosby concludes that this is a sign from heaven praise be br br well the demon baby takes mom's body for a joy ride and picks off in order a truck driver her friend's boyfriend and her friend all being watched by an ex military priest whose mission is to kill the baby when it is born we discover that is actually a catholic <UNK> who is running the whole thing br br the ending is pretty much incomprehensible and if you could make it that far straight through you have a stronger stomach than i did i <UNK> the film a couple of times it was so awful

<START> francis ford <UNK> masterpiece was a great ending for a golden decade of american cinema in the 1970s there was an atmosphere of tolerance open and among the studios that allowed the making of major films by a few of the best directors that the united states has ever had i am not a <UNK> but all the events that <UNK> the decade a few being the violent deaths of major figures of the american political and cultural scenes the racial struggles the <UNK> of the 1960s counter culture the increase of violence and death in the streets seemed to influence the vision of filmmakers who were willing to dare be different and create entertaining and intelligent motion pictures <UNK> film is a strange blend of <UNK> thinking and <UNK> film making following the <UNK> of war and adventure films and at the same time <UNK> them with its flowing <UNK> on the value of life the reason of death or the <UNK> of war it is also a passionate work made against all odds <UNK> in the 1991 documentary hearts of darkness a <UNK> apocalypse a motion picture that went beyond any previous reflection on the vietnam war ever to reach the screen this may not be the definite vietnam motion picture but dealing with it coppola <UNK> the formula of classic melodrama found in two vietnam movies made simultaneously the deer hunter and coming home or in latter ones as platoon and <UNK> of war before vietnam became the starting point to make products of any genre as horror in <UNK> ladder or comedies as good morning vietnam among the more respectable coppola had the courage to take that economic and political conflict as the background of a search for answers to questions faced by any man every day of his life without <UNK> the dramatic consequences of that war
<START> frankie plays jason who is a high school student his biggest problem is his life is built on small or big lies that puts him into trouble most times however he cannot escape from his teacher and he finishes his creative writing <UNK> just before its <UNK> while he is <UNK> fast to hand his <UNK> to the teacher he <UNK> into a car as he explains the situation to grumpy man <UNK> in the car he gives him a lift to his school but the problem is jason leaves his <UNK> in the car the other way of saying this is marty wolf <UNK> steals it br br after a few months jason goes to a movie and sees a trailer that takes him <UNK> because the story of the movie is based on his <UNK> he tells that to his parents but of course they don't believe him especially his father uses words which insults him jason decides to go to la and find wolf to tell his father that jason is not a liar when wolf refuses it jason takes action and ruins his life br br this is the short story of the big fat liar well as a kids movie it might be a light hearted one but there are some errors that even could would ask if that is possible such as having such a small amount of money and going to la with a friend to sort the problem out having access to this cinema <UNK> highly <UNK> house and office setting up a <UNK> system overnight does it seem believable it does not well this is a kids movie but kids are not that <UNK> br br big fat liar offers some little pleasure to its target audience unfortunately i am not a big fat liar to say that this is a good movie out of
<START> first of all i'd like to say that this movie is the greatest thing that ever happened to mankind it is the best out of all the excellent muppet movies and every other movie out there so boo ya for jim <UNK> br br this movie is the first of all the muppet movies and the best boo ya it's about a frog <UNK> who tries to make to hollywood along with the awesome friends he meets on the way comes a couple of the greatest songs ever made that are bound to become classics including the <UNK> connection br br in conclusion i would like to say that watching this movie was the greatest thing ever if you <UNK> already seen it then get off your computer and get you to your nearest video store if they don't have the muppet movie i'd sue them big time
<START> <UNK> sucks it sucks hard it's about this awful country singer attempting comedy they might as well call this show generic because that's what it is it's dumb and generic <UNK> you're not funny and i'm glad your retarded show was cancelled because you suck and so does <UNK> barbra jean the red headed teenager that <UNK> guy and the 12 year old who got knocked up you all suck and none of you are funny oh and i heard a <UNK> that <UNK> is actually a gay devil who <UNK> hitler and <UNK> animals and she puts <UNK> messages on her show and in her music in hopes to make children kill their parents and kill themselves but it was just a <UNK> anyway this is the worst show ever <UNK> is gay i do not like her i think the office is better than this show and this show sucks
<START> this film is a <UNK> a series of <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> woven together by music it's very much a <UNK> film because of the <UNK> of spoken dialogue and what dialogue there is is not important to the structure of the narrative some might expect a national <UNK> tale of customs dress and music or a plot line <UNK> a few central characters don't look for that here br br this is because it paints a portrait of a family of peoples rather than telling a story of individuals the plot is the story through space india to <UNK> and or time we cannot tell of a people there is no need of narration you get a sense of a <UNK> people strongly linked in small <UNK> where social interaction is very important and a great sense of sadness in parts at their <UNK> by society at large br br so it's a <UNK> to <UNK> culture very beautifully shot with a wide spectrum of <UNK> music and a <UNK> in the tail which is the <UNK> these people have faced and still face
<START> this movie is a definitive 5 i finally caught it on hbo the other night i remember when it came out in theatres telling a friend that it would never be a hit because americans didn't want movies about history especially movies that were more about ideas than action i don't know if that was the reason didn't do well but now having finally seen it i can add a few observations of my own br br first while dwight <UNK> has been fine in star trek and the a team as the lead in this movie he is off putting i kept expecting him to shout out jon <UNK> like i am act ing he <UNK> and tone of voice sounded like he was trying very had to be an act or on a stage where he had to emphasize strangely various words and phrases br br second i enjoyed the sly <UNK> of paul <UNK> character as a <UNK> who at every turn <UNK> to herd these cats the scientists along to get to his goal br br third there was some discussion of the moral <UNK> of creating the a bomb and whether the us should use it probably not enough of this or as in depth as <UNK> br br finally there seemed to be an awful lot of twists thrown in for dramatic effect i don't know how much of the events in this movie are true to life but things like having the test bomb slip in its chains or having a lab accident caused by a <UNK> coffee cup and a scientist killed as a result were <UNK> the <UNK> of believability maybe that stuff or events that were similar really happened but it sure felt like various scenes were added solely for dramatic effect which <UNK> the whole tone and purpose of the movie br br was ok i need to read more about the actual events to know if it was over the top or just mostly accurate
<START> <UNK> and are back but the magic of the first film has <UNK> the story line is just awful i mean really south african <UNK> <UNK> the mythical into the u s it's just painful and the accents are absolutely abysmal can no one get an <UNK> south african accent right or will we forever hear the british or americans making them sound like drunken <UNK> the only guy who got the <UNK> accent right was tim robbins in catch a fire another thing about this movie that i disliked was when danny glover so <UNK> describes an <UNK> accent as being <UNK> i mean what a slap in the face to the <UNK> there's also enough <UNK> in this film to make me vomit i mean mel <UNK> character is like so against the <UNK> but then sleeps with their p a type don't waste your time watching this rubbish non <UNK> film if you want to see a film that doesn't completely insult a cultural group then rent die hard 2
<START> <UNK> horror outing has an innocent teen meg <UNK> appealing as always attempting to get in good with the popular <UNK> at school despite the fact they seem to hate her outright and letting herself be subjected to their <UNK> like <UNK> spending the night in a creepy <UNK> despite the complete absence of originality this low budget thriller manages to come up with some decent special effects and has several good performances particularly by robin evans <UNK> campy <UNK> as the leader of the girls the script isn't razor sharp but it has enough quirks to make the proceedings somewhat bearable from
<START> if you are one of those people that think lucio fulci is all about gore guts and zombies you have to watch this and the psychic too for that matter even though the film does include some quite brutal scenes of violence and a unsettling subject matter it's not the main thing here this is a truly impressive story and character driven murder mystery that might well be the director's masterpiece here he proves that he's a real <UNK> creating a memorable disturbing yet strikingly beautiful masterpiece filled with creepy catholic imagery and interesting social commentary it also has a great cast including the gorgeous barbara <UNK> as well as <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> and irene <UNK> in a small but important role still it is brazilian actress <UNK> <UNK> who also <UNK> in <UNK> bizarre lizard in a woman's skin who steals the scene in the role of giving an excellent performance of a woman driven insane by her <UNK> and her vicious murder scene is particularly heartbreaking the second star of the movie is sergio cinematography who along with the <UNK> <UNK> esquire score by <UNK> <UNK> help bringing the secluded italian village with a dark secret setting to life i have to admit thought that the <UNK> head hitting the rocks kind of pulled me off but nonetheless this is a definite italian horror classic a moving sad and ultimately thought provoking work of genius 10 10 for me if you liked this one i recommend watching alfred alice sweet alice as they are somewhat similar and are both underrated gems
<START> this may be all you need to know in order to decide whether you want to see this br br the movie is bad really really bad and sometimes it seems to be aware of that and make fun of how bad it is it <UNK> cliche after cliche and even manages to grow worse as it goes along with some moments that are bad enough to be hilariously funny br br if you can laugh about really poor quality in script writing and production values you might enjoy it otherwise prepare for some serious brain damage br br 3 10
<START> i saw this film one midnight and i can say that it worse than other horror film about a haunted house alexandra paul is not one of the best actress but she can do the role better the little girl get worse this is a example about a bad actress she has not got future in the great world of films sentence for house of the damned bad
<START> it's hard for me to explain this show to my grown friends i have a bunch of <UNK> in the back yard which i lovingly call my chuckle <UNK> my friends laugh at me and look at me like i have 2 heads it would be great to see this series on dvd for us folks who remember it <UNK> with our other childhood memories or to show our friends that there really was a chuckle <UNK> where kids tv today is <UNK> of violent cartoons characters who do magic or a talking <UNK> who lives in a <UNK> under the sea the magic garden was real in the respect that it taught us good values br br i will hold fond memories of carole and paula and the chuckle <UNK>
<START> showtime is a mess but it's an entertaining mess the plot is forgettable the satire is lightweight and the action sequences though well staged aren't that exciting but i laughed a lot credit goes to the inspired pairing of de niro and murphy they have great chemistry murphy delivers the one liners de niro cracks us up with a look or <UNK> this movie will get a rush hour like reception from the critics don't listen to them if you're a fan of de niro or murphy you're going to enjoy this movie
<START> do the following get a copy of this movie and a friend <UNK> the friend 10 that they can't sit through this entire movie they cannot <UNK> their <UNK> or be distracted by anything now watch your friend win or lose you get 10 of entertainment br br it <UNK> me to no end when people see a movie and are quick to give it 1 out of 10 or sum up their thoughts with it sucked and when asked why they respond just because <UNK> that is why this movie exists it's sole purpose is for me to say there this is a horrible movie that is 1 out of 10 br br this movie is absolutely appalling br br while the recent trend of movie parodies has forced them to become increasingly formulaic this movie falls short in every single aspect it's not funny it's not entertaining and for some of the parodies it's completely inaccurate horrible acting unfunny dialogue a witless story terrible special effects one inane gag after another and to make matters even worse there isn't even gratuitous nudity to somehow make it even <UNK> worthwhile br br this movie leaps past idiotic stumbles over stupid and lands face first on moronic even i who loves a good check your brain at the door movie found myself physically <UNK> watching this this movie isn't even hard ticket to hawaii so terrible it's good bad it's just bad br br note i actually challenged a friend to watch this as described above not only couldn't he make it all the way through but he had a headache and needed a couple minutes afterward because he felt a little ill true story br br i could not <UNK> this rating any more a <UNK> 1 out of 10
<START> <UNK> the bourne identity is one of my all time favorite movies however many fans of the book have complained that the movie had very little to do with the <UNK> plot br br the assignment is the real deal it's odd that no one on the bourne identity threads has mentioned this movie at all well i did br br besides the excellent plot i personally found this movie to be as good as any espionage movie i've ever seen with the possible exception of the bourne br br identity itself br br the action is all completely realistic i especially liked the <UNK> training <UNK> which was very inventive br br the feel is dark and gritty there are a few surprising plot twists the acting is excellent br br if you like this genre i cannot recommend this movie highly enough
<START> another well done moral ambiguity pieces where the anti hero makes it hard to decide who to root for br br if nothing else the <UNK> <UNK> anyone who said there were no good parts for actresses in movies at least in 1971 there were four excellent parts for actresses in this film and all were well cast and well executed br br <UNK> <UNK> did a fine job as amy and would go on to play <UNK> june this must have been the first time an adult male box office star shared an extended kiss with a twelve year old girl on camera wonder if there was much controversy about this at the time it was probably <UNK> favorite scene given the fate of <UNK> turtle randolph it is no surprise that <UNK> grew up to be a hardcore animal rights <UNK> br br <UNK> page was likewise excellent playing a complex character with just the right amount of restraint it is interesting that she died just three days after elizabeth <UNK> committed suicide throwing herself through a fifth floor window as they had also worked together in you're a big boy now br br <UNK> who looks like she could be blair <UNK> sister was wonderful as <UNK> and should have gotten an oscar no other performance was even close that year but given what we now know about her you wonder just how much of her performance was a studied effort and how much just came from inside her <UNK> shows such raw pain it is difficult to watch like marilyn <UNK> incredible performance in the <UNK> the viewer is probably seeing a whole lot of her own demons in the character she is playing br br finally there is jo ann harris who is stunningly perfect as the <UNK> carol for my money harris was the <UNK> actress of the 1970's combining <UNK> with intelligence and humor she was the best reason to watch the most wanted television series and the only reason to watch wild wild west <UNK> hard to believe that someone who could bring all that to the screen never became a big star
<START> this is a catastrophe movie set in london starting multiple <UNK> and <UNK> on scotland are <UNK> towards east <UNK> england coast and later the south after several hours of heavy the london <UNK> above <UNK> is short from running over and it <UNK> the way for disaster then a <UNK> <UNK> wave travel relentless down east causing <UNK> and lives of millions of <UNK> are in danger at the center of the story is a tom a who tries to save london from the effects of giant wave trying to convince the authorities that the town <UNK> was <UNK> furthermore a marine engineer robert <UNK> and his ex wife samantha they are trapped into the <UNK> and dropped to sea meantime the secret government agency <UNK> ruled by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> under direct orders of deputy minister david <UNK> attempt to control many <UNK> and avoid more dead approximately 200 000 they have a little time to save london from total catastrophe br br perfectly acceptable drama disaster with alright acting magnificent tom as a who <UNK> catastrophe and excellent robert <UNK> and as ex <UNK> <UNK> their love the movie packs impressive <UNK> scenes brought to life by the breathtaking computer <UNK> special effects better than the classic of the 70s such as <UNK> and similarly to and day after <UNK> although isn't a clear <UNK> we know that the <UNK> is caused by the <UNK> effect and global warming which <UNK> the <UNK> hole the motion picture is well directed by tony mitchell i would recommend this movie to people who like disaster movies another adaptations about <UNK> are the following 1976 by earl <UNK> with robert <UNK> and barbara <UNK> rain 1998 ' directed by <UNK> with morgan freeman and christian slater ' <UNK> a <UNK> rampage 1979 ' directed by bruce <UNK> with richard thomas
<START> if you want to see how to ruin a film study this one very closely in fact it is so bad that people should buy it for that reason alone especially note how most of the scenes look as if they were knocked up in about 5 minutes realism escapes this movie on every level the overall impression is that someone was given a below average script wannabe actors an average director and absolutely no budget whatsoever with a formula like that it just had to be doomed br br i rented this once and i swear i got <UNK> watching it if you are a <UNK> buy this horrible horrible movie and burn it <UNK> as a favor to the world it has no discernible plot bad acting and then <UNK> in something about evil ugly women just to really cap the whole thing off i would suggest watching paint dry before this stupid waste of a tape seriously the paint would be better i wish i could give this negative 10 stars
<START> this movie is a laugh and a half from the first scene where we have an appearance of mel <UNK> as a big bad <UNK> <UNK> stud <UNK> gang leader and that's a giggle fest in itself to the final image of <UNK> van <UNK> now a <UNK> <UNK> teen <UNK> out of the prison <UNK> loving girl's home run by iron <UNK> nuns you can't stop shaking your head the cast of this movie is a cheesy list from mel and <UNK> to the talentless paul <UNK> all i wanted through most of this movie was for him to just stop singing and the king of forty year old teens dick gloria <UNK> playing a <UNK> teen girl with more than a few chops <UNK> not acting i last saw in the horrible <UNK> 50's romp <UNK> woman with a <UNK> so bad it looked like a dead <UNK> that had been <UNK> by a mac truck br br <UNK> is a bad bad girl she <UNK> <UNK> runs wild hits teachers and runs around with gang leaders she <UNK> her idiot <UNK> driving boyfriend chip who we see in the first scene trying to rape a blonde girl before he falls off a cliff nice guy and proceeds to take up with dick instead whether this is a step up for her is <UNK> guess mel shows up at a party she's at with her new beau and <UNK> her of pushing the nasty chip off the cliff while i'm sure that she would have liked to she wasn't there a stupid fight scene between and his gang and mel and his jazz freaks ensues with some hilariously bad moves on both sides br br <UNK> ends up being sent to girls town a <UNK> school <UNK> loving home for <UNK> girls run by sister iron pants and her fellow sisters of <UNK> she <UNK> the nuns and us by <UNK> <UNK> off <UNK> one liners and just generally showing how bad she is she quickly runs into gloria <UNK> playing one of the <UNK> girls who gives her a chop so that she knows her place she meets a limp <UNK> of a girl who's obsessed with paul character why this little <UNK> becomes her br br there's a long bit of movie where nothing much happens except st paul of <UNK> keeps showing up and proving how <UNK> he is he sings way too much in this <UNK> until you want to <UNK> him in his huge to just make him be quiet and little sister played by princess of father <UNK> best fame calls her to tell her she's in trouble turns out it was <UNK> who went out with the and now <UNK> <UNK> her because he found out the girls all break out to go save her with a hysterical fight scene between the girls and mel and his boys this is after a race between mel and dick that is just so stupid that it <UNK> the mind the <UNK> teenagers in this corny movie have a fabulous good time <UNK> through what is basically a silly badly written and morally preachy film that <UNK> none if its aims unless its aim was to make you laugh out loud
<START> love sublime says the title another <UNK> during the <UNK> of the film talked about inner vs <UNK> beauty well in this case the beauty you decide inner or <UNK> is provided by scantily clad or is that scantily dressed <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who the director raj kapoor called a <UNK> of talent while the film was being made one can't <UNK> him of sarcasm of course after all he was promoting his own film br br the paper thin plot is about a woman with a <UNK> face who has a er well <UNK> body a great voice thanks to <UNK> <UNK> with whom the hero <UNK> kapoor falls in love he doesn't want her face only her voice the acting is desperate and even the 4 is because of the music with <UNK> <UNK> giving some good numbers the rest is of course <UNK> avoid save your money inner beauty vs outer beauty you need not be an einstein to figure out which one the director was <UNK> on
<START> the concept show 4 families of diverse <UNK> in the <UNK> district of l a preparing for the family get together at <UNK> i loved soul food and how to make an american <UNK> i think there's a law that <UNK> <UNK> has to be in all these movies which similarly offered a <UNK> of family traditions and was prepared for a treat instead i felt tricked they <UNK> out about 40 characters and all but two are one note cliches with no <UNK> whatsoever the writers and director should spend a few more years learning about life and learn how loving people of different generations actually do relate instead you have a bunch of a holes getting together on turkey day to act like extra obnoxious a holes now to an extent this is what <UNK> is all about but not this <UNK> and why bother having <UNK> then giving her absolutely nothing to do this was a chore to get through and <UNK> <UNK> is a standout but i give it a 4 10
<START> this is a very well written movie full of suspense right up to the end the setting is beautiful in contrast to the frightening action taking place there it is not your typical suspense movie but a movie well packed with interesting twists and surprises which leave you wanting and hoping for a sequel i recommend this film to all suspense lovers
<START> i just wish i was <UNK> enough to say how good this movie is br br i it's hard to say br br maybe i'll just say what comes to mind br br i laughed i really laughed i couldn't believe it i laughed and it wasn't bitter laughter it wasn't cynical laughter it was the laughter that is generated by genuine joy br br joy that's a foreign word for me i don't feel that word often but i did while watching this movie br br will maybe it's <UNK> face he is a great human being smile on my face and there's a <UNK> in my eye that line in one of <UNK> songs describes him perfectly he has <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> is a lucky lucky boy to have a daddy like will <UNK> is a lucky lucky woman to have a husband like will he is someone special br br happy i actually feel happy it's a strange feeling i don't feel this way very often it's just so nice to see to see other people really happy i mean really happy in this movie i did as will says in the movie maybe i'm not happy with just maybe i want you know watching this movie made me think so do i br br fun being yourself we all know we're supposed to be ourselves but it feels like we're <UNK> if we do so maybe it has to be earned maybe it's something that we show after having not been ourselves for a long time that's why i just loved the ending will eva <UNK> kevin james <UNK> julie ann <UNK> all dancing at the wedding dancing without <UNK> no they we're not drunk except on actually being happy i can understand that at least i think i can at least i enjoyed seeing them happy really happy br br women and men i don't know anything about relationships but i do feel watching this movie i feel like connecting with someone <UNK> pushing wanting to be with someone it seems to make life something else entirely i don't really know i'm just guessing but i felt something watching this movie i felt like that connection must be must make life worthwhile br br that's the kind of movie this is it's funny it's clever it's tender it evokes feeling it made me think that maybe just maybe life is truly is a wonderful thing br br want to laugh want to feel really good want to get some answers about girls and girls answers about guys watch <UNK> you will get it all br br go will you are a great human being
<START> warning this could spoil your movie watch it see if you agree br br to think that we as humans can not learn from the past the futuristic society portrayed <UNK> what hitler believed <UNK> a race of people in this case men for the benefit of society it made me sick to my stomach also the <UNK> of a y bomb is insane even in war our instinct for self <UNK> will prevent the <UNK> of humanity we made mistakes in the past ie japan <UNK> and <UNK> in <UNK> but because of that we avoided a bigger mistake in <UNK> during the cuban missile crisis
<START> i should know better i've seen too many of rob <UNK> early work to expect anything good from this movie even if it is about hockey br br here we have yet again another tired sports theme kid has potential for greatness has the apparent to go far if his cocky attitude doesn't screw things up and boom he comes out of it as that <UNK> player kind of champion is that all that can be said of sports movies surely there must be other <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> br br nonetheless this movie has got to be one of the biggest everybody's interactions are just downright silly and not in a stupid funny kind of manner and i can't think of any <UNK> qualities that could <UNK> my position not the actors certainly not <UNK> who plays <UNK> reluctant mentor not the story not the music and very little from the <UNK> sequences br br normally i'm a sucker for 80s movies even if they do tend to be a little <UNK> i e north shore the karate kid but this doesn't even make for good 80s trash for a good 80s sports movie check elsewhere there's plenty of them out there
<START> probably because this is <UNK> first film in color the colors look different specially in the <UNK> scenes they seem to be stronger <UNK> and the result is a bit unrealistic but very pleasing randolph scott is the sheriff a good guy but the real star of the movie is a very young glenn ford who is an outlaw that wants to change evelyn <UNK> is the woman that starts falling for ford and claire <UNK> is the <UNK> that runs the saloon there is a funny character called <UNK> that does not think twice before blowing it i particularly enjoyed two moments of the film one when there is a tremendous horse <UNK> and you see thousands of horses there was no computer to help at that time so i presume they must have gathered all those horses no easy task another moment is the final shootout technically very good there is also quite a <UNK> seeing this western made in 1943 with such great action scenes makes you come to a sad conclusion they don't make them anymore would they be able to in case they wanted i have my doubts
<START> <UNK> has gone down the toilet they have kids saying things like oh my god and we're screwed br br this show <UNK> hate for people who aren't good looking or aren't in the in crowd it say that sexual <UNK> is alright by having girls <UNK> over <UNK> boys not to mention the overweight boy who takes off his shirt the main characters basically <UNK> anyone out of the ordinary friend sam who may be a lesbian beats the <UNK> out of anybody that crosses her path which says it's alright to be a b <UNK> this show has so much <UNK> in it that nobody should watch it i give it a 0 out of 10
<START> in a quiet town a couple of girls witness the murder of one of their friends to a strange young boy named milo who lives on the other side of town after the murder his body is found in a river and his <UNK> dead so sixteen years later a <UNK> draws the girls back to their childhood town and claire a school teacher becomes obsessed that milo hasn't died as she has recurring visions of him and her friends are dying one by one and no one believes her when she claims milo is apart of it so now she sets off to find out the horrifying truth br br when i came across this film i was pretty <UNK> about it especially when it had from the creators of <UNK> on the front cover but reading the odd little plot outline on the back of the video case it sounded alright and rather refreshing for a change well guess what i thought it was a good idea at the time but it was a totally different story when it came to watching the film it just seemed to try to hard to be smart and very psychological based but that latter element didn't come off that well for me and it was basically a prolonged and mostly unconvincing thriller hey i'll admit it had its moments but hardly enough to make it neither effectively chilling or memorable but a bravo to the filmmakers at least the story isn't a rehash of those slasher <UNK> that followed scream and shock horror there's no self <UNK> humour actually there isn't even a hint of humour although maybe it was too serious especially since the plot is rather absurd but that's not its main problem what a disjointed plot we get i didn't know about to much that was going on as it seems to <UNK> a lot stuff in favour for some supposedly shocking and disturbing sequences no more like irrelevant scenes and yawn inducing clichés that we see from time to time also you can see some influences from some good 70's horror films one being don't look now this when our main character keeps on seeing the figure of her past in a <UNK> the other would have to be one of my favourites alice sweet alice with the person causing the trouble wearing a yellow <UNK> and committing grisly deaths interesting idea but it comes across quite shallow and too many faults pop up i liked it more when the scenes dealt with the character's childhood as the performances and circumstances had something creepy about it but when it <UNK> into their <UNK> its tired and <UNK> for most part and the performances weren't awful but incredibly mundane and hardly involving is a good way of putting it most of the dialogue had me <UNK> in disbelief at how contrived and awkward it was you'll be yelling no duh at the screen because you just can't believe what you're hearing the police detective gets the <UNK> of it br br quality wise the film isn't bad actually it's better then your usual straight to video i would say very slick stuff with some inventive and prominent camera angles and a faint score that works reasonably well another factor that stood out and was a key to building on the moody atmosphere was the <UNK> sound effects and that <UNK> bell does leave a <UNK> sensation in your ears the setting of a quiet <UNK> school was well done and rest of the action takes place in a house but just don't be expecting any real suspense or surprises as the execution of these are non existent the deaths aren't pleasant and they're mildly bloody and it's more the aftermath to what happens to these bodies which tries to <UNK> you the villain in this piece the mean spirited child milo was mildly unnerving well that voice and yellow <UNK> does make an <UNK> to begin with but it does seem to lose its effect when we come to the films conclusion the cheesy tag lines on the video compare him to move over jason watch out freddy and this isn't child's play <UNK> but you got to be kidding me right he's <UNK> the new face of evil yeah sure all he needs is to be taught some manners and problem solved overall the film just left me with a sour taste as i've could've gone without seeing it i probably wished i did br br just don't expect too much in this <UNK> of a film or even better just skip it as you won't be missing out on much really
<START> i'm glad cage changed his name from and got this part on his own light hearted no deep thought needed but a cute piece about <UNK> <UNK> though her parents are still hippies captures the voice of the early 80's the <UNK> of the valley and the <UNK> of the other side one can see the beginning of <UNK> talent
<START> this movie is ridiculous it's attempting to be a comedy but the screenplay is horrible the whole movie is done in low light and you cant grasp the fact that it's a comedy truly is bad cinematography you really have to sit there and watch it to realize there's a few jokes here and there going on but either way they're all inside jokes amongst themselves this is more like a wannabe drama flick that went bad it really is a very pointless movie their expressions reveal nothing but <UNK> and disaster which turns out that way anyway unless you want to be bored out of your ass i suggest you stay away from this gag of a movie
<START> ok the very idea is ludicrous br br 1 kids don't own planes 2 kids don't race planes with 3 it made the air force look like total idiots 4 the kids father would not <UNK> his entire career to allow his boy to <UNK> with him 5 neither would a <UNK> colonel br br the sequels i am sure were worse than this tripe the soundtrack is about the only redeeming quality of this waste of celluloid i am sorry but i just don't understand why in the world anyone would write direct and produce such junk the iranian air force is lucky to a couple parts for an <UNK> f 14 and this kid <UNK> not 1 but 2 fully loaded and <UNK> f <UNK> <UNK> a break
<START> <UNK> was a german made movie and subtitled it was also overlong and boring if it was supposed to be a horror movie it failed miserably for me the actors went through their <UNK> looking more like they wanted to be some where else the film work was ok but more attention should have been applied to the awful banal script i paid nothing to see the video and i still feel cheated go read a book and save your money
<START> directed by diane keaton and adapted from a book by <UNK> <UNK> a young mother <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is battling a very serious illness and her self <UNK> <UNK> husband sid john is a little lacking in the emotions department unhappy with the new home situation their sensitive son steven nathan <UNK> decides he wants to stay with his two eccentric <UNK> danny michael richards and <UNK> lou until his mom is well steven seems to be happier and even takes interest in his strange <UNK> living <UNK> he even decides he wants to change his name to <UNK> set in the early 60's this drama is a bit comedic change that to zany not being a <UNK> fan <UNK> heroes <UNK> my attitude albeit i enjoyed the film and it is not a total waste
<START> for all <UNK> and purposes showtime was the worst movie i have ever seen br br why because having deniro in the cast adds immediate credibility and makes you want to watch the movie i had also made the mistake of watching 48 hours and beverly hills cop recently before seeing showtime and for some strange reason thought eddie murphy was still funny well he's not in fact it almost seems like he has been <UNK> as i watched this movie i was in <UNK> that deniro decided this was a good enough script to lend his name too no chemistry between him and murphy whatsoever horrible writing horrible jokes a movie that you think is supposed to be good can't get much worse than this not too long after sitting through the <UNK> that was showtime i happened to watch national security starring martin lawrence the movie had its funny parts but wasn't that great but still it was 20 times better than showtime please if your a deniro fan do not watch this movie
<START> in complete contrast to the previous <UNK> here i thought <UNK> as it was billed when shown with english subtitles here in london at the german film festival in november 2007 was very funny very well acted and excellently scripted br br it's quite <UNK> to design a 100 minute film that consists exclusively and relentlessly of talking heads but i think <UNK> succeeded with wit and <UNK> no standard <UNK> devices of say following a character's soul <UNK> <UNK> with some <UNK> minor seventh <UNK> music and long shot nature <UNK> but when someone said something that revealed their souls well we were <UNK> on by the man with the <UNK> for yet another superficial introduction which is of course the point the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> where everything is down to a quick question and answer br br maybe most films are so clichéd and stupid that we english are ready to laugh at any vaguely intelligent and cinema but i can promise you that at the screening tonight cinema sun 25 <UNK> 2007 the full audience with laughter most of the way through so i wasn't the only one <UNK> br br my girlfriend who speaks german and has lived in <UNK> thought it was hilarious i who don't speak german and have not been to <UNK> i think thought it was hilarious i'd recommend <UNK> to anyone especially couples looking for a smart witty original wise film about the <UNK> of modern relationships and the <UNK> of the generation who feel they've missed out on the happy ever after stuff first time round br br <UNK> in the english subtitled showing in london the subtitles which were very good were shown completely underneath the slightly reduced picture not inside it i thought this was a good thing
<START> what to say about a movie like rock star a lot actually this is the type of movie that is almost <UNK> made for the critics to slam it is also a movie i as a major hard rock fan enjoyed no loved actually while all the while being very <UNK> aware of its many flaws and that the movie while a decent effort in some respects missed the chance it had to escape into greatness and become a rock movie classic oh well br br i loved this movie and would see it again and again but i know that's purely based on my own personal tastes rock star is a movie that will appeal to anyone who has experienced elements of the rock or hard rock lifestyle and wants to go down the road to nostalgia it was a great time for metal heads and it's nice to have a movie that effectively captures that long forgot by many non rock fans time effectively as i think that rock star has done that is one of the film's strengths the concert footage you will feel like your right there with them and how could any hard rock fan not love that as far as setting the atmosphere rock star gets a 10 of 10 it also gets a 10 of 10 for pure entertainment if you want a movie to just let yourself go and free flow into some great memories of good times past then this is the movie for you it is also the reason why i loved this movie so br br but it isn't a great movie i understand that and were it my actual job to review movies <UNK> i'd probably have to be a bit hard on this one the problem with rock star is the character development br br what is wrong with the character development is this there isn't any none the movie has certain scenes few and far between but they are there that do touch on greatness warning brief scene spoilers 3 examples 1 when <UNK> makes his debut on stage including the fall he takes br br 2 the first after show party with emily <UNK> and <UNK> br br 3 a little in the beginning when the original lead singer is casually <UNK> fired the whole business as usual tone sets the stage for what's to come it's played very effectively br br but the problem is nothing ever does come there is little to no character development of anyone in this movie <UNK> <UNK> are merely touched on but never fully explored i don't think that's the fault of the actors actresses particularly <UNK> who tries hard they just are not given much to work with it's just that the script was weak and lacked the ability to go beyond the formula feel into true movie depth rock star was so <UNK> at times including towards the end it was almost ridiculous and though those scenes i mentioned were outstanding and very believable sadly much else in the movie wasn't br br another reviewer mentioned the lack of <UNK> towards the end and i agree but there was actually a lack of <UNK> about anything why does <UNK> leave at the end because he misses his girlfriend and the band won't let him write songs it <UNK> the limits of believability and frankly the end was just corny made no sense and had no reality to it at all br br watching this it's almost like watching a movie where the makers of it said ok this happens here and then this happens and then this etc etc etc by the end it's no longer a movie about a boy who's dream came true it's just another <UNK> <UNK> love story and you wonder why so much detail is left out br br i hope i'm not being to hard on rock star because i truly loved it but not for the right reasons i would have liked to love this as a great movie about the <UNK> and <UNK> of rock fame instead i loved it for it's 80's period feel the clothes the hair the lights the life although many others loved it to i suspect most are people who lived the life of a rock fan like i did or some who play i'd have liked to see the movie cross over and just be respected for being a good well told movie instead of a cliché i think one of the problems was the length i myself hate over long films but this was one that really should have been longer if a movie is done really right the length is not even felt there is just to much to the story for it to be as short as it was that's one reason why there doesn't seem to be much development of either the story or the human beings portrayed in the movie br br so to wind down this is a movie you can greatly get into but not a great movie see it for fun see it for entertainment see it to go back to that great great space in time when metal wasn't just a part of life it was life and for those non rock fans see it to get a little glimpse into a life that meant and still means so much to so many of us
<START> this movie should have easily <UNK> as a film br br that best <UNK> human understanding among people br br it may be rather annoying to even try to comprehend that a young jewish southern girl could would give shelter to an escaped german prisoner of war br br <UNK> depicts an amazing portrait of the unhappy young girl <UNK> for acceptance and love michael <UNK> gave a remarkable performance as her difficult father and esther <UNK> as the maid ruth gave a superb emmy winning performance as an understanding maid caught up with these events br br bruce <UNK> portrays the german who is supposedly not guilty of nazi atrocities this is how his role appears he has escaped but he joined the german army and he might have been a member of the hitler youth movement br br the action takes place in 1944 georgia in a rural area the <UNK> are filled with prejudice even the fbi inspector acts as if he would like to get something on the jews notice the opposite interpretation that as is in bed <UNK> is hunted down and ultimately shot it is interesting to see that society views as a <UNK> for <UNK> an escaped prisoner of war the film also deals with an extremely complex relationship that exists between father and daughter <UNK> at his daughter at the end is some acting as the mother barbara <UNK> is given little to do it was annoying that she is stereotyped as the typical jewish mother with that loud <UNK> of <UNK> on her lips br br <UNK> done and well worth viewing
<START> what a fine film unfortunately being <UNK> the movie script couldn't have followed the book from which it was adapted but the murder of a homosexual would have been too hot to handle in that era br br i thought all of the performances were outstanding as well as the script direction brilliant black and white cinematography music and film noir atmosphere br br i do understand that in <UNK> the film couldn't portray racism against blacks or prejudice against <UNK> robert <UNK> account of prejudice against his grandfather who was irish and who endured this racism 100 years ago was pretty lame but the times <UNK> that the film avoid a further examination of racism br br i do have one observation and one question to ask the viewer 1 did you notice that robert young didn't aim his gun when he shot and killed robert ryan who was running fast in the dark and young shot from an upper story window into the dark without aiming 2 if robert <UNK> grandfather was killed 100 years ago in <UNK> the film was made in <UNK> and young was 40 years old the time line would not be logical if the grandfather had been killed 50 years ago then the time frame would be realistic
<START> this was charlie <UNK> first all talking film yes there had been a little bit of sound and speaking inserted into his previous film modern times but it was still essentially a silent film so it wasn't until 1940 that the public got to hear chaplin speak on film br br the movie is incredibly famous and has a stellar reputation while i enjoyed the film i was not nearly as impressed by this as <UNK> other full length films of the mid <UNK> and 30s that's because i really felt annoyed by some of <UNK> dopey over acting when he played especially when he was giving his speeches the silly pseudo dialog just seemed akin to something a lesser comedian would have used such as the three stooges plus playing a funny hitler is hard for me to take br br however when chaplin played the jewish <UNK> he wasn't especially funny he really wasn't intended to be a funny character but he was a tremendous voice for reason and decency this film should not be remembered as a comedy especially since it doesn't really <UNK> there but for its excellent acting and humanity the final speech by the <UNK> <UNK> is brilliant and almost brought tears to my eyes watch the film for this reason alone
<START> this movie has everything going for it fully developed characters a realistic portrayal of working washington <UNK> in warmth and humor that is uniquely albert brooks the <UNK> down of network news is even more of an issue now than it was in 1987 remember this was pre cable so satisfying to care about complex people attempting to achieve complex goals and it all moves along with lightning speed such a true to life depiction of friendships that <UNK> toward romance see if you can spot john cusack as the angry <UNK> and do you recognize peter from real life broadcast news finally if you're from <UNK> see if you agree with holly <UNK> directions to cab drivers
<START> this show was incredible i've seen all three and this is the best this movie has suspense a bit of romance stunts that will blow your mind go <UNK> great characters and amazing locations where was this filmed will there be more i really liked the story line with her brother looking forward to <UNK> 4 and to see how the world is saved yet again
<START> a man kicks a dog <UNK> in the air br br a woman kicks a cow out of her bed br br a man kicks a <UNK> down the sidewalk br br a woman sucks on a <UNK> toe for 15 seconds br br a man kicks a blind man in the stomach br br jesus rapes a young girl br br there you have it i just saved you an hour of your life surely there are those to whom this shocking <UNK> of cinematic expression would appeal but i found it no different from the <UNK> <UNK> videos i used to shoot with my friends in the <UNK> grade except we never had a real cow br br having heard endless <UNK> from beard <UNK> art of how this is such an important film i thought it would be worth my time make no mistake this is crap if i hear one more person call <UNK> the father of cinematic <UNK> i think i'm going to punch someone if anything he <UNK> a major step <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by his <UNK> fritz lang metropolis f w <UNK> <UNK> and robert <UNK> 10 years earlier this made a joke out of the whole thing as if <UNK> didn't have the confidence to truly embrace the art sans sarcasm sans it would take <UNK> another 40 years before he would <UNK> his style into something admirable skip the early stuff and hop straight to 1970 if you want to be more impressed by his work br br i'm sure he would agree in 1977 <UNK> himself stated that he would happily burn all the <UNK> of his old movies in this case i would be happy to pour the lighter fluid
<START> a <UNK> of unpleasant city <UNK> <UNK> on le for a <UNK> holiday stories <UNK> characters fight make friends <UNK> each other have sex br br <UNK> has gathered together a stellar cast for his adaptation of <UNK> book but to little <UNK> what should be hilarious is instead at turns tedious and irritating all the characters are either pathetic or unpleasant or both and in the end despite the <UNK> nature of things this viewer was left caring little about what happens to any of them br br credit to the always wonderful <UNK> plus <UNK> and <UNK> but that's it and looks like he's rather overdone the <UNK> and if you ask me
<START> the screen writers for this mini series should have been sentenced to the <UNK> themselves they butchered a very fun story and <UNK> the talents of richard e grant the only thing the writers kept from the original books was the name all of the characters were totally altered and the story was not the same i strongly suggest watching another version of the scarlet <UNK> any other version is better than this one
<START> i have just watched this movie on dvd late this morning and was so disappointed that even thought it was a good joke for the audience in other words the creators <UNK> to make comedy not drama at the end i realized that mr tony was earnest about this movie it's a pity because the dialogue is ridiculous the acting is poor and lifeless the story is a <UNK> tale poor ryan <UNK> despite of his efforts his character in the movie remains probably his worst performance what to say for jason <UNK> lack of all kinds of skills to develop the role which is an imaginary fiction for this reasons i vote 3 10
<START> those two main characters and <UNK> are a <UNK> comedy act i was wondering if this is one of these typical slapstick movies where the story is either not important or simply not existing but when i saw this movie i was very happy that there is a cool story and the main characters really fit in it br br all in all very amusing and not a common german movie
<START> don't look in the basement is actually a very clever and well thought out exploitation flick that gets a bad rap because of its cheap quality and bad acting sure it's not a masterpiece by anyone's standards but it is a very fun little b film with a lot to offer and even a lot of creepy scenes that will stay in your head br br as i said the acting could have been a lot better but that's the case with most exploitation so i can't really complain the story is clever and has some great plot twists that will keep you guessing i thought the gore was a lot of fun too there's just something great about older gore films because they didn't have cgi back then so they had to actually set it all up themselves see this one for a good time
<START> in the 60's cleveland television audiences could watch a episode of flash gordon as part of the show 11 <UNK> friday this was the best material any of us in junior high had ever seen we would have regular <UNK> although we did not call them that just to get in on the fun of watching this stuff with a group of friends then the next week we would quote our favorite <UNK> lines from the latest episode br br watching it today <UNK> much the same reaction but if you can stop laughing at the dialogue the lame creatures the silly costumes and the horrible <UNK> long enough there are some good things i did not appreciate the first time through the production <UNK> built some excellent sets both the rooms and the laboratory devices charles <UNK> the <UNK> character was the all time best screen villain certainly up to that time and <UNK> better than anyone since jean rogers is <UNK> beautiful br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> do not see this film in most cases such as that of <UNK> on and the grudge the japanese film are infinitely better than the american remake however this movie was terrible the ghosts much like a trick or dressed as a sheet ghost <UNK> and in an attempt to be scary in the absence of good makeup or special effects and the acting is just horrible the story itself is inconsistent and confusing not everything is explained leaving the film to go from bad to worse do not waste your time with this movie it's not worth it and i am sure that there are more entertaining things to do like watching paint dry
<START> revenge of the zombies is a pretty weak and barely passable zombie effort br br spoilers br br traveling in the <UNK> larry adams robert <UNK> and scott hugo are informed that a friend has deceased meeting with local dr von john carradine he repeats the notion that they mysteriously died while they are staying there they realize that the help consists of zombies <UNK> dead people who are doing the <UNK> of their master as the bodies pile up he reveals that he has been making the creatures for use in various experiments and all try to stop him before it's too late br br the good news this here gets very little right the opening is easily it's best as it's got several great marks for it from where it starts with the creepy <UNK> walking in the dark all the way through to the revelations this one works wonders for both it's mystery and great imagery the big one is a really scene where the creature emerges from a coffin in a long slow and creepy shot these here are all done before the opening credits and is a fun sight the scenes in the middle where the creature <UNK> inside the coffin is pretty chilling and looks really great the last big positive is the really fun ending with the sort of ending that feels reminiscent of so many universal attempts this one fits in with that style from the creepy to the real action involved near the swamp this one is fun and really works with the others to give it's only real <UNK> br br the bad news this one here only has a couple flaws but they are major ones the first one is the film's major boredom from <UNK> almost nothing happens in here mainly due to the tendency to do everything with talking rather than anything else there's only <UNK> scenes <UNK> to the zombies yet there's nothing here that <UNK> any action to the film this one simply doesn't have any action and that's what hurts the film it rarely <UNK> a scenes that keeps the interest going and at times this makes it feel a lot longer than it really is the last flaw in the film are it's pathetic excuses for zombies those used to more modern fare will have a hard time getting any fear out of these creatures and they really only serve several scenes this here doesn't treat the zombies as <UNK> making them even less frightening little screen time <UNK> nature and un modern behavior from these zombies really destroys this one these here are what really hurt the film br br the final verdict with bad zombies and hardly anything worth watching this one here is a curious effort those used to modern zombies will find little of interest in this one and come out the same as this one is while only classic horror fans are advised to give it a shot br br today's rating pg mild violence
<START> this movie <UNK> from the bible and fell so below the bar of the 1956 movie i hate that they replaced the 2006 movie over the <UNK> seen 10 <UNK> <UNK> looked like a criminal in this movie not like the kind looking man heston in the 1956 movie i will not waste my time again watching this movie they tried so hard to <UNK> this movie in order to keep you on the edge that it was more like a soap opera and not a good one at that i'm pretty sure that younger ones out there who never paid attention to the original 10 <UNK> may disagree with me but to each his own also it took them 10 years to make the first 10 <UNK> it probably took them 2 months to make this one the special effects were not as amazing as the first one and after all these years with so much technology you would have thought they would have done better now
<START> what is wrong with also known as deadly <UNK> though what the for the name change is i have no idea can probably be summed up where a woman says to her lover br br keep it down baby i'm trying to sleep br br it's not the dialogue that's the problem or the way it's delivered it's the fact the actress has has a central european accent nothing wrong with that until it's revealed her character is from <UNK> in the united states this what struck me about this thriller while watching it the way accents don't match their characters apart from the <UNK> woman with a german accent we see a south african with an english accent a local police chief who sounds like he's an <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> officer and worst of all george c scott playing someone who's either dutch or british with an accent that sounds like it might be american <UNK> with south african you soon give up following what's on screen and end up <UNK> on what <UNK> a character might be due to the strange way they speak it's interesting to note that this site hasn't given this movie a country of origin with so many different actors from different countries you do feel that this was produced by the united nations br br even if you're not curious about accents or <UNK> you'll probably have to give up following the action anyway because is plot less things happen like a boat exploding and a hostage situation and the hero being <UNK> as an agent for south african intelligence but you're left scratching your head wondering what the heck this is all leading to i was lost
<START> this film is not really a remake of the 1949 o'brien film which is excellent it borrows the main premise a man has been <UNK> and spends the rest of the film trying to find his killer but i like that the writers chose an english professor instead of a private dick as the protagonist the plot is also quite original in general the film moves along fast enough to keep you awake but what mars this film is a strange dated quality about it probably due to the horrendous 80's original music score combined with an affected noir feel dennis quaid <UNK> inexplicably throughout the whole film at odd moments but he's still compelling in a general way meg ryan is fine as the student <UNK> love interest when the film gets sort of bad is when <UNK> the <UNK> meets the british bodyguard <UNK> and their <UNK> are pretty laughable the bodyguard works for the rich widow played by lovely charlotte <UNK> but those scenes are too self <UNK> noir to help the film along even though the family plot line is rather interesting <UNK> also keeps showing up at the same place and finding this bodyguard which is rather <UNK> in the latter part of the film a man is shot by a window and from the outside you see him jump out of it that was pretty bad direction but aside from some of these obvious flaws i think it still holds ok i certainly didn't predict the ending so that was good there is a twist and although some posters here think they were <UNK> i thought it was a fine and believable ending dennis quaid with his weird <UNK> and black eyes is more likable in the right stuff great balls of fire inner space and cold creek <UNK> but here as <UNK> he's supposed to be somewhat of a jerk so he did fine fairly decent movie
<START> the bone <UNK> is about a group <UNK> who go on a search for a missing crew of <UNK> in the desert when the find them they are nothing more than bones stripped clean and they could not have been dead for more than six hours the story keeps you interested as to what exactly caused this the characters are well enough and the acting is pretty good br br about an hour and ten minutes in when you find out what is causing the bones to be stripped clean you sigh oh that is really stupid the movie is ruined by bad writing and a non exciting ending up until that point the movie was pretty good and it is a shame that it took such a bad turn so i cannot recommend this movie i gave it a 4 10
<START> in the 1930s hal roach studios was on top of the comedy world with such stars as laurel and hardy <UNK> chase and the little <UNK> most of these films are exceptional and have <UNK> the passing of time however a lesser known roach product was the pairing of thelma todd and <UNK> <UNK> later todd was paired with the equally <UNK> <UNK> kelly try as i might i just can't stand these pictures they just aren't funny plus unlike laurel and hardy there was not an ounce of chemistry between todd and her two co stars before you just think i am a <UNK> understand that i have seen and reviewed several hundred roach films as well as many other early comedies so i am well <UNK> with the genre and within the genre this team is among the worst part of the reason i think i am right about the team is that as a lower <UNK> team at roach they were given all the scripts no one else wanted if stan or ollie hated a given plot idea it was often given to todd and <UNK> kelly and usually it showed br br in this film however the team is at their absolute lowest it's hard to imagine a comedy with less laughs and a more contrived plot the film begins with <UNK> in the jury and thelma as a defense lawyer as for <UNK> she's a completely annoying moron not the lovable type moron like stan laurel or lou <UNK> but just a totally annoying and grating person who is <UNK> and obnoxious as for thelma as usual she's the rather bland straight man and as such has little to do but react to <UNK> behavior br br the plot involves thelma defending a client who is accused of selling exploding <UNK> <UNK> considering that the <UNK> are highly dangerous when the attorney asks <UNK> to try <UNK> one it just seems dumb and while they were called <UNK> they were more like giant black <UNK> that were larger than golf balls <UNK> them only seemed contrived and made no sense even for a low brow comedy when they find she has <UNK> the <UNK> and it really is explosive everyone <UNK> and runs about like idiots until the film ends br br as i said i am not a fan of this team however even for those who want to like the film there isn't one legitimate laugh in the entire short when i talked over this review with my wife who also saw the movie with me she thought my score of 2 was overly generous
<START> how do you describe perfection in the mood for love maggie cheung and tony <UNK> practically dance on the screen and give stellar performances that stay with you hours after you've left the theatre every scene in the film <UNK> with the powerful combination of superb cinematography and shot selection top notch acting and the sensual soundtrack <UNK> king cole singing in french absolutely sets the tone for the whole movie maggie and tony look marvelous with maggie <UNK> about in some truly glorious and tony always looking <UNK> i've seen this movie several times already and <UNK> i see it i find something new to rave about love it
<START> honestly i am not that impressed by it it's not a bad movie but it's not great one either there's a story to tell but it's told in a very incoherent way which kinds of makes it loose it's full meaning and ability to intrigue this movie could of been made in another way with an outstanding result the story is just so interesting yet somehow i'm not intrigued when watching it br br it definitely isn't an amateur movie rather the opposite and some of the scenes are really emotional the actors and actresses does quite a good job and so does the director but there's just something so unfinished by the whole movie that i cant quite put my finger on perhaps if you had gotten to know the characters more all the of the movie could of been better <UNK> and put more <UNK> throughout it cause as it was it became slow from time to time
<START> the film has so much potential which was not developed mark <UNK> gives a good performance and so does bill paxton the scenery is beautiful and the aircraft are neat the problem with this film is that the story is way underdeveloped and the plot goes nowhere the film at certain points almost puts you to sleep i give it 3 out of 10 stars for the flying scenes
<START> picking this up along with the rest of the marx brothers box set i found myself disappointed by most everything beyond a night at the opera this stinker is <UNK> the worst i've seen of them so far with the clever lines left out and the characterization is <UNK> the playwright is so <UNK> stupid in this play it's hard not to tackle the television and try and <UNK> him br br as it is the seem to do better as <UNK> brought in to <UNK> havoc and are much much better when they have a good gag or two at least the material here is all obviously written for anyone and it really wastes the <UNK> talent avoid br br rating 3 10
<START> a total and absolute waste of time bad acting bad story predictable simple pathetic after a while i was only watching to see what happens since i'd already invested my time into it totally surprised mrs <UNK> played in a weak movie as this honestly just don't bother a total and absolute waste of time bad acting bad story predictable simple pathetic after a while i was only watching to see what happens since i'd already invested my time into it totally surprised mrs <UNK> played in a weak movie as this honestly just don't bother a total and absolute waste of time bad acting bad story predictable simple pathetic after a while i was only watching to see what happens since i'd already invested my time into it totally surprised mrs <UNK> played in a weak movie as this honestly just don't bother
<START> i am a huge shirley temple fan when i saw this movie it made me appreciate what a talented child shirley actually was ashley rose <UNK> made possibly the worst on screen shirley imagine an 11 year old playing shirley temple from the age of 5 that in itself is wrong but getting her to <UNK> voice and her singing is <UNK> the dancing was good i'll say that as previous users have said there was little dramatic scenes nothing to make the story interesting not even <UNK> <UNK> i would have liked to have seen more of the world wide phenomenon that shirley temple created there was too much focus on the wizard of oz when in reality shirley was just considered for dorothy the film portrays it as though it is the end of the world when she does not get the role shirley herself said that she is glad judy garland got to play her for me the star of the show was the lady who played <UNK> temple otherwise stay away for great shirley temple films watch <UNK> poor little rich girl and little miss broadway
<START> i agree that this film was spectacular the way in which jamie foxx captured not only the impression of ray charles but the essence of ray charles really made the film his life made a great story and it is good that it is finally being told i also found a great interview with jamie foxx about this role by ernie from on <UNK> channel 8 the link is http video <UNK> com q jamie foxx en i encourage everyone to check it out as it gives in depth looks into what went into his role and his personal feelings about ray charles the only problem i might <UNK> with the film is that the style was rather bland at times but in the end i think it helped make the story more realistic and keep the focus on the person ray charles rather than the film ray
<START> i found this one to be more chaotic than the average stooges short as strange as that may sound there were several funny bits especially the running gags calling dr howard dr fine dr howard the glass door breaking the stooges running into the supply room and coming back out with well you know but also quite of bit of it was taken up with things that just didn't make any sense to me i have to assume that these were generally take offs of scenes from the film men in white but since i don't know much about that movie i can't say for sure maybe if someone could explain these i'd appreciate this short more
<START> good grief 1 you completely missed the point the girl was only seen briefly specifically because she was the one who was going to kill herself everyone else was so wrapped up in their own stories they didn't notice her nor did we as one of the other students says at the end we're all so wrapped up in our own problems we don't notice what's going on for someone else br br the director himself said if he had killed off one of the others it would've suggested their problems were worse than someone else's the whole point of killing kelly was that she was <UNK> by all of us get it now
<START> this is a must see movie you will laugh you will cry and when it's over you'll wish there were more well written and compelling this movie draws you in and holds on tight the casting was perfect the characters <UNK> and the performances outstanding <UNK> is the standard to which all women should hold themselves strong <UNK> protective and never <UNK> <UNK> to me is the epitome of what a christian mother and woman should be a true <UNK> of the community if i were half the woman <UNK> is i might consider myself to be doing okay i would have been <UNK> if <UNK> had died at some point in the movie but since she didn't i will definitely buy this when it comes out on dvd i can only hope that the story continues and that <UNK> goes back to <UNK> to try to <UNK> the town piece by piece and person by person
<START> i was 10 or eleven years old when this movie came out and it has stayed with me for 35 years since when the movie came out all of the theaters in the st louis area distributed as a a pack of flower <UNK> that had the movie name etc on the front on the back of the pack it read in so many words plant these <UNK> at midnight if a white flower grows you are saved but if a red flower grows you are doomed suffice it to say that for an eleven year old kid i did not plant the <UNK> for fear of what may pop up here is the spoiler as the movie starts out you see a small toy tank moving about in the dirt on a small road a family is leaving town and suddenly the camera turns to the tank again and it is full size it rolls over the car and you see bloody limbs <UNK> from the <UNK> then just as sudden the tank is small again br br the reason this movie stuck with me for that long was because i had a exact toy tank as the one in the movie unfortunately i don't know what happened to it but i did keep a <UNK> eye on that thing ever since br br turn out the lights put in the dvd make a <UNK> and watch this movie it is very good
<START> half past dead was unlike any steven segal film i've ever seen very little of segal himself in action and i agree with the last review i read <UNK> steals the show br br i saw nothing really new here just the same old stuff from other flicks changed around a little the best action scenes were as she once again kicked butt it was interesting seeing her as the bad guy after watching her for two seasons on walker texas ranger still kicking butt but for the good guys br br
<START> oh dear gods this is awful stay away just stay away if you think you've seen bad movies think again never before has my brain hurt as much as it did after i watched this movie the acting if it is allowed to be called that is enough to cause internal inside your head the story is so thin it is just barely there no wait scratch that there is not a complete story there but once in a while there is a few thin lines that stick up from all the amount of <UNK> and believe me those few lines should have been shot the best way to enjoy this movie is to drop <UNK> on it and watch the <UNK> fire from a distance br br some may call me sarcastic in this review but i am only trying to spare some of you of a serious headache however should you be what i like to call a visual <UNK> like myself please go right ahead and watch this monstrosity
<START> please why not put this fantastic film on dvd i have been searching just like the previous writer for years whats the hold up or show it on tv its so <UNK> its one of the most romantic and beautifully written books i have ever read and believe i have read some i seem to think it was read on radio 4 but i can't find that either why not try and remake it even i promise it will be top <UNK> people love those sorts of stories so please either release it and take us out of our misery or remake it although i doubt if it could be improved upon has any one read gone to earth by the same author or seen the film with jennifer jones this is superb but not to the same extent may be
<START> i have been away from <UNK> for the last 10 years during that time i constantly lived in london when i have seen the movie i realised how much i am i am not just from turkey i am a part of turkey one of my part is <UNK> the sound of the <UNK> the people of the <UNK> br br probably faith akin thought that he has done great musical documentary but i must say it is more than that it is about putting nice blend of vastly different <UNK> cultures approaches politics into a delicious pot br br as we all know turkey to be precise <UNK> is always comes and goes between being eastern or western city as one of the band member said <UNK> is a <UNK> cultural city but much more a eastern city because we always tried to be a western city it shows we've never been one br br this movie will catch from very first second music is excellent people are fascinating especially and singers band members it is nice to see you all at a small cinema in wood green
<START> so the <UNK> are now knocking off american horror flicks but they are doing so with style doll master is a close copy of <UNK> and dolls and even has a little child's play going for it several young adults are invited to attend a special event at a gallery filled with dolls only to find they are targets of a vengeful spirit the dolls come to life and do some pretty nasty things to the kids the gore level is reasonably high the photography and set design and production values are first rate the acting isn't all that bad and the scares are definitely there doll master may not be in the same league with a tale of two sisters or even dead friend but it's close give it a watch you won't be disappointed
<START> i can't figure out what jon voight could possibly have been thinking when he got involved in this <UNK> rate incoherent pretentious mind numbing <UNK> he helped to write the alleged script himself and he should be damn well ashamed of it the film i can't call it a movie because it barely moves at all is rambling embarrassingly pretentious drivel sort of like a really bad oprah <UNK> show but worse it <UNK> <UNK> back and forth from medieval times to modern day los angeles with voight as a television producer who thinks he is the reincarnation of a medieval prince who must save the kingdom from the <UNK> of his evil brother and somehow this gets transferred to modern times where voight has to save the country from the evil <UNK> of an oil company executive if the bizarre casting <UNK> <UNK> frankie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> among others isn't enough to kill it the <UNK> inept direction the washed out photography it looks like it was shot with a really cheap <UNK> camera the almost complete lack of editing scenes either go on and on endlessly or are chopped off in the middle of a sentence and <UNK> embarrassing apparently stream of consciousness acting are enough to bury it which is exactly what should have been done with it a jaw dropping experience avoid this dog at all costs
<START> jimmy stewart was a real life pilot wwii <UNK> and a one star general in the air force and therefore a natural for how real pilots react when they fly when you see the faithful recreation of the actual plane you begin to understand the real life bravery and courage of lucky lindy when he flew the atlantic solo in <UNK>
<START> this film is wonderful example of the quality dramas that channel 4 and the bbc have produced over the years ted <UNK> delivers a powerful performance of a man tormented by memories <UNK> will accept and a society that believes he is insane it is a remarkable performance by a man most known for his role in cheers a tv comedy sitcom the supporting cast are all very well chosen not least mary wife who acts the part of <UNK> wife in the film but above all it is the <UNK> and very delicate shifts between our world and <UNK> world that make this film the difference in perspective between giants and <UNK> all acted by real actors is beautifully captured a rare treat of cinematography and direction
<START> as a serious horror fan i get that certain marketing <UNK> are used to sell movies especially the really bad ones so i wouldn't call it <UNK> that i assumed this was <UNK> horror ripping off cannibal zombi jungle holocaust unfortunately i was completely wrong as this is very hardcore i should have realized that when i saw the odd no actual or <UNK> minor was used warning notice the <UNK> part as though he is daring us to catch him a group of scientists half of whom are pretty women in <UNK> are led by a sea captain with a <UNK> for on the beach in search for a mutated native killing villagers due to a nuclear bomb <UNK> on a supposedly <UNK> island the radiation turned this last man into a rapist killer br br writer actor george <UNK> is the only one trying here and succeeds in keeping his clothes on the sex scenes are whacked out women walk around nude <UNK> a strange <UNK> and one even asks for rape when her husband turns her down well two chicks <UNK> each other naturally turns into a <UNK> scene because women are i saw the chick toss another chicks <UNK> and finger herself br br if there is anything you should know about this film it is that because the rest of this insane movie is just the same oh who am i kidding there is a ton more to tell here like the white <UNK> that pays for 2 black guys to tag team her in a <UNK> or the <UNK> taking off her top to use as a <UNK> when the captain cuts himself when he refuses her advances she starts crying so being the good gentleman he is he reluctantly lets her pleasure him in front of the other crew members i was honestly waiting for the pizza guy to show up and the <UNK> to ask if there is any other way to pay him br br and all of this happens before they <UNK> for the island to conduct their research wait i thought this was a zombie flick but the zombie doesn't enter until the mark but by that time everyone else has been entered plenty i found myself hitting fast forward a few several this is my first splatter porn flick and i don't think it does that <UNK> any justice i guess it is the woman in me talking when i say that i would like more plot and less <UNK> <UNK> hairy sex funny thing is this could have worked as a decent horror film as the idea of atomic bombing <UNK> a bitter man and killing his family was a good one even <UNK> character shakes his head and walks away from a couple <UNK> it makes me wonder if it was the character or the writer himself that was disgusted br br i don't feel like going into the sound or film quality because you should have already guessed it was bad this production was shot back to back with 3 other movies including erotic nights of the living dead which sports most of the same cast <UNK> has said this was done because everyone wanted a vacation and a paycheck <UNK> i feel like talking about the sound suddenly the sound was weird during the sex scenes because while the cast is speaking italian it seems as though they recorded english <UNK> and played that over their dialogue so while 2 people are <UNK> i can clearly hear someone in the background say no yes wonderful wait there was a slightly amusing italian score that couldn't save this movie the <UNK> were minimal at best and consisted of some blood in only a few scenes and i would like to point out that there were no violent rape scenes as the bright warning label said on the dvd cover <UNK> another marketing <UNK> so no fear there only fear the bad movie br br presented in widescreen 1 85 1 aspect ratio i watched the region 1 not rated version running at released in 2005 by exploitation digital there is apparently a <UNK> version by digital which is the same running time so i doubt anything is different <UNK> <UNK> but you shouldn't pay more than 25 00 for a copy or as i would recommend pay nothing and pretend it doesn't exist br br favorite quote <UNK> civilians are bad luck women are bad luck they're scientists too they must really be monsters dvd extras original trailer with hardcore shots kills to make it look more interesting than it is trailers for ss hell camp <UNK> and a very informative interview with <UNK> br br bottom line lame porno but even weaker as a horror film either get real porn or watch real horror br br rating 3 10 by molly <UNK> www <UNK> com
<START> captain <UNK> is no oscar <UNK> but it was pretty good i have to admit ms <UNK> can really act she puts on a very good performance in fact she our does her boyfriend tom in drama john hurt was great as usual nicholas cage seemed to be enjoying himself i bet he felt he was going back to his roots as an italian however i did learn something one more chapter in horrors of nazi germany the many italian killed during the period of there surrender to the allies and <UNK> eventual surrender
<START> i came across this film by accident and wish i hadn't br br why make a sexually rude sequel and some gore when a man is <UNK> of a well know children's movie br br do not take young kids to see this the title <UNK> you it has nothing to do with the original snow white except for stealing it's characters better still don't bother going yourself it's not worth it br br i could not watch it all the poor in comparison to disney cartoon graphics and no plot except on how to totally mess up a classic movie made me want to give up and leave
<START> this movie is retarded a cheap movie that tries to be a <UNK> movie because the characters are looking for pot but none of them are <UNK> just a bunch of garbage thomas hayden church should not direct anymore especially this movie which is a waste of film people who liked this movie gave good comments but from all the people on here some are just retarded and don't watch movies so they think that any bad movie is good the actors suck and the movie sucks balls br br i think that many people are going to be upset because this movie tries to make itself look like the ultimate <UNK> movie when it is just the worst movie about <UNK> that i have ever seen i hope that people will stop the director from directing crap like this even <UNK> cannot make this movie funny or entertaining
<START> i'll never understand why when a studio like universal buys a musical it then <UNK> it when bringing it to screen my first thought when seeing <UNK> <UNK> and robert walker were starring i would be seeing something from mgm which did musicals best at that time boy was i wrong and disappointed br br one touch of <UNK> which starred mary martin kenny baker and john <UNK> on broadway ran for performances in the 1943 1945 season and <UNK> walker and tom <UNK> play the roles that martin baker and <UNK> did on stage the kurt <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> musical with book by <UNK> and s j was a comeback vehicle for mary martin who herself as the queen of broadway after a disappointing venture in hollywood br br look at the names that went into this show given who was responsible for the book i expected to see some <UNK> wit in this production instead i got a rather pedestrian screenplay it was like all the wit was <UNK> out of it doing her best to make up for it is eve <UNK> playing her usual girl friday role with tom <UNK> but it's even too much for eve br br the story concerns department store window <UNK> robert walker who kisses a very valuable statue of <UNK> who springs to life in the person of <UNK> <UNK> of course when the statue goes missing <UNK> yells for the law and is suspicious of walker the last person to be with the statue br br the rest of the film is walker dealing with <UNK> and what will happen to both of them for reasons i don't understand <UNK> was of course dubbed by <UNK> wilson and walker sings only a couple of lines the singing is carried by dick and <UNK> san juan playing <UNK> friends and <UNK> of course on broadway the songs were done by singers mary martin and kenny baker you would kind of think that would be playing <UNK> role at least it was awkward to say the least br br only three songs survived from the score don't look now but my heart is showing that's him and the <UNK> speak low <UNK> <UNK> is shown to best advantage in speak low which was sung as a <UNK> by martin and baker on broadway for some reason the lyrics of one of the greatest men of <UNK> of the last century <UNK> <UNK> were done over by ann i suspect the infamous code was at work here br br in lee biography of <UNK> <UNK> he makes mention of a brief <UNK> <UNK> had with robert walker when she had had a <UNK> with her current man howard duff when duff and <UNK> reunited walker took it badly and didn't speak at all to <UNK> off camera i'm sure the fact that both of them were not in their best work didn't help matters either br br hopefully some <UNK> company will do one touch of <UNK> and you'll get to see it the way <UNK> <UNK> and wrote it
<START> this is probably the worst movie i've seen in a long time independent or not solid writing is a must <UNK> for directing and acting i know these actors can act i've seen them in and more but this movie is very bad very bad maybe it's the script maybe it's the director probably a little of both probably a lot of both technically ok just bad bad bad i have a theory that the <UNK> for this movie also own the poker magazines because i saw a very <UNK> review in one of the magazines <UNK> we made it so it's gotta be good right not so fast i know it takes a lot of hard work and money to even get a movie made much less sold and distributed and for that i <UNK> these folks but the final product leave a bad taste in my mouth br br p s i won a free rental and chose this movie from blockbuster tomorrow i'm going to get my money back
<START> this movie should have ended as soon as the joke about kids is told in the opening i liked robin harris and most of his comedy but the really funny routines were not meant to be something the whole family could go see <UNK> it to taking the point of one of jerry <UNK> jokes and attempting to squeeze the joke for as long as you can in order to turn it into a movie this movie had to be self serving because i can not find anyone who found the settings or antics familiar whats most funny about this movie is the <UNK> of the writers and producers to pass it off as something of value 1 10 stars because there is no half star
<START> a true masterpiece by and tony demonstrates his exceptional acting ability as the cool enigmatic br br yet another example of a must see movie that the everyday person will not receive access as the high street cinema chains are full of hollywood <UNK> nonsense fortunately i <UNK> in the metropolis and amongst the <UNK> few who enjoy the choice the art house cinema provides i champion the day when cinema investment will be into film <UNK> allowing choice for the masses and away from <UNK> penny sweet <UNK> br br film of the year for me so far and yes i've seen a few
<START> i don't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch while i did i got so <UNK> i gave up working to just sit and finish watching the last half hour <UNK> and i sure don't usually shed tears over this sort of show but i was crying at the end a lot of emotional nuance great acting and good southern feel john corbett is one of the most talented actors out there and the guy who played luke was really good too highly recommend
<START> it's been said that batman begins in the first batman movie to get it right but i think that's a horrible <UNK> for i think the new batman film although greater that batman forever and batman and robin <UNK> compared to tim <UNK> classics with this one being the best of the five the darkness is beautiful as is the music and scenery creating a <UNK> city <UNK> in mystery unlike batman begins where <UNK> city is a normal looking city the villains are terrific in this movie you literally can't take your eyes off of the penguin and cat woman i applaud tim burton for being original with his use of the penguin as a freak rather than an ordinary criminal or a clone of the old batman tv show in batman begins we have the scarecrow whose not nearly as demanding on screen as the penguin or cat woman the film doesn't need to focus only on batman because we already know his story and it is the villains who we are exploring and trying to figure out and they are the ones who create the plot with the penguin running for mayor and seeking revenge for his parents' <UNK> by killing the first born sons of <UNK> a task he fails danny <UNK> gives the finest performance ever by a superhero villain in any film <UNK> even <UNK> joker the closing scene where the <UNK> drag the dead body of the penguin into the water is touching and powerful it's a tragedy that tim burton wasn't allowed to complete his trilogy since warner bros interesting in marketing appeal wanted to <UNK> the batman movies up and they got their wish unfortunately tim burton planned on directing the third film using the <UNK> as the villain with no two face and robin to mess it up and i'm sure michael keaton would've signed on so this is the last great batman film batman begins is dark but boring tedious ordinary filled with lackluster villains and a playboy bruce wayne a decent batman film but the best batman film ever never batman returns holds that crown
<START> a by the numbers <UNK> exercise with a disappointing non <UNK> and usage of the term ' the cinematography appears right out of basic cable <UNK> land which <UNK> any semblance of <UNK> murky atmosphere from the proceedings in addition there's not nearly enough gore sex or attractive young things to <UNK> the majority of the film's targeted viewers that being said the lead actress who plays the possessed has a sexy <UNK> skinned presence what else needs to be said about this non winner don't rent unless you've got a thing for middle aged adults <UNK> their past and <UNK> with clichéd priests <UNK> hispanic all <UNK> their past actions
<START> one of the best ever direction a thrilling and dramatic history wonderful soundtrack and most of all the incredible credibility of susan sarandon and sean penn the best and most <UNK> under 40 generation actor after seeing this movie i guess if there's anyone who couldn't have any doubt about giving death to another man in spite of the ugly things he could have done
<START> this film must have been quietly released on some other side of the world perhaps even in english hopefully nobody understood a word not there's anything to understand in this movie anyways call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever why would i come to that conclusion because it's my national to <UNK> horrible films and this one begs for it every other minute once i became a fan of science theater 3000 i had no doubt in my mind they'd find it somewhere and use it sure enough the version they acquired was entitled cave <UNK> using some strange intro footage not even from the film itself apparently they were ashamed to use footage from their own film i can't say i recommend buying this film rather i highly recommend getting the mst3k version sure to find it most anywhere mst3k dvd's are sold don't miss out
<START> i'm not sure how i can make ten lines out of this question but i'll try br br when julie went to the dance and they were dancing to slow music what was the name of the song that was playing and who played it br br i love that song and i watch the movie over and over just to hear that one song br br i did several <UNK> online and even looked up the soundtrack but i <UNK> can't find the song br br it might be because the song they were dancing to wasn't a complete song and just partial br br i would appreciate if anyone out there who knows what the name of the song and the group who sung it br br thank you br br frank
<START> frank <UNK> is a so so private <UNK> short which aims to teach the importance of the <UNK> in stopping military secrets from <UNK> out <UNK> attempts to get word out to his girlfriend that he's to be <UNK> in the south pacific but the <UNK> <UNK> each attempt he makes to send the letter these early scenes are the best with the unseen <UNK> <UNK> the letter out of the sky with long mechanical arms <UNK> and even a specially employed eagle the second half of the cartoon in which <UNK> manages to send the letter with the aid of technical fairy first class who is actually teaching him a lesson is less funny and <UNK> with a disappointing only a dream finale the main point of interest in this part of the cartoon is the appearance of extremely scantily clad girlfriend who is even seen bare <UNK> albeit with <UNK> placed limbs at all times aimed at the military the <UNK> shorts were often <UNK> by a <UNK> but these scenes in as they may be are by far the most erotic i've come across in any of these shorts thus far despite all this i prefer the <UNK> shorts that go for the <UNK> a little more usually resulting in the death of the main character for great examples of this seek out <UNK> 'the or chuck <UNK> is fairly weak by comparison
<START> the opening of <UNK> masterpiece avoids mere <UNK> in its depiction of the <UNK> horrifying events of august <UNK> 1945 in which 90 of <UNK> and <UNK> of thousands of lives were <UNK> in an instant instead <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> of the catastrophe focusing on such <UNK> images as the <UNK> <UNK> cloud <UNK> in the distance and the black rain that a beautiful young woman's face the rest of the film <UNK> the <UNK> of the latter incident bringing the atomic holocaust and its aftermath over 100 000 people died of radiation <UNK> down to the <UNK> level of the plight of <UNK> and her small community bound by the bomb br br the survivors <UNK> for <UNK> and continuity most notably by attempting to find a suitable marriage for but the <UNK> possibility of radiation sickness shadows every aspect of their lives potential <UNK> naturally enough shy away from a young woman no matter how attractive who might suddenly grow sick and die genuine love when it finally does appear does so unexpectedly and <UNK> we are left wondering if love across class lines is more a token of status as damaged goods or of a common humanity thrown into bold relief by harsh circumstances that <UNK> class <UNK> br br the film's <UNK> restrained style <UNK> the impact the spare <UNK> interior shots reminding us that <UNK> began his career as an assistant to the great <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is evident for example in the paired scenes of bathing the first <UNK> her lovely back and legs the second how her hair is falling out the shots stand almost as <UNK> to the <UNK> its tragic essence the film's documentary style realism is <UNK> for <UNK> purposes several times perhaps most notably in a scene that lays bare the troubled interior life of a shell shocked veteran both the score by the renowned avant garde composer <UNK> <UNK> and the stunning black and white photography contribute greatly to the film's brooding atmosphere when in the final shot uncle <UNK> <UNK> the film's <UNK> narrator looks to the <UNK> sky for a <UNK> as a sign of hope and <UNK> the black and white imagery suddenly becomes so poignant that it is almost unbearable few films from japan or anywhere else for that matter could be compared to the great <UNK> japanese masterpieces of the 1950s this film is one of them when i finished viewing it for the first time i sat stunned unable to move for at least five minutes overwhelmed as i was by the emotions great tragedy should inspire terror and pity
<START> being an admitted chess addict i was excited to see a documentary about the 1997 <UNK> between <UNK> <UNK> and deep blue <UNK> i was hoping to see an in depth look at the match and a lot of what <UNK> had to say boy was i wrong and misguided by a mile this documentary is a lot like many modern documentaries there is a lot of flash but no real substance after watching it i am sad to say i felt like i wasted my time one of the most annoying aspects about the documentary is that it does not stay at one place for a decent period of time it has the typical mtv type editing where the camera shows different images and quick sound bites from people every five seconds it is very sad that film making has been watered down to the attention span of a 10 year old child br br i understand it is difficult to make a film about chess but that does not mean one should make it flashy <UNK> <UNK> did have a couple of interesting ideas though it brought up the idea whether computers can think like human beings or not whether computers have advanced to a unique new level this is what <UNK> thought after the match but this film does not go deep enough with this idea also this film tries to bring in a bizarre theory it tries to imply the paranoid that a human being was making the moves along with the help of the computer <UNK> had <UNK> about this but still to this day there is no evidence towards the end of the film it tries to imply the bizarre that maybe might have been the human being who was secretly making the moves with the aid of deep blue interesting to think about but i don't know how plausible or realistic it is i still would not recommend this movie though not even for chess <UNK>
<START> i don't normally write reviews but for this film i had to i'm shocked at the acting talent in this move going to waste the script was appalling the editing awful and the plot very thin you spend the first half of the movie wondering who is talking to who and what on earth they are doing the latter half of the movie slows down slightly but has no depth or feeling the only saving grace is the nice but still limited cgi and the location being london i gave 3 stars for that and the fact the actors still tried to do a good job with the drivel they were given if you fancy losing a couple of hours of your life with mediocre popcorn disaster movie entertainment by all means this is the movie for you but i would recommend doing something else with your time instead like watching the real archive footage online http www com <UNK>
<START> like another reviewer my wife bought this movie as part of a 20 movie family pack i guess you could say that this was a decent made for tv movie for 1980 but it is super predictable and the acting except for robert conrad is generally sub par the football scenes are nothing special and seem to mainly act as filler for the movie the movie is very dated now but a decent remake could probably make this into a good movie however is that really necessary i mean how many underdog sports team works together for the big game with the <UNK> guys movies do we really need this is probably a good movie for your younger kids if you find it in the bargain bin but a sports movie buff will find it lacking
<START> well wright may have made a gritty depiction of life around <UNK> as he so repeatedly and <UNK> goes on about because of when it was written as opposed to published but it is his not <UNK> and shouldn't claim to be an adaptation br br mrs bennett looks like a rural this is a <UNK> woman they have servants remember the book scene with the servant dressing the hair etc but wright portrays her with rough skin all down her chest rough hands and working in the kitchen and the pigs wandering through if he wants <UNK> he should try tess br br mr bennett the script makes too <UNK> and modern and ignored the weakness in him the scene where he stops mary playing is supposed to make you cringe not pass in seconds if it doesn't don't include it br br <UNK> is very weak in the part and seems to be doing some kind of pride by numbers acting the first <UNK> he looks like a nervous <UNK> rather than a man <UNK> his pride to make a <UNK> beneath his station most of his lines he could as well be reading a shopping list br br <UNK> is awful completely over the top with excessive <UNK> and skipping indeed knightley plays elizabeth more like the <UNK> inane character <UNK> actually is in the book at times br br and elizabeth half the time knightley is clearly <UNK> voice and <UNK> close your eyes to see what a copy it is and in her role you see <UNK> major error there is no prejudice br br from the first encounter with <UNK> she clearly <UNK> him when he comments to on the <UNK> of the women in the hall she initially looks hurt not shocked and the latter should set up the prejudice side of things and when she and are <UNK> round the room she comes across like a <UNK> obviously all over him and by virtually cutting out you don't get elizabeth invested enough there to set up the <UNK> aspects falling out of that relationship br br and apparently it is caroline not miss and mr happily wanders into jane's bedroom and and and wright can <UNK> about how great he is with period all he wants but a few <UNK> shots of rural life which show the <UNK> for hardy don't excuse him the glaring <UNK> all over the place br br the cinematographer who clearly wants awards should have been in he <UNK> between <UNK> and hardy throughout the film and wasn't the last <UNK> shots lighting from tess the need to see <UNK> walk along through the with <UNK> shirt was just dumb but most importantly when going between those 2 very different landscapes they forget the most important one austen she'd have laughed out loud at the elizabeth sad therefore rain running through to <UNK> <UNK> wet <UNK> rubbish br br i admit i found it impossible the watch the film without using the book as context i was prepared to give it some <UNK> as it had to provide the story in a short space of time but to forget fully one half of the core of the book in prejudice and <UNK> to continually look more <UNK> than <UNK> made it almost unwatchable i could only see it as a mess with generally poor performances when knightley wasn't <UNK> <UNK> she was <UNK> or skipping or both and only <UNK> down a couple of times to indicate she does have some promise but about on <UNK> to convey emotion isn't a substitute for a poor script and poor direction although for some it was simply a case of bad script br br tom holland alone would escape <UNK> while he toned down the comic aspects of collins he did turn in a very interesting approach <UNK> does superbly the <UNK> she can do in her sleep whether it be here or in oscar <UNK> but this was supposed to be lady catherine de not lady she was just a little too sane br br the <UNK> length could have been handled by a competent screenwriter surely not characters filling in story gaps and helping along the audience all over the place elizabeth couldn't have come up with the figure and while they wanted to cut time with her learning of involvement in marriage the lines didn't fit with <UNK> it was the worst case of <UNK> exposition in the piece br br it really is appalling stuff anyone who reviews it saying it works well in the context of the book is someone i frankly don't believe has read or understood the <UNK> in the thing wright seems to think his characters are in the 1990s not the from their behaviour i'm not convinced he has read the book he certainly doesn't understand it he doesn't understand <UNK> <UNK> wit or <UNK> of touch he certainly made a dull plodding film out of it br br what is possibly worse was the sad pathetic need of the chick lit lovers to need the 'i love you i love all over the place so they can sigh and get off on it the fact that it has no place in a work by austen is apparently irrelevant br br anyone who reviews it as a film alone well more difficult for me except i would note the poor acting the weak <UNK> and the <UNK> skipping inane <UNK> of the whole thing if you are going to adapt you can change a lot but if it loses the spirit and key motivations then don't insult the book by taking it's title
<START> like most other people i saw this movie on mystery science theater 3000 although it received some well deserved <UNK> it's one of the better films to be featured on that show br br the premise is better than even your average hollywood blockbuster these days it poses some interesting moral <UNK> although the score is sometimes <UNK> it also provides a few lovely moments when richard is walking by the river watching the movie you can see where a lot of plot developments probably looked very good on paper <UNK> <UNK> in modern society is an interesting problem to <UNK> and the ending probably would have been a nice '70s style if the <UNK> affairs hadn't been so goofy br br unfortunately the movie is <UNK> cheap making the flaws all the more obvious the clone farm is very obviously a college campus and a beer can serves as a major plot point lena and richard have zero chemistry we are supposed to believe this is a meeting of <UNK> minds but there doesn't seem to be a brain cell between them the <UNK> old couple <UNK> also gets real old real fast there are also some mistakes that can be blamed on bad directorial choices such as the decision to hold a climactic conversation out of reach of any audio equipment whatsoever br br in all a noble effort but is nonetheless best viewed on mst3k
<START> <UNK> is a pathetic attempt at film making which wanders around and among a bunch of manhattan teens exploring all the usual teen <UNK> stuff sex drugs and classical music almost completely without story focus or purpose griffith is in the film for about 2 minutes while <UNK> <UNK> works her way through another in her long list of dog flicks nothing in this films works and wayne should consider getting a real job not recommended for anyone <UNK> ugh d
<START> family guy is probably the most <UNK> sitcom ever produced it relentlessly <UNK> everything it can think of from tv shows to family drama best of all it's one of the few tv shows on today that's actually funny br br the show revolves around the <UNK> peter the <UNK> father whose schemes are limited by his lack of intelligence lois the mother who is more or less the head of the family even though peter considers himself to be that chris the fat teenage son who has just as few brains as his dad meg the black sheep of the family that is the but of everyone's jokes the baby who has plans for killing his mother and taking over the world and brian the family dog who is frequently the voice of reason but is frequently <UNK> br br family guy employs many tactics to get laughs from the audience most notable are the frequent <UNK> that spoof what has just been said they are effective because of the impeccable timing and in how they play out family guy uses spoofs to get humor as well most <UNK> from 80's tv shows what really makes the show so great is that a person doesn't have to be familiar with what it's <UNK> i'm sure it would help but the material is funny enough in its own right but the show doesn't stop there not only does it spoof just about everything it <UNK> its own spoofs the show is filled with off color humor the only reason why people aren't up in arms about the show is probably because it makes fun of every race sex and other <UNK> equally there is nothing sacred here and no one and nothing is <UNK> from family guy's satirical <UNK> br br putting on musical numbers in a film takes a lot of time and effort and it's a very big risk but family guy contains some great songs all well written and performed and of course they are hilarious perhaps the most famous one the <UNK> <UNK> is both catchy and hysterical because it hits the ratings board where it hurts br br the voice characterizations are right on the money seth <UNK> is tremendously talented he provides the voices for peter brian which is his own natural voice and not only are the voices consistent and creative he can alter their pitch at will so it really seems as if they are spoken by three different actors alex <UNK> brings a <UNK> <UNK> to lois that is perfect for the character seth green is <UNK> as chris had i not looked on imdb i would have never known that it was him <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the character of meg and while she was good <UNK> <UNK> really <UNK> the character with her sharp voice <UNK> gives meg a new <UNK> edge that she didn't have with <UNK> br br family guy has been compared to the simpsons and that's entirely understandable and not just because they are produced by fox both are <UNK> of blue collar life and while the simpsons is good family guy contains are <UNK> edge the show is utterly <UNK> there is no real sacred cow the show <UNK> <UNK> physical and mental <UNK> tv shows and movies celebrities politicians religion especially <UNK> drug use and addiction sexual humor of all kinds including s m and some that's just beyond description not everything family guy throws at the audience works but as a whole the show is consistently amusing and frequently hilarious br br if there's any flaw with family guy it's that the jokes run on far too long sometimes particularly with the awkward moment jokes the sequences are stretched for so long that not only does it <UNK> to become funny it becomes so irritating and long that a fast forward button is <UNK> these can be effective at about 10 to 15 seconds but the show sometimes stretches these to beyond two minutes one could argue that the show <UNK> its rules to suit the plot and it often does for example brian frequently acts like a person but he still acts like a dog when the story requires it but that's not a problem because the show still works br br some people have <UNK> that the show has stopped being funny while i agree that it's not as edgy as it used to be i think the blame lies with fox not <UNK> and his crew the show <UNK> with fox but after some lackluster ratings and viewer <UNK> it was canceled however dvd sales were large enough for it to be picked up by adult swim the show became an instant success and it was once again bought by fox however because the show is so big now fox is afraid to let the writers experiment and try new things while it's still funny the humor is not as fresh and edgy br br definitely check this show out it's awesome
<START> a light uplifting and engaging movie watching irene dunne is a delight as you watch her she <UNK> to be irene dunne and becomes in every way paula <UNK> br br i have enjoyed irene dunne in every movie that i have seen and that would be nearly all of them what a shame that most of her movies need <UNK> so badly i do hope irene dunne movie are restored before it is too late they are such <UNK> thank goodness this is not the case with over 21 br br it is a must see if you like superb acting and witty comedy with serious overtones i agree with a previous comment on the speech the world and apple pie it was one of the many highlights of the movie i read somewhere that irene dunne helped in writing that speech along with director <UNK> irene dunne was a very good and <UNK> person in private life and it certainly seems to show through in her movies
<START> even though this film was nothing special as such i am drawn to comment on at least one factor that ruled in its favour that of the lead female performer in the film <UNK> cannon in spite of the film's ridiculous storyline and what she goes through here hers was the best acting job in the film making the unbelievable seem more plausible her <UNK> scene with the gay photographer david <UNK> has to be seen to be believed good work <UNK>
<START> not sure if this is just a lousy movie or if it was intended to be a mockery of a b western story line was so so but the filming editing and acting were just plain bad plus the music in the background was irritating to no end too loud and just non stop many times you could not make out the dialog over the background music i'm in <UNK> single action shooting society and do some old west shooting with them and a lot of the actors are members of this group so that's why i bought it if you have no interest in this group of people or that sport you certainly most likely wouldn't even have this little bit of interest to help out with the film the acting of even the veteran actors particularly stella stevens left a lot to be desired also
<START> this is not so much of a review as it is a testament that it has been <UNK> yet again that the academy <UNK> money not artistic accomplishment and i must say i am <UNK> that this usually artistic and intelligent band of <UNK> members have left this off the top 250 boogie nights is powerful raw and <UNK> through script direction and acting very few movies can claim this triple crown
<START> this film is a work of pure class from start to finish for a moment forget the famous 28 minute no dialog heist forget that it's set in paris and forget it's noir the film itself the premise and the execution make this a pure gold experience it's sharp intelligent and thought through in great detail just like the heist itself it portrays real characters that are not only believable but whom you empathize with it's a film that doesn't <UNK> the notion of a robbery but shows it for what it is <UNK> it shows that a heist is hard work and ultimately not worth doing now all things considered put on top of that a daring 28 minute sequence with not a word spoken and set in gorgeous paris with truly great attention to detail and fantastic cinematography and that last scene when you look up and see those trees wonderful use of raw and basic filming techniques it is a master piece in my view and i'm glad to have seen it
<START> saw the film at the closing <UNK> of the ealing film festival in west london england enjoyed it immensely although the crow the chinese policeman don't appear and dan <UNK> becomes dan <UNK> played by sean hughes i the interaction between dan and the author writer director voiced played by lord richard attenborough works very well br br the <UNK> is that lord attenborough and elliott <UNK> as dr <UNK> appeared in the film for just a <UNK> of beer br br spike was shown the film on video before he died and by all accounts enjoyed it immensely
<START> roll up roll up it's big gay bruce and his big gay death cannon plausible plot unnecessary decent acting unnecessary respect shown to its mighty <UNK> unnecessary yes it's another <UNK> stuffed turkey in the butch bruce <UNK> br br i mean where do you start with this film okay let's begin with the <UNK> <UNK> people might have that this was in some way related to either the book or the original film the day of the it's not in fact it's so different and so bad that <UNK> <UNK> asked to have his name taken off it now i'm not necessarily a <UNK> brit who can't hack hollywood <UNK> british films well okay maybe i am a bit like that but fortunately it's a redundant point in this case this film is so different to the original that the name and the odd reference are the only things that survive br br now let's move to the premise cheesy russian gangster gets killed in a <UNK> police raid somehow involving the fbi although no one bothers to explain why in revenge brother of gangster decides to <UNK> vengeance by killing the wife of the us president although again no one bothers to explain why this is a good move  although to be fair it was pre 9 11 so he wasn't to know it would have resulted in the us <UNK> carpet bombing eastern europe gangster hires nasty killer willis police hire <UNK> killer gere <UNK> killer tracks nasty killer police <UNK> around and <UNK> get killed <UNK> killer kills nasty killer first lady is saved and we all realise that the ira are just this bunch of real sweet guys <UNK> who just happen to want to kill innocent people nice br br let's put to one side the <UNK> hollywood habit of playing in the troubles of northern ireland like it was a in a theme park i deal with this point more <UNK> on the message boards if hollywood directors want to cast the <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> with hearts of gold that's up to them i of course <UNK> the right to despise them for it it's a free country br br more <UNK> however is the fact that the film manages to <UNK> and insult the irish while trying to support them that's not politically <UNK> it's far worse it's incompetent it's no wonder for instance that gere still looks so damn good given that he slept through the entire six months it took to make this piece of p the fact that <UNK> accent is not only southern irish but an appalling parody of southern irish shows that the filmmakers weren't looking much beyond america to make money from this film then there is that lovely scene at the end where sidney <UNK> a complete waste of space in this film says he's off for a coffee offers to get our <UNK> ira man one then casually says ah but then you guys drink guinness don't you yeah that's right sidney the irish live on guinness and <UNK> br br while we're on the subject of <UNK> why in the original film the detective is the <UNK> in gere is the <UNK> so what does <UNK> do well he just hangs around and looks like a <UNK> at of course he's got absolutely nothing to do apart from call in the marines at the end and he only does this because the nice ira man tells him to br br while we're on the subject of gere why i suppose it's only a matter of time before hollywood remakes gandhi with <UNK> <UNK> playing ex <UNK> <UNK> gandhi <UNK> his way through 1940s and 50s india he is after all a bit dark of <UNK> and therefore very likely to be a muslim <UNK> let's not forget that <UNK> character is a killer and therefore a nasty piece of work and if he's not why does he know the if he's not why does he know all his moves and if he is why is he such a limp <UNK> and such a <UNK> person br br all this goes to show that the makers of this film couldn't be bothered to a think about the plot b have the characters making decisions that were in keeping with their character c avoid cheesy stereotypes like having the big boss bad guy kill his own friend  i honestly thought this had turned into a bond movie d give the central characters something to do e credit the audience with a <UNK> of intelligence br br this film is an insult to the british and irish killed at the hands of terrorists it's an insult to the irish people it's an insult to not great but pretty good film it rips off and an insult to the intelligence but most of all  and most unforgivable  it is an insult to my a for having to sit through the over two hours of run time it took to finish honestly you'd think with no plot no characters and no dialogue it would be over in no time but they didn't even have the decency to quit early
<START> <UNK> machine finds burt reynolds as a <UNK> cop who after a failed buy and bust that wasn't his fault but that got a few people killed in it he finds himself to the vice squad in <UNK> br br the <UNK> is hardly as good as the <UNK> beat but it does have its <UNK> benefits one night after a <UNK> of working girls where one of their books falls into their hands the guys ask for <UNK> on rachel <UNK> place she's an expensive item both notorious mobster <UNK> <UNK> and law and order candidate earl <UNK> br br their <UNK> however records a murder and the rest of the film is <UNK> and his new colleagues from vice trying to solve this <UNK> case br br though it's a burt reynolds film and those usually have some humor to them the comedy is kept in check as the film turns as deadly serious as dirty harry it was reported in fact that clint eastwood was offered this film br br look for some good performances by fellow vice cops <UNK> <UNK> and brian keith and by henry <UNK> the <UNK> up brother of <UNK> who does the dirty work of the organization and loves his job br br it's not a bad film a mixture of dirty harry and laura why laura you'll have to see <UNK> machine for that answer
<START> <UNK> has gone down the toilet they have kids saying things like oh my god and we're screwed br br this show <UNK> hate for people who aren't good looking or aren't in the in crowd it say that sexual <UNK> is alright by having girls <UNK> over <UNK> boys not to mention the overweight boy who takes off his shirt the main characters basically <UNK> anyone out of the ordinary friend sam who may be a lesbian beats the <UNK> out of anybody that crosses her path which says it's alright to be a b <UNK> this show has so much <UNK> in it that nobody should watch it i give it a 0 out of 10
<START> i am not <UNK> bates my names is but <UNK> is my mum i'm just using her account barney and friends or barney as it is called here in england is the <UNK> show ever i never really liked it it had been about for 3 or 4 years when i was born so it was nothing new my friend however loved this <UNK> of a show i was about 6 and i was at his house once and he had a barney vhs tape playing on the tv i turned the power off and he burst into tears grow up its a talking dinosaur for sake anyway i happened to catch the barney movie on tv later that year and i loved it i got the vhs of it a few months later and i wore the tape out i loved it so much i gave that tape away a few years ago now but i loved it at the time but the show my god the show was bad several kids fell victims to because of this butt plug of so called entertainment never again never again its not just me who hates barney either 85 of all the comments on this show are bad and and just look at the amount of you tube <UNK> and videos that take the mess out of barney are on you tube and don't get me started on blow job <UNK> why the hell would the producers dare give a character such a sexual name yet another <UNK> message in a kid's show and that baby <UNK> is the worst thing since <UNK> bin laden all in all i give barney and friends minus 1000 out of 10
<START> when i <UNK> savage intruder into the <UNK> search engine one of the <UNK> it came up with was savage garden international video collection the story so far 1999 the only reason i mention this is because i'm a huge savage garden fan you should do yourself a favour check some of their music out like <UNK> or to the moon and back rather than bother with this average pot <UNK> sorry i just wanted to say that anyway savage intruder starts with a bizarre montage of what looks like mgm musical premiere footage a few spinning <UNK> which have no meaning whatsoever in the long run it's late 60's hollywood amid the <UNK> <UNK> a serial killer is at work <UNK> <UNK> actresses killing them <UNK> their bodies a young man named <UNK> <UNK> david garfield as john david garfield <UNK> off a tour bus looking for <UNK> when it stops at the house of a now retired actress <UNK> parker <UNK> hopkins who was <UNK> of the biggest stars of the motion <UNK> but now lives in a big house with an elderly <UNK> named mildred <UNK> lake a personal secretary leslie blair <UNK> <UNK> a young maid named virginia wing <UNK> has recently broken her foot needs a personal assistant gives <UNK> the job slowly <UNK> charms his way into affections more importantly her large <UNK> <UNK> starts to turn <UNK> against the other employees but <UNK> isn't what he seems <UNK> is a drug addicted <UNK> who gets greta pregnant while still having sex with <UNK> greta threatens to tell <UNK> spoil <UNK> <UNK> plans but she has a close encounter with an axe no one in the house is safe as <UNK> brings drugs sex rock <UNK> roll <UNK> <UNK> to the parker mansion while his sinister plan starts to become more more apparent br br written produced directed by donald <UNK> i thought savage intruder was a bit of a mess but a mildly entertaining one at the same time the script is all over the place it can't really decide what it wants to be savage intruder suffers from an identity crisis the film starts with the discovery of a severed head limbs straight after another woman dorothy is killed by a mysterious <UNK> figure but then it completely <UNK> the slasher film elements that it has just built up never going back to them savage intruder then becomes a sort of feel good film as <UNK> befriends <UNK> shows her how to enjoy life again having an implied sexual relationship with her it's actually disgusting to think about as she's old enough to be his grandmother <UNK> stops living the life of a <UNK> gives up the alcohol as <UNK> appears to make her happy as they go to <UNK> together hold for friend like she used too this part of savage intruder wouldn't look out of place in a disney film every so often the tedium of the feel good stuff is interrupted by <UNK> shooting up having silly hallucinations about his mother <UNK> her hand off with an axe he has sex with great at one point as well then after greta has been murdered savage intruder becomes a bizarre horror film as <UNK> is revealed for the loony that he is savage intruder just doesn't flow properly as a film in my opinion as it mixes various genres with little success similarly the murder mystery elements don't work are frankly a bit of a puzzle why go to great <UNK> to <UNK> the killers identity during the murder scenes but then make it perfectly clear who is committing them throughout the rest of the film anyway <UNK> as a character didn't work for me either one moment he's a cool calm clever <UNK> con man then next he's a stark raving loony why kill all his other victims but with <UNK> try to con her what makes her so different if it is because she has money why not go after her to start with so many questions so few answers some of the 60's dialogue is pretty funny to listen to these days like when <UNK> offers greta a <UNK> in reality hard drugs greta says what do i need a <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> replies because your a pain wow this guy knows how to charm the ladies or when <UNK> suggests that <UNK> do some <UNK> <UNK> do you have green fingers he replies no but i'm good at grass there isn't much gore in savage intruder some severed limbs a couple of decapitated heads there is also a fairly impressive shot when someone has their hand cut off with an axe which is probably why it's repeated three or four times the silly looking drug <UNK> scenes need to be seen to be believed technically savage intruder is ok the location filming in the <UNK> mansion hollywood hills probably give it a better look than it deserves the acting is average as is the rest of the production overall i'd say savage intruder feels like it tries to be a murder mystery that unfortunately gives the killer away as a result just doesn't work it's a mildly entertaining one time watch at best a complete mess of a film at worse you decide which
<START> based on the <UNK> autobiography a many thing love is a many thing 1955 tells the story of han focusing on the romance that han a widowed <UNK> doctor in 1949 hong kong had with a married american <UNK> named mark elliott i don't want to feel anything again ever han tells mark soon after they meet but the two soon develop the mutual for each other and who can blame them mark is played by william <UNK> at the near peak of his hunky dude period the following year's <UNK> would be the peak in this the first of three films over the next seven years that would find <UNK> in china 1960's the world of <UNK> wong and <UNK> satan never sleeps being the others and dr han is here played by jennifer jones who although not a <UNK> unlike <UNK> nancy <UNK> and pretty france of those other exotic <UNK> films does a credible job of passing as one whether dressed in european <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> bathing suit jones looks ridiculously gorgeous here no wonder east meets west in this film so dramatically with its two appealing lead stars breathtaking hong kong scenery beautiful <UNK> and color oscar winning costumes and that classic oscar winning title song that through the film like a lovely <UNK> love is a many thing turns out to be quite the winning and romantic <UNK> han herself supposedly did not care for the picture so i can only imagine that great liberties were taken with her source material still i enjoyed it and if the film's ending causes a tear to come to the eye just remember <UNK> words of wisdom life's greatest tragedy is not to be loved
<START> what an excellent movie made even more so by the fact that my wife and i stumbled onto it so <UNK> channel surfing on a nice frozen day in north texas kathy bates is at her usual best leading a cast of very normal and human <UNK> characters thru one of the most wonderful feel good movies we've ever seen why this movie wasn't given the attention it deserved on it's release in 2002 is difficult to understand why it was head and shoulders above so many of the boring pieces of trash released with greater <UNK> and attention is evident in the viewing it is obvious that we as a general public are being force fed that which has been deemed great and wonderful by the powerful and influential while true gems such as <UNK> love manage to shine thru all those <UNK> to really enjoyable cinema rent or buy this movie you won't regret it
<START> i'm not really a t v watcher except between the ages of 6 and 8 and general hospital still had luke and laura but there are a few exceptions and i definitely think that king of queens is one of them every decade has it's classics and i think that this show will or damn well should be amongst this <UNK> best its comedic timing is awesome and can at times be down right odd on a more note the actors more than succeed in conveying subtle and not so subtle <UNK> in their characters without getting too hokey one <UNK> wrote that it may take a couple of episodes to get into it and i agree it's definitely one that kind of grows on you but once you're in you're pretty much hooked and with good reason
<START> in <UNK> book length interview with hitchcock it's apparent that big <UNK> fear from the police dates back to his childhood his father sent him to the police station carrying a note the note said he's been naughty <UNK> him for an hour the policemen <UNK> and ever since hitchcock has had a deep fear of being wrongly accused and taken by the police br br strangers on a train is probably one of the best in his wrongly accused series the movie is based on a patricia <UNK> novel that's the same author who wrote the <UNK> series she was always fascinated by smart criminals br br hitchcock's opening is very strong and takes you immediately to the protagonists guy haines a famous <UNK> player and bruno anthony the aspiring criminal the two guys share a chemistry which in that day and age was probably a lot more than what the audience could chew bruno tries to <UNK> guy that they could commit the perfect murder leaving no clues if they switch victims bruno will kill guy's wife who wouldn't give him a divorce and guy would kill <UNK> father the motives are respectively love and money br br <UNK> performance is meant to be seductive and <UNK> this is not something that was done by accident in fact hitchcock edited two versions of the movie one us one uk in the us version the volume of <UNK> <UNK> was turned down quite a bit br br strangers on a train is a very deep movie but more importantly this is another excellent hitchcock thriller an excellent example of a thrilling scene is when guy is climbing the steps up to <UNK> father room hitchcock <UNK> that the audience's attention needed to be distracted at this point so that they don't figure out what guy will find in the room <UNK> treats us to a huge menacing dog at the top of the stairs which provided the needed distraction br br the most famous shot in the movie occurs during a <UNK> match bruno has been continuously stalking guy so that guy will <UNK> his end of the bargain kill his father when guy looks at the audience all the heads are back and forth all except one <UNK> he's looking straight at guy with an i'll get you smile br br the ending is another example of suspense both men fight for one key piece of evidence on a merry go round that's <UNK> at mad speed a worker is <UNK> under it so he could get to the controls when we finally get off this ride and the movie ends with guy proving his innocence we are left exhausted and nail less for those of us still biting our nails br br strangers on a train is easily one of hitchcock's best wrongly accused movies some credit him with one of the best villains bruno as well all in all the movie might appear somewhat dated but that's a lesson in thriller making from the master himself i won't turn down <UNK> if he came to teach me renaissance painting so neither should you br br review posted at com
<START> this movie does an excellent job of taking us all the way through the dark tunnel of espionage from the <UNK> through the ultimate <UNK> the movie's impact is made even deeper with the realization that it is based on a true story timothy <UNK> provides us with a quality understated performance and sean penn demonstrates why he is one of america's finest living actors as with midnight express this movie should make us all think twice about doing something we shouldn't be doing in a foreign country
<START> spoilers spoilers well seeing as i am a major h lots fan maybe i liked the movie more than normal people would however this movie is still excellent it had tons of surprises and it gave some more closure to the series while i was sad that <UNK> turned into a murderer the overall feeling i felt was satisfied
<START> the first time i saw this was when i was with a date and she thought it was an awesome movie i didn't br br the second time i saw this was last night on tv it still sucks br br as a love story this sucks as having julia portray a street hooker this is repulsive to me she was a <UNK> with a <UNK> and heels she had no tough shell to her she wasn't tortured <UNK> <UNK> starving or anything else her hooker character was so flawed like comparing a <UNK> to a diamond the two simply don't fit no matter what they look like br br the only cast i felt was worth watching was the 2 bitchy <UNK> whom were excellently cast they did such a fine job that i hated them for the few seconds that they were on screen they had real definition for the minor roles ok so the movie wasn't entirely trash the two ignorant <UNK> saved the film br br aside from those two women sales people the rest of the cast including the big names was just crap either everybody was an ass <UNK> or had absolutely no reason to fill any dialog in the movie aside from just <UNK> julia roberts or kissing ass to richard gere br br this was a movie about how when you walk around in high heels and a tight <UNK> in beverly hills people <UNK> at you and guys who work in <UNK> <UNK> as if they just had a baseball bat struck to their face br br while in reality the women who are dressed to the <UNK> in beverly hills are <UNK> and prostitutes to a higher degree but since they aren't wearing the <UNK> madonna looking jewelry or the <UNK> boots they can look down on the others who do br br the hotel cast was <UNK> sad to watch and anybody who had any real character had less than a minute of screen time br br this is an insult to romantic movies comedies dramas and even to prostitutes who face wealthy customers on a daily basis with hopes of having their lives work out perfect br br the story is about julia roberts being <UNK> yes <UNK> by a <UNK> in a business suit and <UNK> br br she is still owned still told how to act how to move what to wear what to say where to go and what to do he is more controlling than a street <UNK> but the folks at disney <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it up to make it easier to swallow br br had richard gere been a black man with a gold tooth and an <UNK> <UNK> at his side instead of an case this movie would be about how a woman has to struggle to get away from the <UNK> of prostitution same story different characters will make a very different <UNK> br br oh yeah change the white man for a black man or asian or spanish have the land business deal be changed to a deal of weapons or <UNK> and the entire concept of romantic comedy is thrown away br br as far as i'm concerned pretty woman is still trash dressed with <UNK> and <UNK> br br i didn't like it 15 years ago when i didn't understand it and was led by the hollywood hype i hate it now that i can see past the pretty <UNK> that is called love br br this movie is not a romantic comedy it's a story on how to control a woman as long as you have the means and <UNK> to do so br br this is an insult to strong women weak women and women in general as well as to my television screen br br do i hate it yes does it suck yes would i recommend it to you no well maybe if i really hated you br br will this review get posted we'll see br br <UNK> that's all for now
<START> i was at school in the late sixties and early seventies and this film is very much how my school was the school play where the leading actors kiss that happened at my school a crazy gang of <UNK> my school again only when we went on a cross country run we would have a smoke <UNK> the some one at my school broke in through a sky light and broke the after that they were kept in a safe and as for certain activities what can i say the film actually came out in 1982 i remember that as it was when i bought my house and the film was showing at the same time if you like british films and films about school growing up and period pieces then this is for you another film very much like it came out a few years before and i for one would like to see that again also is in the genre highly recommended but trust me 1982 is when it came out
<START> ok most of us agree that this is a weak attempt at a remake but at the same time it's also a different movie in its own right don't get me wrong <UNK> werewolf in <UNK> is a superior film but <UNK> remake in <UNK> is a decent movie as well br br first off the only real similarities are the title 2 american and werewolves other than those 3 things <UNK> remake in <UNK> stands apart fairly well on its own with its special blend of humor action adventure and horror most of the people who say this film is better than the original are the youth of today's generation that think any movie made before 1990 is total crap while those of us who grew up in the 80's can appreciate older films and what they have added to the horror films of today what a lot of people fail to realize is that without the old classic films including the b w ones horror wouldn't be what it is today now i'm getting a little off the beaten path br br an american werewolf in paris is a good attempt at re creating a classic but it will never <UNK> the original ever with that said this is still a very entertaining film to watch and i do recommend it i'm giving it a 7 out of 10 maybe that's being a little generous but i've seen much worse attempts at trying to re create a classic
<START> rented 3 bad movies to watch with my friends in my <UNK> room br br <UNK> 4 jack frost and the prey br br i picked up jack and 4 because they are well known bad movies i have never seen br br i picked this movie out because it matched the how to find a bad movie guide on <UNK> no real description no <UNK> of the movie on the back and i had never heard of it had to be a winner br br spoilers but this movie is so awful it doesn't matter p br br this is a true bad movie 4 and jack frost are dumb on purpose this is dumb despite the best efforts of the cast and crew br br this movie starts out much like evil dead even the actors look similar and have the same style of dress unlike evil dead it never <UNK> any speed at all for a slasher movie it is pretty bland in 80 minutes 6 people get killed but these are spread apart so far it becomes quickly boring br br the director threw in a lot of boring shots on animals hunting obviously to go along with the whole prey theme but they do nothing to advance the story and are quite boring the gore is horrible all these extra shots were to make up for lack of a script and story br br the last 5 minutes of the movie are shot mostly in slow motion yet another way to add length to this the climax is such a total joke its hard to laugh at it is so bad the back of the box says the ending will shock and haunt you yes it will it will shock you that someone could put such a bad plot twist on film and haunt you because you won't believe you paid to watch this crap br br also the <UNK> is its not human and it's got an axe one person is killed with an axe in the whole movie and it is off screen br br a true 1 out of 10 i love laughing at bad movies but this one is so bad that it even lacks campy qualities no bad movie night is compete without a true character building flick p
<START> red <UNK> is flawed weak and lacking even the camp <UNK> isn't good br br there are only two good things about red <UNK> the costumes even though the red <UNK> costume is ridiculous it's ironic that a girl who is even afraid to be touched by men because she was raped still choose to wear so few little clothes even when it <UNK> and the music by <UNK> <UNK> still the movie is somewhat watchable but certainly not <UNK> br br the story is extremely simple and they didn't even bother to make it interesting the story could have been forgotten if there had been some good action sequences and some humor both are present but are seriously flawed in many ways the movie takes itself too serious and tries to impress but fails completely br br <UNK> <UNK> is an horrible leading lady i don't know who's accent is worse hers or <UNK> and on top of that she can't act there is also absolutely no chemistry between the two characters which makes the love story totally unbelievable even worse was bergman as the main villain who acts more poorly than a paper bag ronald <UNK> was somewhat good in his role but my god he looked horrible he changed so much since his only well known role in <UNK> of the lost <UNK> maybe it had something to do with his illness which claimed his life in 1991 and by the way what was with all those <UNK> of the lost <UNK> actors in this movie next to ronald <UNK> pat roach terry richards and appeared in a role it seemed like some kind of <UNK> of the lost <UNK> reunion br br the only times when the movie gets a bit interesting is during the sword fights even though some of them are needless and weak br br only really watchable for the fans of the fantasy genre br br 4 10
<START> i was so moved by this film in 1981 i went back to the theater four times to see it again something i have never done for another film no movie evokes the feelings of growing up in the 60's like four friends that it so closely my own experiences in the 60's is probably something that many will share <UNK> is <UNK> beautiful and <UNK> why she didn't become a major star after this i will never know the acting by the entire cast is flawless as is steve script i always wanted to know how much of the story was <UNK> but alas steve is no longer here to answer that question i have all but worn out my vhs copy of this great movie highly recommended
<START> this movie is bad i saw the rated and the <UNK> versions they are terrible now i know it's suppose to be a low budget porn spoof of <UNK> but <UNK> is just not good at being bad good it's not funny not funny at all i wanted to laugh i tried to laugh but this movie let me down at least the <UNK> version has lots of nudity to look forward to and is it me because <UNK> is not a great looking woman from the <UNK> down she's okay but on the way up leaves much to be desired she does look good in that school girl outfit please if you must watch this <UNK> rent it first rated or <UNK> doesn't really make any difference they're both bad to me

<START> this is one of my favourite westerns what a cast glenn ford plays his role in his usual mild controlled but firm manner ford plays one of the smaller <UNK> in the shadow of the mighty anchor ranch that wants to swallow up the whole territory edward g robinson plays the crippled <UNK> of the anchor ranch and <UNK> stanwyck plays his sly scheming wife there is plenty of action in this western that is quite impressive the scenery is delicious and the <UNK> scope photography is breath taking and the soundtrack is <UNK> i would say that this western had a size able budget it looks expensive one of a series of great glenn ford westerns
<START> let me state this right from the start i do not hate this show i actually quite like some aspects of it in fact when i first started to watch it i quickly became hooked i was just starting to come out of the whole anime is for kids stereotype and the mature elements of the show had me intrigued br br unfortunately after seeing the whole series through and a few of the films i can say that my overall <UNK> has changed and it falls into almost all of the <UNK> that plague bad anime seven or eight friends and myself started watching this series on tv by the end only one friend and i were still watching and neither of us liked it br br allow me to explain the plot for you you can skip this paragraph if you don't want to know is an average high school student who one day falls into a magical well near her family run <UNK> when comes out of the well again she has been transported back in time to the <UNK> era of japan she meets up with many other characters and they form a group of five or so companions who set off on a journey of revenge justice <UNK> in one characters case overall they are trying to recover the pieces of the sacred jewel <UNK> which enhances the power of demons who use it br br while there are many many side stories and story <UNK> there is no were near enough material to <UNK> episodes the only story arc that is interesting enough to watch is still sort of dull the band of seven after the half way mark in the series or maybe even before it becomes painfully obvious that the plot is frozen in place and whoever made the series decided instead to put in dozens and dozens of filler episodes br br these episodes have little to no impact on the story and rarely even on the characters in some cases some characters who had an important role in the story will disappear for dozens of episodes at a time many episodes follow the exact same cookie cutter <UNK> as the stories before it <UNK> shoots wind <UNK> at enemy <UNK> characters gasp in horror enemy turns out to have <UNK> characters spent three episodes trying to kill enemy before finally fires sacred arrow at him and he turns to dust br br also major spoiler the conclusion will be revealed the lack of any conclusion makes it seem like you have <UNK> <UNK> hours br br major spoiler over br br the animation itself is above average and in some cases excellent even so <UNK> animation cells plague most action scenes and it is very hard to ignore them when it is clear that the exact same <UNK> has <UNK> past a character five or six times in a row br br on the <UNK> side however all of the characters are very well developed and the romances between some of the characters were truly captivating also the character designs <UNK> were brilliant and at times among the best i have seen particularly with the band of seven there is definitely no <UNK> of opportunities here even so i found myself hoping that a character would die just so there would be some sort of movement in the plot and some of the humour in the show between characters is used again and again one particular joke sit boy is found within the first five episodes and you can literally expect it to be used again and again for the remaining episodes br br although there are some good aspects of the show and it is easy to see why it has a huge following the series seems to be dominated by obsessed fan girls who <UNK> over and <UNK> br br bottom line definitely worth checking out but not worth watching the whole series the first 30 episodes are very clever original and enjoyable for anybody but after that it simply becomes dull and tedious watching a tv show should never feel like a chore but somehow this series <UNK> just that don't expect much from <UNK> because you will only feel let down
<START> i can't seem to find anything that is good about this miniseries why the hell would you <UNK> chocolate when u could <UNK> something far more practical like smoking or alcohol also the fact that its an australian program and its all set in england and everyone is <UNK> british accents is stupid overall i think that this show is unrealistic and cheap
<START> i love this film tense with great characters the kid from is excellent as is corey <UNK> when the kids storm the bank it is pure <UNK> inside of the bank it becomes a bit like a lord of the flies situation where they turn on each other justin walker from clueless is wonderful i saw this on showtime while channel surfing it was a pleasant surprise james <UNK> is also quite good here as the small town sheriff taylor <UNK> who i love from <UNK> does a nice job too as a federal agent i recommend this film for any fan of bank robbery movies with a lot of good characters i was shocked to discover that roger corman was a producer on this since the film is not a b movie
<START> this is the only movie that i can think of where after it ended i was <UNK> with anger at the waste of money and time on the part of myself and everyone involved in making it no wonder alan moore refused to have anything to do with v for <UNK> a phenomenal film after this <UNK> br br it's not bad in an entertaining way like <UNK> it's bad in a way that makes you want to claw your eyes out plot holes the size of planets the worst script in memory horrible acting by decent actors visuals that should be great but somehow flop br br it could have been so good
<START> this movie was so awful so boring so badly miscast it took a lot of work to make what should have been a sure thing into such a travesty i love lucille ball but she absolutely <UNK> in this movie too old couldn't sing sounded like a truck <UNK> <UNK> even when not singing and the biggest sin of all she wasn't funny even a little the studio shot themselves in the foot with this one and for ruining what should have been a fabulous screen version of a fabulous stage musical some other body parts deserve to have been wounded as well or perhaps they were already lacking those parts that might explain it but for lucy to think she was right for a part that required singing well that's the saddest thing of all it's a very good thing to know your limitations even a legend can't come out of a stinker like this and still smell like a rose
<START> from the second the music <UNK> second one of the movie and it was movie hack tripe i knew i was in for a very long ride <UNK> clichéd i laughed a lot and knew how the plot ended well before the ending they didn't use particularly well and the <UNK> and hair were kinda awful my particular favourite makeup moment is that the only way they age depardieu as far as i could see was by putting a straight hair wig on him instead of <UNK> i could go on about the ridiculous <UNK> of the music for a long time the movie could be improved <UNK> by an 18th century score br br <UNK> ah it's that horrible guy patrick doyle who's responsible for the score say no more he should not be allowed near historical movies he should stick to 20th century settings br br the visit to the notable people portion was also hilarious particularly his little visit to <UNK> <UNK> who was not particularly convincingly played br br i thought the only actor who appeared grounded in the century at hand was michael <UNK> as james murray he absolutely stole the show for all 30 seconds he was on screen <UNK> he made you see what the movie could have been br br the love scenes did have some heat the two leads were stunning together br br the most awful scene for historians is where they're at the big dinner in britain before <UNK> <UNK> and he lifts his glass and says the first two lines of how stands the glass around aka why soldiers why as if it's a <UNK> absolutely excruciating failure at <UNK> much better to leave it out thousands of people know the damn song and thousands more believe the <UNK> that <UNK> and company sang it probably drunk not all <UNK> like this bunch <UNK>
<START> wow they told me it was bad but i had no idea br br we've started a tradition we found one copy of this movie and we just pass it from person to person whoever has the movie watches it and then passes it to someone else deemed worthy of seeing this unique creative horrible movie hopefully it'll travel <UNK> the world a few times br br it's painful really painful it's even beyond so bad it's funny well okay sometimes it's so bad it's funny but most of the time it just gives you that feeling that there's something sucking at your brain from the inside br br wow watch it then pass it
<START> the twilight zone has achieved a certain mythology about it much like star trek that's because there are many devoted lovers of the show that no matter what think every episode was a winner they are the ones who score each individual show a 10 and cannot <UNK> <UNK> the show because of this a while back i reviewed all the original star trek episodes the good and the bad because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive now it's time to do the same for the twilight zone br br now i was very surprised when i saw reviews for this bland episode that described it as being among the best and gave it scores of 10 if this is the case then why is it that everyone i know who has seen this episode hates it as much as i do it's possible that me and my family and friends are all <UNK> but it's also possible this is yet another case of <UNK> fans <UNK> <UNK> the rating on an average or below average episode br br the episode itself stars william <UNK> and others as various <UNK> a soldier a dancer etc they are all stuck in a room with no escape and only at the end do you realize the shocking truth which isn't at all shocking and is in fact <UNK> lame no this is a badly written and <UNK> episode yes there were plenty of episodes of the series that deserved a 10 but few as <UNK> as this one due to a shallow script and an unappealing resolution
<START> poor old robert taylor other than the <UNK> nothing much has gone his way this almost shocker is a <UNK> ninety minutes and not much more it's one of those cheesy detective crime flicks with the narrative of the lead character the whole way through usually that's reserved for comedies these days but this film takes itself way too seriously a pity australian films particularly in the 2000 <UNK> periods have been of exceptional quality overall but i suppose there have got to be a few misses why even make a film like this that obviously isn't going to be any good
<START> basil <UNK> and <UNK> bruce return as sherlock holmes and dr watson in this superior tale of holmes battling the 3rd <UNK> and the mastermind genius of professor <UNK> the film opens up in switzerland as holmes is in disguise as an old he must bring dr and the bomb site to england before the germans can kidnap holmes succeeds and the germans the evil professor <UNK> manages to <UNK> scotland yard and dennis by kidnapping the only clue left by is a list of dancing men who will break the hidden code of dancing men holmes or <UNK> first can holmes prevent the bomb site from falling into the german hands thereby saving england from the <UNK> bombing techniques developed by bomb site watch and enjoy
<START> set in 1945 follows a failed swedish book editor who decides to take a non stop train to berlin unfortunately for everyone around him he's a walking disaster causing mayhem everywhere he goes the train also holds a man and his mistress scheming to murder the man's wife who's also on the train a soldier on his way home two gay elderly gentlemen an angry train conductor two nuns a bunch of <UNK> and even more people br br meant as a mix of noir ish thriller which it does quite well at least to begin with and comedy the film fails with both it doesn't sit right as the film changes tone with every new scene and as the train races towards its final destination the film turns more and more bizarre ending on a truly surreal note br br the good bits are wasted in a <UNK> of pointless plots and characters is packed with famous swedish actors no matter how small the part is it feels like the filmmakers <UNK> everyone they've ever worked with and offered them a part in the film too bad that the performances are just as bad as the script act your lines don't read them br br the comedy is more or less slapstick with the same jokes repeated over and over the pace is incredibly slow at times quite often actually with on scene in particular dragging on for about ten minutes for no good reason the screenwriter also seems to think that swearing is a good way to replace decent dialogue the film looks great though in moody b w but it's wasted on such inept film making in every other department 1 10
<START> the only print of i've been able to find was abysmal i almost couldn't watch it which is a shame as this is among the greatest films the story which i believe had been done before and since by other japanese directors is a bit <UNK> than my favorite films the <UNK> and and is essentially a tale of tragic romance in this case a <UNK> romance that crosses strict class boundaries as always with there is an <UNK> expressed tone of <UNK> and bad print aside i was very pleased as with all of films i'm eagerly awaiting a restored dvd release whenever that may come
<START> i this on turner classic just because it was pre code and sounded interesting when i got around to watching i noticed that the critique gave it one and a half stars on a four star scale i started watching with <UNK> even old movies can be bad movies but i quickly got engaged in the story and mary performance as the business brains behind a simple <UNK> rise to success not a truly great movie too predictable but certainly better than advertised and i would have liked to have seen more of <UNK> cortez as the man who <UNK> mary but won't give up his wealthy wife i'd recommend giving it a look just to appreciate <UNK> and what a long way we've come baby
<START> this is truly without <UNK> one of the worst slasher movies ever made i know it came out in the 80's following a tendency started by friday the 13th the prey copies the <UNK> mentioned movie in many aspects the woods setting the killer the dumb teens the gore etc br br but the prey is as bad as you might expect i didn't even remember about it if it wasn't for coincidence br br well the killer is in fact human so don't expect a supernatural killer in the likes of jason the situations rather boring and lack of tension gore violence etc it just does not works for a slasher flick br br the acting is simply horrid the score is horrible a combination of boring <UNK> with cheesy 80's tunes i won't even mention the technical aspects of the movie because believe me it seems that it cost only 20 dollars br br please avoid this one like the plague it's one of the worst movies i've ever seen and that's something to say thank god it seems to have <UNK> from earth
<START> horror genius <UNK> <UNK> is one of my personal favorite directors and his films <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> range high on my personal all time favorite list opera of 1987 is yet another <UNK> and brilliant film that no horror lover can afford to miss and that will keep you on the edge of your chair from the beginning to the end this stunning and ultra violent giallo could well be described as the <UNK> <UNK> film which is quite something considering that <UNK> films are not exactly known for the of their violence the violence is extreme and very stylized in a brilliant way that makes opera a film <UNK> nightmare br br warning spoilers ahead br br just when betty christina a young opera singer is becoming successful a murderous and incredibly sadistic psychopath starts stalking her the murders are truly brutal and of particularly sadistic nature the killer <UNK> <UNK> to the tied up <UNK> <UNK> so she has to keep them open and watch while he brutally murders people close to her in <UNK> ways when done with the <UNK> the killer releases betty and leaves just to come back for other friends of hers br br as usual for <UNK> films the violence is extremely graphic and very stylized opera truly is a brutal film and what a stylish and atmospheric film it is this film is absolutely <UNK> and pure suspense from the beginning to the end the performances are entirely very good especially christina is brilliant in the lead a stunning beauty and great actress alike fits perfectly in her role of the talented singer whose fear and horrid experiences are slowly making her crazy other great performances include those of ian <UNK> as a horror film director who is directing an opera and director <UNK> real life girlfriend daria who has a role in many of his movies the camera work is excellent as in all <UNK> films and the huge opera house is an excellent setting that contributes a lot both to the film's beauty and its <UNK> creepy atmosphere the score which is partly classical music and partly heavy metal is great too even though i slightly missed brilliant <UNK> rock <UNK> that are such a <UNK> element of most other <UNK> movies opera truly is a terrifying and absolutely breathtaking giallo experience this is an absolute must see for any horror lover and i highly recommend it to any other film fan who is not too sensitive when it comes to extreme violence excellent and absolutely <UNK>
<START> when watching this movie with it's <UNK> cause and effect wall to wall clichés and hackneyed sentiment can anyone be so naive as to think that this is actually how <UNK> life played out you watch it in a <UNK> of <UNK> hollywood <UNK> aren't based on the individual lives anymore they're just <UNK> of previously successful <UNK> if hollywood made a movie about your life it would be filled with such perfect <UNK> that you'd barely recognize your own story any personal complexity would be <UNK> by some all explaining simplistic <UNK> your story would resemble rocky because it's the only life arc hollywood knows how to produce anymore we couldn't leave the audience <UNK> anything left open ended as they exit this movie doesn't trust an audience to figure things out without being led to them i perceived the captain hook mother reference <UNK> before the movie it for me i could see the 25 kids twist coming for days br br this is a completely average movie not horrible but not great hence it's likely to be <UNK> with a few oscars next year there's nothing the academy likes better than <UNK> itself for finally <UNK> <UNK> put in place over the previous thirty years br br from the new <UNK> article lost boys by anthony lane br br arthur davies also <UNK> his boys and it may be unfair of finding <UNK> to <UNK> him for <UNK> purposes from the scene by the time that johnny <UNK> meets kate <UNK> she is already a widow whereas arthur was very much alive when <UNK> first entered the little by little the the davies family br br finding <UNK> is a <UNK> from the moment that <UNK> met george and jack and started to <UNK> the means by which they might be rendered immortal the story is sad but the reality is even more dismal davies dies from cancer of the jaw dies of lung cancer the five boys are <UNK> <UNK> is made their guardian is killed in the first world war fighting with his <UNK> in <UNK> an <UNK> at <UNK> is drowned while swimming with a friend the two bodies when <UNK> are found <UNK> together br br on april 5 1960 peter davies by then an <UNK> <UNK> threw himself under a subway train in london we should not presume to read a mind in torment but we may note in passing that if he had lived another month he would have reached the <UNK> of <UNK> birth and thus one <UNK> a fresh <UNK> of interest in peter pan  that terrible masterpiece in the words of peter davies
<START> the australian public and the australian film industry are often heard to complain that there are not enough great aussie films around or that they are all the same br br well in this case this film is not a <UNK> copy of other australian films it is unique it will make you laugh out loud it will make you cry and it will make you feel really good about yourself br br the casting of this film is superb and the acting is second to none the script and the photography colour light etc is wonderful but more important this is a great film i don't want to talk about the plot as i think it is always best to see a film knowing as little about it as possible suffice to say this film will appeal to a wide range of audiences take your girlfriend take your mum take your friends for a great evening out br br 10 10
<START> after seeing meredith in beyond the <UNK> i had to buy another film with her staring i cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick it's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on meredith as she moves across the screen save your money until the tv network comes out with a dvd on beyond the <UNK> it's worth it at any price this one needs to pay you to see br br this pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman perhaps some of her latest might fit but i haven't seen them she has the smile of a <UNK> bell and eyes of dana <UNK> with a much younger body br br
<START> i have just seen today you die it is bad almost very bad br br 1 the direction and editing are awful just awful almost made me turn off the movie the director has no idea what he is doing he seems to be filming things at random and some scenes don't make sense at all also i hate it when the same scene is used again in the same movie in this movie some scenes were used 3 or 4 times pretty bad br br 2 the dialogue is sometimes good sometimes awful i like the fact that they wanted to make <UNK> character and character seem like they were in a similar relationship to the characters in lethal weapon but it did not work simply because some of the dialogue did not make sense and i speak english very well it's not that i did not understand the words it was the fact that the jokes and dialogue lines had no meaning whatsoever br br 3 the script is pretty bad why do they always try to <UNK> <UNK> action movies <UNK> wife in the movie has psychic abilities why is it useful to the movie no seagal <UNK> a whole bunch of people who work for the guy who betrayed him and he knows these people without having ever met them in the movie stupid the story sometimes goes off track and the jumps back without any reason the story is messy and pointless sometimes they should have kept it simple and it would have worked br br 4 in some of the action scenes it is not seagal it is his stunt double you can tell because they only film him from behind and never show his face he also beats the guys with movie martial arts not real ones like the <UNK> steven knows the stunt double uses cheesy kicks and punches br br 5 steven is good in the movie 90 95 of the lines are said with his real voice the rest is dubbing but it is not that bad this was good also steven seems to be enjoying himself in the movie and is more into the action that he was in <UNK> he likes as a partner at least he does not seem to dislike him also he seems to have been in better shape than in some of his recent movies i hate the fact that he wears clothes to hide his body but in the same clothes that he wears on the dvd cover he looks more than ok and he should have wore those clothes for most of the movie not the stupid long leather coat br br i really think that seagal was willing to make a good movie the fact that he came late and took off early from the set on two movies directed by does not look like a coincidence to me i think he realized that the crew were amateurs or only in it for a quick buck and he did not give a damn anymore br br in the hands of a better company and crew this might have been a damn good action movie for seagal something like out for justice or above the law i honestly believe that but the people who made the movie are not very good at their jobs or they did not have enough money to do the job properly too bad since i liked steven in the movie and was cool ice cool too but the rest was bad hey at least this gives me hope for black dawn and shadows of the past i think that <UNK> might be just as badly handled but hey steven seemed to be back into the same mood he was in while making his better movies and at least that is reason enough to watch the movie br br i liked it but it could have been so much better 4 10
<START> i didn't like underdog i mean it was really unnecessary and needed a big face lift and then it would have been maybe passable but for the main part i didn't like it this wasn't like any other kid movie its one of those movies that wanted parents who grew up watching the cartoon to come with there kids to come see this i am neither of them so the film didn't appeal to me in the slightest i had some problems with it like i don't think jason lee was the right voice for underdog it made it him sound sloppy and really <UNK> then it was really predictable which makes you feel tired and mad the humor was really what made me mad it was just to unfunny and somewhat pathetic the one thing that bothered me the most thought was how almost everything out of mouth was sarcastic or rude the acting was passable but needed a little improvement if you have kids they might enjoy it but if your not a kid by all means see it you might like it unlike me 3 4 stars out of 10
<START> this movie was recommended to me by some <UNK> from their comments i had some pretty <UNK> expectations but this movie was nothing but disappointing the aim of the director is obvious to use an <UNK> of speeches <UNK> as a way to argue against the bush <UNK> but the director fails miserably at this also i seriously question the director's choice of main character it's a bum who is definitely not worthy of being heard the rise of corporation power so what most importantly this movie gets a failing score in its <UNK> power it's clearly intended for those who've already formed their opinions it's true that the movie's <UNK> are quite pleasing but pretty much everything else in the movie simply sucks
<START> i have done some research on ed and i have found a few interesting things like the fact that ed was quiet and a loner not some buff over bearing jerk as in this movie i will say that i didn't finish this movie but i will i will cringe through the fact that all of us talk like we are from you know the funny but oh so sad factor in this movie is <UNK> isn't as hot as they made it look br br this movie is not only an insult to <UNK> people being a myself but it is a complete insult to a man that was proved to be an insane lonely man he killed two people and the movie couldn't even get that right ed didn't get that close and personal and scare people he shot the two and only people he killed so why do these movies lie and say based on a true story this is not based on nothing but the lies the director came up with in his foul head br br a joke and nothing more br br ok i would like to add on to this i did finish this oh so sad movie and i personal would like to laugh at the director do your <UNK> when making a movie i would like to inform you that there are no mountains for those who have never been in <UNK> and oh there is no desert what the hell there was more <UNK> trees and snow in <UNK> and that was suppose to be shot in br br ok for those who know nothing about ed <UNK> i would like to give you your history lesson ed <UNK> was thought to have killed his family but it was never proved he killed a bartender she was shot at bar close when no one was around he took the dead bartender back to his house 10 years later he shot and killed the store clerk he the cash register and the store truck he was caught because of this murder he came in the day before when her son was there and asked about <UNK> the day he killed her he was in there buying the <UNK> and the that only had was the only evidence they had to start a world wide man hunt he robbed graves in fact in robbed <UNK> graves he hate the people he <UNK> up and he made <UNK> shades <UNK> <UNK> and other things br br he had a family that he had dinner with once and awhile and they threw all the meat he ever gave them out when he was caught considering he was caught at their house he was arrested and <UNK> in the back of a cop car in fear of what may happen to him how do i know all of this i read the book the judge that tried him wrote br br after this movie was over after watching the whole horrific thing not only am i offended by the directors view on what <UNK> women look like i mean it was hard to tell who this guy had on the <UNK> half the time you know cause <UNK> women are all <UNK> please i am overly offended by the lack of <UNK> this guy did and the poor job he did making this movie i have no idea who this kane guy is and i think he may be ok in something else but he did a horrible job playing ed <UNK> br br after all of this i am so sad i wasted the 3 99 on the movie br br movie after finished was completely untrue this movie is like me saying that the world is flat and george washington wasn't our first president come on people that is your history and this is history to end this rant how would all of you feel if i made a movie and george washington looked like brad pitt some of you may think that is fine but it would be not true and he lived and wasn't the president and whatever you can't rewrite history
<START> at the beginning of we're introduced to three <UNK> of seemingly unrelated characters to make matters even more confusing we're informed via titles on the screen that the action is taking place in three separate time lines between the years 1999 and 2001 it takes a great deal of time but eventually we come to see how the three <UNK> are related mark austin a young man in his <UNK> gay and hiv positive is estranged from his conservative parents elizabeth and <UNK> robert austin br br mark is now a drifter and arrives in beach north <UNK> a <UNK> town where he meets george <UNK> played by michael kelly a gay motel owner and they eventually become involved with each other meanwhile <UNK> birth mother grace played by bonnie hunt has come to the point in her life where she has decided to find the son she gave up for <UNK> when she was 17 similarly <UNK> <UNK> mother also has decided to track her estranged son as she misses him despite the <UNK> of her <UNK> minister husband br br we're told is based on a true story and that perhaps is its <UNK> <UNK> director writer tim tries too hard to create scenes <UNK> with dramatic tension where there is very little to be found take mark and both sensitive souls who have little to disagree about there's some slight tension when grace faces off against an <UNK> agency director who is forbidden by law to give her any information about her lost son as well as a slight conflict with her mother who <UNK> that she of her when she became pregnant as a teenager no sparks fly either between elizabeth and robert since the good <UNK> has <UNK> insisted from the beginning that he has no intention of <UNK> with his son br br is similar to in that the gay couple are the good guys and the straight males for example the beach cop and the <UNK> are the baddies the biggest letdown of the movie is that there is no interaction and hence no dramatic conflict between mark and either one of his mark is already dead before either the birth or <UNK> mother has a chance to <UNK> with him br br theme is both a <UNK> for tolerance and an for family members to express their heartfelt feelings before it's too late sentiments are for the most part well <UNK> but they do not make for good drama <UNK> moves along at a <UNK> pace without providing any new revelations or suspense regarding such topics as aids <UNK> and <UNK> ultimately fails due to a lack of originality
<START> i am a huge fan of the <UNK> game huge fan it still holds a place in my top 10 games list of all time the story line was new fresh a truly brilliant foundation to base a movie on or so i thought br br <UNK> the movie is no less than another directors attempt at <UNK> in on a successful game franchise see doom the movie and many more br br the video game begins as the player jack <UNK> <UNK> in a sea side cave after been shot off his boat by an <UNK> from an unknown soldier jack then finds a communication device where <UNK> doyle <UNK> him across islands <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> to find his lady friend valerie <UNK> all the <UNK> battling mutated super soldiers and <UNK> enhanced animals br br the movie plays out very very differently 1 there's a needless 30 mins 1 3 of the movie of <UNK> before we even get to the blowing <UNK> scene 2 jack then walks onto the beach kills some <UNK> then drives off nothing like the game 3 there is no <UNK> with doyle on the other end 4 the <UNK> look like with on and there was no mutated <UNK> <UNK> creatures jumping out of the <UNK> a part of the <UNK> game i enjoyed <UNK> 5 there is no sun filled beach scenes no aircraft <UNK> no <UNK> stations on huge <UNK> little reference to any in game <UNK> characters items vehicles in fact no attempt to follow the story line at all 6 the climactic <UNK> scene from the game is replaced with an old industrial building 7 there's an ending scene where everyone except live happily ever after what the br br i recommend avoiding this movie at all costs if you are a <UNK> you will hate this movie will all your soul it is a movie clearly intended for males so girls stay away so if your a male 12 <UNK> years of age have never played <UNK> and are not disgusted by directors attempts at books games to the cinema then this is for you
<START> 1999 adaptation of <UNK> park is far superior to this ostensibly slightly more faithful film the 1999 film is <UNK> by many austen <UNK> but i admire the job did in making <UNK> park her own it may not be strictly jane <UNK> <UNK> park but at least it was well written beautifully shot and well acted by a superior cast i don't see how austen <UNK> can be any happier with this 2007 version from <UNK> and <UNK> on masterpiece theatre <UNK> the screenplay is <UNK> <UNK> together and <UNK> down to boot the production values are lackluster and the cast apart from redgrave and blake are largely guilty of bad acting i can't think of a worst miscast than <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> price her look was all wrong <UNK> hair and dark <UNK> and her talent simply wasn't suited to the material sir thomas looked <UNK> the whole time michelle ryan as <UNK> was on <UNK> as were the actors who portrayed the <UNK> when i think how superior <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> were in the <UNK> version i just kinda shake my head br br i haven't seen the 1983 version so i can't comment on it but i'd advise anyone who's curious to give the <UNK> version a chance read the novel before or after and make up your own mind
<START> first and foremost i'd like to state for the record that it's incredibly dumb to call your movie <UNK> when the subject matter exclusively revolves on scientific research performed on <UNK> animal as well as human aged 12 16 weeks the <UNK> stage is over at the end of the <UNK> <UNK> week and from that moment on the unborn <UNK> enters the <UNK> phase okay in all honestly i didn't know all this but i took the effort of looking it up and that's the also the least thing the creators of <UNK> could have done don't worry i'm not just stumbling over details or being <UNK> bitter as there are several more reasons to state why <UNK> is a huge failure actual science can be considered as boring and <UNK> and thus science fiction is a cinematic genre created especially to make the otherwise tedious yet educational science topics more interesting and <UNK> to larger audiences by depicting ambitious scientific experiments that go horribly wrong or space missions that encounter evil aliens instead of light years of void filmmakers usually manage to entertain people with spectacular special effects and at the same time teach them useful little trivia about science in order to make a good or at least halfway decent science fiction movie writers and directors only have to <UNK> with one basic rule don't be boring if they can't fulfill this one condition the viewer might as well read a <UNK> accurate book something must have gone wrong during the production of ralph <UNK> <UNK> the basic premise is potentially fascinating and even involving as we're all sensitive about saving the lives of unborn babies there also were some very prominent names involved in the production like main stars rock hudson giant seconds diane <UNK> <UNK> alice doesn't live here anymore and director nelson himself was responsible for the acclaimed classics soldier blue and <UNK> then what went wrong simple the script is <UNK> boring clichéd and the whole thing looks incredibly foolish because the lab scenery scientific equipment is clearly too primitive to achieve any medical <UNK> with br br rock hudson in a very poor performance plays a doctor who hasn't put any passion in his research work ever since his wife passed away when his car hits a pregnant dog on a rainy night his passion returns and he does everything possible to save the dying <UNK> <UNK> he manages to keep one <UNK> alive <UNK> its growth process and trains it to become an extremely intelligent dog because his <UNK> is so successful dr paul convinces his friend at the hospital to repeat his <UNK> with the human <UNK> taken from the <UNK> of a pregnant teenager who committed suicide the female subject unexpectedly keeps growing at a fast rate however and after only a couple of weeks she's a full grown ravishing and super intelligent woman the good doctor naturally falls in love with her but the groundbreaking new growth treatment also begins to show horrible side effects absolute nothing happens during the first 45 minutes of the film apart from a lot of implausible and overly melodramatic <UNK> <UNK> and one or two deeply impressive tricks performed by the dog that second half of the film does contain a little bit of grotesque action and suspense but by then the stupidity of the dialogs and the implausible plot twists already ruined the potentially fabulous sci fi idea there are some really cool scenes most notably the chess showdown between victoria and <UNK> <UNK> in a highly memorable and ultra obnoxious supportive role the grand finale is <UNK> grotesque and literally on the verge of ridiculous and it almost feels like ralph nelson put in that final disastrous shot because it was the general rule in contemporary thriller sci fi cinema the last sequence including the horrible freeze frame shot at the end certainly doesn't fit the tone of the previous 100 minutes of the film but anyway my sincere admiration and respect to the dog and his <UNK> an animal with such intellect and talent surely deserved to demonstrate its tricks in a much better film
<START> just in case the title didn't give it away this movie is garbage br br short review yeah br br i decided to spend as much time writing this review as hollywood probably decided to put into the script i doubt it'll be published considering how poorly i <UNK> everything but if this is and anyone reads it stick to <UNK> the first movie it completely surpasses its predecessors in every single way the sequels aren't ever worth buying or seeing and everyone involved in making them should be ashamed for ruining what has to be one of the most classic original films of our childhood
<START> in watching this off and on for a few seasons two things come to mind one wondering what kind of girl wants to be a model and two run to the nearest ice cream store and have a low fat <UNK> br br i tried to be a fan because i liked the idea of this reality show competition no other famous model thought of this and it is very admirable for <UNK> banks to do so but as the series goes on and on i've come to the conclusion that this is a sorry lot of folks trying to make a mountain out of a women shouldn't watch this teens should stay clear of it unless they're doing book reports on the subject br br many women try out for <UNK> to compete for <UNK> next top model they live together cat fight together cry together get put through pointless <UNK> shoots with pointless <UNK> people and and get eliminated and almost all of them claim you will see me again heck i'm trying to see what happened to the ones that did win actually br br this is the dream of some girls and good for them in watching this i hope the other girls that see this and run like <UNK> the other way like to college br br i just happened to watch more of this recent season because of the <UNK> of full figured models joining the group that even made me think more of this as a sorry lot of folks the full figured models were no more than average sized ladies competing with what i think is the <UNK> group of models they ever chose so of course that would make them look even <UNK> a <UNK> use all the time bad bad <UNK> and crew br br but to be fair <UNK> next top model is not about full figured models it's about <UNK> an imagined image a beauty that can be mass <UNK> and sold as the ultimate in beauty and this show is just looking for the next fresh piece of meat to add to the mix hence the name of the show hence the sorry lot of judges <UNK> <UNK> hence <UNK> and her consistent this was me <UNK> every camera angle you can get but then again that is the one thing i like about this show the ex model giving others who wouldn't have the chance a chance to enter the doors but after that everything else is status <UNK> for that industry which is why there are no surprises or week to week interest in the program
<START> it's certainly a direct to video but the story is not as bad as most of the other reviewers think i quite like the fact the hero is doing the wrong thing most of the time br br the hero's reactions and the reactions of the rebels are just human the hopper character is actually playing god that might be the right thing to do but one may not like that anyway br br in the end the god player is doomed to death and the hero who would have spent his own life can live quite a <UNK> br br the most unrealistic thing i saw is that earth is doing so well with no moon its <UNK>
<START> strange but acceptable mob comedy that has an undercover fbi agent matthew <UNK> <UNK> with a <UNK> concerned widow michelle to tie two murders on a <UNK> mob boss dean <UNK> br br the movie shows that it doesn't have to go over the top just to be funny and director jonathan <UNK> the silence of the <UNK> philadelphia keeps the movie from looking like it being was restrained that's good and it avoids being too
<START> if you're a sane person and you have seen films before then you cannot tolerate this piece of for more than 20 minutes and if you do stay there longer then it won't be because you'd expect akshay or <UNK> not govinda please but because you value your money too much and you want at least a short <UNK> on the <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> in return of the money they robbed you off its hard to believe that the director who gave us a cult film like can fall to such levels alright he's repetitive but now he's coming out of all third rate <UNK> and expects us to laugh because he's brought in <UNK> <UNK> and akshay kumar no sir this ain't going to work now especially with this stupid script of yours even comedy films can have meaningful scripts <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> anyone br br govinda doesn't have much to do so can't comment akshay kumar was boring <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> some of the worst joke possible lara <UNK> had real scope for acting in this one but she fails miserably the only high point of the film possibly is <UNK> acting but she's there only for the first 10 minutes br br i don't think this film is worth any more space probably not even this much so final warning don't watch it
<START> the prey has an interesting history unless you remember the ads for it in <UNK> in june of 1984 you might have caught it on the movie channel back in summer 85 but little else is remembered the plot is your basic killer in the woods again but ironically this was filmed before friday the 13th the prey was actually shot sometime in 1978 according to one of the actors in an interview years later but released for about a week at some drive ins yes jim drive in showed this in june of <UNK> but it has a dated look to it maybe they released it so later on to cash in on all the other terror films the market was <UNK> with by 1984 now on the story it has some kind of back story a forest fire back in the 1940's leaves a lot of <UNK> burned to death but one of their children survive our monster so flash forward to present day which would be 1978 we have an older middle age couple camping only to be <UNK> by the monster the tag line for this picture claims its not human and its got an axe but an axe was only used in these first two killings now we have a bunch of teenagers who look like they in their mid <UNK> camping we all know they are the prey and the monster knocks them of one by one for an 80 minute movie it seems longer we also have a lot of <UNK> footage to fill in <UNK> for the 80 mins overall for being out into an 80 's horror movie it looks way more 70's than ever hey the prey had potential to be a good horror killer in the woods movie but falls a little short it does however feature a pretty scary cool looking monster at the end and we have to wait till the last 2 minutes to see him side note the monster has gone on to star in the <UNK> family movies in the 1990's
<START> where this movies <UNK> from traditional hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings in europe for example we've had years of war and though one nation could never <UNK> the other the old enemies always ended living next to each other or with each other at the end of the conflict in the us the immigrants white population <UNK> the <UNK> population to near <UNK> the us citizen never had to live with its enemy this explains in my view the often simplistic nature of hollywood movie when they try and explain a foreign country's <UNK> but in this movie the director and screenplay did not fall into this cliché it turns out everyone in the story has some right and some wrong it's a great story of morality hidden truth and compromise
<START> i didn't think this movie was very good at all basically they took a bunch of one liners from various shirley temple movies threw them together and had <UNK> act like shirley temple acted on screen oh my goodness was said quite a number of times if you are familiar with shirley temple movies you will recognize several lines direct from her movies the trouble is they have <UNK> saying these in <UNK> everyday life in the end what we get is a <UNK> of re created shirley temple movies instead of any sort of real look into shirley <UNK> life save yourself the trouble and rent shirley temple movies it's a lot better than watching <UNK> try and recreate <UNK> acting style
<START> second husband is an amateurish attempt at <UNK> with more to fault than to praise the plot is <UNK> the story monotonous the acting poor the execution second rate etc not worth the time unless maybe your a relative of one of the actors <UNK> d
<START> this made for tv film is about every cliché you can come up with for a disaster movie the only problem is it isn't very well done br br my brain is still insulted from the scenes in which brian <UNK> is supposedly looking at a computer <UNK> looking for weather pattern data and showing on that <UNK> are stock footage scenes of weather turmoil ala the weather channels commercials why would watching local news footage of a washed out side street give insight to global weather <UNK> you got me br br also interspersed through out the first two hours are some of the worst cgi effects known to man watch for the semi truck and the airplane that look like they were rendered on a <UNK> 64 br br all the <UNK> in this movie is done with the subtlety of a <UNK> the dialog is forced and i can't think of a likable character that i want to survive the second half br br the character i hate the most is the stupid wife who's husband is cheating maybe if she lifted a finger at anytime during the show instead of being a helpless woman who stands in the the same 10 square feet of the kitchen all day her husband wouldn't be sleeping with the <UNK> <UNK> for a rival energy company she is so helpless in fact i want to put her out of her and my misery i hope everyone in this movie dies in the second half
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a wonder in this he makes such a good <UNK> the role given here for george cole was made for him hence the casting job on this film was perfect i think it was one of those rare occasions where everything <UNK> the story line was good the comic dialogue a scream and the older <UNK> girls a delight each character you are <UNK> to even the villains why can't we make films like this any more basically this is a very english comedy with good movement and <UNK>
<START> while mind of <UNK> could be summed up as nothing more than a clone of <UNK> show it is really worse than that first of all carlos <UNK> is a that is as funny as he is original which isn't saying much the show contains lame spoofs of american television ads and political issues and <UNK> comedic insight on politics adds to the low quality of this show on top of it all <UNK> <UNK> in more lame ethnic jokes and stolen jeff <UNK> lines than i can count on one hand while every once in a while carlos gets a cheap laugh the rest of the time he spends insulting everyone in sight which does include <UNK> his own audience members with the exception of south park drawn together and friday night stand up this show marks the end of the <UNK> show glory days which for those of you who haven't heard was before he went to africa
<START> only three words are really required for this review piece of crap br br if you enjoyed watching the cartoon as a child you will find this movie to be a complete waste of your time and money the best thing about your two hours in the <UNK> will be your feet sticking to the floor br br yes they do use all of the names and catch phrases the even name the dog in reference to the dog being boy in the cartoon they name the love interest polly but she isn't miss sweet polly br br my wife and son drug me to see this they should have drugged me to see it br br the original underdog was voiced by <UNK> cox the ultimate nerd this one is voiced by someone with a smart teenager that knows more than all the adults attitude br br as a stand alone movie it is awful as an homage to underdog it is even worse it is not an homage it is not a retelling of the story it is not an <UNK> of the story it is purely an attempt to cash in on a known title and create <UNK> the next time i go to the store i fear that i will see underdog toys <UNK> <UNK> sheets clothing etc <UNK> and <UNK> king probably fought over the kid's meal rights for this br br the worst part of this movie however is the soundtrack they do the underdog theme song to rap read that with a silent c at the beginning great now that we are going to destroy something let's go all the way br br i knew that it would probably be bad before i went my fears were confirmed when i arrived at my local 12 <UNK> and found that they opened it for the first day and first showing in their smallest <UNK> and one of only four without stadium <UNK> even the theatre people knew it was going to be garbage save your money on the tickets and <UNK> it better by going out and buying the original series on dvd it will be more entertaining and have better production values
<START> the second live action outing for <UNK> is far better than the glued together elements of ten different stories that was called the first film instead staying fairly close to the original comic br br in a nutshell queen <UNK> has made a bet with to build a palace in egypt to show that the <UNK> are a great people royal architect seeks the help of <UNK> and <UNK> to complete his task there are several laugh out loud moments some jokes that only the french might get <UNK> at the 35 hour week while others that are more universal the big budget special effects are spectacular but overshadowed by the jokes from the original comic br br depardieu and <UNK> still work brilliantly as a pair while monica <UNK> makes perfect casting as <UNK> also for fans of the comics the hilarious pirates get a look making up for their absence in film 1
<START> i tried to watch this adaptation but it was just so awful i couldn't torture myself like that the performances were quite sub par with the exception of ariel fonda was way over the top in a role that should be handled with some subtlety i have studied shakespeare and seen many adaptations and this is by far the worst one i have ever seen i have to wonder why on earth someone made this film shakespeare can and has been beautifully adapted in many cases this is not one of them if you must watch this film may i suggest a drinking game take a drink every time they go off book from the original idea and two drinks every time fonda overacts you should be quite drunk in a very short time
<START> this is an amazingly well filmed early <UNK> adaptation of the eugene o'neill play its major <UNK> is a static camera and as a result it comes off much of the time as the filmed play it is which is a pity for it's a good piece of primitive <UNK> made at a time when sound was posing all kinds of technical problems and as a result most films were experimental whether or not this was their <UNK> intention garbo is as mysterious and charismatic as she was in her silent films and her entrance is still classic her voice is strangely deep almost <UNK> which only enhances her already <UNK> eccentric persona as her boyfriend charles <UNK> is appropriately <UNK> he was apparently born <UNK> and a perfect counterpart to the divine garbo his irish <UNK> is not bad at all and he seems always a natural man of the sea very o'neill like in his independent brooding nature as <UNK> very confused father george marion seems truly from another time he has the sort of face and voice open <UNK> totally without <UNK> that has <UNK> from the earth marie <UNK> is also in the o'neill swing of things her blank expression and intensity around the eyes speaks volumes as she plays her <UNK> character as a woman at times <UNK> on <UNK> poetic license perhaps as this is not in the script but we can forgive miss <UNK> <UNK> she is too good at it not to the story ends with a movement to the next thing as distinct from resolution which isn't the author's cup of tea and those who like their films neatly worked out in the end will be disappointed by the absence of any real surprise in anna christie we are in o'neill country a place of sea <UNK> and fog a feeling of all <UNK> and <UNK> which we would now call or anxiety <UNK> rather than analyze this mood the author simply and wisely presents it as weather land ocean and people <UNK> and address one another in a unique language we feel to have heard
<START> this film set the standard for all rock <UNK> to follow it accomplished this through the energetic performances of the leads the <UNK> of the camera work avoiding <UNK> <UNK> clichés that were actually invented for the beatles in their first two films tight editing and a non <UNK> presentation of the star as human being rather than symbol or god or demon yes there are minor holes in the plot and incidental details that are a little unnecessary and there will always be debate between families of those personally involved as to <UNK> but the issue here as in the much more recent i walk the line or carpenter's famed tv elvis biopic of the same era is whether the meaning of the <UNK> life in its time and place as a <UNK> for <UNK> ideals and appreciation is made <UNK> in the performance and this is clearly the case here we come away from this movie understanding not only how buddy holly became a star but why i don't see what else one could want from the film
<START> are sea side <UNK> the sad dreary places they're always depicted as in movies and novels certainly this movie along with the near contemporary don't look now depicts <UNK> as a particularly <UNK> and <UNK> tourist trap for a more light hearted approach see just married with <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> murphy having never been to <UNK> i can't say for sure but it does make a perfect setting for this somber but <UNK> spectacle from <UNK> visconti one of the great of world cinema having seen the movie i now wish i had gotten around to reading the thomas mann <UNK> it's based on which also inspired an opera by sir benjamin <UNK> since i don't know the back story and the movie has little in the way of plot or exposition i'm left wondering about <UNK> <UNK> 's obsession with young is he a homosexual a <UNK> or is his longing for the beautiful youth something more innocent perhaps reminds him of what he could have been and now knows he never will be those who complain of the slow pace of this movie should stick to car crashes and kung fu at 2 hours and 15 minutes it's not particularly long and it moves at a <UNK> but hardly <UNK> pace the film benefits from the ravishing music of <UNK> on whom character is clearly based <UNK> <UNK> gives a moving performance and the movie is <UNK> by the presence of one of <UNK> great <UNK> as mother
<START> everything is <UNK> is a <UNK> interpretation of something more than half of the jonathan <UNK> <UNK> novel this version is more about changes in eastern europe from world war ii through post cold war and how the younger generation relates to that history as a family memory br br debut director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> some of the humor and language <UNK> of the novel mostly through the marvelous eugene as the u s <UNK> <UNK> tour guide he is so eye catching that the film becomes more his odyssey into his country and his family as he goes from his comfortable <UNK> in sophisticated <UNK> to the heart of a cynical isolated land that has been <UNK> by through the <UNK> and now <UNK> with both jews and non jews as <UNK> as funny as his opening scenes are when he <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> we later feel his fish out of in his own country when he tries to ask directions of local <UNK> br br uses <UNK> wood as the american tourist as an up tight <UNK> in a visual <UNK> as his character is less verbal than as one of the <UNK> in the book he and play off each other well until the conclusion that becomes more sentimental in this <UNK> plot once the <UNK> story takes over in the last quarter of the film <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> by boris the younger generation does not seem to <UNK> any <UNK> as they just <UNK> up the closure br br <UNK> does a wonderful job <UNK> the human urge to document history one of his <UNK> in the credits is professor and her style of remembering pre holocaust life through <UNK> clearly inspired the look and it is very powerful and effective br br the czech republic stands in for the <UNK> and the production design staff were able to find memorable symbols of change in the cities towns and countryside as this is now primarily a road movie and the long driving scenes do drag a bit <UNK> <UNK> some of the symbolism from the book particularly of the moon and river but having cut out the portions of the book that explain those they just look pretty or ominous for atmosphere and no longer represent time and fate br br as w c fields would have predicted the dog steals most of his scenes for easy laughs in general <UNK> does go for more <UNK> than the book it is <UNK> touching especially for those who haven't read the book but less morally and emotionally messy br br the film is enormously <UNK> by its marvelous soundtrack which <UNK> from songs and from gypsy band to traditional tunes to contemporary tracks to paul <UNK> score br br this is not a holocaust film per se being a kind of mirror image of the train of life train de <UNK> as about memory of a time that is <UNK> with meaning now but will <UNK> more with those who have an emotional connection to that history
<START> i'm glad this was the last of the <UNK> universal mummy movies the movies were all of qualities and this movie was definitely one of the lesser ones br br problem is that it's a very slow moving movie in which basically nothing interesting or exciting is ever happening perhaps it would had all been better if the mummy had made his entrance earlier on in the movie instead now the movie once again spends its first 20 minutes explaining what had all happened in the previous mummy movies by also once again using archive footage from this time the mummy from 1932 again to which this movie is the fourth mummy movie following the 1932 mummy story the movie just never knows to find the right pace and even though the movie is barely over an hour long it still feels a bit like a drag br br it of course also doesn't help that the movie has a rather simplistic and actually very little interesting story the movie also feels quite disjointed the first and second half of the movie don't really connect to each other and they seemed like two separate movies on their own br br at least <UNK> <UNK> jr is still in it he once more <UNK> the role of the mummy <UNK> for the third time too bad that he has such limited screen time this time he gets unfortunately very little interesting to do which is also a big waste of the mummy character itself the movie is further more filled with dozens of silly actors who are playing around with silly accents it seemed so totally unnecessary to me that most of the characters had to speak with such an accent and it actually gets quite distracting and annoying at points br br the mummy movies that's least worth seeing br br 4 10
<START> penelope of wayne's world fame made her mark with the documentary the decline of western civilization about the la punk scene in the late '70s and early '80s most of the documentary features interviews with the <UNK> and footage of <UNK> which often turn violent overall we get to see how the punk movement was a reaction to the hippies whereas the hippies were into being natural the <UNK> wanted to have themselves as altered as possible what with <UNK> hair and all but also we see how they're really <UNK> and sometimes becoming <UNK> br br anyway this is a really great time capsule we're not really sure whether we want to long for that era or feel <UNK> by it but this is definitely not a documentary that will leave you neutral truly worth seeing
<START> this was a hindi movie hindi horrible reasons cheap dialogues cheap special effects cheap directing <UNK> a 2 <UNK> max movie into 3 <UNK> br br spoiler little bit br br specifically for this movie 1 dialogues are not funny they are cheesy and cheap though akshay tried his best acting for which i admire him comedy was not funny at all i laughed only 3 times during this movie 2 first half of the movie was useless to the story of the 2nd half the 2nd half was the actual story movie the first half was time pass build up 3 the characters are not developed properly at all <UNK> <UNK> is smart in the first half an idiot in the 2nd half rest of the movie we don't really develop any feelings or caring for akshay and govinda their characters are stupid nothing more they do not seem to struggle in their difficulties jokes are funny but they are not funny in a very serious scene the characters of the gang and the drug <UNK> are cheesy and have been used in last 20 movies there is nothing new about those characters again they are shown to be stupid for being funny however stupid funny when stupid is the norm throughout the whole movie the only character that made sense was that of lara <UNK> with a real story 4 special effects were crap at the end <UNK> r off the ladder of a fire truck you notice that they are not actually on ladder in air secondly <UNK> start to fly off when the ladder starts to move around <UNK> can't fly off a ladder when its moving they fall directly to the ground due to something called gravity 5 the whole movie was dubbed all the dialogues were recorded after the movie the actors' lips hardly to the dialogues br br there are probably many other reasons why this movie was crap but i can't remember them look at this masterpiece of crappy indian movies by non intelligent even stupid director yourself and you will agree with my review <UNK> who like hindi movies please increase your expectations for decent quality in hindi movies br br let me say that not all hindi movies are bad i like some i did not like this one br br 1 5 10 1 5 for the effort by akshay and lara
<START> i was very curious to see this depardieu outing plus the time period is definitely fascinating being a fan i was disappointed and that may be an understatement the film never really took cinematic flight there's no foundation for the <UNK> between and <UNK> etc br br basically the script was weak adapted from the affair and yet the direction was masterful it's <UNK> also there were some amazing actors but they never really grab the audience's attention like they should depardieu comes off as a quasi goofy <UNK> not exactly the image we have in mind is incredible as usual but again the script puts up limits even actors of great talent can't break down and linda pop up as and saint just and if you're familiar with then you'd know them br br overall i was disappointed with this much <UNK> film great cast great director but no quality foundation bad <UNK> script we need to get in and general j <UNK> what are their motivations eh who knows one likes women the other <UNK> himself ok so if you're looking for a great french revolution movie i highly recommend la revolution it's in two parts and oh so great excellent performances in depth script <UNK> <UNK> bits definitely a satisfying experience <UNK> maria <UNK> is a much better than depardieu the wonderful apparently took some notes from and is brilliant as <UNK> see it now as for fans you're better off with man of iron <UNK> promised land and the like cheers
<START> i am so glad when i watch in every time the movie of ray for the sidney of the 21st century jamie foxx who played this role as an evidence of his brilliant ability as an actor to take his position beside great actors in hollywood by his golden supporting for the strong abilities of <UNK> american actors all over the times and periods by his eternal work as an evidence for the eternity of ray charles as a grand prove for their legend appearance in every time by their success for winning oscar prize as best actor for leading role an best mixing sound between fact and cinematic scenes upon ray and jamie as a mixing between two copies of ray ray of the past and ray of 2004 acted in the person of jamie foxx it was nice from the director to choose those songs to be adapted with <UNK> scenes in the <UNK> of film to enter for the atmosphere of success in legend corn with legend movies in hollywood since <UNK> till now and his <UNK> of choosing sharon in the role of ray s mother that she succeeded in this role by brilliant analysis for the core of her character that ray s mother was the turning point for him upon her grew up to be independent on himself to take his place in this world and to be icon in his talent as <UNK> king cole louis armstrong duke <UNK> and at the end of this film by receiving his honorable report from and their decision to take his song georgia on my mind the national <UNK> for this state he made his promise for his mother to be alive until now by his legend songs and brilliant life
<START> i saw the film and am very pleased to see a film so different in character and story to the stupid mainstream american major productions its a film with a background interesting for young as much as all age groups contrary to certain reviews the audience seems to split my <UNK> as the film is very successful wherever yet exploited worldwide for example in <UNK> is was <UNK> number 3 negative statements must be respected but one should expect such to be guided on a fact basis if you have the chance view the film and enjoy it
<START> what this movie is not cool entertaining br br what this movie is visually interesting difficult to get through intentional br br i feel that this movie puts the viewer if he or she is willing through a clip of time where they experience a world without language much like how animals must experience the world you don't really watch this movie as much as you witness an awful series of events in what feels like real time br br consistently it goes on much longer than is comfortable this movie could be edited down to a 20 minute short and it would be a totally different movie it would be cool and entertaining but the experience would be lost i have seen a lot of cool movies but i have never experienced one like this if you can get your head in the right place for this one you should be able to really appreciate but likely not enjoy what they accomplished here 10 out of 10
<START> i'd have little to add to <UNK> eye comment here but as the first brazilian born raised and living in <UNK> de <UNK> in a neighborhood just a few miles away from the of depicted in the film to comment on u s <UNK> rising here on imdb i get mixed feelings on the one hand it's good that the dire situation of brazilian <UNK> are getting more attention from filmmakers and the media both from brazil and abroad since local <UNK> seem to have given up a long time ago one the other hand it's incredibly frustrating that rising turns out to be such a missed opportunity for <UNK> non brazilian audiences on the issue because first time directors jeff <UNK> and matt who are from the u s and understandably on the matter turn the biography of group leader anderson into a glamorous in this superficial one sided under <UNK> and misleading documentary good intentions muddled results rising looks like a tv ad is shallow as a prime time tv interview and biased as a <UNK> video br br rising feels <UNK> phony for a brazilian viewer and not only because of its hype visual treatment of a bleak reality and its misplaced feel good happy ending city of god is an obvious reference here with <UNK> actors and jonathan <UNK> for no apparent reason other than hype rising is allegedly a documentary about the group and its leader anderson but beware when you see the scenes shot in <UNK> <UNK> the beautiful <UNK> shore line you might as well be warned that the home of and anderson is located in an area of <UNK> far away from any beach strange choice of location to say the least br br rising is probably confusing for non <UNK> who won't know many of the <UNK> and the film won't tell them either and will have to wait for the closing credits to find out that many of the songs on the soundtrack are not by the band though you'll get suspicious when you start to hear pink <UNK> of all people they won't know either that important issues were simply left <UNK> why does the film push the notion that is a one man project why not acknowledge the many partners who supply it with substantial financial and support like city <UNK> private brazilian <UNK> <UNK> recording companies and international without which might not even <UNK> why not state clearly that is still plagued by violent drug wars and that its <UNK> still live in constant fear of attacks by <UNK> and cops why not state clearly that many of the archive footage clips showing police violence and corruption did not take place in how and why did the kid richard finally join why on freaking earth wasn't he interviewed once again at the end of the film br br as for anderson himself the film leaves a lot of loose ends for the viewer what's the story about anderson having two mothers is the baby he holds in his arms his son why is he inspired by <UNK> is he a <UNK> why does a woman appear on the beach when the films mentions <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from the accident is he a <UNK> why not let him explain the <UNK> of starting a group that fights drugs and simultaneously <UNK> bob <UNK> if is also a pride building movement for black people from <UNK> why are the girls in the band limited to <UNK> <UNK> routines no you won't get any answers to these questions either br br instead the filmmakers are interested in turning anderson into a <UNK> mix of pop star malcolm x gandhi and christ check out that last image of the statue of christ the <UNK> <UNK> hill immediately after showing anderson miraculously walking after his surgery and that's the worst thing the filmmakers could do to anderson and his cause turn him into a special chosen one by the time they show his surgery <UNK> you're ready to believe it's a mark from god br br because what's remarkable about anderson who's the most ordinary guy you could ever meet is that he helped change his environment not by being special but by <UNK> and adapting winning projects like the movement in among others to his own community with strong support by friends artists <UNK> politicians <UNK> and the media if you're not <UNK> in portuguese you probably won't notice that anderson isn't particularly bright or <UNK> unlike his <UNK> witty partner <UNK> junior as much as he isn't particularly talented as a singer <UNK> or musician yet his <UNK> might have been the film's true inspirational core to show that anyone with <UNK> <UNK> and steady support can in fact contribute significantly to his or her community no need to be jesus <UNK> because what really matters is the movement not the guy see haven't we had enough of personality cult br br by the end of rising you probably won't know much more about <UNK> than you did when you walked in you'll just have seen what some of them look like
<START> i can't give it less than a star i tried at this moment im not sure if im halfway through it or not but i stopped <UNK> paying attention around the time part of it was revealed to be a dream or not or maybe it was i think viewers who posted a comment that didn't include the <UNK> horrible or awful or made me want to swallow a bullet are probably being nice because it is an indie film don't listen to them listen to me there is no nudity in the movie skip it i needed ten lines to submit this warning so i will also say that the <UNK> girl that some users have described as hot is fat she has fat elephant legs
<START> i enjoyed the film and the fact that it aimed rather high in dealing with some sophisticated material i saw the film in a preview screening and it wasn't ruined by any silly video boxes that spoiled the ending the performances were quite good especially andrew mccarthy in a more mature roll i also enjoyed the look of the film which gave it a mysterious air i also enjoyed some of the twists in the plot and don't want to give too much away in case other <UNK> video boxes don't give it all away the script was a little over the top at times but i appreciated the fact that the film makers weren't afraid to challenge the audiences with interesting and puzzling regarding the roll of faith in our world and while some might find the ending a little too open ended i appreciated the fact that the movie refused to tie everything up neatly with a bow that's not how life works
<START> it may have been thrilling for an audience in 1946 but the movie is now a bit boring i had a hard time sitting through the whole thing and it was very predictable i mean we know from the beginning of the movie that welles is the nazi war criminal and i'll give you one guess as to whether he is caught and appropriately <UNK> in the end br br not worth watching it's sad that welles only made three movies worth seeing in his long career kane <UNK> and a touch of evil
<START> the evil that men do 1984 was one of the few non cannon films charlie bronson made during the 80's unlike most of the cannon films charlie starred in this one wasn't fun or entertaining charlie basically <UNK> and people for over an hour and a half if you thought he was mr emotion before wait until you see this br br in this one charlie goes to an <UNK> central american country and shows the <UNK> that whoever <UNK> with chuck or his people have to pay the <UNK> this one is no fun it's not cheesy or campy just brutal sadistic and not in a good way br br i didn't like this one i have no love for this film no <UNK> because it's not worth watching maybe if they didn't cut the hell out of it watch with br br don't bother
<START> <UNK> adam or as it's more <UNK> known amongst english speaking audiences starts with an epic battle as king <UNK> his army <UNK> a load of guys although i'm not sure who they were the film itself isn't too helpful in establishing the fact anyway after king <UNK> has slaughtered all these guys princess maria bishop commander <UNK> are forced to sign a <UNK> which lets king <UNK> rule just about everything in sight soon after princess maria <UNK> <UNK> they have sex meanwhile in the <UNK> wedding ceremony ever just two sentences long <UNK> <UNK> princess maria is planning to rebel against <UNK> gain some sweet revenge in the process <UNK> his guards attack kill <UNK> even though his pregnant wife princess escapes with her <UNK> with guards in hot pursuit after the <UNK> <UNK> ever less than 5 minutes or the time it takes to run around a bush princess gives birth to a young baby boy who is hidden in some <UNK> away from guards unfortunately when tries to retrieve the little <UNK> he finds that the baby has been adopted by a pride of <UNK> as one of their own year's later the evil <UNK> now rules treating his subjects with no mercy princess maria has given birth he has a son but is also still kicking around trying to put together a gang of rebels to <UNK> <UNK> the task seems hopeless unless they can <UNK> the help of the legendary who is more beast than man br br this turkish greek co production was directed by as is a one of a kind type of film i found it hilariously bad but at the same time immensely entertaining the script never seems to take itself seriously it is a pretty funny film at times it moves along like a rocket is never dull or boring some of the english dubbed dialogue is just hilarious in context with what's happening on screen none of it makes any sense we get a boy raised by <UNK> an evil king betrayal dark family secrets <UNK> that form the shape of <UNK> in an element of the story that was present before the kid was raised by <UNK> crazy fight scenes torture scenes where the <UNK> people are supposed to be tied to <UNK> ancient castle interiors that randomly contain <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> rings idiotic bad guys who all seem to have extensive facial hair a central character who has a jaw line resembling a house brick can be stabbed twice have his hands covered in acid this acid can eat it's way through steel but is kept in a <UNK> <UNK> fall over 20 feet onto a <UNK> floor yet maintain no serious injury <UNK> adam is a <UNK> entertaining film i don't think i've seen another film quite like it that i can compare it too if your looking for something serious then forget this but if you like <UNK> bad they're <UNK> type films want to have fun laugh be entertained then <UNK> adam should be at the very top of your list total 100 gold for bad film fans those with a taste for the different bizarre on the disappointing side only gets his steel <UNK> 10 minutes before the end which is a shame br br director certainly keeps things moving along at a <UNK> pace although it's far from well made during the opening battle one moment guys are fighting on a sand <UNK> the next their on a hill with trees in the background there is one point where uses a to pole vault but it's obviously just a long tube with a <UNK> wrapped around it then there's the scene when a <UNK> pack of are supposed the chasing down but the dogs used are obviously different <UNK> including some of the most harmless looking dogs ever there are just so many individual scenes in <UNK> adam that are just hilarious stupid bizarre or all three that i could go on forever just check the ending out when is jumping flying about everywhere like he can fly there's lots of blood in <UNK> adam although not much actual graphic gore or violence a few <UNK> someone has their hands cut off is as graphic as it gets br br technically <UNK> adam is pretty <UNK> the period costumes are bright <UNK> featuring <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> various other bright colours the fight scenes are cheap but at least the filmmakers tried to put as much action in as they could the music seemed like it was more suited to a classical ballet rather than an action film is yet another bizarre aspect to <UNK> adam the acting was bad even dubbed you could tell the acting was bad br br <UNK> adam is pure gold from start to finish there are so many things to like laugh at enjoy in this film that i just ended up really liking it in no way whatsoever can <UNK> adam be considered a good film in any sense of the word but it's one hell of an entertaining one i may have have to watch this one again sometime soon just to prove to myself that i didn't dream it all the best turkish action film about a man raised by <UNK> you will ever see period proved popular enough to <UNK> a sequel ii the 1979
<START> years ago with ray of light madonna broke through to a truly amazing level of musical artistry and since then she's occasionally <UNK> even her own standards this concert production with its hypnotic editing amazing dancing <UNK> lighting effects and <UNK> inducing <UNK> blows away all previous efforts <UNK> apparent ambition to single <UNK> bring about world peace through music and dance may seem <UNK> or absurd to some but hell <UNK> got to do it thanks to her <UNK> of the remarkable talent of everyone involved in this production <UNK> tour live from london places her once again among the top ten artists working anywhere in the world in any medium
<START> i went to see the italian job with mixed reviews in my head i was pleasantly surprised with an entertaining close to 2 hours i thought the cast was just great and so were the special effects with the safe and truck just dropping out of sight if you like fast paced action movies this is the one to see
<START> man i think people have forgotten how to watch a movie everyone thinks they're a critic they comment on things that the average movie goer doesn't even know or think about br br i enjoyed the film it was what i was expecting therefore was not disappointed steven gets a bad rap for putting his views into his films but that's also a reason to watch what's even more funny is the people that complain about his films say he's the worst and that we shouldn't watch his films yet watch his movies anyway all so they can comment on how bad they are who's the <UNK> if you don't like his work don't watch it then you won't have to subject yourself to this supposedly painful event br br stop comparing movies to other movies and watch a movie on an individual basis and you may begin to enjoy films again
<START> okay i'm a history buff and okay i'm a action film <UNK> so of course this film is on my top ten of all time i really love the action scenes and the unique <UNK> of the period i sort of have doubts about fighting two handed sword from horse back and the sword seems more <UNK> like than like oh well i've never fought from horse back either br br i love the attempts at <UNK> <UNK> too the typical desert probably couldn't read the <UNK> so they'd take his word for it several writers have criticized <UNK> <UNK> well on vacation as a youth i met a family of south <UNK> in our west dinosaur national <UNK> and although they spoke between themselves yeah second generation germans can hear the difference they spoke english with a scottish <UNK> seems that who teaches you affects your <UNK> scottish <UNK>
<START> this movie was very good not great but very good it is based on a one man play by <UNK> <UNK> hudson yes he played most of the parts on paper it looks like stunt casting yes let's round up all the black folks in hollywood and put them in one movie <UNK> <UNK> even produced it the only name i didn't see was <UNK> thank god because it probably would of ended up being like a hallmark movie instead this movie was not some sentimental mess it was moving but not phony the characters came and went with the exception of her husband pauline and the writer in question the movie <UNK> around the universe of <UNK> mrs bill crosby and how she raised the writer and took in people now being a jaded new <UNK> when he said she took in sick people and old and then we see them going to a mental institution to pick up a man i'm thinking looks like sister has a <UNK> going getting folks jobs and taking the <UNK> but no she explains to lou she just wants 25 bucks a week and did not want the money ahead of time i think that part was put in the movie just for us jaded new <UNK> so we know she is not <UNK> the poor folks g it was written by a new <UNK> so he knows the deal g she almost seems <UNK> and looking through a little boys eyes i can see why she is married to a <UNK> do well who is 17 years younger and fools around on her <UNK> howard was born to play these type of parts he was good but i would like to see him play something different who plays <UNK> is also very good but for some reason the person who stood out to me was a small role played by <UNK> wright where is this mans oscar he already won a emmy and a tony he was in <UNK> and he stole the movie i did not even know who he was in this movie he is a <UNK> never the same i never seen him play a bad part yet this was a 5 minute role and he managed to make me both laugh and cry i re <UNK> the scene few times one time because i didn't know who he was his wife <UNK> was excellent i have seen her in roles before mostly <UNK> stuff but she is so good here i actually know people who act just like her so it was very real to me macy grey who had one of the bigger parts was also very good i was very happy that they did not kill <UNK> off i thought she was a <UNK> in the beginning of the movie but she was able to go home and start her old routine of taking care of people there are women like that in most of our lives people we might know or even lived with thank god for them i do not know how they do it all of the time i have a friend who lost 2 children and been through a lot of stuff but whenever i am feeling <UNK> sorry for myself i call her and she always puts me in a good mood this movie is a tribute to all of those people i only wish they they told us what happened to some of the characters like the the one armed man boyfriend who is played by one of my favorite actors on <UNK> the wire omar <UNK> character and richard the lesbian and <UNK> one arm man he was mesmerizing in another small role
<START> excellent film featuring anthony wong that certainly lives up to it's title erotic but increasingly violent courtesy of dreams purchased from a crazed <UNK> that rapidly turn into nightmares of some <UNK> as the <UNK> gets inside them to manipulate poor mr wong well filmed and very fast moving this is a non stop tale of serious magic <UNK> power and corruption but also makes time for some fine sex scenes and some very bloody violence there is also just a little touch of humour now and again to catch you further off guard and the whole thing makes for a most <UNK> 90 minutes or so excellent performances all round
<START> don't torture a <UNK> is one of the coolest italian horror films i've ever seen and i've seen my share to call it a giallo is a little misleading because it's not really a typical murder mystery it's more of a straight horror movie br br complete with one of the most brutal and gory scenes ever in a movie this old <UNK> <UNK> and turning film <UNK> with a creepy ambiance and an old school italian feel the setting is perfect an old italian village the music is ridiculously perfect the finale is genuine and original br br after seeing don't torture a <UNK> you really have to wonder how <UNK> later stuff got so off beat i like all his stuff but he <UNK> maybe he figured he already did it because with this film he hits the <UNK> br br i'd recommend this film to anyone who thinks that <UNK> <UNK> owns the giallo genre fulci beats him with this one br br 10 out of 10 kids
<START> i first saw this movie at a premiere party in mr hometown there between directors musicians and other norwegian celebrities i laughed and laughed i just couldn't stop if you like a comedy with black humor sharp lines and excellent acting this is one flick you have to see it's like mixing true romance with the wedding singer and add a dash of mad about you br br 10 points
<START> after seeing the movie i feel the father and the mother are both reasonable person although not perfect at all on the contrary i don't like the author and his two sisters br br is a person's <UNK> an accurate portrait of herself no most of time people only write problems in her <UNK> because she want to solve the problem so a <UNK> is always a more negative side of a person in this movie the author judge his mother's life by her <UNK> not a wise choice br br the author's elder sister is so ugly <UNK> and internal first she said her father's second marriage is not fair for her mother then she said she doesn't love her mother so she don't love both father and mother i doubt she love anybody in the world her face is so ugly just a reflection of her heart through out the movie i feel the author and his sisters are lack of love and respect to their parents however i feel the father are mother are very loving to their children even the author try to portrait them as cold <UNK> person
<START> let's face it <UNK> of bad movies are made all the time for those people who work in film you have probably <UNK> a lot of time and effort into many of these plot less wonders sometimes and this is my opinion it is the act of merely making the movie that is important to us to tell a story no matter how simple and unrealistic also the <UNK> process is one key characteristic that is unique to film and theater to put on a production of any caliber requires the talents of a varying amount of people depending on its scale to bring its story to life the most intriguing part of american movie however is not the movie being filmed it is the movie maker himself as a character of his own life which demands our attention none of them serve as models of the filmmakers we know and have worked with but i will argue they are <UNK> of small parts of us which try to be a part of this cult activity of independent film making alright a very small part of us these are the people who live under the rocks of their own lives and just so happen to be by the romance of cinema this leads me to my next argument american movie captures the raw spirit of independent film making bad stories told on nowadays digital film with sloppy effects and horrible performances because this is the best they can do with a budget of a couple thousand dollars rather than a studio budget of several million dollars a day that is the difference between low low low end productions and studio productions the independent filmmaker just wants to create a linear or even a <UNK> story to shoot as well as he can with the money he's <UNK> in himself and the resources around him in order to see a finished product on his <UNK> tv rugged <UNK> <UNK> in every art form i find this film to be a brilliant document of truth for many filmmakers and no i'm not full of myself man these people are hilarious their problems seem hilarious their characteristics are hilarious best line of the movie it's alright it's okay there's something to live for jesus told me so said a million times by a funny old man <UNK> off to tom beach chicago rules
<START> i was drawn to friends by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous <UNK> john whom i had see in a club in nearby <UNK> i had no idea of the emotions and impact the movie would make recently i was brought back to the movie by a song that heart did called seasons then i found the <UNK> john song friends thinking it was the same song it's been 35 years of so anyway the <UNK> of the emotions of friends came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love i have more recall of the way the movie hit me than i do of the actual details of the production plot etc so forgive me for a rather poor review i remember taking a couple of special friends on a date to see the movie and them being as moved and <UNK> eyed at the end as i was i'm both anxious and nervous to find a copy and see it now so many movies which seemed so important to me back then i e the graduate easy rider now just seem silly and i don't want this to fall into the same category but i will find it and if it turns out silly then at least i'll be able to turn my wife onto a great no outstanding soundtrack when we met we went through this with last tango in paris the youngsters i work with i'm <UNK> respect my opinions but it's hard to explain the feelings of the sixties and the movies and songs that reflect such strong feelings but seem a little aged now i just can't figure out if the the aging process is the movies or me friends is a very special sensitive and wonderful movie it will bring back a lot of special feelings i'm sure by all means rent or buy a copy <UNK> were not near the strong genre then that they are today
<START> highly politically charged drama that while biased is extremely well handled and one of the most intelligent films ever made it contains almost no preaching but rather follows a naive tv reporter who gradually comes to realize the threat presented by nuclear power plants not because of an inherent danger but because the <UNK> are more interested in the bottom line than in the safety of those affected br br many hated the film because they saw it as a political <UNK> made by ultra <UNK> like jane fonda and michael douglas but if you view it simply as a drama it's gripping exciting full of well developed distinctive characters and ultimately a truly suspenseful contemporary thriller that hits close to home br br historical note for some especially those in the energy industry and inhabitants of the <UNK> <UNK> area it hit perhaps a little too close to home as less than a week after this film was released the devastating explosion at the three mile island nuclear facility occurred br br update <UNK> <UNK> 2007 in the nearly a decade since i first wrote this critique i've heard a lot of commentary on the film one thing i think really needs to be noted is that this film is not the ultra liberal anti nuclear <UNK> that it's often <UNK> as being br br while the makers and stars are or were notable hollywood establishment <UNK> what this film attacks is not the very idea of nuclear power but rather the idea of human greed corruption and <UNK> calling into question the potential <UNK> of something that nature has already made dangerous br br no one who accepts reality can argue the fact that human exposure to nuclear radiation is at least quite likely to be fatal close friends of mine who worked at a nuclear plant for several years even told me of their <UNK> official policy on the maximum safe exposure levels that its employees could handle br br you don't have to believe that <UNK> are <UNK> evil in order to accept that individuals in pursuit of wealth and power are greedy and often corrupt and even if you <UNK> that claim you can't <UNK> that all humans are prone to make mistakes when it comes to exposing innocent people to nuclear radiation we can't afford any mistakes and that more than anything is the argument this film seeks to make br br <UNK> it if you must but try to have a little perspective we're currently engaged in a war whose ongoing results are quite different from those originally predicted an incredibly <UNK> war with no end in sight and whether or not you feel the war was necessary to combat global terrorism you can't <UNK> the reality that the length the financial cost and most importantly the loss of human life have all far <UNK> the levels that the experts assured us of back in 2003 so even if no one involved is greedy or corrupt mistakes were made and mistakes of a pretty serious <UNK> to boot the same kind of serious mistakes if allowed to <UNK> in the nuclear industry could render much of the <UNK> surface
<START> on the positive i'll say it's pretty enough to be watchable on the negative it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen long whiny and pointless and i'm not saying this to be mean i really wanted to like this film it seemed to have everything going for it had the so called buzz and was a <UNK> to track down besides had a little more effort gone into it on the story side i believe this would've been amazing and i expect the team behind it will produce wonderful work in the future they clearly have the ability but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go
<START> this is a great movie a must own i really liked every aspect of it from the sword fighting the romance the costumes were really well done and put together the scenery is absolutely beautiful i also loved the mystery and magic also the message of the power of love that love is the greatest power there is i really like the heart of the king in the sense that he desires peace instead of the bloodshed and hate i wish that i could live in a world like that with flying ships to <UNK> in the sky i also think that it was really nice how they brought the animals into the movie i also thought that the cook was really funny i have watched it many times in one day and still never tire of it just wish they would bring it onto a dvd
<START> the plot here is simple country boy farrell goes to the city to sell the <UNK> crop falls in love with a waitress kate <UNK> and marries her bringing her home to a hostile father and a group of woman hungry <UNK> there are shades of they knew what they wanted and mice and men here the <UNK> taking place in two lengthy sequences set in the restaurant <UNK> the first half hour and are <UNK> paced is so weak he allows his father to <UNK> his wife who is <UNK> by mac richard alexander one of the <UNK> to come away with him <UNK> and alexander are the only good things in this tedious <UNK> which lacks the insights and the cinematic beauty we expect from <UNK> <UNK> character has no <UNK> so we wind up rooting for a real man mac to take kate away from it all with audience sympathy <UNK> the film loses its narrative progression the father's <UNK> at film's end is unrealistic and unbelievable making for a contrived denouement this film is for fans of the stars and the director only general audiences need not bother
<START> interesting concept that just doesn't make it i watched the whole movie but had to read imdb comments to find out what code <UNK> meant if when it was explained in the film i must have been in a coma or possibly brain dead by then i only watched it for tim robbins the fact that i did not know any of the other actors should have been a tip off we all have to start somewhere but this film should not be it as to the <UNK> empathy virus holy <UNK> belt batman where were the joker the <UNK> etc also why are the women all so damned ugly if i want to see less than plain stick figures i'll just walk down the street the best part of the film was the car crash it was totally believable and not over the top like most movie crashes
<START> this is an odd movie on the surface it's no different to many other d grade gore movies but in at least a few ways it stands out firstly the main killer character is really weird how the heck a guy who only ever like a chicken got <UNK> is totally beyond me what was that female <UNK> board member thinking he's totally <UNK> and <UNK> he another problem with <UNK> the geek is the script direction for the women the daughter is so pathetic and seemingly stupid that if she was mine slap her in attempting to <UNK> her mother off the bed she struggles with <UNK> and just doesn't seem to think i'll get <UNK> or a knife later on in a similar attempt to <UNK> her mother she wanders down stairs and starts searching in a box of <UNK> <UNK> stuff for some <UNK> eventually she gets a knife by the way this is after the killer has obviously left in the car and just returned bizarre on the plus side the daughter did get her <UNK> off for the shower scene so that was nice although again unusual it seems that in many of these d grade gore movies they happily show throats being bitten open with <UNK> blood but the sight of a female breast is somehow too strong for the audience in general it worked but it was annoying and nasty although the bare breasts made up for some of that
<START> ok first to all the <UNK> get a life i don't see why you even bother to post on these boards when obviously you know nothing about cinema robots or people br br this movie has an important lessons for all of us to learn about gender stereotypes relationships and destiny really we are all robots <UNK> to respond certain ways to certain <UNK> without thinking how many times have we seen a sunset and made some trite comment without even thinking about it i say thank you <UNK> brilliantly played by <UNK> peters for making me stop and think about the awesome power of mother nature br br it's only when val and <UNK> begin to reject their programming that they begin to understand their true desire to find love and to flee the factory in search of a creative life this movie should be mandatory viewing in <UNK> just think of the dreams and hopes it could inspire in the inmates maybe even they could overcome their bad programming and join the rest of us in a crime free world br br we can all learn a lot from these robots i am a better person for
<START> another good animation from disney sequels are not always that great and tend to follow the same plot as the original however the son of tramp tries to <UNK> the world out side the home and family he knows and learns where he actually belongs being a <UNK> dog is not for everyone er dog that is but <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the voices of the various characters were superb and provided by several well know actors such as scott wolf <UNK> <UNK> and mickey rooney entertaining and a well made family movie
<START> it's difficult to express how bad this movie is even in the 1950s when intellectual searching for the meaning of life was <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> of physical <UNK> clean clothes <UNK> etc was a common reaction to the smug middle class <UNK> of both the usa and western europe this movie would have been a stinker the plot is a <UNK> of several <UNK> ex <UNK> if that's the correct latin <UNK> the acting consists of deadpan stares broken by occasional <UNK> by the male lead as well as the females the gratuitous view of catherine <UNK> or <UNK> breasts are worthy of a <UNK> commercial the repeated orchestra rehearsal in the abandoned building is i'm sure heavy with meaning in the director's mind but to me is just one more stupid symbol thrown into this meaningless movie i'm <UNK> because my time has been wasted watching this <UNK> excuse for an art <UNK> the scenery is beautiful and the sex scene is hot but underneath his clothes this king has no substance
<START> from time to time it's very <UNK> for the <UNK> to watch some silent film about the harsh life of the common people in order to remind themselves of the <UNK> and the comfortable life that they have enjoyed since the beginning of mankind or even in comparison with the complicated and hard work that common people have to endure everyday since the <UNK> rule the world br br and that's what happens in the love light the first film directed by dame france marion who will be famous afterwards in the silent and <UNK> world thanks overall to her work as a screenwriter better for her certainly because her career as a film director doesn't impress this german count br br the film tells the story of dame angela dame mary pickford a merry italian girl who lives surrounded by a <UNK> <UNK> an important difference of opinion between upper and low classes <UNK> prefers to live surrounded by <UNK> luxury  she has two brothers and a secret admirer but all she gives him in return is indifference destiny begins to work hard and pretty soon war is <UNK> and dame <UNK> two brothers <UNK> and in the next reel both are dead but destiny is even and dame angela meanwhile falls in love <UNK> a german and to make things worse she doesn't know that her <UNK> <UNK> is a spy and that the light <UNK> that she sends to him every night from the <UNK> she maintains thinking that is a love <UNK> don't mean <UNK> <UNK> but sink any damn italian boat at sea  br br fortunately for dame angela pretty soon her <UNK> german spy will be found by the <UNK> in her house in which she was hiding him a not strange fact indeed because it is not an easy task for a german to go but the german spy will prefer to die before being captured by those italians br br from that german love a half <UNK> baby will born the wicked destiny at full but a greedy <UNK> who has a particular idea of <UNK> will carry away her son with the <UNK> of a catholic nun who has taken the <UNK> of <UNK> to a fact that will put dame angela at the verge of insanity br br but meanwhile dame <UNK> secret admirer has returned from the war and you can think that finally dame <UNK> <UNK> life will improve a tremendous mistake because destiny has in store for her that the returned soldier is blind but as they say in germany it may be a <UNK> in disguise and finally dame angela will recover her son and will start a new life with her blind <UNK> in a poor italian village in what it is supposed to be a happy ending for the common people br br as this german count said before it was much better for dame frances marion that she continued her career as a screenwriter because as can be seen in the love light she had a lot of imagination to <UNK> incredible stories <UNK> <UNK>  but a completely different subject is to direct films and her silent debut lacks emotion and rhythm in spite of the effort of dame pickford to involve the audience with her many <UNK> the nonexistent film narrative causes indifference in the <UNK> making this the kind of film where only dame pickford herself provides the interest and not her circumstances br br and now if you'll allow me i must <UNK> take my leave because this german count must send morse <UNK> from the <UNK> north tower to one of his <UNK> rich <UNK>
<START> lady and the tramp ii adventure i think is a good movie but i think the first lady and the tramp movie is better because it is the original and i would think that the original movies compared to the is better lady and the tramp ii takes off after the original but this time it's <UNK> turn lady and <UNK> <UNK> always hates been treated with the things that has to be done with him following the rules in the house taking <UNK> all the time and taking things nice and easy <UNK> gets angry and runs away with a pack of dogs that are left off the loose <UNK> meets another dog called angel they both get along fine and do the things mother and father did having an italian meal and <UNK> etc afterwards <UNK> realises that he is loved by his family <UNK> his pal which is the baby <UNK> comes back and angel is joined in the family i give this movie 10 out of 10
<START> i consider myself lucky that i got to view a wonderful movie with two marvelous actors kramer vs kramer was great to me because i think i could relate to it br br unfortunately my parents are divorced even though i was older than billy in this movie i felt his pain and confusion having two parents who you thought were happy and end up hating each other is the worst through this movie actually i think it made me realize that my parents are people too and they had as just much pain as my sister and i had br br back to the movie this was a good one yes it's dated and meryl and dustin are very young but i would recommend this for a lot of people because i think most can relate in some way there are funny sad happy and <UNK> moments that are carried away <UNK> by these great actors it's a good movie and deserves more credit than a 7 5 br br 9 10
<START> perhaps spoiler well i <UNK> seen it at the film festival in <UNK> and i have to say it s ridiculous sorry author and writer and whatever but it is the worst try making a good movie i <UNK> ever seen if u <UNK> got <UNK> times the possibility to get away from your enemy and u don't do it its getting boring there are in the movie witch gives u the impression that they are forgotten e g a in front of a security <UNK> they are asking for help and a somebody sees it and the police than there is a cut and nothing the killer gets a shot in his head and 50 <UNK> later he is behaving like nothing happened no its no zombie movie and finally the final the big end which we were promised <UNK> lets say take a little guy who always wanted to give the world one of the best endings in history so badly that everything goes wrong im not going to vote 1 because the actress is beautiful
<START> i only went to see this movie because i have always liked kevin <UNK> i felt that <UNK> did a great job in the <UNK> effect unfortunately even though these two actors were are capable of good if not great acting moments some of that was missing here some of the scenes were just not believable and didn't have enough story line support br br though the movie claims influence from the <UNK> <UNK> aftermath there was very little none to that effect in the movie br br overall i liked the fact that the movie brought forward some of what goes into saving lives from a water perspective br br the special effects were pretty good and more than a little <UNK> not sure i'll ever go deep sea fishing again br br i expected a little more emotion in the film than what was presented br br definitely a movie that could've been seen on dvd
<START> the year 2004 was the year of the biopic with no less than four pictures <UNK> real events real people with varying degrees of critical praise of the four pictures to make it to the race to the oscars in early 2005 <UNK> the <UNK> hotel <UNK> and ray ray became the big winner of the night as the acting award went to jamie foxx for his portrayal of r b genius ray charles br br and it was well deserved despite that <UNK> <UNK> came close and liam neeson wasn't even nominated what made foxx the winner was that the other two were playing relatively obscure <UNK> ray charles was still making music right up until his death in 2004 and by then there wasn't a soul who didn't know at least one song that <UNK> had penned it did help that jamie foxx rose well above the movie itself as a whole somewhat weak and often looking like it wouldn't be out of place as a tv biopic and his portrayal is detailed as it's <UNK> he has the delicate assignment which is to <UNK> a person down to nuances and once the crisis of <UNK> addiction to heroin hits a head foxx pulls out all the stops and it isn't hard to imagine the real ray actually going through such a painful ordeal br br the low point of the film is how it spends a little too much time in <UNK> <UNK> relationship with women like the <UNK> taylor wishes to establish that ray had this <UNK> life a product of his own demons and his entry into success at a time when being black and successful brought a huge amount of <UNK> of the women the only one to succeed bringing real life is warren as <UNK> mother hers is a difficult role since she is alone on screen with the child actor playing young ray but her facial and body language is gut wrenching especially at the moment she must <UNK> her <UNK> to have ray find his way around the house such intensity of emotion to stand there and watch your blind son crawl across a room and having to force him to have this rude awakening into independence a beautiful performance and one which should have been acknowledged br br a fantastic <UNK> to ray is the featured music anyone who knows r b will enjoy the early <UNK> of <UNK> radio hits as much as his later ones which would bring him to the <UNK> of popular music and jamie foxx virtually steals the show as he performs the songs as ray that alone will live on even when the movie in itself is little more than a stiff biopic i would have though loved it if they would have used his last adult contemporary hit from 1993 sing my song for you in the closing credits after all it is ray charles a performer who had a fierce dedication to his art
<START> lance used to get quality support work from james cameron heck he even had his own tv show <UNK> for a seasons why is he doing this couldn't he find some better way to pay his bills br br i love a good low budget movie some of them you can laugh at simply due to their ludicrous premise their <UNK> stereotyped characters or often times because the actors are related to the director producers but this movie has no redeeming value i didn't laugh i didn't cry i only had this sick feeling in my stomach that feeling was quickly identified as pity at one point lance <UNK> was an a list support actor he's been in terminator he was going to be terminator before arnold showed up aliens classic b movie <UNK> among so many others i wanted to send him money after this maybe we should start a support lance <UNK> or something br br then again for making this thing maybe not
<START> lots of flames thousands of extras in battle scenes lots of beautiful sets i don't think the plot supported such a vast <UNK> the story could have been told far more effectively and have been more valid psychologically if there weren't so much macho <UNK> in the production chinese movies tend to be this way in my experience and i think this <UNK> from the film
<START> i saw the film yesterday and stopped it at half time because i felt it was a waste of time the idea to make a film through the eyes of a one of the evil guys throughout most fantasy and medieval films is great and offers plenty of possibilities but the film couldn't catch one of them i was not feeling for any of the characters the plot was all too predictable to the point that i followed it and the second leap of time in the storyline made me quit those who expect a deep insight into the emotional situation of a in the middle ages a social <UNK> to that time might be disappointed
<START> mel brooks has really <UNK> himself on this movie no one can deny that blazing <UNK> was a classic and a breakthrough in this style of comedy film but men in <UNK> has become the <UNK> of his creative genius this movie is a definite must see if you enjoy this movie i would also recommend space balls and history of the world the same goes in reverse if you have seen any of these movies then men in <UNK> should be next on your list
<START> well i don't normally think there's such a thing as a horrible movie but this is pretty damned close the best acting performance in the whole thing was <UNK> <UNK> who has one line in a 10 second scene i agree with the glad it was short review the music videos at the end were cool though
<START> before this clip music videos were merely to display an artist michael jackson's thriller created a whole new section of music videos which can honestly be called mini movies thriller follows a couple as they travel to the girl's house from a movie on the way they encounter zombies announced by the immortal vincent price my favorite part is where the zombies <UNK> in on the couple and the girl turns to see that michael has turned into one of them then they do a little dance the scariest thing about thriller may be the fact that it is consistently more fun and enjoyable than a lot of movies that are made after twenty years it remains the <UNK> music video br br p s my music video top 5 5 madonna like a <UNK> 4 guns <UNK> <UNK> sweet child of mine 3 nine inch nails closer 2 peter gabriel <UNK> 1 michael jackson thriller
<START> this was very good except for two things which i'll mention at the end the animation is great <UNK> by nick park and <UNK> trademark of exaggerated teeth and mouths of the characters which make you laugh almost every time you see someone the color was magnificent too br br the best part of the film however is the clever comedy woven throughout this is another of these animated films in which there is so much to see and hear each frame that it would require many viewings to catch all the gags it's just a funny exaggerated look at the oddball wallace and his silent and smart dog <UNK> along the way it <UNK> fun people who get carried away with their <UNK> gardens something akin to how the obsessive dog lovers were <UNK> in best of show br br my only complaints were two typical traits of today's films animated or not 1 let's make the <UNK> in the film look like a total idiot 2 let's <UNK> the final action scene with the predictable result but way overdone those aside this is still a very amusing film that should provide a lot of laughs to many people and a movie to enjoy multiple times
<START> some time ago we read of the results of a <UNK> taken by some newspaper sports writers the questions <UNK> were only two and were brief and right to the point br br the question number 1 asked to tell who was his most beloved college football team question number 2 asked the fan to name his most hated college football team the answer to both questions was simply <UNK> dame <UNK> is tops on both lists yeah love 'em or hate 'em but you sure don't ignore em br br the roots of this unique position of this college football <UNK> are found in the life and career of one grown up little immigrant boy from chicago named br br as a biopic the production of all american 1940 came out relatively close to the death of coach in a 1930 plane crash it was about 10 years after that the film was released that would mean that <UNK> work on the project started about 8 years after our <UNK> great loss of mr br br his <UNK> and voice were well known from <UNK> radio and motion picture news <UNK> both widow bonnie and the university of <UNK> dame had <UNK> rights in choosing the actor to play the lead and the script we think that they could not have done the job any better pat o'brien truly looks the part and was himself a <UNK> in college ronald reagan is cast in the pivotal role of george a free spirited student going to <UNK> dame on a baseball <UNK> he was a walk on football player br br the cast runs full of talented players we have griffith veteran donald crisp as <UNK> <UNK> c s c <UNK> dame president albert is <UNK> the chemistry <UNK> and mentor <UNK> page appears as the mrs bonnie owen davis jr is <UNK> gus the <UNK> in that historic <UNK> vs army game at west point br br the cast is rounded out by kane <UNK> nick william marshall and william <UNK> as the four <UNK> real life big time college <UNK> howard jones warner bill and <UNK> <UNK> appear as themselves in scenes of <UNK> <UNK> into college sports and add an authentic touch br br as for biopic all american all one can only say that it hits the ground running and did not slow down from beginning to end there is no wasted time either all the screen time is used to move the story along br br use of <UNK> dame choir the campus itself and all that <UNK> band march music all ad to the feeling of really being there br br to this day even though their basketball team and other sports teams compete in the big east <UNK> <UNK> dame remains an independent in <UNK> football what this means that in effect the fighting irish play a national schedule br br there was no such <UNK> with the family of george there was a <UNK> some years ago over the scene portraying young mr giving the famous win for the speech television <UNK> of this all were minus the speech in the death bed scene br br other <UNK> dame themed films were made over the years the spirit of <UNK> dame universal 1931 featured j farrell <UNK> as a look alike coach it also featured <UNK> <UNK> andy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as well as the members of the real <UNK> dame championship teams featuring the real four <UNK> then of course we have <UNK> <UNK> star 1993 with sean <UNK> jon <UNK> ned beatty and charles <UNK> among others in a fine cast there was also talk of an <UNK> film critical of <UNK> dame called golden glory but nothing has <UNK> has it let me know dear reader <UNK> br br warner brothers always had great music in their both in opening themes and in incidental music in this movie they have <UNK> the <UNK> dame fight song in the score along with it were step <UNK> dame and the <UNK> dame <UNK> <UNK> which had its premiere at the funeral in 1930 at the <UNK> dame
<START> i cannot believe anyone is giving this film a good rating in addition to the terrible acting thin nonexistent plot line and pace this would be the movie to watch if you were really trying to fall asleep the writer's and director's brains must have been fried eggs to ever have <UNK> something as <UNK> as this based on the plot summary on the dvd case the premise really sounded promising but within the first ten minutes i knew it was a lost cause if you want to see a really creep take on the area <UNK> idea check out the remake of the hills have eyes <UNK> will soon fade away as all pathetic films of its <UNK> do next
<START> i watched this video because i like <UNK> and this movie was filmed in its entirety there very disappointing since it fails to catch any of the flavor or beauty of the island just the hot dry and <UNK> elements the movie was dull boring completely incoherent from beginning to end pretentious and devoid of any <UNK> plot you had to be a psychic to follow the plot line or lack thereof it had its moments sure but so does going to the dentist br br in short i'd much rather endure another before viewing this horrible mess again it was so bad i actually couldn't fall asleep there are quite a few <UNK> movies out there that were obviously made without adult <UNK> this is one of them on the bright side who is <UNK> <UNK> never before have i seen a more beautiful set of legs she is the one saving grace of this movie br br disturbing too was the cruel <UNK> hunt depicted in the closing credits a <UNK> that was released on someone's property <UNK> has very few native <UNK> all of them small rats bats etc and then set upon by dogs before it was shot oh well go visit <UNK> anyway despite this film it's a beautiful colorful island rich in history and lots of fun
<START> this is quite an entertaining b flick in the universal horror series featuring dracula the <UNK> and <UNK> monster the plot revolves around dracula john carradine and larry <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jr <UNK> visiting a revolutionary doctor they both ask him if they can be <UNK> and the doctor attempts to <UNK> a way for each beneath the doctor's castle they find <UNK> monster buried in mud this is apparently a reference to the previous movie in the frankenstein series br br of course if things had went as planned the movie would have turned out incredibly boring instead dracula can't <UNK> his <UNK> and the doctor is eventually infected by a blood <UNK> with <UNK> as a semi vampire the doctor goes insane and <UNK> <UNK> monster as with all of the universal horror series the ending is completely <UNK> a beautiful woman with a <UNK> one of the doctor's two <UNK> has a particularly gruesome end plus you just have to feel sorry for <UNK> monster in this film he's awake for around two minutes kills one police officer and then yet another building what's this the fifth now <UNK> on top of him and is consumed by flames it is also unfortunate that the great character created in the wolf man 1941 larry <UNK> is really reduced here people that film and <UNK> performance in it here he would be <UNK> criticized as wooden all in all though it's a pretty fun movie at just <UNK> minutes a nice waste of time 7 10
<START> a beautiful woman a backwoods <UNK> monster man a super sweet monster truck a road kill zombie brother and 2 friends one <UNK> <UNK> overly sensitive nerd and the other a foul mouthed adolescent <UNK> throw them all together with a dash of <UNK> <UNK> texas chainsaw massacre and road trip and you've got monster man a hilarious horror comedy outing that never sets out to say something it's a simple straight forward laugh fest <UNK> and well made this horror comedy is at its heart a buddy flick this film offered some hilarious and sickening set pieces i highly recommend this to fright fans looking to be entertained
<START> good job that's how i would describe this animated scooby doo adventure this is so far the best of the animated scooby movies i have seen i liked the story i thought it had some depth to to it the movie is also well paced it doesn't get boring for a minute it also has an interesting group of characters besides scooby and shaggy and the gang of course plus the movie was a real blast i has a lot of fun watching it i also liked the great scottish music it was very catchy and <UNK> naturally we know that scooby and the will solve the mystery but it's still fun getting to that point the animation is also pretty good for this movie i would love it if they did a 3d animation scooby adventure but we'll just have to wait and see for me scooby doo and the <UNK> <UNK> monster is a 7 10
<START> this third installment in the scarecrow series is by far the best of the lot i know i know but how good is it well let's not be silly it's still pretty bad but by comparison to the first two it's a fine film again shot on digital with decent lighting and good camera work br br spoiler br br when a college baseball team new members one is left in a <UNK> coma of course they abandon him in a <UNK> tied to a scarecrow in keeping with the legend the boy's soul is transferred into the body of the scarecrow which comes to life and <UNK> terrible vengeance on well pretty much everyone the co <UNK> drive to the beach which is somehow very close to the <UNK> on the sunny beach they are killed one by one by the <UNK> scarecrow br br writer director brian does a credible job of bringing some much needed drama to the film unfortunately the drama leaps over good and lands in common cheese much of the acting was fair but there were some really terrible bits including an awful piece of poorly done lip <UNK> some plot points were left mostly <UNK> and most were used to get someone alone so they could be slaughtered again better than the previous <UNK> but still lacking
<START> this production of hamlet prince of <UNK> is by far the best that i have seen although it may not have the production value of some of the more recent adaptations it does have the most important element sir derek <UNK> as hamlet br br <UNK> portrayal of the disturbed prince is multi layered and riveting his displays of emotion swing from hatred to sorrow love to and everywhere else on the map but without seeming forced or over the top in fact some of the more powerful sequences occur when he <UNK> them with <UNK> soft speech and thoughtful expression as to whether or not he <UNK> hamlet as mad or sane well you should decide for yourselves i changed my mind more than once at one point it seems he has thought himself sane and merely playing at madness but suspects that he is actually mad after all a revelation to himself captured beautifully having performed the part of hamlet on stage more times than any other actor in history <UNK> <UNK> for the role then comes as little surprise br br as for the production itself it is presented as a kind of filmed copy of the stage play with little special effects or fancy camera work minimal sets and no musical <UNK> to speak of this production relies on the acting <UNK> of the cast and the words of shakespeare to evoke the emotion and interest of its audience and it works the other players are top notch as well particularly patrick stewart's <UNK> and claire <UNK> <UNK> together the cast present a <UNK> ensemble br br the last but far from least element that makes this production stand out is the play itself here it is presented in its entirety a <UNK> on film but oddly enough i never noticed the time i was too busy getting caught up in the story i suspect that you will too
<START> this <UNK> movie about a sister and her battle to save as many souls as she can is very moving the film does well in picking up the characters and showing how sister helen deals with each br br a wonderful journey from life to death br br
<START> i think that you can not imagine how these people really work before i came to the studios to watch the guys work there i actually thought quite the same as you do but since i saw and did the work the guys on that tv show have to do i have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they are doing all day long that really is no easy work and also the actors which in your eyes may be terribly bad are really great people and a lot of them really can act i don't think that the material given to them can really show that as i think this material isn't very good but they are truly good so i don't think that you before you haven't seen these guys doing there work can judge over them and i shouldn't have judged over them as well before i met them but i did and am now terribly ashamed of it so please do not allow yourself to judge over these great people unless you haven't seen them doing there job
<START> this was a movie i came across by accident i was flipping through and saw it was on showtime so i watched it now i watch it at least once a month this is a movie that is filled with symbols that might cause some people to trash it don't listen to people that hate this movie if they want an action movie with expensive f x they should have rented a movie that promises them if you are in the mood for a good sci fi i highly recommend if <UNK> on dvd i recommend the alliance atlantic edition of the film it contains many more extras than the dimension films edition
<START> peter hunt started out as a very gifted film editor and got his first stab at directing when he <UNK> the james bond film on her <UNK> secret service considered by many bond fans to be the best of the series other titles in his filmography include epic scale adventure movies like gold and shout at the devil both adapted from <UNK> smith novels <UNK> travels is an odd one on his list of films it seems strange that a director of <UNK> style and expertise would choose to direct a film of this kind a half live action half animated retelling of jonathan <UNK> classic satire the film looked twenty years out of date even when it was made and in all honesty it simply doesn't work and there's not a damn thing that hunt with his usual eye for fast paced action or star richard harris who can usually <UNK> the most stilted of roles can do to rescue this one br br <UNK> richard harris is a brilliant medical student living in <UNK> century <UNK> his father norman shelley wants him to go to london to make his fortune but <UNK> prefers the idea of receiving rather less pay but a heck of a lot more adventure as a <UNK> surgeon aboard a ship called the during a voyage the is blown off course during a storm and hits a <UNK> the ship sinks and everyone is lost apart from who finds himself washed <UNK> in the kingdom of when he comes round <UNK> finds that the strange land where he has washed <UNK> is populated by incredibly small humans no <UNK> than his toe to them he looks like a giant they <UNK> <UNK> to help them in a war against another race of tiny people who live on an <UNK> island but <UNK> doesn't like being manipulated for purposes of war and <UNK> so he makes plans to br br harris is left to carry the entire film here his first couple of scenes involve other actors but once he is <UNK> in he spends the rest of the film <UNK> over <UNK> high sets and acting alongside his animated counterparts the idea of mixing live action and animation was not new at the time but it certainly hadn't been done a lot a few disney movies like song of the south so dear to my heart and <UNK> dragon had <UNK> with the idea but it was still pretty much in its <UNK> <UNK> travels is not an especially well animated film but the scenes showing interaction between harris and his cartoon co stars are at least competently done occasionally the film tries to be true to its satirical origins there's one scene where we learn that has gone to war with its <UNK> because of eggs and the point seems to be that wars can begin over the most ridiculous of things but at its heart this is very much a kids' film and the satirical overtones are barely <UNK> upon everyone involved has done better things during their career  <UNK> travels might fill an otherwise empty afternoon but apart from that it is a forgettable and <UNK> experience
<START> latest attempt to revive the series actually based on a pretty good idea but without the required gore fx violence for this type of thriller and thus boring good special fx sets costumes etc but the film comes of just plain silly and a near waste of time hopefully the next installment will correct this problem
<START> kevin kline offers a brilliant comic turn in the 1997 comedy in out kline plays howard <UNK> a small town history teacher who <UNK> sits down to watch the academy awards this year because one of his former students matt dillon is a <UNK> he is nominated for his performance in a film where he plays a gay soldier and when he wins he thanks howard in his speech for inspiring him because howard is gay now this floors howard because he as no clue why thus guy would say this on international television howard is even engaged to be married to joan cusack in an oscar nominated performance so he has no idea where dillon s cameron drake got the idea that he is gay and finds he has to defend himself to everyone at school but is shocked that no one seemed terribly shocked by what cameron said on the oscars howard has a birthday party where he is given birthday presents like the soundtrack to <UNK> and ends up explaining to his guests why barbra streisand had to make funny lady his parents <UNK> <UNK> debbie reynolds are shocked but promise to support their son even if he is gay he also gets a visit from an out of town reporter tom <UNK> who wants to do an article about him because he's gay too the moment when <UNK> plants a big kiss right on <UNK> lips is a classic but all of these little things have howard actually questioning his sexuality and wondering if he really is gay much to the <UNK> and frustration of his fiancée cusack who is beyond confused the scene where she leaves a bar in her wedding <UNK> and stands in the middle of street screaming about the lack of single straight men in the world is a classic but what i like about this movie is the way kline fully <UNK> in the role and was not afraid to look foolish or look gay there is a fabulous scene probably the most famous from the film where he buys a record on how to be macho and the guy on the record is talking about how real men don't dance and a disco tune comes on i will survive if memory serves and the narrator on the record says no matter what you do don't dance but howard can't help himself and he ends up shaking his groove thing all over the room it's hysterically funny and kline plays it with sincerity and gusto the film is not pro or anti gay it's just a <UNK> and amusing character study about a man trying to figure out exactly who he is wonderful film
<START> though this film doesn't stand out particularly from the movie crowd its still a very nice film to sit down and watch with your feet up there maybe the odd one or two mistakes you catch and the cinematic are a little <UNK> the film itself is very enjoyable and has a wonderful atmosphere to it the music contributes a lot to the mood of the movie br br the acting is none the less impressive especially the dog he he with john travolta taking the lead of the fun <UNK> loving michael other characters feel very genuine and perform very well within the film br br so after a long day at work stick michael on in the evening with some ice cream and enjoy a very quality film in its own right
<START> i am speechless simmons has managed to do something i thought impossible he has made the harlem on <UNK> island look like citizen kane painful cannot even begin to describe this piece of i don't know mind you the premise sounded funny but now that i've seen it it's funny in the way that dropping an <UNK> on your <UNK> is funny br br i won't bother to describe the premise as the title says it all if only to say i don't think there was literally one funny thing in this film not one not even the monkey bite how could one of the funniest characters in the vacation franchise the sleazy white trash eddie randy quaid be made so <UNK> unfunny i never felt so much sympathy for an actor in my life i equally <UNK> the other actors <UNK> in this comedic atrocity <UNK> flynn catherine <UNK> long suffering but sunny wife dana <UNK> the original audrey <UNK> fred <UNK> and the stunning sung hi lee perhaps the only reason to watch the film if only with the sound off save for that old <UNK> ed <UNK> uncle nick he had it coming alas the audience didn't i only say thank heavens that chevy chase who has been in a <UNK> for years <UNK> clear of this <UNK> splatter it's the <UNK> career move he ever made br br i don't know if you folks are religious like i am but i know i'll be praying to the lord tonight to add 2 hours if not 2 years to my life to make up for the time i spent in front of the television that i'll never get back otherwise br br hot water burn baby says zero out of 10 stars if you take a few hits off the <UNK> and drink the water maybe 1 <UNK> of a star out of 10
<START> this movie deserved better mike <UNK> satirical wit brought to light something too many in this country are trying to deny we're getting dumber as a society br br could the 24 hour a day anna nicole coverage be any more proof mike judge paints a frightening future where the dumb survive and <UNK> makes you stop and think and laugh can you look at the world and not ask are we getting dumber are we being <UNK> by the human trash as well as our own trash beware of br br the movie is really funny i'd tell you more of the plot but i don't want to spoil it br br so why release this film with zero promotion could it be that the stupid are already taking over
<START> first i played the second monkey island game and i liked it despite the low quality graphics and sound then a few months later i found out a new game was made i tried it out and liked it a lot first thing you notice is the great graphics the areas are huge colorful and detailed with lots to explore the game requires you to use your brain a lot as always the game is challenging with all point and click games frustrating the jokes haven't gotten old a third time around the animated cut scenes are a great addition to the game also this is the best <UNK> game out there perhaps the best p c game too if you like <UNK> games that play like a movie get this game
<START> 17 <UNK> <UNK> more 1969 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br for a film that most viewers have agreed is pretty average i'm impressed by quite how many <UNK> interpretations have been offered of it i've only <UNK> the web quite briefly and i've already been informed that more is a 19th century style romance an <UNK> to the story of <UNK> a plain film full of dull people and of interest only to pink <UNK> <UNK> it's fair to say then that critical reception is mixed i would argue that these wildly <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> 1969 directorial debut are proof enough that more is anything but a pretty average film br br neither is it a masterpiece of course i approached more as i did easy rider and <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> film a <UNK> of an era despite the differences in pace style and content between these movies they all have similar flaws either vague or downright unlikeable characters acting that seems slightly <UNK> from reality relaxed editing and abrupt endings that have left viewers <UNK> these movies never try to be <UNK> or meet the audience half way they are what they are man this in itself is not a problem as long as we are left with a <UNK> of the experience thankfully more offers several truly memorable images sounds and <UNK> to the viewer and this is what saves it br br <UNK> is a young man who arrives in paris fresh from his studies in germany the first part of the film follows him as he falls in with a group of french <UNK> <UNK> them to <UNK> cool and self conscious parties and bars before meeting <UNK> the two characters become sexually and <UNK> involved and he promises to follow her to <UNK> against the advice of his friend charlie this is where the <UNK> thing comes into play she is the sun he is pursuing her you may now be able to guess how this all ends br br <UNK> is an <UNK> so far away from the <UNK> urgency of the over populated paris that the naive <UNK> knows he must be on to a good thing <UNK> remains <UNK> and <UNK> and the island has a less <UNK> <UNK> up until now i had cared little for either of these characters and their <UNK> pursuit of somewhere to be really free but once the action is <UNK> down to just these two the film becomes poignant quite suddenly during just one single <UNK> exchange of dialogue in the remote villa they inhabit the place where their <UNK> love i went from watching with a <UNK> optimism to being utterly <UNK> i can't think of many other films that have done this br br the relationship between <UNK> and <UNK> is real and human in that we can see it go from life defining <UNK> to <UNK> and cruel <UNK> they take a lot of drugs and <UNK> naked on the the rocks and <UNK> their lives <UNK> around nothing but each other and the beautiful <UNK> surroundings for a while their situation is the very essence of freedom emotional <UNK> and experience for its own sake but <UNK> is not in control and this is the downfall of more than just his future on <UNK> br br pink <UNK> score is a perfect fit for the <UNK> the <UNK> and the foreboding of more it is one of the most memorable <UNK> along with the <UNK> <UNK> around bed and their <UNK> <UNK> around the <UNK> which appears on the soundtrack <UNK> front cover a scene in which they take acid to escape from heroin <UNK> is <UNK> of the fundamental flaws of the couple they cannot without a crash maybe they've come too close to what they wanted br br <UNK> never makes contact with any family or friends from before his arrival in paris we are left to presume they have no idea where he is while other 1960s <UNK> movies <UNK> on <UNK> excess the media and <UNK> <UNK> has instead presented us with a story focused upon one man who backs himself into a little corner somewhere in the world and quietly disappears
<START> i really wanted to love this movie and not only cause it had aaron in it but i thought the premise would be cool cause i enjoy movies and shows that revolves around <UNK> the cinematography was good but besides it being <UNK> around <UNK> everything else is just very cliché oh and little miss sunshine was very irritating in this movie although <UNK> <UNK> seems to be a bit irritating in every movie she is in cause she plays a lot of roles where she is <UNK> it has some decent flashes of cooking but food really didn't play a big part in the movie than i expected which was a big disappointment for me this film had some good potential the cast was great but they just had very little to work with i like a good light hearted romantic comedy but this was just bland and longer than it should be cause it felt way longer than it is it's not a terrible movie you just won't miss anything by not watching this movie br br 4 5 10
<START> the great news is that this film is now available on dvd from http com for all those who wish to own it as well as on video this is good news as it is one of my favourite films br br i watched this film for the first time in the 80s and it is <UNK> holiday viewing living in the small market town called <UNK> and with its own traditions of <UNK> and traditions we are also a <UNK> tight community we are now also faced with large <UNK> developments which <UNK> to destroy the community and you can see why i love this film first of all and most important there are <UNK> of snow then there is the lovely legend of the christmas tree and also the christian denouement as all the community <UNK> up the money to help the <UNK> farmer save his farm and stay in the community the evil <UNK> only after the money are sent <UNK> as the whole town <UNK> their money to help protect what they have which is very special i love the way the whole community send their message to santa via the post office which is misunderstood by the hero he and his daughter have a long journey to make after the death of the wife and mother of the family there is a likely candidate for this even a <UNK> ride and most heartwarming of all is that the taxi driver whose engine is broken is mysteriously given a new one on christmas morning and no one had <UNK> it there is a lovely moment where denver sings a <UNK> and an exciting search great gentle film for everything christmas is really about
<START> today you die was the 4th seagal movie in a mini marathon i just held wow i don't know where to start he seems to <UNK> his lines more and more as time goes on and the scenes between seagal and where they seem to <UNK> are embarrassing and what did his <UNK> dreams have to do with anything else in the plot i can't recommend this to anyone but the most die hard seagal fan and even then you are better off with his earlier work of the 4 films in my marathon <UNK> into the sun <UNK> and today you die today was the worst a previous reviewer mentioned this but the usage of stock footage was quite obvious
<START> you have to see this movie it's a big <UNK> in the history of film when this film was made american film industry reached the bottom of sucking see this movie laugh and feel sorry for yourself for wasting the last 2 hours of your life it's the worst acting i've seen and even worse directing the villains laugh like they're taken from a clown circus and if the guys who did scary movie want to do a parody on superhero movies they only have to take the script from this movie and do a remake called black <UNK> iii the threat of really really bad movies who in some way manages to lure the production companies into a sequel suicide
<START> the closer she gets is an <UNK> documentary dealing with the death of a person i actually knew it allows a glimpse into the private moments of the family involved in the most trying time of their lives parents tend to support the work of their children in this case the subject of the documentary went above and beyond she was willing to share her death experience as an act of love for her son it is a most touching work of art <UNK> the serious <UNK> and lighter sides of life for this family the story is one which can make you laugh but also cry as it <UNK> issues we all must face i highly recommend this documentary to those <UNK> to cry and are willing to deal with the issue of <UNK> in a most human manner this film will touch you
<START> this is a spin off of pulp fiction i thought that it would be good for a few decent laughs well it turns out that this movie really was terrible the whole plot doesn't follow on the pulp fiction plot it turns to other movie like forrest <UNK> and more some laughs came out of this movie but all and all it totally took 90 minutes of my life away from me if you are thinking of renting this movie please don't it will waste 90 minutes of your life <UNK> renting this and go on and find a movie that actually makes sense please if there is a <UNK> fiction 2 i will definitely not go on and rent the sequel just giving a heads up for those out there
<START> i think several others have already commented on this film but i liked it so well i wanted to just say how good a film this is i gave it a rating of 9 out of 10 it did not get a 10 because it is very slow starting i almost quit on it but am glad i didn't hang in there it is well worth the wait br br this is primarily a film about relationships <UNK> trust and betrayal br br michelle pfeiffer jessica lange and jason <UNK> all do bang up jobs in this movie br br set in <UNK> farm country jason <UNK> character is a farmer whose grandfather first settled there <UNK> character is getting older and he decides to set up a trust <UNK> the thousand <UNK> of <UNK> among his three adult daughters that's when the plot of this film really beginning cooking br br sisters turn against each other due to <UNK> rather than greed over the land they also make some <UNK> about each other's <UNK> and their present day <UNK> including an <UNK> affair while the father becomes increasingly abusive demanding and paranoid until the terrible truth about everyone finally comes <UNK> out br br this film really reached me emotionally i got angry right along with some of the characters and sad with them i could feel their pain due to the excellent performances that were given br br the ending was a bit of a surprise to me but in keeping with the growth of the characters br br
<START> i can't imagine a director whose <UNK> for blood and violence is greater than quentin <UNK> at least in his films <UNK> is no different we all know tarantino the guy who <UNK> on the scene in the early 90s with cult classics such as <UNK> dogs and pulp fiction since he has been a disappointment for some well i am <UNK> to say tarantino has not lost his touch he brings us his best since pulp fiction and thankfully so br br we know the story a wwii tale told only as tarantino can fictional of course a war film hasn't been done like this before brad pitt as lt <UNK> <UNK> leads the <UNK> in nazi occupied france their goal <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as colonel hans <UNK> plays a similar role on the other side he's know as the jew hunter and goes about his business as ruthless as no other the third sub story consists of a young jewish <UNK> <UNK> who witnesses the slaughter of her family and she of course wishes to plot revenge on the germans for her devastating lose there actually is three stories here <UNK> and connecting with each other if you know anything about tarantino or his films this is nothing new for him br br war has never been been so fun the <UNK> are haunting but at the same time very funny at times even hilarious the dark comedy aspect play a big aspect in this as in many other tarantino films the entertainment and hilarity is led by brad pitt i found him extremely funny and entertaining i couldn't wait to see him on screen again even with his crazy accent he works in this type of film also making great impressions were <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> who were tremendous the film was filled with noteworthy performances br br the story itself has so many historical inaccuracies to even count but so what it isn't meant to be a documentary tarantino wanted to have fun with as should we the cinematography department deserves big props with beautiful vibrant colors <UNK> the film you've really got to love the last line in the film but pulp fiction remains his masterpiece br br quentin tarantino among all other things is an entertainer wwii is one of the most tragic events in history but tarantino some how manages to make it fun <UNK> is a fun film it's tremendously entertaining shocking dramatic suspenseful and funny at the same time jam packed with everything you look for in a movie done with that certain tarantino style it's worth being checked out it's time to experience for yourself what war is like through the eyes of quentin tarantino
<START> not a larry masterpiece but it stands on its own as a good western any of the <UNK> <UNK> do who ever takes on the role of <UNK> call does a great portrayal in their own style it's also easy to see that they were looking to use this as a stepping stone to the t v series both version of it and that the writers knew how to keep the flavor alive william peterson was awesome in this the geeky c s i guy is not the character he plays in this this guy can do it all it seems br br it's deserve to be enjoyed by those who enjoy westerns br br stars
<START> head is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968 the movie is a complete <UNK> of the <UNK> image it presents the <UNK> in a way their fans never perceived them men with real thoughts totally controlled by their producers the <UNK> were given the opportunity to tell their side of the story the film <UNK> fun at their image the entertainment industry and corporate america the soundtrack contains some of their best music it's a movie well worth seeing over and over again
<START> a sleeper i had never even heard of this movie until i was channel jumping one night i've been a police officer myself for 25 years and thought this was a true to life movie non police critics are rating the movie purely from a <UNK> point of view and not from a police <UNK> point of view this is real
<START> the screenplay is the worst part of this film as it <UNK> from one premise to the next missing all the important bits that would have made a number of different stories possible this film is confusing because the audience doesn't know what the story is i had no problem with the low production values and the acting wasn't great but this is telly so it was fine i don't mind if some scenes looked like they were done in one take but having such a non <UNK> screenplay is completely unnecessary did any executive actually read it before <UNK> out the cash avoid this at all costs br br the prologue in particular was so poorly written it needed a voice over to fill in all the details that had been left out the prologue was rushed it wasn't clear what was happening ie the russian revolution was reduced to some <UNK> are happening in <UNK> with the next scene being soldiers <UNK> them i know the basic history of the revolution so i could fill in the details those <UNK> <UNK> the prologue is best ignored br br this could have been a thoughtful study of a person who is confused about who she is it sets up this premise in the asylum it could then have her struggling to identify herself for the rest of the film no gone the film assumes she is who she says she is even though there is still no <UNK> evidence it sets up a melodramatic romance a love so strong it'll believe anything she says okay a <UNK> romance no because it makes no sense the love interest seems like a crazed and incidentally sleazy lunatic <UNK> out in wild gestures this also doesn't work because the film <UNK> decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end they never got married and she returned to america the love story <UNK> despite there being plenty of love scenes i was never convinced of the reason that they were in love i find <UNK> com romances more convincing despite there only being one or two scenes which establish that they've even spent any time with each other br br it could have been a thriller type thing where the film assumes she is who she says she is and she struggles to prove her identity no the court case is summed up rather than dealt with the bizarre voice over comes back again to fill in the details of a better film br br the funniest thing to consider is what really happened anna anderson was a loony who went to america and married another loony and they did crazy things together throughout her life she had <UNK> of lunatic behaviour none of this in the film either there's a really annoying character in the asylum who <UNK> up from nowhere and <UNK> herself as a <UNK> flew over the <UNK> next <UNK> <UNK> type <UNK> thankfully she <UNK> having brought nothing to the story

<START> i caught this for the first time a few nights ago on television i expected to only tune in for a few minutes but found myself intrigued by the movie i ended up watching it all and found it surprisingly compelling the acting by the three american leads was quite good especially that of alex <UNK> he plays a <UNK> with quite a degree of vulnerability very different from how most of them are portrayed in westerns he ended up in several situations where he was at the mercy of the bounty hunters the final shootout between the three leads and the bad guys was very good as was the scene where the doctor <UNK> a bullet out of clay <UNK> somewhat gruesome but realistic i must admit that despite my initial <UNK> at watching a spaghetti western i ended up enjoying this film quite a bit i would recommend it to anyone who likes westerns
<START> it <UNK> me no end that now and forever i will have to identify this movie which i consider a masterpiece and i don't use that word lightly with the <UNK> not the michael douglas movie not only are the titles the same but they refer to the same thing the <UNK> <UNK> that upon the survivors of the first nuclear <UNK> in <UNK> film this is no cheap metaphor the whole movie is about the <UNK> physical and emotional from <UNK> and the war itself as the <UNK> of a couple and their grown niece becomes more <UNK> clear the ironic imagery becomes more potent from the old clock that is <UNK> each night to the stone gods that gradually pile up outside the <UNK> door these in turn are <UNK> by a <UNK> veteran who is compelled in a series of episodes to attack anything with a <UNK> that approaches the town the bombing day itself is shown in <UNK> flashbacks that are <UNK> horrifying yet black rain can be watched even repeatedly because of <UNK> compassion for his characters i repeat a masterpiece
<START> forget easy rider head is the film about the 1960s br br almost laugh as the <UNK> <UNK> their entire career to a one minute tv commercial about see the 50 foot victor mature try to figure out what the heck he's doing in this film hear frank <UNK> with his pet cow on <UNK> tell jones your music is awfully white experience the only live performance as a real rock band play the honest to gosh first ever real punk rock song circle sky listen as jones sings a harry <UNK> song about having a <UNK> father be confused be very confused as confused as <UNK> <UNK> is when mickey <UNK> makes sexual <UNK> about her in her film debut witness <UNK> <UNK> against the vietnam war leap out of nowhere and just as quickly disappear watch mike spit on christmas while wearing a <UNK> victorian smoking jacket in a gothic horror movie sound stage let yourself drift into the <UNK> bliss inspired by a comic book version of indian <UNK> delivered by a hammy white character actor in black face while peter pretends that he knows how to play a guitar discover academy award winning director bob first feature length film as written by academy award winning actor jack nicholson pretend it's not happening when the <UNK> commit group suicide by jumping off the golden gate bridge take drugs take a lot of drugs take as many drugs as the cast and crew evidently did while making this film br br with head the <UNK> revealed themselves as the <UNK> in hollywood history bar none it is <UNK> to discover that they blamed the failure of this film on bad <UNK> to be sure the promotion was virtually non existent but did they not recognize how angry how down right depressing how self destructive this film actually is i mean this film is a trip on bad acid to the suicide ward of a mental hospital the only film i know to be this depressing is terry <UNK> brazil and like brazil this film reveals why life in the later 20th century was almost unbearable if you were lucky it's not simply that western culture was suffering from serious information <UNK> but the information itself was just bad bad more bad and dismal in fact it was the <UNK> effect itself that kept people going since this allowed people to keep distracting themselves with one crisis or another if news from vietnam became too much to bear they could turn the channel and watch a documentary on the rising <UNK> rate br br the positive response to the reality revealed in head was <UNK> three days of peace and love and nudity and mud and bugs and bad food and dirty drink and <UNK> and pee and bad acid and peter <UNK> almost killing <UNK> hoffman all taking place behind a steel fence under the lovingly <UNK> eyes of a <UNK> army of ny state troopers meaning that the freedom of <UNK> nation was as <UNK> as the song john thought he was singing while so strung out he could barely speak 500 000 <UNK> too stupid to come in out of the rain was one <UNK> judgment on <UNK> i think it was andy <UNK> br br the one good thing occurring there was <UNK> <UNK> star <UNK> <UNK> two years previously the <UNK> <UNK> experience had gone on their first national tour of america as the warm up band opening for the <UNK> br br see it's all connected somehow br br you owe it to yourself <UNK> you owe it to your unborn children to see the real 1960s only to be found on film in this bizarre <UNK> and utterly absurd tribute to one of the more interesting <UNK> <UNK> of the later 20th century
<START> i am a professional musician who was inspired nearly 20 years ago to begin playing guitar after hearing jimmy page on led <UNK> ii while i don't play in the same genre or style the impact of that man has been huge now nearly 20 years later i finally got to see something more than the not so good the song remains the same again i have seen so many bands perform some small some the current <UNK> ' no band no where no way has ever been able to pull off the magic that you can actually taste by watching this dvd br br robert plant can be a bit much at times and you can nearly sense <UNK> annoyance for him forgetting lyrics but that didn't matter i guess especially for the era genius shines more on this dvd then on any album with <UNK> the band of joy or lord is pretty ordinary but the magic of this dvd is how well the four of them perform together the world loved to imagine that they were into black magic k etc that was only a matter of interest to page the magic notice i say this a lot is that this dvd captures a rare glance to the <UNK> of 4 young boys who can play brilliantly no matter how sloppy they are actually playing it didn't matter br br a quick breakdown the first of the two dvd's is where the true magic is you should be able to sense the power and <UNK> had in their early days by the end of the second dvd page is struggling with his sanity during the songs it's no secret that by this time he was severely addicted to heroin so i'd recommend the first <UNK> to any music lover and the second for the only true <UNK> fan br br i may be going too far here for some <UNK> but i would say after watching this page is certainly more creative and inventive than <UNK> <UNK> i said it and if you disagree watch the dvd
<START> i am not even willing to vote a single star for this crap but imdb have zero as rating option worst movie i have ever watched story of the movie 1 predator ship crashes on earth 2 one alien and some face <UNK> are released and they start killing humans 3 one predator arrives on earth and he starts killing aliens and humans 4 then one human jet drops a bomb and kills human aliens and predator 5 some humans find the shoulder <UNK> of the predator 6 the end directors should consider money back to the viewers if still you want to watch this movie <UNK> from some <UNK> site and say thanks to me for saving you money all the movie has been filmed in some dark corner of the earth you see just dark shadows even in action scenes too much violence i didn't expect it from a fox movie
<START> although many <UNK> <UNK> fans are delighted with her work here i have to pass as a socially prominent member of the british smart set her british accent is basically non existent and her line <UNK> sound just like well line <UNK> and her <UNK> seems <UNK> like and <UNK> basil <UNK> usually a fine actor seems off <UNK> throughout and also speaks with a weird sort of accent in his case something like italian though we cannot be sure the script manages to keep his precise <UNK> a secret he is further <UNK> by the script which gives him one of those old movie <UNK> something to do with nerves which requires surgery the only real entertainment is provided by the <UNK> kay francis sporting a <UNK> bob with side <UNK> in her role as a <UNK> <UNK> who shamelessly <UNK> men including <UNK> and then <UNK> them out she pulls it off with her unique <UNK> she is the only living thing in this dead sea of a film
<START> ok say some college in southern california has an movie making class and some <UNK> were <UNK> just to film girls and they gave them a camera and then they were drunk stoned or just to plain stupid to actually use a camera and they turned this in for their grade and failed br br that is my only explanation for this this thing good god they left the date and time counter on during some of it the picture started in new scene way before the sound and forget about a plot well apparently there was one and they had to tell you all about it once the 3 hour introduction sequence was finished but i am glad they did because i never would have gotten it by watching this br br stay away from this
<START> i viewed the first two nights before coming to imdb looking for some actor info i saw the 9 rating which surprised me since i was not that impressed by what i'd seen as reference i happen to believe <UNK> <UNK> was the best tv western ever i grew up next to the mgm back lots in <UNK> city in the 50s and have a certain sense of <UNK> about the western genre br br so i saw the glowing first review and decided to read more there i found several reviews with 1 or 2 stars that summed up my feelings well about the lack of character development poor editing feeling that it was shot on the universal back lot <UNK> is long gone and overall impression that it was not going to come close to changing my feelings about <UNK> my impression is that the overwhelming vote of those who chose to write was less than a 4 0 br br this got me to wondering about the process that <UNK> a 9 rating if the people giving the <UNK> and <UNK> do not take the time to justify their vote is the <UNK> box being stuffed by people with a <UNK> motivation i have long used imdb as one tool to screen movies and thought it the best available now i am not so sure
<START> a lot about usa the movie can be summed up in its title it draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of hollywood like <UNK> that <UNK> things that shouldn't be <UNK> i'm not sure i agree with the <UNK> take on recent events although <UNK> i can't always tell exactly where he stands but i admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across audio tracks of speeches radio interviews poetry etc play as large a role here as visuals most of the time the visuals of the story are accompanied by these audio elements to good effect i'm kind of a radio buff so it was satisfying to hear the way that radio was integrated into the pace of the movie in fact most of the dialog takes place over the story rather than having characters talk to one another that's not to say that there aren't characters real people but except for jim the protagonist a kind of <UNK> drop out with an <UNK> state of mind the others come and go pretty quickly a few make a very powerful impression especially a guru like taxi driver who seems to be the voice of wisdom itself when he breaks out into a spontaneous song of <UNK> while driving jim to the subway it is a very powerful moment on the cover of the dvd is the quote the danger is clear which is taken from president <UNK> speech that <UNK> the way to our <UNK> into iraq in retrospect hearing that speech at a climactic moment in the film brought home how we are living in a historically charged moment which will always be remembered
<START> this film is a <UNK> <UNK> of various idiotic cliches for instance boy meets <UNK> rich girl and gets her to fall in love with him by <UNK> her in college an over used backdrop in recent indian commercial films a male <UNK> <UNK> of sexual conquest the climax is predictable having been used ad <UNK> in several other films as with many other recent commercial hindi films the film <UNK> with the <UNK> <UNK> of songs which probably contributed to the film's success more than anything else
<START> this episode sucks br br over the past few years i have watched all episodes of next generation and voyager and am now watching enterprise br br i am thoroughly enjoying this series until this episode i <UNK> at the screen in horror at the destruction of character and entertainment it is more like an attempt at slapstick br br it does not build the characters but throws them out on a <UNK> and leaves the audience <UNK> it does little to build the series br br why this was ever allowed to go to air <UNK> me was it the writing was it the directing was it the producer we'll probably never know br br but one bad apple isn't bad i suppose i say that hoping it is only one
<START> the thomas crown affair is a terrible remake of a not very good movie <UNK> only for the topless shots of former <UNK> <UNK> russo br br that's it the plot is <UNK> pierce brosnan <UNK> in his part and dennis <UNK> as usual plays an annoying irish cop but i couldn't take my eyes off the beautiful ms russo there's an okay love making scene on a <UNK> a <UNK> sexy ballroom dance a topless beach scene and a roll in the sack oh and there's a painting stolen from a museum and a gets sunk br br but let's hope other directors recognize ms <UNK> <UNK> attributes and cast her in more highly visible roles
<START> i think that toy soldiers is an excellent movie it's one of the only movies that aside from some well known actors has an unknown cast that can actually act in my opinion the plot is captivating it keeps your attention without having an outrageous story that couldn't possibly happen in real life i think that everyone would enjoy this movie sean <UNK> always seems to pick the perfect movies to be in that showcase his talent he's very underrated and doesn't get the recognition that he deserves other movies that he has been in other actors have been in the spotlight but this movie and <UNK> really showcase him because he is the main character in both i hope that he someday gets the <UNK> he deserves for his acting if you want to see a great movie you need to check this one out and if you are a sean <UNK> fan you will definitely like this movie
<START> this is a beautifully made film finely <UNK> the fragile human stories both before and after 1945 and the <UNK> combat of war the use of <UNK> from battle of britain a film that does not nearly so well portray the 1940s enhances rather than <UNK> from the whole a deeply impressive work this lived in my memory for the 2 years since i saw it and i have just bought it to explore the making of extras br br i highly recommend this film movie like <UNK> high it <UNK> between <UNK> exciting or scary air combat sequences where the viewer might experience actual loss of characters they'd come to care about but also unpredictable interactions on the ground where <UNK> writers and real life experiences inform some involving and moving events this also <UNK> the fact that for many people 1945 marked not just the end of one conflict but the beginning of another and even today we still don't <UNK> the loss bravery and sacrifice of so many <UNK> heroes or even worse we <UNK> them from a distance without allowing them to be human beings with all the emotional weaknesses that <UNK> making their sacrifices all the more <UNK> br br watching this movie is an experience which will take you from the heights of friendship to the depths of jealousy and back to love that <UNK> even beyond death if all war films were like this we'd never have to fight again br br did i mention it's worth watching br br 10 10
<START> while the dog was cute the film was not it wasn't the premise or the theme that was a problem the premise had great possibilities for humor and pathos both the theme is a worthy one helping other people is more important than <UNK> a fortune br br sadly the adorable dog the unique premise and the theme were <UNK> by poor acting stilted dialogue and amateurish filming br br even my youngest child who will sit through almost anything gave up before we had gotten halfway through how many times can that dog run up and down the same <UNK> i can't spoil it for you as i never saw the end it just was not worth watching all the way to the end
<START> if i had watched this movie when i hit rock bottom i probably would have sunk into the deepest depression of my life and may have been nearly desperate enough to try it the only thing is in the real world when you rob millions of dollars from unsuspecting individuals everything doesn't come up <UNK> unless you are an investment <UNK> or government <UNK> so how does that matter i had been rejected from school after school and it <UNK> so it is a brilliant topic for a movie and when you give yourself over to the imaginary to let yourself watch this movie without <UNK> real world <UNK> it can truly touch someone in that situation and let them know they are not alone overdone <UNK> completely tears apart the established educational system as we know it really all i can say is that as i am in college now looking back on where i was and watching this movie i can truly appreciate it in a way i never would have been able to otherwise it is juvenile and <UNK> yes but it is an emotional and uplifting fantasy about freedom and i cant think of a better way to end my night
<START> there is a serious scene in this movie a scene that lets you know that his film won't be pulling many cheap punches it takes place in a crowded train station and the protagonists are <UNK> by <UNK> with automatic weapons they make a break for it and just manage to get out in a <UNK> of <UNK> the main hall of the train station is now filled with corpses of innocent people that were caught in the <UNK> some would call that too sad and or grim to put into what is supposed to be an enjoyable action flick i call it honesty most action movies tend to lean toward the safe side of showing violence and plot elements this mostly means that in spite massive <UNK> innocent people tend not to die or at least we don't see them die the violence is all purely the good guys versus the bad guys with mainly the bad guys dying a bit of common sense clearly shows this to be absurd br br <UNK> <UNK> showed a hint of this in his first and sadly only hit die hard 2 the villains intentionally crash a plane full of people to get their point across the scene was also filmed with a <UNK> scene of a <UNK> plane with only a few people on board going down but the <UNK> and probably more realistic scenario ended up being used however to fit the spirit of the first film die hard 2 was mostly a fun action movie here that <UNK> and more convincing edge is <UNK> the violence is bloody the one liners are hilarious but with a certain style that more echoes natural human sarcasm than clichéd film <UNK> at key moments of action the plot is also packed with more <UNK> intent than most action films the villain is not just some rogue out for revenge or a mad grab at power it is less ridiculous but also more frightening than that from recent films the bourne trilogy almost gets there with its less cheesy than usual action film style but this film is from 1996 and 7 years before the bourne identity with matt damon made it to the big screen br br another interesting aspect is that the main hero is actually a heroine and this is well before the movie version of tomb <UNK> became a hit what's more is that this heroine genuinely looks like she could take down john <UNK> and then take his still lit cigarette this movie marks <UNK> <UNK> second action heroine role and she still didn't manage to score a hit while angelina jolie stars in tomb <UNK> years later and scores a hit the reasons are beyond me completely br br lastly this movie isn't all dark edged there are many outrageous and spectacular set pieces that one can only see in an action film the climatic explosion of a chemical bomb is an absolutely spectacular display of movie <UNK> with more than one law of physics taking a convenient break thus there is formula here but it is the anti formula for the everyday hollywood action movie formula 9 10 br br <UNK> 13 violence profanity
<START> the secret life starts with the worst possible narrative intro the crimes committed by jeffrey dahmer are too horrible to make a film about okay so what are you suggesting that we shouldn't bother to continue watching as the film won't be accurate or bloody anyway and they were right too the film isn't the least bit shocking and contains almost no blood or gore at all although i think that's mainly due to the low budget production values and not because of <UNK> crimes being too horrific basically the secret life jeffrey dahmer is just one sequence repeated over and over again young pitiful and mentally confused jeffrey picks up victims always males as he was a homosexual kills them and then talks about how it wasn't his intention to hurt them and about how lonely he is this gets boring really quick and even the admirable performance by unknown actor carl crew can't save this movie from being a total dud still this version is much better than the pretentious and hopelessly muddled dahmer that got released in 2002
<START> joan cusack steals the show the premise is good the plot line interesting and the screenplay was ok a tad too simplistic in that a coming out story of a gay man was so positive when it is usually not quite so positive then again it is fiction all in all an entertaining romp br br one thing i noticed was the inside joke aspect since the target audience probably was straight they may not get the gay stuff in context with the story br br kevin kline showed a <UNK> of his acting <UNK> that screenwriters sometimes don't take in consideration when suggesting kline for a part br br this one hit the mark
<START> this is definitely the biggest surprise of the festival so far and without a doubt the best the festival has had to offer i went into this film with little to no expectations after learning that the director was responsible for the awful vampire flick the <UNK> and i left pleasantly surprised the film stars <UNK> of in crowd fame as a young mother whose husband has just passed she moves into an old family home in the mountains with her two daughters next to a mine that is a <UNK> to <UNK> children back in the day unlucky for them the children return with a vengeance killing and eating everyone in their path the film works on many levels it's well done suspenseful it has spots of good cinematography and capable performances by <UNK> especially the atmosphere is spooky yet slightly <UNK> the score is decent and the makeup effects are gruesome and simplistic the film keeps up a creepy and unsettling tone and the kids themselves with pale skin torn up lips and hollow eyes are pretty scary and <UNK> the film is original and inventive without being to artsy or complicated i can't see this film making it into a wide release without some <UNK> and slight fine <UNK> but they definitely have a good product on there hands and should pursue some type of theatrical distribution however the theatre in which i saw it in was horrible the sound was dreadfully messed up which i felt took away from the film <UNK> and it stopped in the middle because they couldn't center it on the screen which killed the mood a bit all in all though it was the most satisfying of entries maybe because it had the least expectations but nonetheless was a welcome addition to genre films
<START> i think samuel <UNK> was trying to accomplish two things in this film first the film is a homage to <UNK> considered to be the best <UNK> <UNK> of the past century secondly having brought to the screen the dead end kids with his film of the same title and seeing them sign with warner brothers he was trying to create a second gang of appealing <UNK> br br though the film was good there certainly was no demand that the kids from this film be <UNK> for another feature br br leader of the gang is gene reynolds who at one time played the <UNK> but now leads a street gang of <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> arthur <UNK> breaks the <UNK> his late father gave young reynolds and threatens to send him to <UNK> school over the feeble <UNK> of his mother <UNK> main br br young reynolds happens to stumble onto a music school run by the old music <UNK> himself walter brennan and his daughter <UNK> they take him in but they have their financial problems with a lot of <UNK> led by porter hall br br this film is mostly to be seen today because it's a chance for classical music lovers to see and hear <UNK> who as you gather is the solution one way or another to everybody's problems joel <UNK> is in this film also but has a rather <UNK> part as <UNK> boyfriend br br besides one thing the film does do is touch on albeit <UNK> on the topic of child abuse and <UNK> <UNK> arthur <UNK> is one mean man and <UNK> main is very clearly a much <UNK> wife br br the kids in the cast do well reynolds tommy kelly terry and a young girl under the name of <UNK> <UNK> who grew up and performed as <UNK> <UNK> nightclub partner to nelson eddy she had a nice soprano even as a child br br but it's you see the show for
<START> everything about this show is terrible its premise even sets itself up to get cheap laughs with bad writing a family theme has already been used too many times most notably by the simpsons which is an excellent show with great writing and many laughs meanwhile family guy has about five minutes of story in each episode with tons of celebrity jokes and random flashbacks thrown in now if this was original or funny sure i'd think it was clever but no it's not funny at all in fact the only reason the episodes are like this is because it is the <UNK> way to effortlessly <UNK> out episode after episode of this junk much of this show is unoriginal and what is original is just lame it is also amazingly crude and <UNK> which again can be fine if it's still intelligent animation isn't everything either but from an artistic point of view this show fails also proving yet again that family guy <UNK> for as many cheap jokes and easy <UNK> as possible people enjoy this show and i don't really care because people can enjoy anything they want no matter how much it aims for the lowest common <UNK> but no i don't recommend this especially for anyone who wants to someday study film or become a writer this is cheap entertainment that aims low and has found success in this the fact that this is so successful says bad things about america
<START> play made a new genre of horror the killer dolls some of this films has not got too much money for make it but i think that the only film that make shadow to <UNK> is this ok it´s a product direct to video or direct to tv but <UNK> is not real and the killer is the little girl the imagination of children are too big and this film play with it the roles are good and <UNK> is great br br
<START> from producer writer golden globe nominated director james l brooks terms of <UNK> as good as it gets this is a really good satirical comedy film showing behind the scenes in the life of a news reporter anchor journalist or producer might be like basically jane craig oscar and golden globe nominated holly hunter falls for new reporter tom oscar and golden globe nominated william hurt but <UNK> aaron altman oscar nominated albert brooks also has strong feelings for her the network <UNK> for big changes and sparks will fly with all members of the studio also starring jack nicholson as anchor bill lois <UNK> as jennifer mack mrs robert as ernie <UNK> school of <UNK> joan cusack as blair peter as paul moore christian as bobby robert as martin <UNK> ed <UNK> as george and stephen as <UNK> the comedy is subtle but strong the romance has it's moments and it is certainly a believable situation film it was nominated the oscars for best cinematography best film editing best writing screenplay written directly for the screen and best picture and it was nominated the golden globe for best motion picture comedy musical and best screenplay motion picture it was number 64 on 100 years 100 laughs very good
<START> most awful casting i've ever seen clark kent as a crack head a very feminine looking woman as a <UNK> and on and on br br stupid ass violence just for the sake of being violent no content no meaning this person has never been on the streets it's a joke br br the only thing dumber than this movie is the fact that i finished watching it i just kept thinking it couldn't get any worse but it did to the very end br br trying way to hard to be an off the hook movie trying to be freaky so stupid i really have no more to say but can't leave a comment unless i write more br br please take this advice and do not bother watching this movie awful

<START> i must say i thought the show greek would be really ridiculous and stupid since i am part of a <UNK> i didn't want them to make greek <UNK> look bad br br but i think greek is hilarious yes they do have the stereotypical <UNK> and <UNK> but it's not mocking but just cute humor br br all the characters are pretty likable minus rebecca logan i just can't stand her <UNK> and rusty have good chemistry as brother and sister then there is who doesn't love a guy like haha his character brings so much to the show room mate <UNK> played by clark duke is hilarious as well br br it's definitely fun to watch so tune in for season 2 i can't wait till it is back on
<START> for unknown reasons this beautiful masterpiece didn't get well deserved recognition and has been vastly under appreciated by many american movie critics so it's easy to understand that i've met lots of troubles trying to find this movie finally i watched it and it was so beautiful sincere and poignant that for the first time in my life i watched one movie five times in one week after getting the tape the story is focused on the friendship between two young boys <UNK> and <UNK> eleven and twelve years old who are very different from each other but they are becoming the best and only friends the beauty and sincerity of their friendship have been shown in the cure so sincere and naturally as it has never been before there are so many beautiful heartfelt and poignant scenes particularly on the river which strike the heart and can't leave any human indifferent to them the movie also is full of incredibly powerful and emotional symbolism particularly strong with <UNK> shoe which also greatly <UNK> visual impression from such beautiful work the story written by robert is well written and on the contrary to overwhelming majority of modern hollywood's products practically every scene every phrase and every sentence in the movie is meaningful and bring something important about characters and relations between them peter <UNK> who as i know had no major experience in movie directing before showed his great abilities and talents in this <UNK> the cinematography is also superb with perfectly selected locations for the movie but the most important is perfect acting which with all above mentioned makes the cure one of the best movies ever both brad as <UNK> and joseph as <UNK> created wonderful atmosphere of sincere friendship and magnificent chemistry between two main characters only one this movie i haven't seen most of their other works is enough to name them as one of the best actors of their generation <UNK> <UNK> also give a terrific performance as <UNK> mother it's terribly sad that such talented actors didn't get wide recognition while numerous overrated stars enjoy enormous publicity and huge <UNK> finally it would be unfair not to mention amazing soundtrack written by david and terrific mark <UNK> song one of the best songs that i've ever heard in the movies my great escape so all that i can say about the cure is one simple word  great at any point of view this movie is a beautiful heartfelt and inspiring work of all people involved in making of this masterpiece i have to credit all those people who put their hearts and souls into the movie and universal pictures which among numerous formulaic commercial projects has found a way to make such a beautiful movie but such movie so rarely come to movie theaters that very often studios themselves don't realize what gem they have made that they're unable to provide respective marketing campaign the only one minor <UNK> about the cure for me is its short length only <UNK> minutes br br i don't want to write more about the movie because it's simply impossible to put its beauty and sincerity into words so if you have any opportunity for watching the cure rent it or buy it and you wouldn't be disappointed br br 10 out of 10 sorry for my bad english
<START> i have been living in <UNK> for 24 years and i a <UNK> years of experience would suggest do know what <UNK> has gone through all those years br br faith akin is still quite young born in 1973 and falling in the great mistake of being <UNK> when looking at turkey just as his other movie <UNK> die <UNK> did this movie seriously lack contemporary urban turkish life and <UNK> the audience when giving out quite false clues as to the <UNK> and cultural <UNK> of <UNK> br br anyone who could speak turkish could easily <UNK> that many underground bands groups depicted in the movie for one are so miserable and their members cannot even speak a proper language that they cannot be taken as of the contemporary turkish music much less a piece of crap which many turkish <UNK> even do not know about at all br br we <UNK> have long been <UNK> to <UNK> who look at turkey with some <UNK> point of view trying to fit the actual turkish image into their mind <UNK> what is new in this movie is the fact that now a turkish <UNK> director faith akin is making the same mistake looking at turkey with some false western glasses and <UNK> to depict it as if he understands better all of a vain effort br br just ask any turkish friend of yours what sort of a musical documentary is this without mentioning the names <UNK> <UNK> and many others who have shaped so far the real music we are listening today br br faith akin has a long long lesson to learn before <UNK> away and confusing other people's minds with false images about the contemporary turkish music
<START> john wayne is one of the few players in film history to have failed at his first big break and then succeed on the second time around of course everyone knows the second time was the classic <UNK> with john ford directing br br but we're here to talk about the big trail john ford's fellow director <UNK> walsh spotted this tall kid on the set of one of ford's films and thought he had potential he wanted to make him the lead in a big budget western that fox was planning to do the film as planned would be an homage to the famous classic silent western the covered <UNK> br br in watching the big trail i was struck by how similar wayne's character of <UNK> coleman here is to the <UNK> kid in <UNK> both characters were likable young but both were also on a mission of vengeance and of course both films were done on location and show the expense in making them no studio product here with a <UNK> western set br br i also don't think that it was an accident that wayne got this break at the beginning of the sound era <UNK> walsh i'm guessing looked around hollywood and probably didn't think a whole lot of movie <UNK> would have staying power in sound that's something else walsh spotted in wayne br br according to what i've read the big trail <UNK> because after spending all that money to make the film in an early wide screen process some genius at fox realized that their theaters weren't <UNK> with the wide screen to show it and when the great depression hit there would be no money to <UNK> those screens at fox movie houses so the big trail got a limited release even in what we would call a <UNK> version and lost money big for fox films br br <UNK> <UNK> is fine as the heroine who duke wins loses and wins again from ian keith keith charles stevens and f <UNK> power are the trio of villains wayne has to deal with br br f <UNK> power is the father of the famous movie legend <UNK> power he was a big <UNK> man with a grand background in classic roles on screen and on stage i wouldn't be surprised if his son who would have been 15 at the time might not have been hanging around the set br br also look for ward bond though you might have trouble <UNK> him under a big <UNK> beard br br watching the big trail now it is interesting to <UNK> where john wayne's career might have gone if the big trail had been a big hit
<START> i'm certain that people from usa don't know anything about the rest of the world but i think they <UNK> talk about what they don't know and they must remember that the rest of the world is not as <UNK> as the usa the only places where <UNK> sex between teenagers are illegal are the usa and <UNK> nations in france for instance the age of <UNK> is 15 in brazil it's 14 in spain it's 12 so the teenagers actors 16 and 17 years old by the time of production aren't doing anything illegal nudity isn't considered big deal in almost all <UNK> countries and only a freak could consider a <UNK> love as child <UNK>
<START> i heard about this series in 2001 which a friend of mine was recording off the television each week i never bothered to watch though i became <UNK> with the series through the magazine which i looked at every now and then in <UNK> i recently purchased series one on dvd and have become addicted to this fascinating and original series the characters at first seem unlikeable but it is amazing how fast they grow and develop into a united force as they begin to care for one another it becomes easy to care what happens to them bearing in mind that this is only a tv series and they are fictional br br however it isn't the pc world of star trek and so whilst every character shows a good <UNK> they each have their own flaws and demons that they must deal with story lines mixed in with an overall multiple story arc make this one of the most complex and rewarding television experiences i have ever had the pleasure of viewing i absolutely enjoy watching each of the characters interact with one another br br this strange new world we are introduced to is brilliantly portrayed through the eyes of astronaut john <UNK> and as he learns and <UNK> to being on the other side of the galaxy strange alien creatures different cultures being hunted by a character that wants him dead and being treated as inferior by his <UNK> we can easily relate to what he must be feeling as he becomes used to his surroundings so do the viewers and his compassionate strong <UNK> and brave character is a joy to watch br br i have watched only seven episodes of <UNK> season one and look forward to continuing through seasons two four and the mini series maybe one day we can all enjoy a season five highly recommended viewing and well worth setting time aside to watch buy and enjoy 10 10
<START> this movie is one of my favorite comedies of all time the dialog is crisp the pace is fast not only is this a clever comedy this is an interesting look at what goes on behind the scenes in the television news business br br there are so many funny lines a couple of my favorites br br ernie <UNK> <UNK> it must be nice to always believe you know better to always think you're the <UNK> person in the room jane seriously no it's not it's awful br br aaron he must be good looking jane how do you know that aaron no one invites a bad looking idiot to their room br br the performances of holly hunter albert brooks and william hurt were absolutely brilliant even years later i remember this movie well often forgotten is the wonderfully funny joan cusack i love the scene where the <UNK> are racing to beat a <UNK> there are so many funny scenes that it's hard to pick a favorite i highly recommend this film
<START> on paper this movie has some chops a street kid <UNK> past trauma <UNK> his life and <UNK> when the world would have written him off great stuff everyone loves a happy ending br br in the theater though there were some <UNK> that left the movie dead inside the dialog was hollow and uninteresting the characters were almost cartoonish in their lack of dimension and complexity and why did everyone need to be gay i have nothing against homosexual themes or characters in a movie but when it's used in this fashion not only is is offensive to <UNK> it <UNK> the lifestyle and <UNK> the movie if the story works without this cheap trick it should have been cut br br every character seemed to come out of the same cookie cutter form each had one major flaw and one minor flaw every character is good hearted were they succeed or not and everyone one of them had or is in an abusive relationship with someone br br the most annoying fact of the movie is that they never let you get over that the name <UNK> comes from great expectations they give it to you once and that should be enough the story shares enough with the dickens classic to make this fact obvious br br the most interesting part of the film is the story of the grandfather and the <UNK> he leaves for <UNK> and how <UNK> the main character learns how to grow up from the lessons learned from the tape in the end with lessons learned <UNK> confronts his dark past and movies forward with his life
<START> the 80s were <UNK> by all those halloween friday the 13th slasher style horror movies so this is something of a relief br br ten unbelievably annoying teenagers would you want to hang out with these <UNK> decide to throw a halloween party at a local former funeral <UNK> called <UNK> house during a past life <UNK> a demon is accidentally released and each person becomes possessed and kills off the others br br this all sounds very evil dead demons ish but <UNK> lends some directorial style to the proceedings there are some good one liners the music is excellent the steve johnson <UNK> make up fx are scary and <UNK> <UNK> is quite fun as a boy crazy bimbo who <UNK> out <UNK> with her fingers and does an amazing new thing with a tube of <UNK> br br great fun on a no <UNK> level after checking out the breakdown of the voting and the other posted reviews i don't understand how this only received 4 out of 10 br br i give it 8 out of 10
<START> <UNK> a remake of the <UNK> is thankfully a <UNK> version of the original it packs the same punch and true to his cinematic brilliance delivers it with style and <UNK> a <UNK> career with the entry of the likes of <UNK> and on the <UNK> got the much needed <UNK> with this movie this might well prove to be the best movie <UNK> has ever been on considering the choices he has been making since then the hard working actor seems to have lost his bearing what with talented new being accepted both by the industry and public alike br br the tightly <UNK> script which runs at a neck break speed revolves around a <UNK> <UNK> aspiring to make a mark in the game of a popular game among boys in india the events following the chance encounter with his rescue of the girl in distress and how he <UNK> with the aspirations of his friends and his own forms the and end of the movie <UNK> fits as a <UNK> into the role and <UNK> a subdued and believable portrayal of the boy next door br br has more than a stereotyped <UNK> heroine <UNK> to play the role is far more complex than just a girl in trouble with limited exploits her occasional muted expressions and subtle vulnerability to add color to the role this is a classic case of a cover page girl coming of age to become a professional actress became my personal favorite after this movie br br the movie ends on predictable lines although one has to credit the director for keeping the audience guessing on many things including change in decision to leave the country <UNK> raj deserves a word of praise for providing the perfect counter weight for role his almost <UNK> stature in the role of a villain and the apparent <UNK> in the hero's armor form a perfect <UNK> for keeping the audience guessing br br overall this is a great movie that deserves at least a single viewing i give it a clear 8 out of 10
<START> a stupid show in the vein of the rest of them with terrible music and a laugh track that must be from i love lucy i got rid of tv because of shows like this but picked up the 1st season at big lots for 3 00 should bought the van damme movie instead br br if i was a conspiracy <UNK> who believed that a small group of people are working against real families and keep coming up with this drivel propaganda in order to <UNK> family values i would point to this show married with children family guy etc but i'm not so i won't br br btw i'm not christian love the simpsons and <UNK> show i watched two episodes and thought that if shows like this are popular who are they popular with then i remembered all those of the people of <UNK> that have been <UNK> around the web and thought ah ha it is no wonder our culture is a joke around the world when this is prime time
<START> i saw this movie in the theater when i was 14 and it changed my life i immediately cut off my hair and began buying all of the records of the bands in the movie these were some of the <UNK> bands of l a punk rock caught on film at the peak of their powers bands like black flag pre <UNK> circle <UNK> fear x and the <UNK> have few equals in the history of punk music i can't believe this film has never been put out on video or dvd great movie for fans of punk rock
<START> <UNK> and never are two of the biggest box office misses and never is a surprise farce from empire strikes back hero <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> maria <UNK> seems to steal the show when in the midst of the unfolding plot <UNK> mission turns more to hollywood romp sometime around when basinger comes in how about <UNK> kinski i still think that the casting of <UNK> makes or as is evident in both films breaks the story worst of all is the attempt to pass off the aging and very hairy connery off as the sex symbol he indeed was in the '60s the '80s was a <UNK> time for bond flicks mostly though for your eyes only is a great title at times when i happen to need to waste some time over the holidays by watching this film in the often string of bond re run festivals i think the best <UNK> of the film is its score and i'm not into soft '80s
<START> i always liked listening to buddy holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in an airplane crash he wasn't in the old rock <UNK> roll class of let's say chuck <UNK> or jerry lee lewis but he wasn't far behind who knows how big his legacy would have been had he sang for decades almost every single he put out was a hit br br so i was very pleasantly surprised how good a job gary busey did at playing him and at imitating his singing voice he did buddy proud as were the actors don <UNK> and charles martin smith who played <UNK> <UNK> group the <UNK> br br music wise there are some of <UNK> better known songs in the beginning of the film and its really good with a strong finish at the end as holly and the boys are shown in <UNK> in their last concert ever busey not only sings like holly he's a dead <UNK> for him in the looks department some thing was the best performance ever and you get no argument from me br br i'm also glad they ended the film on an upbeat note with that <UNK> concert instead of <UNK> on his tragic accident the ending could have been a real <UNK> but they didn't let it be
<START> this is a pretty lousy picture it offers nothing unique or original or even interesting br br a medical student discovers that a secret society at her university is engaged in macabre medical experiments and of course she becomes involved in solving the weird deaths at the school this movie started out promising with a few cool special effects in which a guy is partially <UNK> while alive and tries to get away after he wakes up but then even that <UNK> and the rest of the special effects are pretty routine plastic models of the human body and that unreal looking blood that these second rate horror movies always seem to have br br and as if the routine plot and the lousy acting wasn't enough this movie had subtitles that many times didn't even match the dubbed english that you hear being spoken and then add that to the mouth movement not matching the dubbing well let's just say trying to <UNK> all that in your head isn't worth it for this mediocre movie br br i was at least counting on some skin in this movie and except for a bit during the opening credits this movie didn't deliver on that either br br this is a boring routine run of the mill horror gore movie short on horror and gore skip this movie unless ernest goes to camp is the only rental left
<START> we've all see the countless previews and trailers if you enjoyed <UNK> getting <UNK> by the bull you'll take great <UNK> pleasure in the opening act i must caution the masses however i considered taking my under 18 son with me but am <UNK> i did not this <UNK> of obnoxious skits contains a few that albeit as hilarious as they may seem to the adult community a few are not for the immature these guys must get paid a great <UNK> to tolerate some of the <UNK> stunts sometimes played at their expense in particular <UNK> and are <UNK> by the group in a few particular stunts enjoy
<START> ever want to see a movie where chuck norris takes the bad guys aside and <UNK> <UNK> with them the errors of their ways until they see the light and with tears in their eyes they shake hands right the <UNK> of the world together in peace and harmony and forever end the reign of evil in the world br br well forget it br br <UNK> <UNK> instead goes right for the drop kick as our truck <UNK> man chuck <UNK> his big <UNK> into the small backwoods town where his little brother is being held by a corrupt judge and his even more corrupt law men br br chuck karate kicks chops <UNK> and cuts every baddie in sight until not an evil <UNK> <UNK> raise his head a lot of fights are in slow motion for excitement purposes but just help pad out the movie to fill <UNK> minutes br br and there's a lot of fights here which leave just about 15 minutes for plot development and that's about all the plot you get but what did you expect calm discussion br br one star for <UNK> <UNK> and that's a small 10 4 good buddy
<START> i found this movie to be extremely delightful i am biased i suppose i happen to adore kathy bates i found her singing an added pleasure she has a very nice voice br br ms bates plays grace <UNK> the film takes you from her married life in chicago to england the home of her recently murdered singing idol victor fox there she meets his three surviving <UNK> sisters she also discovers that victor leaves behind a male lover <UNK> simpson br br the story leads you on to some surprisingly comedic and heartwarming situations as grace and <UNK> develop a true <UNK> for each other after an initial rather rude <UNK> on his part they return to chicago where they team up with <UNK> <UNK> sized hilarious daughter in law to find the serial killer who murdered victor br br everyone in the picture did a fine job particularly enjoyed julie andrews <UNK> redgrave and barry <UNK> this movie was fun it makes you cry the music is absolutely charming br br other posters here who found problems with any parts of this movie just don't have a clue br br
<START> this is a great tv movie with a good story and many comic moments thanks to the excellent cast br br the only problem this movie has is that it hasn't stood the test of time as well as it might have br br despite this it's definitely worth viewing particularly if you are an alan <UNK> or ruth gordon fan
<START> what a dire film i cannot believe that i actually sat down and watched it a very very very very very very pathetic effort with no redeeming features whatsoever the so called racing sequences are laughably awful and the plot was so bad i've forgotten it part of the film was made at the <UNK> course in <UNK> in i think 1988 during the actual grand <UNK> there i was there and am glad i didn't appear in any of the scenes shown in the film it could have been good what a pity
<START> a story of love between two people at the end of wwii beautifully filmed very romantic and yet rather <UNK> fable of budding love and war that would not end if you want happy endings don't watch movies
<START> the movie is powerful as a political statement about extraordinary rendition torture and the politics of the war on terror others have already commented on these and other aspects of the movie my review may contain spoilers so if you haven't seen the movie you may not want to read beyond this point br br several questions are raised by this movie first of all was the protagonist guilty or not there is no satisfying explanation for why the <UNK> decided to have him picked up and rendered in the first place is there an innocent explanation for why he got phone calls from what the <UNK> thinks is a terrorist if there is the movie does not seem to give one and that made the whole movie quite unsatisfying to me it is all well and good to make statements about whether torture is right or wrong but first prove to me that they tortured the wrong person then we will take it to the next step br br if the protagonist was guilty then what was achieved by releasing him perhaps we was well trained to resist up to a certain point and then pretend to break down and give answers that can be proved wrong with a little research thus <UNK> to lead the <UNK> to believe that they had tortured an innocent man into <UNK> without actually being guilty however there is nothing in the movie that proves he is guilty either br br the various other loose ends out there are 1 so a rogue cia agent has him released and <UNK> back home what <UNK> the <UNK> from picking him up again a little publicity in the washington post please give me a break here if a senator is not willing to put his neck on the line to <UNK> on his behalf what does <UNK> <UNK> have to fear 2 if the <UNK> has been tracking what phone numbers are being called by whom why couldn't they listen in on some of the calls to figure out whether anything <UNK> is being discussed 3 the plot is even more stupid anyways any criminal with more than a dozen brain cells would his criminal business on an anonymous <UNK> cell phone line not on one that can be <UNK> back to him and his house br br the whole movie revolves around <UNK> at the <UNK> heart strings by showing graphic and gratuitous scenes of torture but when you think about it with any more depth there is nothing of substance in this movie only plenty of unanswered questions and the feeling of what that is it at the end of the movie
<START> someone definitely has it in for the wind and i cannot believe that what i saw on the screen has much to do with it this is a better and more solid movie than most of the <UNK> i watch all year long the cinematography displays a genuine love and <UNK> of the craft and the casting was just fine i would love to see more of these folks especially <UNK> br br as far as the story and script i'm not so sure that the negative comments <UNK> this post were written with the intent of <UNK> anybody else about the movie the long drawn out <UNK> <UNK> bashing <UNK> that must have taken hours to <UNK> and are the only comments ever left for any movie on this site by the reviewer are obvious <UNK> directed at the producers of the film i don't know the inside story but it would probably make a good movie what i do know from being around this <UNK> is productions that try to make everybody happy usually end up being awful and when the filmmaker has the guts drive and common sense to kill the babies someone always ends up with hurt feelings that's part of the <UNK> too and one of the finest learning tools available to those truly dedicated to making it in the movie business of course the failures have nothing better to do than to sit at home and write false reviews on the internet as a form of <UNK> against those that <UNK> them read were honest and truthful with them and that is my best guess to explain the nasty nasty reviews in as much as there is a grain of truth behind everything there is a point to be made but these <UNK> of the are so over the top that they become obviously <UNK> br br it's not a slasher blood bath if that's what you're looking for it's more the psychological suspense thriller which typically is not appreciated by the lowest common out there the best way to see this movie is to try to any pre conceived notions pop it in and let it unfold seriously characters are defined by their actions and words and when you see what these people do and what they say i don't think you can come away with the conclusion that these characters were poorly developed poorly understood perhaps br br overall i do agree that this is a nicely done compelling movie perhaps i would not have given it a 9 under normal circumstances but the severe negative comments actually attracted me to the picture i have a secret love for really bad cinema to me the ratings below 5 should be reserved for the <UNK> inept poorly acted and <UNK> written movies none of that applies here it is quality movie making with some real talent in there i gave it the nine to to tip the <UNK> back in the correct direction watch the movie and tell me i am wrong
<START> the only reason i saw this movie was because it had <UNK> <UNK> and it was supposed to be horror don't be fooled this movie has to be the worst horror film i have seen it's about these people who go to a secret location which has a monster in it the monster is a man with a <UNK> face running around in blue sweat pants who has a <UNK> for brains some people die some people don't in the end they throw the monster off of a plane and then fly away happily but oh no the monster is still alive after falling out of a plane go spend 2 hours some other way like watching paint dry on a wall trust me it's more entertaining than this crap
<START> a real let down the novel is such a brilliant stomach <UNK> journey into madness but this made for tv movie style nonsense is turgid and painfully slow stick to mike hammer i find it hard to believe that no body has made a brilliant version of this book kubrick <UNK> over it on the cover he should have taken over the <UNK> on this one <UNK> <UNK> is too <UNK> as lou ford and the whole thing has the same production values as that seventies tv spin off of planet of the apes i thoroughly recommend that you go out and buy lots of jim thompson novels though actually the <UNK> isn't done too badly thats one of his starring jon <UNK>
<START> jimmy wang <UNK> an authentic asian superstar directed and wrote this film which i have only seen in a dubbed <UNK> version the widescreen shaw scope shape was lost and the original actor's voices absent but this is still good to watch the story is the usual martial arts school fights villains from japan plot with our young hero winning out in the end by beating up loads of <UNK> thugs br br the combat gets better as the film <UNK> early in the film it looks stiff and dull but later there is a great scene where wang <UNK> fights <UNK> in a gambling joint then walks out into a snowy scene and takes some more villains on with knives sword and <UNK> that part is very exciting br br quite good then but it would be interesting to see a non dubbed widescreen version if there is one
<START> six teenagers go to an old remote abandoned school where 27 years ago a horrible massacre took place for a night of fun and pranks instead the kids run <UNK> of the vicious crazed security guard excellently played with <UNK> creepy menace by spanish horror icon paul naschy who committed the nasty killings director carlos <UNK> relates the intriguing story at a <UNK> pace and does an <UNK> job of creating a <UNK> spooky and mysterious atmosphere the witty script by and <UNK> offers a clever and inspired blend of slasher and supernatural elements that keep the viewer guessing to the very end the slick cinematography by <UNK> makes expert use of light and shadow david san moody score likewise does the trick the attractive and appealing young cast all contribute lively and engaging performances with especially <UNK> turns by carlos as <UNK> <UNK> olivia <UNK> as the <UNK> maria <UNK> as obnoxious joker <UNK> and carmen <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> chick sandra the murder set pieces are every bit as bloody and brutal as they ought to be terrific <UNK> of a surprise dark ending too a solid and satisfying shocker
<START> this movie sucked from beginning to end it was predictable there was <UNK> no chemistry between <UNK> and the chick the plot went nowhere floating off into oblivion all of these led to the movie being very hilarious in its stupidity and i wanted to <UNK> orlando jones the guy just needs to go away
<START> i had no idea this movie was produced by wwe wrestling is lame enough why did they have to <UNK> their name further by making a movie as crappy as this one was i found it to be a complete disappointment if i had of known this movie was going to be as stupid as it was i would have stayed home and done something more entertaining sure i'll give them the credit of the cool effects but the killer didn't seem as scary as he could have been he lacked a number of things but i'll let you point them out for yourselves the plot was a great idea just could have been done in a much better way maybe in the future wwe will stick to its moronic wrestling and stay out of the film industry
<START> hard to believe but it is i shouldn't be surprised commercials try to show how unique and funny a show can be yet not only didn't the commercials <UNK> this new show have the slightest <UNK> of humor to me i've not spoken with anyone who found the commercials amusing either br br i don't recall ever seeing a pilot so devoid of <UNK> <UNK> or humor the characters were <UNK> for the most part especially <UNK> <UNK> which is astonishing she would agree to be in a <UNK> <UNK> of a show like this the few moments where the characters were slightly <UNK> were considerably hackneyed and trite br br rare is the show with no <UNK> qualities at all and this is not one of them and kim has exactly one redeeming quality and that's <UNK> blair despite wearing <UNK> outfits and acting like a pitiful whiny stupid excuse for a young woman who seems like a cross between britney spears paris hilton and kim <UNK> <UNK> is still nice to look at br br but if you want to look at <UNK> go rent <UNK> you'll at least maintain a <UNK> of respect for her instead of <UNK> this <UNK> character into your brain to associate with her br br all in all and kim is a waste and truly <UNK> the worst that tv is or ever has been it sets a new low
<START> this movie vampires the turning isn't even really worth the 2 out of 10 i'm giving it the movie is very predictable from beginning up to the very end when our hero kills the leader of the vampire <UNK> the use of music in this movie was even bad it kept playing as if you were to expect something significant to happen at any second though it never did the acting was b rank at best and the movie was just dull the only reason i give this movie a 2 out of 10 is because the story had potential though it ended up unable to deliver oh and did i mention the wardrobe the wardrobe for this movie was obviously cheap to non existent because our hero and his girlfriend whom he's trying to save throughout the entire movie wear the same outfits through the entire movie i'd suggest this film only if your really bored and don't have a good wall with fresh paint to watch dry dave the horror cowboy
<START> i am not surprised to find user comments for this film full of <UNK> nonsense such as that this film proves that when it is <UNK> love will find a way i begin in this way not to criticize a specific reviewer but because this <UNK> so <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that was <UNK> out over this film even before it hit the theaters even the best of films do not prove anything nor are they intended to the best films entertain and move the viewer and the english patient fails on both <UNK> br br i remember the <UNK> promotion of the english patient very clearly from the producers of <UNK> and <UNK> flew over the <UNK> nest ' it <UNK> announced an ignorant or <UNK> <UNK> might miss the crucial word producers in this <UNK> statement and <UNK> associate the director of the english patient so very <UNK> with the truly great director <UNK> <UNK> such a comparison is offensive to the memory of mr <UNK> br br while the novel by michael upon which the film was based is a good one it is unfortunate that the film failed to capture any quality of the book in any way whatsoever aside from plot elements that seem only <UNK> similar the film bears little resemblance to the novel br br despite <UNK> which began when i heard that shamelessly misleading promotion i went to see this film in the theater as it began to unfold i realized that the rendering of the <UNK> peculiar magic had failed that the actors knew their words but not their characters and that their characters were flat dull and <UNK> the film was a complete travesty of novel and a completely still born cinematic <UNK> of the worst description br br those who <UNK> over this film are very apt to speak with <UNK> like sweeping and grand and hypnotic well it is none of those in fact not even fine novel could be described as sweeping or grand it could be described as magical and hypnotic yet these are precisely the qualities that the film so utterly failed to deliver it is almost as if had as a reader entirely missed what was valuable in the novel and could <UNK> out on celluloid only a pale <UNK> version a version that not only missed the spirit of the story but that focused on the wrong characters he produced a <UNK> <UNK> that not only had no respect for story's <UNK> but no apparent of them as well br br took the central focus away from <UNK> and <UNK> and put it on the patient and <UNK> <UNK> thereby missing the narrative trail of the novel as well as the essence of it br br ralph <UNK> and <UNK> scott thomas put in <UNK> uninspiring <UNK> <UNK> performances that were obviously intended to convey a great driving passionate love affair to the viewer but which in fact delivered only an inexplicable <UNK> <UNK> between two flat shallow uninteresting both actors are physically and emotionally <UNK> and <UNK> and neither performance provided the viewer with the great emotional response obviously intended by <UNK> and overblown presentation br br the grand sweeping david lean like qualities to which the many <UNK> reviewers of this goofy film love to refer simply is not there the comparison to david lean dr <UNK> is positively insulting to yet another great director take for example the <UNK> <UNK> scene which is no doubt one <UNK> these grand sweeping qualities are believed to have <UNK> or should have <UNK> the <UNK> is not grand it is not even convincing the subsequent <UNK> of the characters in the <UNK> and their <UNK> after the storm which no doubt was supposed to affect the viewer dramatically and emotionally completely lacked either drama or emotion in fact because it was so <UNK> weak it had an air of comedy about it where comedy was clearly out of place br br this film failed it failed as a rendering of the novel and it failed as a film it seems to have been the oscar vehicle of the year joining such over <UNK> as kramer vs kramer or terms of <UNK> one can only thank god that even the hype driven <UNK> br br had the good sense to present the best actress award to frances for her truly deserving performance in the truly excellent film <UNK> there was not a single performance in the <UNK> english patient that was not either embarrassingly horrid over acting willem dafoe or truly forgettable mediocre acting <UNK> and scott thomas br br why this non <UNK> of a film <UNK> a <UNK> of <UNK> and clearly tasteless <UNK> will remain a mystery fortunately the <UNK> of time will bury this mediocrity of a film <UNK> and it will not thankfully have the strength ever to dig itself out
<START> this espionage melodrama has a nice almost promising cast and should have been very atmospheric there is a will or an intention of also a want or a lack of it br br sheen plays a <UNK> who now <UNK> as an agent he is a loner loved by women but <UNK> mrs <UNK> is his mistress <UNK> plays the <UNK> generous <UNK> soviet agent br br sheen and <UNK> are both essentially annoying <UNK> does a cameo and so do other known actors mrs <UNK> is hot but then again she always is br br i will be your true friend and break it to flick is low on suspense and on excitement it's trite and quite boring the good thing is that you get to see mrs <UNK> naked other than that <UNK> derivative espionage exploitation
<START> <UNK> the oscars from 1992 and this film might get nominated or even win it was so good at capturing its era and <UNK> cultures that it belongs in american and japanese time <UNK> if you wanted to know what living here or there was like back then this film will show you as an american you'll feel like you <UNK> along for an extended japanese vacation and by the end of the film you'll be a die hard dragons fan as you accept the <UNK> of japanese tradition and culture into their baseball much as we have done with our culture in our own game br br jack elliot tom <UNK> is a <UNK> aging detroit <UNK> who is <UNK> to the dragons <UNK> <UNK> up to the <UNK> giants <UNK> answer to the <UNK> the giants are admired for their success yet that success also has everyone wanting to <UNK> them something which is rarely done the manager <UNK> jack as the final piece of the <UNK> winning puzzle and we're left with what could have been <UNK> ho on a baseball field but instead was much more br br the casting was outstanding <UNK> proved that with a good script and a character that suits him he can carry a film as well as he did his television show and the japanese cast was equally good down to mr from die hard back as the image conscious owner the other actors including the one who plays the love interest also the <UNK> daughter strong and independent yet simultaneously a believer in japanese traditions beyond what was forced on her she is a proper and supportive girlfriend for jack even her father never tells her not to see him almost <UNK> with jack for what he <UNK> from her and a bit <UNK> he at least knows the man she has chosen to love br br the baseball scenes are great <UNK> immensely by a pre fame dennis <UNK> as another american ex and jack's western mentor the usual fish out of water elements are there and you can almost feel yourself stumbling right along with jack to fit into a country that doesn't speak our language and doesn't practice our ways yet copies everything we do including our national <UNK> one of the funnier scenes occurs when jack <UNK> a magazine informs his manager that he has learned of the tradition in japan where you can get drunk and tell off your boss and it can't be used against you and <UNK> that right very <UNK> the plots and subplots are tied up neatly at the end but not too neatly and nothing concludes <UNK> br br to call this a comedy is misguided it's a pure comedy drama or even a drama with good humor the plot is too deep to dismiss it the way it was by critics as an actor out of his league trying to carry a lightweight film the situations were amusing but in their place against a far more serious profound and precisely detailed backdrop that results in one of the best films i've ever seen the baseball cinematography rivals that of for love of the game for realism br br some say the film is about baseball or about japan but more than anything it seems to be about the <UNK> and how people arrive at work from totally different origins with different <UNK> and somehow have to put their differences aside for the good of the company or the team br br a truly great film that never should have had to apologize for itself the way it did when it was in theaters
<START> one of the more prominent popular episodes but clearly one of the worst a red shirt female falls for khan instead of dropping dead for a change and then proceeds to <UNK> kirk and the enterprise as if loyalty were a non existent character <UNK> on the ship makes one wonder what kind of psychology <UNK> this supposedly brilliant <UNK> uses to test people when hiring we have the same kind of absurd lack of loyalty in <UNK> of an eye when a red shirt male takes the <UNK> side just because he falls in love same as in ss however in that episode the betrayal plays a tiny role in the overall plot this is very silly because it once again makes <UNK> crew seem like a bunch of soft headed easy to impress morons who once they fall in love with the enemy are capable of doing just about anything the fact that switches back to <UNK> side doesn't the <UNK> in any way lord and the lord br br why is khan kept behind a regular door when they know he has superior strength that's one of several st plot devices that <UNK> <UNK> intelligence why does khan hold a knife against <UNK> throat if khan is of such superior intelligence then one would expect him to be more <UNK> with the way he carries himself and what's with a <UNK> being played with a latino accent <UNK> should have been provided with a vocal coach i was half expecting to hear the the in the background at any moment why the hell would kirk or any ship captain provide <UNK> use of the <UNK> library concerning the <UNK> technical details of the enterprise to anyone is the <UNK> an institution solely <UNK> of idiots br br ss is a very cartoonish silly episode so no wonder <UNK> love it it doesn't have too many sci fi elements in it which is what <UNK> hate the most it also figures that the st franchise chose to revive this dull character for the second movie that way pleasing <UNK> <UNK> who were so very disappointed with the first movie which you guessed it had far too much sci fi for the average tiny <UNK> brain
<START> surprisingly good film made in the wake of the exorcist concerning a young woman who becomes possessed by a spirit after she goes to a de <UNK> church to <UNK> a life size and life like <UNK> man the piece was christ and the two thieves however christ was long ago sold off trouble starts once the figure is removed from the cross and it seems to come to life and seduce the woman from that point on it becomes a battle for the girls soul creepy scary and much better than you think the film works because its cast sells the events which are decidedly adult it helps that these are real people who are flawed so its easier to relate to them i really liked this film and seeing it again for the first time in at least a decade i was shocked at how good it is definitely better than any of its <UNK> of <UNK> titles makes it seem
<START> my take typically routine and lazy straight to video attempt from disney br br disney must have fallen in love with the family movie tradition that is the family dog many movies have devoted themselves with stories that solely center themselves with man's best friend disney themselves have made a handful they also made a handful of those that are literally dogs add this one to that bunch br br i haven't seen the original for a very long time so probably i'm not the right person to judge if this straight to video sequel <UNK> any better anyone above the age of seven aren't the right people to see it either perhaps only the youngest of the young will want to see lady and the tramp ii adventure and even they would grow up and say it wasn't the best kind of family entertainment they have ever seen i guess to be fair i can say is that it <UNK> a rental but that ain't much to say br br this sequel pretty much picks up the parts left behind after the original <UNK> called classic lady and tramp now have a <UNK> of cute <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and one mischievous <UNK> named <UNK> who is a chip off the old block instead of the confines of home <UNK> wishes to run off with the other <UNK> dogs of town unknown of his <UNK> own past as one of those of the streets to capture the charms of the original this one throws in the same poor dog rich dog love story in vice versa <UNK> falls for a one of the <UNK> dogs named angel and who wouldn't with a name like that and a voice that sounds like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> replay of the famous spaghetti scene other than the cute factor there is nothing in store for any audience in this lazy straight to video effort stick with the original br br rating out of 5
<START> un <UNK> <UNK> or nightmare concert as it's more <UNK> know amongst english speaking audiences starts as horror film director lucio fulci played by the man himself lucio fulci goes to lunch after filming a very gory violent scene however he orders <UNK> has a horrible vision relating to <UNK> the grotesque visions hallucinations dreams continue begin to affect his mental state fulci decides to seek help contacts professor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> l thompson for psychiatric help <UNK> claims that fulci cannot separate fantasy from reality agrees to help him however <UNK> has a more sinister <UNK> motive as a serial killer starts to brutally kill prostitutes fulci thinks he might be responsible br br this italian production was co written directed by lucio fulci who also stars in the film as a horror film director named lucio fulci which doesn't really feel like a lot of effort went into it anyway un <UNK> <UNK> is gory if nothing else for that alone i rather liked it the script by fulci john <UNK> <UNK> antonio is nothing more than a <UNK> excuse to edit together lots of gory footage from other italian films it serves it's purpose well enough i suppose to see fulci on screen has a certain fascination if your a fan of his or are familiar with his films the ending is very rushed almost as if they ran out of money as it just has a policeman telling fulci they killed the killer that's it another thing about that ending when the two cops put the white sheet over the dead killer in the field then they walk away leaving it there without any other police presence i mean would the police in italy just leave a dead body in the middle of a field on it's own it moves along at a good pace if you like your gore then you have to see this although if you don't like gore then you'll hate it with a passion it all depends on your <UNK> so the choice folks is yours br br director fulci was never the most artistically <UNK> filmmaker it shows here as his footage is bland flat looks like it was shot for tv the footage from the other films 7 in total doesn't match the stuff fulci shot it is obvious that this has been <UNK> together from different films if your looking for gore you've hit the <UNK> people are <UNK> with <UNK> put through meat <UNK> faces are <UNK> there are a few <UNK> there are some <UNK> throats <UNK> body is <UNK> crushed under a car a tongue is ripped out someone has their throat crushed as a wheelchair runs over it there are loads of <UNK> someone has their guts removed with a hook there's a rotten corpse complete with <UNK> someone hand is cut off someone has their head <UNK> in their eye falls out a gory death by piano wire as it <UNK> through <UNK> throat there are loads of severed limbs <UNK> of blood <UNK> around a scene of some cats eating brains there's more as well having said that some of the special effects are a bit fake look cheesy br br with a supposed budget of around 100 000 it shows this is pretty cheap looking it has no visual style or artistic merit but then again why would you want those when you can see a nazi orgy sequence wall to wall gore the acting in this is terrible including fulci br br un <UNK> <UNK> is a top film if your a gore <UNK> like me however if your looking for something with a little bit more substance or indeed any substance then this ones not for you this is the sort of film which <UNK> people straight down the middle you'll either love what it does or hate it
<START> i will <UNK> it in only one respect it was innovative innovative doesn't mean it's a good film it means that it can give you an idea of what you can take and <UNK> in your own films br br the simple plot is well simple i got to the point where i didn't care if they destroy the building or not if i had to hear that girl's annoying giggle one more time i swear i would <UNK> the dvd out the window and there's also the protagonist they try to make him lovable but he's a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the girls <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at her when she's naked putting her <UNK> over his eyes when he sleeps putting her <UNK> on a blow up sex doll which she takes her <UNK> off while hes asleep and slips them on his doll <UNK> br br what <UNK> me even <UNK> is that crappy <UNK> in the photo gallery on the dvd you can see what the film looked before they it and put in a color <UNK> <UNK> too the film looked a lot better without the effect so they sacrificed it being a good film just to be artsy <UNK> i could understand using gimmicks like that if the film quality was crap br br i think most people who liked this film just liked it because the chick was naked for a good 5 10 minutes this doesn't compare to <UNK> like so many are to do <UNK> has characters you can get into and like these people here just <UNK> and giggle br br lastly i would also to point out that this was also to be like a german <UNK> film the old <UNK> one of the problems with most foreign especially artsy films is that <UNK> focus on making an artsy composition and forget about the <UNK> of the scene it results in the audience not really understanding what s going on because they don't get a sense of the space of the surroundings br br anyway it's rubbish the short film on the dvd surprise was a <UNK> lot better
<START> after watching <UNK> 1 i'd heard there was a sequel and decided to look it up the movie seemed pretty bad and i told myself to stay away but stupid me gave in and actually bought the damn thing all the reviews and everything bad you've heard about <UNK> ii are true the movie is simply worn of ideas and the <UNK> plot and jokes i've ever heard the <UNK> the acting the whole movie really is bad randy quaid was funny though br br just stay away from this movie as much as you can is all i can really say i deeply regret watching and buying the dvd but not sure which was the <UNK> decision just stay away as much as possible
<START> this film is <UNK> with sentimentality <UNK> flying that makes a pilot like me cringe and irrelevant material why introduce rachel for instance she has absolutely nothing to do with the film except to <UNK> her follow me truck to run wild and crash into fence that has got to be one of the <UNK> sequences among many in the film another is at the end when the aircraft was it a b 26 or an a 26 both are used in the film is left with props <UNK> and no in place that serves the plot of course but to reveal it would be to commit a <UNK> spoiler as it is the aircraft would have begun to taxi sans control the ending again avoiding spoilers involves much too much talk as at the beginning of sound films in the 30s with all those final speeches here dreyfuss just <UNK> on and on the ending also <UNK> other radical <UNK> of aircraft <UNK> and a couple of <UNK> <UNK> that i won't describe what a dull and disjointed effort
<START> the play <UNK> was written by william shakespeare between the years of and ever since then many other versions of the play have been produced including remakes completed in 1948 1971 and 2006 <UNK> kurosawa even directed a japanese version of <UNK> in 1957 entitled the play starts out with king <UNK> hearing about the success of two of his <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in a recent battle with the irish and the <UNK> after a quick promotion from <UNK> <UNK> instantly gets an uncanny feeling for lust greed and power and does everything in his power to gain access to the crown even if it includes murder br br geoffrey wright tried creating his own version of the famous play in 2006 by setting it in the modern melbourne underworld just imagine a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hundreds of soldiers with an <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> his own rendition of low at the same time just kidding about the latter but one thing he does do is utter the traditional shakespeare and he keeps it going throughout the whole movie that's right shakespeare meets ghetto it's all you could ever hope for <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> is rough and violent enough to match up with any other modern day action film but it lacks decent acting the right <UNK> and a good technique of camera work br br the <UNK> movie starts out with <UNK> sam who works as a hit man drug dealer for <UNK> gary sweet a drug lord from melbourne australia after being promoted to the of by <UNK> as the three witches had predicted <UNK> starts to take over <UNK> as he sets his eyes on the throne after promoting <UNK> <UNK> invites himself over to <UNK> house for a night of drugs and alcohol before the <UNK> begin lady <UNK> victoria hall talks <UNK> into killing <UNK> to take power over the throne after the <UNK> are drunk and everyone's asleep <UNK> <UNK> into <UNK> room and stabs him to death after his murder <UNK> takes all of <UNK> <UNK> including <UNK> title and crown just as soon as he thinks he's got what he wanted he finds out that it will take more than <UNK> and running away to solve his problems br br one major flaw of the movie was the acting a once seemingly flamboyant and <UNK> <UNK> suddenly turns into a sissy and he looks like a sad puppy dog throughout the entire film i don't really know if this was or <UNK> fault but either way one of the two should have realized <UNK> was a king not a <UNK> on a <UNK> that took everything his wife had to say literally like i said earlier <UNK> should have been rude arrogant and <UNK> but when his character changes over to a drug lord he changes personalities as well i suppose on the other hand lady <UNK> really knew how to <UNK> it in the bud when it came to <UNK> and <UNK> her character she didn't seem quite as <UNK> as she was in the play or the 1971 version but she reminds <UNK> that compared to murder anything else he could possibly do wouldn't quite match up br br another thing i found <UNK> was all the nudity this <UNK> had to be <UNK> fault the witches didn't do a bit of acting unless you call <UNK> around in your birthday suit acting at one point in the film i started to wonder if i was watching <UNK> or unique positions <UNK> 2 br br don't get me wrong when i say i find the shakespearean dialogue out of place it's spoken <UNK> but when it's spoken by an australian gangster it's just really weird when <UNK> starts to kill people off he first lets them know by talking to them in <UNK> <UNK> english <UNK> contains plenty of action blood gore and nudity to last anyone a lifetime you forget all the positive facts though when you start to think to yourself okay what in the heck did he just say in that last sentence at some points in the movie i don't even think the actors themselves knew what they were saying the new age <UNK> of the movie could have easily been pulled off it weren't for the and the br br the camera work was just simply fair for me one thing i could not stand was the constant pacing back and forth between characters the camera technique used gave off that blair witch sort of vibe and made me throw up a little in my mouth matt reeves tried to attempt the same concept of camera work in <UNK> field but it just doesn't work it makes me want to get out of my chair and look around for the little <UNK> <UNK> they have conveniently planted on every seat in the <UNK> br br looking back on it all the <UNK> holds one positive plenty of action other than that the movie contains nothing more than uninspired acting correct english usage and stomach turning camera work the soundtrack holds one or two of the same songs but each song is edited or <UNK> differently for every scene there is never a variation of interesting or captivating media used from now on out directors should leave the dangerous drug underworld to al pacino and robert deniro future <UNK> of <UNK> should be created just as shakespeare intended the play to be 400 years ago i would recommend using medieval clothing <UNK> <UNK> english swords and <UNK> and a soundtrack prepared by <UNK> but either way the modern <UNK> makes you <UNK> for some good folk music a camp fire and a
<START> without a doubt the biggest waste of film of the year this movie is poorly structured sadistic cruel and filled with unlikable characters on top of that and maybe the worst crime it's uninteresting and vastly predictable as soon as bill <UNK> character on the photo changing the word from evidence to violence i had the entire plot figured out there are no surprises and there is no compelling reason to watch this trash the only redeeming feature for me is that i saw this thing for free on my <UNK> cable and didn't waste any money i would truly be angry if i had paid to see it in a theatre br br anyone that <UNK> this thing a thriller really needs to get out more an awful awful film in every way that matters

<START> this would probably be a good film to see provided you've already seen every other film in existence and thoroughly explored the of yourself and those around you god this movie was unbelievably insipid with some of the worst or is it nonexistent writing ever captured on film there is no saving grace to this film even the <UNK> are kind of lame and it's just a complete waste of time and money br br run fast it's beyond horrible br br
<START> maybe it's just a personal affection for this screen version of the novel or a <UNK> for things egyptian i grew up loving to visit the <UNK> in <UNK> museum of fine arts but i think <UNK> is a tad tough on this rather good film the production values are great regarding color and cinematography and it appears some effort went into historical authenticity much of it from the novel i'm sure <UNK> is admittedly a bit stiff in the lead role but one can accept this as part of character victor mature is well victor mature peter ustinov is a delight to watch in this type of role which he always did so well and so <UNK> <UNK> performance as is <UNK> camp and i find even michael rather dry portrayal of to have its own appeal br br the historical <UNK> of <UNK> a brief <UNK> in ancient <UNK> history is interesting as is himself and well worth reading about the religious wars portrayed here have a basis in fact br br an interesting <UNK> regarding whose birth name was she was a polish who producer <UNK> <UNK> and his wife <UNK> took under their wing i believe they may even have adopted her her screen name is formed from and his wife's first names she continued her acting career in france but never achieved great success and after a rather unhappy life died at her own hand in 1971 br br altogether this is an interesting film and enjoyable to watch for the visual values alone american movie classics shows this occasionally in <UNK> which is essential to capturing the scope and <UNK> of the story
<START> just finished with zombie bloodbath part one on the amazing zombie bloodbath trilogy dvd from camp motion pictures zombie bloodbath 2 rage of the undead is next now this one left me a bit puzzled due to a few plot holes and some confusing twists here and there but it is a better film on many levels director todd sheets truly shows a major leap in style and talent between the two films again this is not for people who want <UNK> and hollywood style horror films this is for people who like their zombies bloody raw and grainy the story as far as i could tell was basically about two robbers who in 1945 try and steal from an elderly couple only to find that the couple are members of a cult one guy is simply killed and the other the one in charge is basically turned into a scarecrow and <UNK> and they stand him in the nearby field still alive but dying cut to present day and a van full of college kids break down near a <UNK> at the same time a group of <UNK> escape from a nearby jail both groups end up at the same house the house was the one the elderly coupled used to live in and when one of the <UNK> knocks down the scarecrow and takes it's jacket it causes the scarecrow to wake up and he in turn brings the cult members back from the dead wow and this is all in the first half hour there is another plot also going on in town where a couple of serial killer types have taken some workers at a <UNK> hostage this actually works though as the people trapped in the house finally escape and end up in the same <UNK> most of the twists work out pretty good but it is obvious that the film was just too complex in some spots for it's own good it all ends in a huge showdown with the remaining heroes finding a delivery truck or something full of flesh eating <UNK> <UNK> of course they throw it at the undead and cause some major melting and a few heads to explode and then we get an odd thought provoking ending first let me say that while it was not always easy to follow i still had a major good time with this movie it was fun and the acting was pretty darn good for a low budget effort it was obvious that todd sheets was truly trying to bring more to the table than a typical zombie film and in that regard he has succeeded it had better special effects than the first film great pacing and some cool music and visuals plus there is a true show <UNK> of a shot from inside a mouth as a knife is <UNK> through it care was taken here and it shows the weakness lies in the scripting and in a few of the performances again i recommend listening to the commentary track it was even better than the first one and i learned a lot like finding out that some of the scenes were shot on super 8 film for effect and that the film came back ruined from the lab and they could <UNK> use it and they had already been editing the film by the time they got the film back so some of the confusion is from a few scenes not being in the film also i learned that todd sheets truly has a passion and love for making horror movies it shows the film is a good example of no budget cinema that could have used one more rewrite but still shines with more style than most <UNK> films i see not quite as fun as the first film though a better movie technically i really admire sheets as one of the true and <UNK> in the area of <UNK> cinema and this one is a great addition to the <UNK> zombie genre
<START> on march 17 1974 a man is found dead in the <UNK> at <UNK> penn station although well known he cannot be identified because he <UNK> out the personal information in his <UNK> and his body lays <UNK> at the city's <UNK> for three days it turned out to be the body of what many consider one of the greatest american <UNK> of the <UNK> century louis i <UNK> he died at the age of 73 on his way from india where one of his greatest projects the <UNK> for management in was <UNK> <UNK> br br one of the most influential post war american <UNK> louis <UNK> <UNK> legacy includes the house of <UNK> in <UNK> the art museum in forth worth the <UNK> art gallery the <UNK> <UNK> in california and a kind of mobile music boat designed to give <UNK> in <UNK> in various cities around the world br br while celebrated as an architect very little was known about his private life in addition to his wife esther and their daughter sue ann <UNK> was survived by two <UNK> harriet and anne and their two children all three families lived within miles of each other in suburban philadelphia but their paths never crossed until the funeral his son <UNK> the director of this film was only 11 years old at the time and had only a few memories of his father's weekly visits at harriet <UNK> mother in philadelphia twenty five years later he sets out on a journey to confront his father by visiting <UNK> buildings talking to relatives and colleagues and visiting the places that played a role in louis <UNK> life br br one of the most moving <UNK> is when <UNK> asks his mother a landscape architect and mistress of louis <UNK> why she kept up with playing second <UNK> to his wife and never confronted him with this tears shed her eyes but she has no regrets it was worth it it's such an intensely sad moment she's obviously <UNK> treated as an <UNK> at his funeral which she was forbidden to attend it's almost as if she led a substitute life it all feels strangely unreal another interview with edward bacon <UNK> <UNK> nemesis who was in charge of the <UNK> of his native <UNK> in the fifties and sixties almost suffers a stroke on the spot when he is reminded of <UNK> <UNK> ideas about architecture his son <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> when a very senior bacon literally screams with anger whenever <UNK> name comes up the final scene is reserved for <UNK> <UNK> creation the <UNK> in <UNK> it took 23 years to complete a vast and extraordinary building of which the are extremely proud it's one of the very few national symbols with stature in this <UNK> nation some of the interviews with the locals brought tears in my eyes especially when they find out they are talking to god <UNK> the own son br br the film is as much a personal journey as it is an account of <UNK> grand <UNK> legacy and is above all about the <UNK> of the film itself and film making in general perhaps louis i <UNK> <UNK> as a father but these shortcomings in his personal life make for an all the more interesting portrait in this extraordinary film br br camera <UNK> 9 10
<START> this film is a joy to watch and should do well on dvd and video i suppose you really have to be irish to appreciate the some of the <UNK> such as accent <UNK> and the dress sense of some of the characters but let me assure you that when dylan <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> is quite familiar to most people from <UNK> because we have many characters in our fine city that look act and talk like that the sheer simple comedy employed and michael genius acting alone are worth the money but on top of this the plot is great the script is fantastic and the dialogue fast moving and catchy a perfect light entertainment movie without the <UNK> humour of jim carrey
<START> i am one of those people that respect every film maker as having achieved each film i watch i usually respect although i admit i <UNK> carefully and for what it is not any more this is truly one of the worst scripts i have seen produced as a film so much so i felt compelled to warn others off it the dialogue was truly unbelievable the main was about the last person i would be interested in finding out more about a scene were an old school friend it like it <UNK> made me laugh only because it was a pathetic attempt to reveal the subtext of an already <UNK> plot the direction is <UNK> at best and at worst film making by numbers to compare this film to the atmospheric <UNK> of a film like five easy pieces is a travesty
<START> the movie was excellent save for some of the scenes with <UNK> i enjoyed how it brought together every detective on the series and wrapped up some <UNK> that were never resolved during the series thanks to nbc it was great to see <UNK> and <UNK> together at their most human and most basic persons <UNK> and <UNK> did a great job but as usual will get overlooked it hurt to see that this was the end of homicide memories tapes and reruns on <UNK> just aren't the same as watching it come on every friday but the movie did its job and did it very well presenting a great depiction of life after al retired and the family relationship that existed between the unit i enjoyed this a lot
<START> business vs personal conviction profit vs art br br as with any documentary that <UNK> the <UNK> large <UNK> against the small producer the viewer will <UNK> have to take the side of one or the other based on their own believes this is as much a documentary of the new <UNK> way of doing things that <UNK> is bringing us against the old traditional ways where character and the art of making things matters almost more than getting the product sold br br if you have to remember one thing from this movie it is that the masses can no longer decide by themselves they just follow the taste of one or a couple of critics that tend to and <UNK> taste in the same way as used to do for the fast bite something parker himself admits to in the film against a backdrop of a <UNK> king sign it is all about image against content as another <UNK> says that is the easy way the <UNK> way easier than taking the time for a nice wine to mature easier than to <UNK> your own taste by trying and trying yet over again controlled <UNK> taste is easier br br there is a <UNK> of hope when even some of our cousins across the ocean agree that a few people are <UNK> the taste of to <UNK> the <UNK> and ensure a maximum of it gets sold to the grey masses <UNK> and difference is sacrificed for the extra buck it is nice to see that not everything or everyone is giving in to <UNK> even across the ocean br br as in many other areas of today's world <UNK> of a few and reduced freedom of choice <UNK> us all let everyone make up their mind and decide what to go for too much <UNK> kills the mind and taste difference brings <UNK> and healthy competition and will allow for choice and not just <UNK> packed more of the same <UNK> sells easily and a lot and brings everyone to the same level the lower one br br on this i am going to open up a nice bottle and wish you a
<START> i truly enjoyed this film it's rare to find a star who can pull off the physical aspects of any sports dance themed film convincingly and do a first rate acting job as well in this film you find two stars who rise to the occasion both women deliver warm touching and at times humorous performances the film also touched on a number of topics from racial issues to sexual identity and yet the approach wasn't heavy handed the production values were also top notch for a small budget film i saw this at the philadelphia gay lesbian film festival and went back to see it a second time it was a real crowd <UNK> everyone i spoke to seemed to enjoy this film
<START> this is one of those movies where the acting set location direction and effects were so bad you need to rent a copy get 5 or 6 buddies a <UNK> of beer sit down and watch it to borrow from the late douglas adams watching this movie will be like having your brains <UNK> out by a slice of <UNK> wrapped around a large gold brick br br what is wrong everything british actors posing as americans there have been many that can pull it off like bob <UNK> but he isn't in this one it wasn't even necessary to choose north america as a location why not say it took place in england or something the director seemed to like taking shots of girls tits and <UNK> more than actually coming up with some kind of character motivation so at this point you drunken buddies will be saying all right another t a shot there isn't much dialog so feel free to skip off to the kitchen and make those <UNK> what did i like about this movie after my friends passed out i managed to collect <UNK> off of them and told them they spent it at the strip bar after we finished watching the awful movie
<START> well someone who enjoys traveling down the highway at eating <UNK> and running the air <UNK> twenty four seven and watching fox news non stop i found this documentary interesting one thing i picked up when they being they talk about north america i assume this documentary was <UNK> for the canadian bashing i will leave that to bill <UNK> br br the consequence of the <UNK> of oil will affect everyone especially those who live in big countries of australia canada and the united states i am sure that green peace are cheering no more gas means no more <UNK> without realizing people who live in the sub zero <UNK> could <UNK> to death br br as someone who has studied <UNK> i know for a fact we are living in a world of <UNK> resources i will give the documentary props for trying to present a balanced point of view about the <UNK> of oil however i am studying a degree in <UNK> this documentary is full of loaded messages <UNK> as what the <UNK> didn't send troops to vietnam br br if you are going to present a documentary about <UNK> and resources it is best to leave the political bashing to one side because it could cause a potential audience member to totally shut down concentrate on the issue of <UNK> resources at the end of the day it is best to open the minds of the mainstream as it is no good preaching to the <UNK> choir br br i really do enjoy watching documentaries such as <UNK> <UNK> and end of <UNK> not for their political bias because they do remind us the world isn't so safe sure i like to shop and <UNK> junk food like there is no tomorrow but if the world is going to end tomorrow i would rather die rich and <UNK> the living <UNK> out of it br br for the potential documentary makers out there just give the people facts and let the viewers make up their own minds if you are trying package your political views as a balanced documentary the people are going to smell a rat a mile away
<START> dr is a mad scientist who is <UNK> trying to find a cure for a <UNK> cause of when he <UNK> a piano concert he is stricken by the beautiful daughter of the <UNK> and sets out to woo her but when she wants nothing to do with him he <UNK> her father with the virus in an attempt to <UNK> money and his daughter in exchange for a cure br br that is the basic premise for this b grade low budget thriller i have to say i was <UNK> by this movie not that it was terrible it wasn't but there was nothing particularly noteworthy about it either it was entertaining enough for a viewing but is not one that will stay in my memory br br the dialog is a bit corny at times and the acting is just mediocre the story is fairly predictable and doesn't really give us anything new of course i can't complain too much about a movie that has a guy in a gorilla suit who serves almost no real purpose and a doctor with a <UNK> like stare that fails to <UNK> his victims br br it may be worth a watch if you like this sort of movie but don't go into it with too many expectations
<START> i have watched this movie on and off since it started playing about 1 hour ago and i have to say thats an hour of my life i wasted and will not be getting back the acting is crap and the scripts need a serious look at and whoever wrote them needs to be slapped perhaps the tv will explode and put me out of my misery the only good thing about this movie is that for guys and girls it has some good eye candy in it though most of which i wish would disappear as far as the movie is concerned the special effects as sh t <UNK> who thinks a guy dressed in skin tight leather pants and half a leather jacket is scary he looks more feminine than most of the women in this movie the voice of <UNK> is pathetic nobody finds it threatening or scary at all please tv i beg you to blow up
<START> as with many of <UNK> films a lot of people find them to be boring and confusing well i like them and i like this film too i went out and rented it on dvd and i watched it 3 times it is a very subtle movie that provides an <UNK> experience for those who did not enjoy it you just wasted 2 hours of your life too bad
<START> beware my lovely is an experimental studio film from the early fifties and was directed by a man harry <UNK> better known for his set designs robert ryan plays a <UNK> who is hired by <UNK> <UNK> to do some <UNK> for her the problem is that he is a <UNK> murderer and doesn't know it miss <UNK> is an <UNK> soul and tries to win ryan over to little <UNK> he is not the sort of man compassion could help or cure thus we have an interesting situation of two people who basically mean well but one of them can't do well because there is something wrong with him he suffers <UNK> <UNK> during which he commits acts of violence which he later forgets br br essentially the effect ryan has on <UNK> is that of the hunter and his prey or in another sense a <UNK> the audience finds out early on that ryan is a mad killer but it takes <UNK> much longer thus we must live with this knowledge as we watch poor miss <UNK> try everything in her power to <UNK> ryan over in order to make things work get the job done get on with life but getting on with things isn't in <UNK> makeup as he is incapable of any but the most <UNK> forms of <UNK> and as soon as there is an opening his paranoia <UNK> itself br br as a study in mental illness the movie isn't too impressive what it's <UNK> at is showing the effect of major mental illness with dangerous in the mix and its effect on a normal person in this regard the film is realistic and compassionate though relentlessly logical in that we know <UNK> can't ryan yet we want her to the result is that if one is willing one can get extremely involved in this film emotionally if one can put aside so to speak its melodramatic structure br br <UNK> shows us gradually the <UNK> the <UNK> house a <UNK> gothic monstrosity that never feels like a home we become familiar with <UNK> kitchen and <UNK> and we come to know which windows miss <UNK> can use for an escape and which ones she can't
<START> this has to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life i can't believe people actually a write scripts like this b have a budget to make a film c actually expect it to be successful words can't even describe how horrible this film is i enjoy my fair share of teen movies but this didn't even come close to being funny in fact it was funny for the sole reason that it was so horrible i can probably count one maybe two parts in the film where i even managed to squeeze out a chuckle other than the laughs regarding how bad it was br br renting this was one of the biggest mistakes i've ever made its been a day since i've seen the film and i'm still in shock regarding how horrible it was avoid at all costs br br 2 10
<START> michael <UNK> the couch trip is a wonderfully <UNK> comedy about what makes a good psychiatrist it is so subtle and wicked that you start to realize what a <UNK> satire it really is it is also dan best movie made in a particularly great film year 1988 for him first the great <UNK> and now this br br <UNK> stars as john burns a career crook who <UNK> insanity to escape prison now a dumb comedy would just be about this but the couch trip uses this as a <UNK> for everything else beverly hills psychiatrist george charles <UNK> subtly hilarious here has a nervous breakdown and a replacement is selected lawrence who happens to be psychiatrist you can pretty much guess what's going to happen but the great thing about the couch trip is not what happens but how it is done br br the couch trip gives dan <UNK> the best role he has ever had his john burns is one of the truly original comic creations in movie history wicked one liners and physical humor are a part of it but what makes it special is that <UNK> makes burns a lovable character we root for him and grow to like him a whole lot during the 98 minute running time br br but <UNK> isn't alone here he gets strong support from other great comic actors walter matthau joins the hilarity as a con artist minister who catches on to <UNK> secret and commits <UNK> blackmail charles <UNK> slow burns his way to another great comic role as the burned out psychiatrist <UNK> has been one of the most <UNK> actors in hollywood it's criminal they haven't used him more often richard <UNK> plays <UNK> <UNK> lawyer to perfection br br the couch trip is one of many films made by the now <UNK> <UNK> pictures corporation that are currently unseen mgm spent a fortune buying the <UNK> library but have yet to truly cash in on their <UNK> the couch trip joins dressed to kill blow out and countless others in gathering dust rotting in the vault shame on mgm for their <UNK> hopefully with new management the couch trip will find the audience and respect it deserves br br out of 4 stars
<START> the movie is okay meaning that i don't regret watching it i found the acting purely and the most of the dialog stupid oh no this was my <UNK> bible it's sort of bad remake of u turn a man arrives to a desert town out in nowhere meets the wrong people and falls in love with the wrong woman and off cause <UNK> involved in something he thought he could leave behind him the movie is quite predictable and there is really nothing new in it when it's finish you didn't really care most of the characters are stereotypes specially brian austin green all in all just another movie from the states but okay entertaining on boring <UNK> night imdb vote 4 10
<START> there's a good story well hidden and never really used br br the film is short and overly <UNK> on action and <UNK> photography somehow character and story development have been forgotten what is left is muddled and superficial br br turn off your brain and will probably find that the time goes quickly enough but unless you are the sort of person that finds <UNK> deep and meaningful you are going to get no real satisfaction from this film br br watch only if you have nothing better to do and then only if someone else pays for the video rental
<START> as much as i love trains i couldn't stomach this movie the premise that one could steal a <UNK> and drive from <UNK> to chicago without hitting another train along the way has to be right up there on the impossible plot lines hit board imagine two disgruntled <UNK> employees stealing the <UNK> that <UNK> the <UNK> to and <UNK> and driving it to new york and you get the idea br br having said all that it's a nice try <UNK> is at his <UNK> best and <UNK> <UNK> turns a good performance as his <UNK> but well meaning sidekick bob <UNK> is suitably <UNK> as the corporate guy and the little guy takes on <UNK> story gets another airing
<START> a small town kid working in a big city becomes a huge star and then <UNK> out of control it shows you the rise to fame and then fall from fame and back to a little rise great cast of actors and a great director a great great movie called boogie nights br br p t anderson an amazing director who made boogie nights amazing from the moment the movie starts to the moment it ends you can feel how beautiful this movie is some scenes are breathtaking literally a great story a great movie mark <UNK> was fantastic philip seymour hoffman was wonderful as he is in everything thomas jane also was magnificent and although he only had a small part he played it to perfection there is one scene in this movie i can't get over the drug deal gone bad scene it was amazing music acting and cinematography combined to make it amazing i hadn't seen boogie nights and thank god i did its so well rounded and i am now a huge fan of <UNK> paul thomas anderson br br do whatever you have to do and watch this movie
<START> well i should say the only film related to club dj electronic music and <UNK> that <UNK> respect br br seriously now it's a <UNK> fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a <UNK> albeit its in a club its in <UNK> and its somewhat dated the film leaves out some of the elements of club life but doesn't <UNK> from them altogether it presents a <UNK> yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives br br at the core of the film and the best element of justin <UNK> script is the characters eccentric unique yet completely understandable and accessible this film simple would not work and be infinitely less entertaining were it not for <UNK> nina and <UNK> viewers can deny the political and social <UNK> of the subtext of human traffic as a drug film <UNK> wannabe important <UNK> in british youth culture circa 90's but they can't deny that these are engaging characters br br it's frantic its brutally honest it's <UNK> it's over the top but its a great comedy br br <UNK> are a complex thing so are the drugs that are taken at these events so are the people you will encounter but from someone who has gone to parties become jaded and still goes human traffic is the best <UNK> that could be taken of the <UNK> just whatever you do avoid groove as its the <UNK> of all that is good about human traffic
<START> i made the mistake of watching dark star 1974 late one night many years ago it was one of the stupidest movies that i have ever watched br br 1 bad acting br br 2 bad writing br br 3 <UNK> stupid plot destroying an entire planet because its <UNK> is unstable or in the way will only make matters worse instead of having one large easily <UNK> object you'll have thousands of smaller but equally lethal and more difficult objects to track br br 4 completely unrealistic characters a painted beach ball as a space alien the writers must have been doing too many drugs br br not surprisingly the majority of actors that starred in dark star never did anything else of those that did do anything else the majority never acted again after dark star therefore having dark star on one's acting resume was a death star to one's acting career
<START> spoilers throughout this is a very strange film particularly for its time in every respect for six years american movies had shown american soldiers as everybody's son brother father br br in movies like the best years of our lives and <UNK> the end of time our hearts are <UNK> by the difficulty that the sweet returning soldiers have in <UNK> to peace and their families yet in this same year this film shows soldiers as a mix of people rather worse than the viewer one message of this film is lock up your daughters br br even the good soldiers with plenty of time on their hands are gambling all the time getting <UNK> drunk and are wholly indifferent to whether they even have wives any more and their reaction to the police investigating a murder is to <UNK> against them br br mitchum the most sympathetic soldier says things like i don't know if my wife wants to make a go of it now after the war haven't seen her in two years do i care not really maybe we'll make a go of it maybe not br br another soldier is shown as unusually sensitive because after years away he would like to see his wife again br br later when this soldier states at the police station that he spent the evening at a <UNK> home without knowing his wife is sitting just behind him there seems to be no question whatever that his wife will be fine indeed she is i guess it's hey soldiers will be soldiers br br the police detective played by robert young who is trying to crack a murder case states convincingly and with <UNK> <UNK> about someone's account of their actions on the night in question br br do i care no i don't really care about anything any more i've done this too long i guess br br a man shows up at the <UNK> apartment he says i'm just a man like you interested in the whore then he says no that's a lie i'm her husband i'd like to be in the military i was turned down before t br br <UNK> he says no that's a lie why would i want to be a soldier he goes through another series of lies when the police ask him who he is to the end of the movie we haven't a clue who he is or why he is there he's one of the strangest characters in the history of movies br br a man stands with his girlfriend at a bar talking to four soldiers when a clumsy soldier knocks a drink onto his girlfriend she leaves to change her dress and is right back wearing another no problem yet the man doesn't leave with his girlfriend who simply disappears but instead follows one of the soldiers when he leaves to go to another area of the bar the man then <UNK> from the minimal information he's learned about the soldier to <UNK> <UNK> about the problems of returning soldiers and immediately invites the soldier home because he is drunk and feels sick this is strange stuff br br similarly a dance hall girl is irritated by the sentimental soldier who would like to take her out for a real dance and dinner maybe yet she does dance with him and immediately gives him the key to her home br br were people in the late 1940s always <UNK> soldiers to come to their homes after they just met them br br robert ryan kills his host a stranger when he's <UNK> that the jewish host tries to get the <UNK> ryan out of his home the reason for the murder no jew tells me how to drink how to drink huh what does that mean br br this movie is always off <UNK> quite deliberately so the soldiers act consistently with total complete <UNK> of the law and all the characters are as cold and tough as any movie i've ever seen br br and yet the movie is utterly gripping you simply have no idea how these people are going to act or what new bizarre character is going to pop up without anyone thinking the person's actions are strange in the least e g the wife's behavior br br the acting is about the finest ever seen from robert young robert ryan gloria <UNK> who earned an oscar nomination paul kelly and other actors i'd never heard of br br i'd never heard of this movie and it's a complete delight that i've discovered one that i shall want to see again and again and again it's really strange but impossible to look away from because you've no idea what these creatures will do next
