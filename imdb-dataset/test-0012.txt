<START> recently was traveling in <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> and stopped in the small town of <UNK> <UNK> and there was a <UNK> in honor of who was born in <UNK> years ago the people all know about to this day and tour <UNK> are proud to stop at his <UNK> this film is a great history of this great man and his great love for <UNK> dame never realized that has such great talents in chemistry and laboratory science and also taught chemistry for years and at the same time <UNK> the football team ronald reagan played the role of george the who was an outstanding football player reagan had a short role but gave a great supporting role in this film donald crisp father john callahan was outstanding as a priest who always had great faith in during his entire life at <UNK> dame this is a great classic film and will be viewed by many generations to come enjoy
<START> usually when bbc releases a tv series one is used to a certain satisfaction guarantee usually the tv series is splendid even if the story is boring you can trust the acting will make the it worth while when i came across <UNK> here at the local library i was looking forward to an enjoyable evening cause i read the story br br i'm glad i read the story first otherwise i would not think highly of it further was i <UNK> to learn that the production date of this tv series was from 1971 since i thought until that moment that bbc had lost it it is really bad and should be used in acting schools as a horror movie br br the only positive thought i have about this series that the people in this film are not likely to appear or be involved in any bbc or other product this century other than the young sisters who apparently were taking their fist steps in acting and doing remarkably well under the direction otherwise given
<START> let's get it clear from the start i am an <UNK> with the emotional sensitivity of <UNK> stone therefore i consider dramas of people with <UNK> social <UNK> or whatever <UNK> they have and cry on and on about it as stupid movies with poor taste i mean if you have a message you can tell it without the help of sick or pitiful people br br however i liked this movie it is about people with incredible bad luck as personal health goes but they don't cry about it quite the opposite they try to live and people try to protect or take care of them by <UNK> <UNK> them from real life the message is live life to the <UNK> even if the ending is as sad as possible br br my conclusion as sick people dramas go this one is a keeper it is sad yet hopeful i like james <UNK> even if he does seem to always play the arrogant rebel i also say that steven robertson played very well either that or he really has partial <UNK>
<START> a good example of <UNK> politically correct racism where white men are presented as senseless <UNK> <UNK> only there to be <UNK> and their <UNK> <UNK> as noble heroes superior both in their appearance and abilities apart from making the story dull this also <UNK> the neutral viewer to identify himself with one or the other side it's just too <UNK> the repetitive score is incredibly annoying as is the voice over the characters lack any depth and the viewer is soon lost between questions like who is this character and what the hell is that supposed to mean photography is wonderful though and on the whole there's a lot of atmosphere to it but nice shots of misty landscapes alone don't save this movie the dvd box uses <UNK> sutherland as an eye <UNK> in fact his character could have been played by anyone else because it's basically just an empty shell like most non characters and disappears anyway around halfway the film but if you are eager to see jack bauer in a <UNK> that's your kind of movie
<START> in order for a thriller to <UNK> fear suspense or any emotion the story must be believable there is nothing believable or realistic about this film the protagonists have several opportunities to escape or turn the tables but manage to screw it up every time the <UNK> who supposedly plan this out and <UNK> their <UNK> specifically to trap people sure left a lot of <UNK> weapons laying around there is actually one scene where the smart girl has a gun to the head of the main bad guy and decides to <UNK> him instead of pull the trigger this was a thoroughly predictably brainless thriller every character was one dimensional the victims were the usual <UNK> brainless sheep that deserved to be slaughtered is there anyone on this planet capable of writing an intelligent thriller
<START> i'm amazed that i have a real affection for this one <UNK> as i'm not an action and adventure lover but hey it's pretty tough to go wrong with a robert <UNK> film i've read several poor or reviews on this film pulling it apart for it's period errors or unlikely plot development but no one seems to mention the rather intriguing character transition which features how a hardened down on his luck <UNK> <UNK> transforms into a rather noble <UNK> hero and how the pretty boy cowardly <UNK> miller develops a real taste for the life of a highway man once he gets the feel of it filled with lots of bad boy humor lavish scenes particularly the use of fireworks by former and a <UNK> musical score is a fast paced highly enjoyable piece of film making it's certainly worth your viewing time for the climax scene alone shoot 'em up boys
<START> the premise of bottom crossed with <UNK> towers sounds great however have managed to create a film that raises barely a <UNK> ten years ago <UNK> mad stare and idiocy were funny now they are just annoying br br the film had promise though the most horrendous hotel in britain is not a new idea but failed to deliver the saving <UNK> were competent performances from simon <UNK> big train pegg and mathieu and the film is only 90 minutes long sorry guys but you really have hit the bottom
<START> in a phrase moral ambiguity in the soderbergh remake there are good guys and bad guys <UNK> del <UNK> character is clearly the good guy morally clean and <UNK> his counterpart in the bbc original the farmer turned dealer is realistically flawed and conflicted over his fate the two relentless cops are similarly different in the american one they win our hearts in the bbc original they are over <UNK> nearly obsessive br br the best moment for me in <UNK> was when the college student <UNK> asked the drug <UNK> what would you do if you were poor and black and rich white people came into your neighborhood looking for drugs that point was <UNK> throughout the bbc show and <UNK> in jack <UNK> final speech both are excellent but the bbc towers over the remake my conclusion after seeing both shows is that dealers are innocent <UNK> who are only <UNK> a demand and it is the demand that causes so much suffering
<START> six out of seven people who took the time to comment on this movie have very positive <UNK> the one negative review happens to <UNK> or did on the first page of the movie's location in the imdb br br i found what alice found to be one of the best movies almost no one's heard of that i have seen this year it's 6 4 rating is misleading and may be more a function of the difficult subject matter than the quality of the movie who would think that a movie <UNK> about truck stop prostitution would be worth seeing guess again br br for me alice was a positively gripping psychological thriller i was virtually on the edge of my seat the entire time it's a very credible story with a realistic script and is very well cast in a <UNK> world actress <UNK> would win awards for keeping you guessing whether she was good or evil br br ignore the rating and see this terrific movie and by the way i wish there was a soundtrack album
<START> alright i'm 12 so this is where you get to see the movie from a pre <UNK> point of view i've also commented on <UNK> and man both great movies if you want to check it out alright here on earth was a beautiful movie with astounding scenes and images very pleasing to the eye the writer i don't know who it was check imdb either worked very hard or has a good appreciation for love poetry and drama i cried 4 times throughout this movie once for over 30 minutes it was really sad really beautiful really meaningful it's a great movie for anyone say 11 and up who isn't a romantic comedy freak yeah it's romantic yeah it's comedic but in my opinion it's better than she's all that or whatever it takes i never cry it's a tender story go rent it and tape it
<START> <UNK> has gone down the toilet they have kids saying things like oh my god and we're screwed br br this show <UNK> hate for people who aren't good looking or aren't in the in crowd it say that sexual <UNK> is alright by having girls <UNK> over <UNK> boys not to mention the overweight boy who takes off his shirt the main characters basically <UNK> anyone out of the ordinary friend sam who may be a lesbian beats the <UNK> out of anybody that crosses her path which says it's alright to be a b <UNK> this show has so much <UNK> in it that nobody should watch it i give it a 0 out of 10
<START> i used to watch this show when i was growing up when i think about it i remember it very well if you ask me it was a good show two things i remember very well are the opening sequence and theme song in addition to that everyone was <UNK> cast the writing was also very strong the performances were top grade too i hope some network brings it back so i can see every episode before i wrap this up i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever even though i haven't seen every episode now in conclusion if some network ever brings it back i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good
<START> a friend warned me that this was the worst movie he had ever seen i was curious because it had developed a bit of a cult status i like a lot of odd indie cult movies so i gave it a shot i have to agree with my friend it is a steaming pile of dung i am sorry to the people who love this movie but i can recommend much better stuff if you want to watch a twisted indie cult film try peter jackson's dead alive aka <UNK> cemetery man aka or modern vampires
<START> i just saw a tale of two sisters last night and really enjoyed it i've been a big fan of asian horror films recently and think that this is a strong entry from south korea there aren't many jump out at you scares as in the usual american horror film but the director does maintain the off <UNK> and foreboding mood very well especially in the awkward character interactions with each other most of the scares are more <UNK> and plays on everyone's there's something under the bed fears from when they were a child but in this case it's the closet and the sink i also liked how the director was able to capture just how dysfunctional this household is through scenes such as the first dinner that the characters have together he's also good at revealing people's inner life and <UNK> through simple scenes such as the stepmother <UNK> off her make up in the mirror or her sitting in front of the <UNK> tv i think this film is mainly an exploration of guilt and the consequences of living with that guilt hanging over you br br major spoilers ahead do not read any further if you do not want the twists of the movie revealed i was following the story pretty well but did start getting confused during the bag dragging part however i think the flashback at the end definitely tied everything together the film is very much like the <UNK> in the way two of the character's joint guilt eventually leads to mental <UNK> and <UNK> br br here's my interpretation of the film the <UNK> <UNK> that we see after the girls supposed return to the house is either the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> or the actual ghost of <UNK> <UNK> that only <UNK> <UNK> can see and interact with the initial stepmother that we see is in my opinion a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> there is a real stepmother however and she first appears in the film when she's wearing the gray <UNK> i believe it's the real stepmother that the father is talking to on the phone throughout the first part of the movie and she doesn't appear until he pick her up and brings her to the house the stepmother before that point is imagined by <UNK> <UNK> perhaps part of her split personality that explains the bizarre dinner party sequence when the <UNK> brother looks at her like she's crazy and doesn't remember anything that she <UNK> i think it was <UNK> <UNK> acting out her stepmother part of her split personality the film shows this later in the bag dragging scene and scenes such as the stepmother <UNK> her make up in the mirror which is revealed later to actually be <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> her make up in the mirror br br i think the ghosts in the house aren't entirely imagined by <UNK> <UNK> and are either of <UNK> <UNK> or the mother or both in the final flashback it is revealed the <UNK> <UNK> was wearing the green dress and had the <UNK> in her hair when she died this is the green dress that they showed before on the ghost sitting at the <UNK> room table while the stepmother was looking under the sink also it's the <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> was wearing in the flashback that appears on the floor when the stepmother is looking under the sink br br the real stepmother in the end gets <UNK> by the ghost of <UNK> <UNK> who comes for in a scene a little bit like the ring after that the flashback scene ties it all together in terms of how both the stepmother was mainly responsible for her death while <UNK> <UNK> unintentionally played a supporting role br br i wonder if the mother that <UNK> <UNK> sees when she goes up to her room to cry in the flashback is a ghost already perhaps by that point the mother had already killed herself in the closet that's left ambiguous br br other things that are suggested but not clearly explained in the film is that it seems like the stepmother at some point was a nurse perhaps taking care of the mother and somehow may have contributed to her death too it's not clear when her relationship with the father began and whether it caused the mother to kill herself it's also suggested that the mother had mental issues too <UNK> a nurse the stepmother <UNK> to this when she tells <UNK> <UNK> you're beginning to take after your mother i don't think she meant just physically br br also if we accept that the initial stepmother that we see is actually <UNK> <UNK> then there's the suggestion of incest too since the father sleeps with her is that why <UNK> <UNK> freaks out and shouts don't touch me each time the father reaches for her in a later scenes is that the filthy things that you've done that she <UNK> to in a later conversation with the father this film is interesting in it's capacity for different interpretations a few of the scenes however were kind of derivative such as the woman in the black <UNK> around scene which reminded me of the <UNK> jerky movements of in the <UNK> on the grudge films also the final scene where the stepmother finally gets her just <UNK> is reminiscent of the ring furthermore just the idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from the sixth sense or the others br br overall i enjoyed it however and it will be interesting to see how the hollywood remake that's already in production turns out i have to be honest i liked both the ring and the grudge so i'm not one of those <UNK> types who insist that remakes can't be good too one remake that i'm really excited about is dark water coming out this summer i haven't seen the original japanese version yet but both films are definitely on my to see list
<START> daniel dirty war a bbc production made for television was shown recently on cable the film has a documentary style in the way it goes after the people that caused the near holocaust in one of the big metropolis of the world london in fact this film produced in 2004 is almost a <UNK> tale of the events of the following year in which terrorists set explosive devices in the public transport that killed innocent people that were in the wrong place at the wrong time br br the film <UNK> for the pace the director and the production team gave to the project there are no dull moments in the movie as we watch the <UNK> by the terrorists and the people that are following their dirty work although the inevitable happens it's amazing just to think what would be the consequences if a real <UNK> was planted in such a <UNK> populated area br br the last images of the film have a chilling effect the mob scenes and the way the whole area is <UNK> send <UNK> of fear thinking how it could possible happen anywhere
<START> you can't really blame the movie maker for <UNK> che because the industry is all about money most of the stories you hear about this freedom fighter are absolute tripe <UNK> by the communist cuban government after che's death che was a murdering <UNK> from day one here's a list of the great things che did for cuba 1 executed thousands of innocent cuban men women and children to satisfy his lust for power br br 2 destroyed <UNK> economy and good standing with the rest of the world the cuban used to be equal with the american dollar now it's basically worthless br br 3 continually failed at all things that involved <UNK> economy and the military he never made it past his first year in medical school and he was only in one real battle in which he <UNK> with a fully loaded gun br br 4 he took over the largest estate in cuba to set up for himself he had a <UNK> a 60 <UNK> made tv from america a swimming pool and a view of the ocean so much for <UNK> the life style br br cuba today is an absolutely <UNK> country and you have no one but che and the castro brothers to thank for it if you go to cuba today you will not be allowed out of the tourist areas if you did manage to get out of what you're meant to see you would find <UNK> <UNK> and prostitutes br br if you think any of what i'm saying is untrue then go do some studying compare cuban <UNK> from 1950 60 to those of today talk with people who survived or who had parents in the so called cuban revolution of the 1960's read all of the reports of murdered <UNK> read the reports from people who served under che and castro and <UNK> because of what an evil disgusting human being he was br br and please please always remember to read or watch everything <UNK> stop taking everything at face value and think about it
<START> <UNK> moore made his last official appearance on screen as the masked man in director <UNK> epic adventure the lone ranger and the lost city of gold co starring jay as his faithful indian <UNK> <UNK> was an old hand at <UNK> westerns during his 40 years in films and television with over a 100 westerns to his directorial credit this fast paced horse opera <UNK> a <UNK> perspective in its depiction of native americans that had been gradually gaining acceptance since 1950 in hollywood <UNK> after director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the trail with the james stewart western broken arrow racial <UNK> figures as the primary theme in the robert <UNK> and eric screenplay having written 13 episodes of the lone ranger television series <UNK> and each were thoroughly familiar with the formula but they raised the stakes for this theatrical outing our vigilante heroes ride to the rescue of indians who are being murdered by <UNK> white <UNK> for no apparent reason the mystery about the identities of these <UNK> and the reason behind their homicidal behavior is revealed fairly early so that you don't have to guess what is happening br br although the violence in this saga appears tame by contemporary standards the fact that the lone ranger shoots a bad guy to kill in one scene rather than wound and that a <UNK> dame <UNK> a double crossing <UNK> by <UNK> a that sinks into his back between his shoulder <UNK> was pretty <UNK> the television series never went to this length and when the lone ranger <UNK> his six gun he shot the gun out of the <UNK> fist rather than blow him away the other <UNK> here is the indians lynch one of the <UNK> and torture him for information but they are never brought up on charges from <UNK> this henchman douglas kennedy didn't have the villainous statue of <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> the masked man in director stuart the lone ranger but he <UNK> himself well enough as a cowardly outlaw who kills one of his own henchmen without a <UNK> when the <UNK> threatens to <UNK> his name and the identities of his <UNK> to a band of vengeful indians br br the lone ranger and the lost city of gold opens with a <UNK> of the masked <UNK> origins as an <UNK> texas ranger and his transformation into the lone ranger with <UNK> serving as his sidekick this opening two minute <UNK> is an excellent way to get a series oriented character off to a start so that everybody including non lone ranger fans is on equal <UNK> the primary plot about a gang of ruthless white wearing <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> begins with them killing indians and stealing worn around their

disguise so that he can learn more he <UNK> as a gentleman bounty hunter with a mustache and faux southern accent br br despite its <UNK> <UNK> minute running time the lone ranger and the lost city of gold lacks neither excitement nor surprises keeps the action moving ahead at a full <UNK> the dialogue is largely <UNK> rather than memorable as <UNK> and push the plot ahead more often than spring surprises but there is one major surprise that ties in with the good indian theme there is also a scene where the lone ranger pushes his own <UNK> about justice available for everybody under the law at a time when supreme court chief justice earl warren had <UNK> on the high <UNK> landmark decisions that recognized and <UNK> against the conditions surrounding racial <UNK> civil rights <UNK> of church and state and police arrest <UNK> in the united states one thing that <UNK> the lone ranger and the lost city of gold from its predecessor is its epic scale with flashbacks to the age of the spanish <UNK> with a slight bit of science fiction involved in the form of a destructive meteor generally lone ranger stories confined themselves to the 19th century without dragging in european history no the lone ranger wasn't the first movie to deal with spanish <UNK> robert d <UNK> the seven cities of gold 1955 concerned the spanish searching the <UNK> for the eponymous places but western beat gordon <UNK> gold of the seven saints <UNK> to the screen
<START> in this offering one only has to view the current <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> offering to see the parallels outrageously funny and captures the true essence of the competition one can only imagine the wit of the producers and the amazing ability of the performers i too would have nominated this movie for a globe award and feel it is one of the funniest i have ever seen
<START> was okay but hero high was my favorite when i was a kid i mean before there was sky high 2005 and zoom 2006 there was hero high a school for super hero's in training teenagers with super powers would help police capture bad guys and other times they would get in embarrassing situations like the greatest american hero 1981 it was a fun cartoon to watch what was also fun was the live action stage show called the kid <UNK> hour with the actors who voiced the characters also dressed has there characters in the show rex ruthless john <UNK> misty magic fields <UNK> jim captain california chris who also sang the theme song dirty <UNK> glorious gal <UNK> who looks like the love child of superman and wonder woman and punk rock johnny the whole cast just went with anything when it came to the jokes the cartoon was a fun superhero comedy i shore up it will come back in live action like fat albert 2004
<START> i am very open minded i watch all kinds of programs to the end good or bad just to give them a chance and learn from the good aspects and bad ones this show had potential to be good but my god what were the writers casting director and director thinking the cast of actors are terrible with the slightest exception of meryl <UNK> rogers and <UNK> joy being given occasional good lines with the best execution of the lot br br the rest of the cast kill the show it is the same story line in every episode sam has plans to do something his boss <UNK> these plans by <UNK> him ridiculous work projects then the foolish ways sam tries to <UNK> both in a manner that is primarily stupid and lacks any real intelligent humor this is every episode it gets very <UNK> br br season 2 they <UNK> the eye candy the 2 hot girls in the show get written out yet the brother stays explain that casting cut to me please i can see why they wrote them out they had no substantial role but they didn't add anyone better to replace them br br the cocky derek character is given a continuous appearance in season 2 his acting along with everyone else's resembles many poor sitcoms from the 80's might have been funny then but painful now br br the show could have been so much better with a few good writers and some people who had any talent to <UNK> them this show lacks everything production quality is the only good aspect of the show it is great in that regard unfortunately the content is painfully sad br br my god fox was there really nothing better to choose from i'm sticking with shows like it's always sunny in philadelphia or 30 rock for now the bar should be set by programs like these that actually assume the audience are intelligent and aren't continually <UNK> on themselves using all their brain power on continuing to breathe
<START> i saw this last night and voted it an 8 since then it's grown on me and i'd give it a 9 br br the film has at first a seemingly slightly <UNK> <UNK> between the first and second <UNK> the first half is a comedy and there's little hint of the <UNK> truths of <UNK> life wars religious <UNK> that will become revealed in the second half while at first it may be a little <UNK> because it's a slightly unfamiliar narrative sequence on reflection it works br br the acting was good in the role of alex the <UNK> was especially great br br i've <UNK> most other user comments and see that some who've read the book are pleased with the movie while there are a few who are not both feelings of course are valid br br for me a retired family <UNK> and one world believer the film was relevant on two different levels br br the first as history gave a powerful reminder of how <UNK> happen with <UNK> and trying to <UNK> any of those with a different moral value system than our own br br the second was that in <UNK> the first it also revealed something in common to each of us all our families that each of us must go back to our roots to more fully understand ourselves br br t s <UNK> expressed this <UNK> in the 4th of his four when he said we shall not <UNK> from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time br br jonathan goes on a fulfilling journey that any of us would find fantastically <UNK> to explore and discover our roots what were those people going through then who were they really before when and during the early years before and after we were born etc br br so the film at first gives us the impression of a comedy then shifts to give us a lesson in history and human <UNK> but through all that it also gives us <UNK> a message about each of ourselves all of us would be <UNK> rewarded to go back and understand the place from which we first started
<START> is awesome considering that the producers had a <UNK> budget they have done an excellent job it is a must watch the small kid has done an excellent job with a lot of emotions flowing through his eyes grandfather is at his best the photography is superb technically correct and very creative it helps in adding a lot of emotions to the mainstream content the movie will keep u <UNK> and don't be surprised if you are <UNK> after the movie and the story <UNK> in your mind for a few days i sincerely hope that they make it to the final oscar nomination br br enjoy and again don't miss it
<START> this fourth installment of the series is the last to get a theatrical release though it feels like a direct to video movie it's ok i guess but nothing special the acting is the worst of seen in the series up to this point and like the third movie there isn't much in the way of imagination also the sentence directed by alan <UNK> is never a good thing <UNK> is the <UNK> directors use when they want nothing to do with the movie anyway its an acceptable movie in the <UNK> series but not much more than that it's a slight drop in quality from number three and a huge drop from the first two for me <UNK> iv <UNK> is a 4 5 10
<START> text taken from 2001 melbourne international film fest guide br br the title is a pun based on the film's lead actor <UNK> deliberate <UNK> of <UNK> a reference to the film's setting and a rather less than subtle <UNK> to the secret agenda of its protagonist br br <UNK> is an <UNK> national an amateur magician passing himself off as a tourist visiting the <UNK> soon after it is <UNK> to its people his master plan is to win the ultimate struggle by <UNK> and <UNK> the local females <UNK> with the delicious <UNK> thus an entire generation of half creates the illusion of a documentary and maintains a fish eyed perspective that gives the film a <UNK> flair and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i like the concept of <UNK> but the show is spoiled by some seriously wooden acting the medical <UNK> has the best lines and delivers them in an arch <UNK> manner that up the story unfortunately he has little screen time br br also why does <UNK> fox always look and act so utterly unhappy i know that <UNK> investigation is a very serious business but the characters for the most part seem to confuse seriousness with <UNK> and a complete lack of personality i can't imagine dating either sarah or catherine what would you talk to either one about i'm waiting for the episode when at the end of a shift catherine picks up a remote control points it at <UNK> <UNK> him down and <UNK> him into a closet until the next day
<START> the trailer for this film promised a new twist on the zombie genre setting it in the old west except it's not the real old west of course it's some sort of future west in a world where some apocalypse has as are known to do killed people and subsequently turned them into zombies it's zombie virus time again folks and you know what that means get bitten and become one of them br br so into this dusty and dead filled world comes a hero he's a bounty hunter getting paid for taking care of zombies it's not exactly clear who is providing the <UNK> but it seems a little <UNK> industry of zombie hunting has emerged but as the trailer tells us there's a problem they are running out of zombies the only way to keep on <UNK> is to <UNK> new towns and cities with the virus br br i think that's not a bad idea for a film but unfortunately it takes a lot more than a good idea and a crowd of people <UNK> at windows to make a good zombie film what we actually get is a clint eastwood clone the actor's even called clint for crying out loud and his hilarious sidekick trying to bag zombies while <UNK> some still living bad guys to get some big reward the whole subplot about <UNK> other towns is only mentioned in passing over half way through the film instead there's a lot of western movie clichés poor zombie make up and some world class bad acting really bad the sort that wouldn't even make it onto <UNK> both hero and villain <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> are thrown people get bitten as the movie <UNK> to a conclusion the only thing worth wondering is whether it's going to end with the cliché of the hero being the only man alive having killed the one he loves or the cliché of him turning into a zombie in the final frame it's the first one by the way this film was written and directed by <UNK> <UNK> it's the only thing he has done and hopefully it will be his last at the start of the film there is a <UNK> that reads <UNK> entertainment at least they got one thing right
<START> when i first became a father about 5 5 years ago i was prepared for many of the sacrifices i'd have to make i knew i'd have to change <UNK> and take them to swimming lessons and attend many a <UNK> santa claus parade but i wasn't ready for the kind of sacrifice i made last night this in my humble opinion is cruel and unusual punishment br br underdog is bad it's not quite karate dog bad but it makes the shaggy dog feel like pulp fiction if underdog were a television show i'd recommend flipping on by not even the presence of <UNK> and the voice of <UNK> can save it bow wow br br it was also just about the best 80 minutes i've ever enjoyed james was <UNK> to the right of me and michelle to the left and i spent more time watching their reaction to this talking flying <UNK> than watching the screen at 5 and 3 years old they were the target audience and this movie nailed the target there's a scene where underdog <UNK> in another dogs face and michelle thought it was the funniest scene ever captured on film when underdog was flying into outer space james was literally at the edge of his seat <UNK> the kids absolutely loved underdog and that's why i was there that's what last night was all about br br unless you're accompanying someone under the age of ten you have no business wasting a second of your life watching this brutal film but if you are looking to kill 80 minutes with your four year old i won't judge i had a blast
<START> if you love japanese monster movies you'll love this action packed battle <UNK> an alien <UNK> intent upon <UNK> the earth and a giant robot with an of super <UNK> the alien <UNK> <UNK> from the planet <UNK> has a army of thugs called of course the <UNK> gang as well as an endless supply of immense hostile creatures that are <UNK> <UNK> upon the earth to smash buildings make loud noises panic the <UNK> etc a little kid named johnny has the giant robot at his <UNK> call and sends the robot as needed to beat up and then blast these creatures johnny joins a group of good spies called <UNK> and <UNK> to help save the world br br in spite of the campy nature unintentionally humorous dialog and the fact that the target audience was obviously children this movie has non stop action colorful characters decent special effects and just happens to be downright fun to watch battle scenes are well executed and frequent as the storyline requires the good guys and bad guys both made sure they had an <UNK> supply of bombs <UNK> <UNK> and schemes to attack each other in spite of the fact the movie was constructed from edited episodes of a tv series the plot actually develops and reaches an ultimate conclusion br br the film has a positive <UNK> and appeals to everyone's especially kids' desire to destroy evil in its many forms kids may be the target audience but it's fun for everyone to laugh at its comical silliness yet at the same time root for the good guys to <UNK> and save the world the acting is cheesy in places but that is the charm there are several lines of corny dialog possibly translation errors or possibly intentional jokes by the movie makers and you'll find yourself <UNK> these absurd lines later br br admittedly this film is not high in production quality or budget however for what it is campy sci fi it's enjoyable for some laughs i recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor for that sort of thing
<START> i would have to say this is a great movie br br mike judge has an eye things that nobody would ever notice hence office space a statement about the <UNK> down of society and that survival of the <UNK> is mere <UNK> dream in 500 years that pop culture and mass marketing by wealthy companies tend to rule the day yes there is a lot of <UNK> humor in it and it is to get the story moving and his point across but the genuine frustration on private joe <UNK> face is priceless and some cases we can all relate to it at some point in our lives br br if you do not enjoy the humor then look at it from a different point of view and watch it again it took me watching it twice to really appreciate this film for what it with said after watching it am going to read a book now
<START> caught this movie on tv and i watched it again i said to myself it's been a long time since i watched this movie so why not and once again this movie thrilled me it is so easy so watchable and so human that i don't know why some people dislike it br br john travolta shines as michael his dance and every move angel that can hardly be related to this word he <UNK> drinks and he eats like some savage but he's got big heart on his way michael helps all people he meets dorothy winters <UNK> <UNK> in her singing and finding a right man frank <UNK> william hurt in developing himself as a good and decent man michael even helped dear old <UNK> jean <UNK> that last scene is beautiful when they dance on the street br br travolta had great help in other actors <UNK> <UNK> is so beautiful and likable william hurt is great as usual late robert <UNK> shows his talent jean <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are also good but my favorite supporting actor in this movie is bob <UNK> as the <UNK> owner br br so we've got here a solid movie about people with a warm story also and attractive cast just don't take this movie seriously and i can guarantee you'll have fun
<START> this movie was a <UNK> there was no development of the story viewers were thrown into the story without explanation and left to <UNK> for themselves in trying to work out what was going on the action sequences were okay but confusing they weren't the matrix and they weren't <UNK> tiger this movie is best left to cable tv where you don't have to pay to see it or convincing a friend that they should hire it and then go over and watch it as a huge jet li fan i expected more how can someone involved with once upon a time in china put his name to this one
<START> i bought this dvd for my young son who loves the movies i never expected it to be in the same league as the movies but what i got was just another lazy disney cartoon way below what i expected from disney pixar the story is unoriginal the characters are dull and two dimensional the animation is below par even buzz isn't that great the movie could have been so much better i especially hated the paint by numbers storyline i know it's meant for kids but even kids know when something stinks to this level <UNK> br br although i did enjoy some aspects of the movie i really liked the opening section of the movie with the <UNK> mutant monster it just went downhill from there
<START> minor spoiler br br inhabited isn't scary but it is creepy it is an interesting <UNK> story with good acting and great special effects makeup br br basic plot a little girl blames the strange things going on at her family's new house and accompanying <UNK> on her <UNK> friends br br the movie doesn't waste time getting moving though the ending could have been more involved br br i don't recommend this movie to those expecting wanting hardcore horror but i do recommend it to those who want a <UNK> and not necessarily a thriller
<START> i was a huge fan of this series yesterday i watched it again on dvd i was <UNK> about whether laughs would come or not but in a few episodes i was laughing hysterically and some episodes were good acting wise <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shah is brilliant whereas is plain bad but i think she gets the job done maybe a better actress could have been used in place of her this series shows what good clean comedy is br br if this series were to air in the current year i would have given it 9 10 and to think that this series is almost 25 years old and its comedy is still good i give it 10 10 i would highly recommend this series for watching on dvd
<START> stay alive is a bland horror movie about a video game that kills people the same way they die inside the game the friends that play this game soon figure this out and then realise they must defeat the blood <UNK> from the video game or accept their <UNK> we've had video tapes in the ring a deadly website in <UNK> now it's onto video games stay alive does some things well the character development is quite a bit deeper than it usually would be in a horror movie we really see into some of the characters feelings and past and get to know them all quite well so the audience may gain some emotions for them the film is also very suspenseful tense unnerving moments are frequently played through the film accompanied by unsettling creepy music there are plenty of jumps and <UNK> for the viewer this can be ideal once or twice but these false scares that hollywood seems to enjoy <UNK> in horror films nowadays wears thin in stay alive the camera will tend to provide sharp angles or quick flashes in order to give viewers a very quick glimpse of a demon or witch and try to scare them with this sudden burst on the screen why the gore is obviously very weak because of the film's <UNK> the script to stay alive is very cheesy and quite laughable and the characters tend to play it too <UNK> and <UNK> also clichés come in from every direction for instance people wandering around on their own in search of a strange noise or if they have spotted a figure in the dark they will go and investigate it however the computer graphics used for the video game segments are rather impressive and look colourful and sharp working well with the other parts of the film but overall there is just not enough to hold out on with this film <UNK> at just over a hundred minutes it won't be a battle to stay alive but rather stay awake
<START> well i guess i was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning this movie wasn't it it <UNK> along at a pretty slow deliberate pace for the first 40 minutes but there wasn't really anything in it that i was terribly interested in there's an intriguing and mysterious <UNK> between jean <UNK> character and an old man but more of the first 40 minutes is dominated by the <UNK> of the main character whom i didn't know much about and couldn't really relate to at the time he wanders around alone for the most part he doesn't meet anyone i imagine the director was trying to depict the loneliness of the human condition in this post apocalyptic world or something which is all good but i still wish he'd <UNK> it down from 40 minutes to 15 because it can get incredibly boring br br but after those 40 minutes things start to get very interesting i guess i won't really say more than that because i don't want to spoil anything so if you've seen the first 15 30 minutes of this movie and are thinking about turning it off like i was just stick with it it gets a lot better br br one of the most interesting things i found about this movie was the fact that it had no dialogue whatsoever which really made me have to think about what was happening how characters were feeling and what their motivations were why things were how they were in this post apocalyptic world all of which gives the story a lot of room for audience interpretation and it's amazing how much more satisfying a movie is when the actors aren't telling you exactly what's going on
<START> it's not like an historical movie it's not a movie with unforgettable love stories it's not a movie with a spectacular scenario but i can surely say it's a movie with a great atmosphere br br it had that 60's kind of <UNK> and rebellious spirit a group of friends living in a poor apartment in paris each one making art dreaming of changing the world doing drugs and loving in his very own way br br it takes a lot of patience to watch and a special mood that if you're not in you might find it extremely boring and dull br br i liked a lot the very realistic approach of the events that took place and their immediate effect on <UNK> lives the fear for their future the difficulty of <UNK> their living the obstacles in following their dreams br br what i absolutely loved was the black white image the still camera angles were amazing they were like <UNK> moments it left me the impression of a long slide show of old and very <UNK> and suggestive photographs i actually had to see the movie again just to take those amazing screen shots br br in one word beautiful
<START> opera was filmed in <UNK> with a variety of other mass media productions start point for opera is the initial appearance of the <UNK> eye br br the wizard of oz <UNK> start points are third mgm lion <UNK> <UNK> third knock on tin man's chest in the <UNK> and <UNK> third <UNK> click <UNK> with gone with the wind br br prince of darkness <UNK> start point is the music score start point br br electric original release version songs and sequence only br br original release version songs only br br sad wings of destiny original release br br sin after sin original release br br <UNK> class original release br br hell bent for leather original release br br point of entry original release br br screaming for vengeance original release br br <UNK> of the faith original release br br <UNK> original release
<START> i'm a pretty tolerable guy when it comes to movies even b movies i <UNK> watch some b movies for fun and they can range from surprisingly good to just downright awful i usually set my expectations really low before watching these types of movies and even after doing that descent was just downright awful i really didn't mind that they were ripping off the core to some extent but they did absolutely nothing interesting with the material some scientists are worried about the <UNK> <UNK> activity and must travel into the depths of the earth in order to <UNK> the so what we get is a <UNK> long set up in which two <UNK> scientists played by luke perry and rick roberts have to work together on a top secret mission named project deep the man in charge general <UNK> played by michael <UNK> is secretly <UNK> vital information from assistant <UNK> crawford played by <UNK> <UNK> out the cast is natalie brown who plays <UNK> a mission <UNK> who created the mole a <UNK> which is used <UNK> into the depths of the earth br br other than some pretty good special effects and set designs nothing about descent is worthwhile the movie starts out fairly entertaining but it gets <UNK> down quickly in a tiresome story about <UNK> <UNK> activity which has been done to death in other movies such as the core descent also has a poor script with useless forgettable dialog between the characters to make matters worse there is literally no action no real threat or danger the attempts at comic relief are painfully unfunny the plot has <UNK> holes and some of the subplots are left <UNK> at the end leaving a bad taste in your mouth br br in closing this movie was just a cheap way for everyone involved to get a paycheck there was no thought behind this movie no <UNK> it's just there other than some nice looking special effects and set designs this movie fails on every other level the story is from the garbage can of hollywood and the characters are uninteresting to boot descent will simply <UNK> you into boredom and frustration avoid at all costs
<START> this movie starts by showing you a map and then explaining radar and it is quite awhile before you ever see the deadly <UNK> probably a better movie in the 50's this dated piece is a bit to slow moving and the pay off in the end isn't very good though it has its moments like when the guy from perry mason <UNK> with an old man and when he says i have <UNK> the possibilities to one excuse me but when you narrow something down you have a couple or more possibilities not one if you get it down to one you haven't <UNK> it down but you have in fact figured out what it is the monster is standard 50's sci fi fair better than say the <UNK> in the beginning of the end acting is sub par and the heroine is the most unattractive in fact in some shots she does look like a guy in drag you see plenty of fighter plane stock footage and other things but you won't see much at all of the deadly <UNK>
<START> the <UNK> squad isn't a movie it's a void that's the most fascinating thing about it and the thing that kept me watching  i'd never seen a film that offered absolutely nothing before it's a film without any reason to exist whatsoever seemingly <UNK> designed to appeal to no one as if made purely as a <UNK> <UNK> to someone the studio really dislike there is no plot there is no characterisation there are no set piece action scenes there aren't even any scenes as such just a progression of increasingly empty shots projected at 24 frames per second i'm not talking about empty as in dumb summer blockbuster but empty as in we haven't got the pages yet so just point the camera at something and stop when you've got 90 minutes worth it makes you appreciate the <UNK> of charlie's angels and s w a t that much more what it does offer is far too much of <UNK> <UNK> at his most <UNK> <UNK> doing his bastard son of a thousand morons <UNK> marlon brando method acting routine michael <UNK> dancing with omar <UNK> <UNK> no that's it oh <UNK> danes has a nice smile in one shot and dennis <UNK> has the sense to get killed off early genuinely the most utterly pointless film ever made it's like without the jokes but you know for kids
<START> after watching this for 15 minutes i knew how it would end its a cliché film with a stupid setup i'm a big fan of thief films but this one does not deliver anything new smart or special it's about an <UNK> heist gone bad because hot head bad guy shots a bum and of course do <UNK> bad guy goes on a moral trip the reason why it's stupid and not believable is when you've already gone so far to kill a bum why not just kill the one guy that stands between you and <UNK> million they got 45 minutes to <UNK> the money and stage a robbery nobody in there right mind would hesitate to shoot mr do <UNK> and in this case he is a guy they known for a few days all and all i was <UNK> to fast <UNK> from the middle of it but i it out and boy do i regret it
<START> spoiler alert br br this movie will spoil your afternoon or wee small hours of the morning viewing <UNK> br br i like marc singer he has portrayed good characters in the roles i have seen until this movie br br what starts as a promising movie soon disappears up itself with the disastrous <UNK> background and the extreme close up on the person about to die br br then it gets worse br br a lot worse br br to describe it as hammy acting would insult pigs this movie goes to the bottom of the ham barrel and <UNK> the acting off there br br apart from marc <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it up mike <UNK> and <UNK> around the scenery looking as if he is afraid he might fall on the rocks and his wide eyed bad guy just makes him look like a moron he isn't menacing at all br br george looks like a deer caught in the <UNK> he claims to have been threatened by the other two but his character would have been threatened by a <UNK> offering him paper or plastic br br this is really a vehicle for nicole <UNK> as an independent woman getting her life back despite <UNK> the wrong sort of man she was <UNK> br br this is not a remake but this is remarkably similar to cliffhanger seasoned guide loses someone in a fall conscience <UNK> to help out someone else a missing treasure worth <UNK> of money and a gang of do wells who exploit the guide except cliffhanger was a great vehicle for stallone and <UNK> i must admit <UNK> stole the show br br even the unintentional comedy was poor there were times when i wasn't sure if they were using a rubber faced model as a stand in for singer as he tried in vain to storm the weather station no pun intended <UNK> his face to the door post and his clumsy manner in general did nothing to help his character br br avoid br br no seriously avoid it save <UNK> minutes of your life and do something else more <UNK> like watching paint dry or grass grow or just close your eyes and examine the backs of your <UNK> for 90 minutes
<START> if you liked <UNK> network you'll probably like this black comedy as well as it's another brilliant script a wonderful satire on big city <UNK> and a perfect vehicle for <UNK> c scott he plays a burned out chief of medicine on the most chaotic day he or his hospital have ever seen his personal crisis is coming to a head and his <UNK> falling down around him as local residents demonstrate against the hospital and patients and doctors are dying at an <UNK> rate thanks to a <UNK> inspired and murderous <UNK> the latter who <UNK> declares himself the fool for christ of wrath of the <UNK> and angel of the <UNK> pit <UNK> doctors on the head lethal <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> identities causing <UNK> and <UNK> to be performed on the wrong persons br br this film makes you uncomfortable as deadly mistakes like these do happen hopefully not so many not so often and not in one place and at the same time makes you laugh at the priceless character <UNK> one is richard l a law as dr a sort of celebrity surgeon who spends far more time worrying about his <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> stock than about his patients who suffer <UNK> from his vast indifference and neglect there's diana <UNK> as free spirited hippie ish barbara <UNK> who <UNK> the <UNK> chief of medicine scott and tries to get him to run away with her then there's the <UNK> murderer who happens to be <UNK> father and who functions well enough back at the indian <UNK> where he lives with his daughter and even runs a clinic but who's pushed to madness merely by being placed back in civilization the strongest portrait by far is scott's dr who <UNK> his soul as former boy genius failed father and husband brilliant doctor and responsible <UNK> who constantly dreams of suicide but must bear up under the demands of his job scott is exceptional in this demanding role br br until the final scenes one doesn't know if will leave the hospital behind for <UNK> indian <UNK> and a <UNK> simpler life whether her murderous father will be caught or whether the <UNK> <UNK> locals will take over and bring the hospital to its knees watching the crazed killer at work one suspects is telling us our lunatic society makes him do these things as we're told he's a different person away from cities and people br br as my own father was the chief <UNK> of a number of large <UNK> over the years i had some idea of the demands of his job and the huge responsibility he <UNK> this story makes that responsibility the <UNK> on which scott's crisis turns this is both a funny and scary film with the actors up to the considerable demands of script it's also a film i get more out of each time i watch it
<START> i deliberately did not read any reviews of this movie on imdb before i watched it because i really wanted to see it and make up my own mind i have been a big fan of <UNK> in the past i think we can all agree he has made some great movies but lately he seems to have been overcome by his own <UNK> and disappeared up his own this movie proves that it consists of few scenes of the <UNK> at work it consists instead mostly of long tedious boring stretches of conversation between people that after a while you realise you just do not give a stuff about it's <UNK> and lacks any of the great <UNK> dialogue that <UNK> has been responsible for in the past the entire movie is <UNK> there is no tension what is going to happen in every scene is <UNK> so clearly in advance that by the time it happens you just don't care honestly folks don't believe the hype this is a very boring movie and you will be missing nothing if you don't see it
<START> i was hoping to like this movie to settle in for an evening of goofy fun i like judy davis and juliette lewis and the premise seemed off the wall enough to be entertaining br br unfortunately i found myself <UNK> over and over again judy davis gave a fine performance but had very little to work with juliette lewis was fabulous as expected but had very little to do the plot was full of twists that were just plain silly and as so often happens in movies of this type nobody acted the way a real human being would act and personally i thought <UNK> gay <UNK> was totally miscast br br the movie also seemed to shift about <UNK> from a black comedy with touches of farce to a total farce with touches of black comedy one reviewer here notes that other reviews seem to want this movie to be something different and therefore <UNK> it all i can say is that i would have settled for the movie being something and sticking with it this one feels like the director had some <UNK> ideas but wasn't able to pull them all off i give it a 4 out of 10
<START> this movie has remained in my mind for years as one of the best made for tv movie mysteries i've ever seen the acting is superb i've seen it twice and still am puzzled at some parts i'd love to have a copy so i can play certain parts over and over again i am interested in buying a copy of this movie but cannot find it anywhere i am wondering if if anyone has any <UNK> how to find it i've tried e bay amazon com internet <UNK> and am completely frustrated i've not seen it on turner classic movies nor on american movie classics and i have even put out <UNK> in our community asking if anyone has a copy
<START> without anything to walk away with this movie starts with scenes in china with the finding of a <UNK> while this is not a new concept i wasn't going to give up right there then there is a flash forward to <UNK> the man's wife and <UNK> child are fed up with the father who has neglected them while this did not seem <UNK> accurate and the movie made no move to develop these characters or the purpose for the adopted father's devotion i pressed on br br next we're in <UNK> where we are <UNK> by poorly constructed <UNK> interaction and terribly low budget fill in the blank acting camera work lighting br br i won't give away any more of the plot because i suppose the synopsis is accurate the movie is meant to show how a <UNK> girl who though she seems to <UNK> have the compassion and interest to help others when she immediately asks her teacher about the trip to china is spoiled and <UNK> finds herself as being a <UNK> and <UNK> of both body and spirit br br lame lame lame lame br br now i admittedly am a harsh critic so maybe take one of those away and you'll be on the mark
<START> low budget horror about an evil force hard to believe in this day and age but way back when this stuff actually used to get theatrical release these days this sort of thing would either go direct to video or straight to cable shouldn't be too hard to avoid this one who's ever heard of it
<START> frantic somewhat mean spirited <UNK> humor <UNK> in this city boy turned wannabe farmer tale it is not outrageous enough to appeal to the will ferrell crowd and not interesting enough to carry the feature length the most i can praise son in law would be to say that for the most part it avoids toilet humor the main problem is that all of the characters lack warmth and <UNK> shore is so <UNK> that he is a most unlikable hero there are a few amusing bits involving farm animals and that's about it the story what there is is so simplistic and predictable it makes jury duty seem like gone with the wind <UNK>
<START> with <UNK> the german film producers have tried to make something totally new usually there just drama or comedy movies in the horror genre is or was totally new at that time br br the story's also new and shocking <UNK> <UNK> plays her role brilliant and i bet you won't find out who's the murderer it's possible but difficult a really great movie with a lot of talented actors
<START> travolta and thurman deserved a better movie this one is very secondary in all aspects not a single fresh idea but the biggest problem is this film's ridiculous philosophy a gang of black <UNK> after all their criminal activities and even killing people are becoming almost positive mickey mouse like heroes performing on stage and giving away awards at the ceremony perhaps this matches the real life but showing it as a quite normal happy ending is beyond my imagination what's wrong with shooting a couple of bad if they are not politically correct the show must go on that makes me think that hollywood writers have a big problem with <UNK> good and evil even if the genre supposed to be a black comedy
<START> how is this a documentary much more like a walking ghost tour one might take in any given southern city quotes were <UNK> dropped throughout without the first effort at <UNK> the source george <UNK> was the most identified br br documents were referred to without ever being produced in any form flat out <UNK> shots depicting period film stock were spliced aside historical film <UNK> with no <UNK> from reality and self promotion film <UNK> which were entirely unrealistic and improbable for the time at hand were dropped in as if trying to ape blair witch hoping to drum up a <UNK> house on what would otherwise simply be dead real estate br br is this not in some way a great <UNK> to actual victims of <UNK> a dance on their collective graves for the sake of <UNK> the line between actual footage and <UNK> self service is so thin the of doubt so played down the scientific boundaries so blatantly ignored how could this possibly be listed in my <UNK> as documentary br br it's a vacation <UNK> and at that it fully succeeds br br hell i'd visit the joint if i could locate it on <UNK> earth not scary said a previous poster not too serious either says i fascinating story flimsy film making
<START> this movie is by far one of the worst b movies i have ever seen there are no plot twists at all though the acting is decent the storyline is terrible there are also many mistakes in the movie and it was <UNK> to watch for any of you who like horror movies slasher movies or even b movies i don't recommend this to anyone at all most of the movie is focused on pointless killing in ways that aren't even worth discussing this movie could very well be compared to a crappy remake of <UNK> <UNK> which too wasn't that great of a movie for anyone who wishes to spend a day at home watching poorly made movies this one takes the cake
<START> there's something about a movie that features female <UNK> that gets me in front of the screen every time br br i've seen <UNK> iron ii <UNK> iron eagle iii <UNK> <UNK> and even the tv movie getting physical which featured some big names in the sport they were tolerable in their own ways mostly because they featured rachel br br then i went and watched nemesis iii prey harder on the sole basis that it featured such <UNK> as sue price debbie sharon <UNK> and ursula love the ladies always will but after this i'm kinda glad i missed the first two nemesis flicks br br well the first one anyway most of the footage here is lifted <UNK> and kicking and screaming i would guess from nemesis ii actually that one looked <UNK> entertaining from the evidence <UNK> here br br but even though price and company <UNK> and pose they don't get much of a chance to do anything else like say act in fact this whole film is an exercise get it ha ha in <UNK> story telling ambiguous characters and open ended movie making in terms of filming as well as the story line br br nothing makes much sense but even if it did there would still be issues such as making such small parts for such larger than life women as these what a crime br br of course it was written and directed by albert <UNK> so what did you expect <UNK> br br one star only in consideration for all the hard work that price <UNK> and obviously put into their bodies not the craft work done within the movie itself br br thanks ladies
<START> so if a guy meets you and he says 'i want you to look at my <UNK> ' don't be <UNK> maybe he wants you to look at the film he made about how his house was to be built yes that's the only thing what happens in this movie it's like the worst <UNK> <UNK> i ever saw it's like filming the inside of your toilet before you <UNK> it in fact it's less interesting to look at than that br br but if you do watch <UNK> <UNK> be warned that he put a lot of background noise in it too i mean really it's as if the building is being attacked by space mutants from hell or something in the meanwhile the building in progress is growing up as an <UNK> can do too in almost 20 minutes what an accomplishment br br so if someone does ask you to watch his <UNK> be sure he wants to <UNK> it all
<START> i picked up this dvd for 4 99 they had put <UNK> cover art on the package along with a plot summary that had nothing to do with the movie the acting is terrible and the writing is worse the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder i paid too much
<START> i just saw this movie and it turns out to be pretty lame just as mentioned by other user reviews and the one thing that bothered me the most was the southern accent some of the characters had it took place in <UNK> not the south as mentioned from other reviews ed wasn't a big dude so why did the guy that plays jason and <UNK> portray him br br i fast <UNK> through most of it being that there are many slow parts br br hopefully someone will do their <UNK> on ed and the town and make a more accurate movie
<START> yesterday was one of those days we decided to go to the movies we picked van more or less at random but we were interested to see the state of current dutch filmmaking br br the film is based on a book by ronald and i must confess straight away that he is not exactly one of my favorites the film features actors that are best known in the <UNK> for their appearances in soap operas and or afternoon talk shows at least one of them has done some fairly decent stuff after leaving the soap world so we decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt br br and what a mistake that was this movie fails on all <UNK> bad acting the best performance is actually by a guinea pig which very convincingly pretends to be dead flat uninteresting story with unexplained and uninteresting <UNK> why france why tell the story to a girl from <UNK> mistakes black people dont have to use <UNK> as far as i know and <UNK> systems in the <UNK> do not produce clouds of steam like in new york even if this looks great on film people do not wear t shirts outside on new years eve in northern europe there's one funny moment which involves two little dogs and that's it br br so that's what i think but more importantly it seemed that none of the people leaving the movie theater afterwards had enjoyed it i <UNK> one of them saying that he was extremely disappointed because he liked the book so much i did not read the book but my advice would have to be read the book don't see the film
<START> when i was in <UNK> grade me and my buddy were up late at his house and were flipping around cable and started watching this movie we watched it because it looked kind of funny and because it had boobs but then the ending came and we just sat there completely speechless i think after a minute of watching the credits roll he just sort of <UNK> oh dude it goes from dumb 80's teen sex comedy to <UNK> realism so quickly that it catches you off guard i have been trying to rent this movie for years and have not been able to find it and nobody has ever seen it except for me and my friend so it seems but now it is available i highly suggest renting it and <UNK> yourself
<START> spoilers ahead br br 2001 a space odyssey is without a doubt the most challenging and successful film by the late stanley kubrick this is not a film that you watch in order to be entertained or amused instead it provides you with a <UNK> of food for thought images that <UNK> in the <UNK> eye long after the movie itself is over it is a film that you could <UNK> on br br the film intentionally offers us more questions then it can answer it is made to puzzle and but leaves the viewer nevertheless with a sense of awe and <UNK> that is allowing that he has engaged himself in the process of viewing it enjoyment of this film requires some effort on the viewers part the questions that it does pose are large and ominous concerning the <UNK> and destiny of the human race it's ultimate place in the <UNK> design and the existence or lack of some creative intelligence behind the structure of the universe itself br br the first of the films four gives us a distinct view of the species past we see our distant <UNK> half ape half human in a state of near <UNK> the climate has destroyed most of the plant life and the <UNK> <UNK> are near <UNK> an extra object a perfectly smooth and <UNK> black <UNK> appears and the animals are simultaneously inspired by it's presence to tool making and violence they are transformed overnight into and when two <UNK> encounter each other near a water source the tribe that has developed tool making capacity as well as <UNK> destroys the <UNK> tribe the new chief of the winning tribe <UNK> by the first <UNK> of technology <UNK> throws the bone that he used as a weapon in the air we see the bone transformed into a floating satellite which contains nuclear weapons we soon learn that the world is torn apart by nuclear paranoia the characteristics inspired by the appearance that once helped us to survive now <UNK> our very existence br br once again humanity is in crisis once again the <UNK> presence represented by the black <UNK> will step in to aid humanity in the next step in it's development on an exploration of the moon a <UNK> identical to the earlier one we have seen is discovered the <UNK> of the world normally mortal enemies have come together in secret to discuss the <UNK> a mission is arranged the <UNK> has been engaged in some kind of radio communication with <UNK> a few men will travel to the destination of the <UNK> most of them will for most of the time be kept in a state of suspended animation the pilot of the <UNK> will be hal a super computer who has been <UNK> to imitate all of the traits of human beings br br the film has many outstanding sequences as usual for kubrick the use of classical music is outstanding most memorable are blue <UNK> and also <UNK> particularly appropriate given the film's theme of <UNK> ordinary consciousness the cinematography is particularly excellent as well after a single viewing the film's final 30 minutes will haunt you for the rest of your life br br the character of hal is the most important from the view of the film's central <UNK> in imitating all the characteristics of human beings he comes to have their negative traits as well the paranoia he develops which almost leads to the s ruin is an exact mirror of the paranoia that has allowed the political situation back on earth to reach a point of desperate crisis the film suggests that these are the traits that we must leave behind if we are to proceed to the next phase in our evolution br br the architecture of the film is also meaningful the designs of many of the <UNK> are intended to suggest <UNK> organs and the process of birth and <UNK> the central <UNK> of the movie the ending of 2001 is the most spectacular and <UNK> ever filmed br br this movie takes a view of life similar to that presented in the poetry of william butler <UNK> and james <UNK> novel wake it <UNK> a pattern to history and human evolution that is yet <UNK> repeating the same events at large <UNK> yet with the human race as developing according to the will of a being with a larger purpose in mind though we never learn what this purpose is the film <UNK> us that the human race is not meant for failure it's destiny is grand beyond it's capacity to imagine it continues to <UNK> me that in spite of this film many people continue to regard kubrick as a <UNK> br br this is a religious film not in the conventional sense of <UNK> to any specific <UNK> but because of it's of wonder at the vast <UNK> of existence and it's involvement with the deepest and most vital questions of purpose and truth br br in the hands of any other director this would all be perhaps a little too much hollywood's view of life is too <UNK> usually to <UNK> the <UNK> and intensity of a vision such as this one but kubrick was a <UNK> he directs with utter confidence not only that he can handle material of this kind but that he is the only one to do it the process of making this film used all of his creative resources the writing <UNK> with arthur c clarke is the most <UNK> in cinematic history kubrick had to <UNK> some of the special effects that were used in the movie's astounding climax the resources to bring his vision to life did not exist at the time so he brought them into existence br br 2001 is a absolutely unique movie experience those who miss out on it do so at the <UNK> of their own intellectual and imaginative <UNK>
<START> who wrote the script for this movie the staff at disney studios this is the most adaptation of any story ever i wanted to laugh at a few scenes and cry at others and that was only because of how pitiful it was i'll have to hand it credit it did have a few funny scenes but i could've spent better time with my evening very seldom do i turn off a movie after only a quarter of the way through
<START> why did they have to make such a dreadful adaptation the whole complete jane austin series as a part of masterpiece classics looks like a huge disappointment characters are totally miscast and there's no chemistry on the screen the whole thing feels rather rushed the 1999 movie release based on the same novel seems like a masterpiece compared to this i really want to forget it i'm really happy though that pride and prejudice won't be re made as part of this project and we will see the iconic and magnificent colin <UNK> and jennifer <UNK> as protagonists if you <UNK> this <UNK> park production consider yourself lucky
<START> i was a junior in high school when flesh hit the big screens but had the good fortune to see it at midnight movie houses in nyc just two years later br br flesh is the first part of a so called trilogy of films featuring joe as an object of desire it bears the <UNK> name but is more the work of paul <UNK> essentially the story concerns itself with the exploits surrounding one day in the life of a street wise male hustler played by joe joe is young beautiful and a bit naive but he manages to bring home the bacon to his wife for reasons which should not be explained to appreciate the film fully br br of special note to film buffs is that this film along with the remaining two of the trilogy had no script per se <UNK> <UNK> were given simply a premise and the words and actions which the viewer sees are quite natural even at times ridiculous or non <UNK> but all in all it works rolling stone noted in its review that the film was better than midnight cowboy a film of the same year more polished by hollywood an academy award winner for best film with big name talent i equally admire the film but flesh being improvised was somehow more gut wrenching and realistic without the need for complex sub plots and any cause de <UNK> or for that matter any cause at all br br the film <UNK> more than 3 million dollars and was an absolute sensation particularly in the german market which ironically thought they were given a <UNK> version of the film because of the post editing see note below br br curiously the film is very much cut and <UNK> with pops <UNK> flashes and dialogue literally cut off mid sentence it is almost as if <UNK> <UNK> are stating a simple truth that it is a day in the life of a superstar snippets for your <UNK> <UNK> far better than earlier <UNK> works of 8 hours of sleeping and the statue of liberty as a 20 hour movie br br flesh in my opinion is the first of the <UNK> films that actually is <UNK> given a wide <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> first legitimate response to the hollywood phenomenon of stardom br br as the first of a trilogy it portrays a young <UNK> male icon naive sought after <UNK> to <UNK> to please his family subsequent films would show the same character with a <UNK> set of values see trash and heat
<START> look this is a low budget horror film that suffers from all of the problems that go with low budget movies but you must see this just to watch lisa <UNK> as julie she is <UNK> hot and a great little actress to boot these types of horror movies often <UNK> a rare gem and the power gave us lisa <UNK> nothing i enjoy more than sitting down in my studio apartment with a coke and putting in this film my friends bob bill and dennis agree lisa is not only brilliant she is a <UNK> the movie itself often <UNK> along and the rest of the actors are not very helpful in that regard but as soon as lisa hits the screen things really start <UNK> the others are clearly not in her league this is not the exorcist but as i said if you want to see a fun little movie with a hot little actress this is the one to see
<START> a female ex cop who was <UNK> out of the force for <UNK> and who could probably beat chuck norris in a fight hires herself out as a private bodyguard her first client is a worthless playboy type it takes half the movie for her to get kicked off the force in the first place lots of great fight choreography but the plot is strictly by the numbers and the acting is as wooden as the dialogue give this one a miss
<START> after watching <UNK> i was a little disappointed by the rest of <UNK> work some of it is good but it never approaches the level of humour and originality that <UNK> had this one does it is nothing like <UNK> in plot or style but the same level of quality is there br br the acting is good with <UNK> ho song ok bin kim and ha <UNK> shin delivering excellent performances kim in particular manages to <UNK> from the creepy horror scenes to the surreal comedy without the slightest <UNK> br br the plot is strange with lots of twists and turns and takes a big <UNK> at the vampire clichés br br the directing is spot on with tons of pace and humour throughout and some of the most memorable scenes i have ever seen it does <UNK> what is probably the <UNK> love scene you will ever see br br this is just a great film
<START> the movie is more of a <UNK> of corruption in the whole american system the of those who vote who do not matter is so proved in the machines that end of voting a comedian to the <UNK> office politicians are such a joke that we almost need a comic to represent us as we have been laughed at for years around the world have become a way of life for americans and will be the only thing left after he leaves office none to soon oddly the only person of honesty is someone not even elected to the position and tells the truth in the end the story is very subtle and if you go to it for laughs it ain't happening leaves a lot for thought overall i enjoyed it
<START> i have to admit i picked this movie just for the cast and while sutherland <UNK> and <UNK> were as usual great performers the rest of the movie was such a let down it feels like it was put together by a team of <UNK> with low level scripts that is scripts lacking any depth awful photography and editing and hilariously lousy score i can't believe i was able to watch this seemingly long movie until the end the sad thing is this could have actually been a great political thriller given the interesting plot all the potential was there to make it a hit that is two main ingredients are there a great story of national <UNK> and a great core cast even though many other actors are pretty much soap opera quality but maybe i'm missing something until then it's still not worth more than a 3 in my opinion
<START> a young girl becomes a war time <UNK> pen pal and when he visits at <UNK> end expecting someone a bit more available comic complications ensue all ultimately works out well naturally but not before everyone involved has thoroughly <UNK> the scenery errol <UNK> dead on impression of <UNK> bogart from casablanca is a highlight as are various send ups of his own <UNK> image the jumping scene in the kitchen with forrest tucker is a riot it is tucker though who the movie under his arm <UNK> his head and <UNK> over the goal line he demonstrates the comic flair more fully developed twenty years later in f <UNK> and <UNK> a <UNK> and energy that flynn repeatedly plays off to raise his own performance <UNK> parker does a fine job as the woman being pursued and little <UNK> brady charms as <UNK> actual pen pal friend a fine lightweight coming home comedy in a <UNK> setting that children and <UNK> of all ages should find entertaining
<START> sorry after watching the credits i thought this would at least be a decent homage to <UNK> sf actors br br boy was i wrong br br the direction and story telling in this <UNK> are terrible i have never been so insulted by a production br br i have great respect and love for many of the actors in this film but have to say they were <UNK> br br if you haven't seen this <UNK> yet do yourself a favor and stay away these are not only two hours you won't get back but they will also ruin your respect for some actors you may once have enjoyed
<START> if you watch the documentary extra you'll note that the director is totally inexperienced and was actually a co worker bud of quentin in a video store put two and two together and you realise quentin is doing a favour for his old bud despite the bud being rather talentless was that harsh well see this film and you'll realise it isn't too slow in the beginning too nonsensical in the middle and too slow to end that about sums it up eric <UNK> <UNK> were the only two showing some charisma and actually put in an ok performance but the rest was real bad one instance of plot stupidity was when lead <UNK> accidentally leaves his mask off during the raid so what happens well the other robbers decide they may as well remove theirs too what great thinking the violence was relentless and insane but not in a cool way rather in a <UNK> way i wondered if this was meant to be a comedy more fool tarantino for having his good name connected to this garbage more fool me for watching it
<START> i went to this film full of hope with so many capable and humorous actors headed up by sir ben i thought this is going to be a little treat br br oh how i felt like <UNK> my eyes out as the credits rolled that i had wasted of my life this film that was clearly <UNK> there are some real problems with this film and it will probably be easier to list them 1 no jokes i am not particularly hard to please <UNK> high or low brow but there really is not one laugh in this film br br 2 sir ben <UNK> through every single line whether he is supposed to be drunk or not 3 there is no effort to to begin let alone develop the relationship between the love interests in this 2 people <UNK> into each other randomly in the street would instantly have more <UNK> br br 4 all the acting talent that is assembled is completely wasted don't be fooled into watching this because of the names br br 5 for a cold ass hit man he <UNK> out more people in gandhi than this <UNK> waste of time a by the way <UNK> <UNK> look really creepy i was hoping that this was a slow <UNK> but in the end the only thing that could <UNK> any life and justice into this is frank pulling out his 9 and <UNK> the whole cast starting with tea and ending with himself sorry it was that bad
<START> now this is a bad movie if i've ever seen one in one of film's greatest years 1999 detroit rock city <UNK> with runaway bride and wild wild west for the bottom spot in a barrel of <UNK> the plot is masterful four <UNK> high school youngsters finally have their chance at seeing the hard rock <UNK> of kiss third year in a row so when their tickets are by an ultra religious chain smoking mom the pals <UNK> themselves in getting to detroit and i'm sure you can figure out the rest br br well not exactly the movie does go to extreme <UNK> in explaining how the four band members no not gene paul ace and peter go about getting these tickets losing your virginity in a <UNK> saving a <UNK> out bimbo and your mom's <UNK> from the <UNK> steve <UNK> nonetheless <UNK> a robbery in the midst of <UNK> one for a 12 year <UNK> debt and of course <UNK> down to your bare <UNK> for <UNK> ron jeremy after <UNK> a full <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> sounds funny doesn't it perhaps detroit rock city does have a point with all this <UNK> in how extreme sometimes these fans can go and we do understand this movie is a comedy it is supposed to be filled with slapstick but does detroit rock city aim to the proper audience it is rated r meaning the only way <UNK> <UNK> the audience as i see it to which many will eventually <UNK> this one a classic will <UNK> is through illegal terms br br detroit rock city also fails at giving itself the late 1970's touch the <UNK> <UNK> quality is way too clear and way too bright missing the necessary flair from films like this is spinal tap and sid nancy this would've allowed audiences to feel more at <UNK> with the times simply <UNK> kids into pre 90's <UNK> wear and <UNK> others into disco does not do the trick environment does mean something you know i doubt detroit looked this glamorous in <UNK> if there's anything positive coming from this movie it's the kick ass soundtrack of hard late 70 to early 80's rock van <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> you name it it's all here of course we can't forget kiss the band <UNK> subjected throughout br br what the film <UNK> fails to manage are questions concerning why the knights of service it's really just kiss were so <UNK> upon by <UNK> around the nation sure the loud rock and <UNK> makeup might be a part of that for youth to explore themselves and have a good time might be fair reasons as well but what is kiss saying in the music we hear throughout the film towards this highly rebellious group what <UNK> these <UNK> of rock ing and roll ing all night and <UNK> from the rest of the music most likely these questions will remain in a music communication class and not in the films that should answer them simply because it is kiss and they rock and we must do everything in our god forgiven power to see them br br 1 5 5 stars
<START> most <UNK> movie i've ever seen extremely boring i feel like i've seen a hundred movies with the same storyline as this one acting is ok at best there's no action really and there is definitely no thrills capable actors with terrible script i think it could have been written better by a <UNK> <UNK> felt like more of a chore to watch because i was hoping that there would be something in this movie that was going to set it apart from all the other garbage but this fit right in on the heap the whole movie i was waiting for something good to happen but it never came i never rate movies and i never review movies but this movie was so bad that i had to <UNK> in here and post a review to try and save a few poor souls from wasting their time and or money with this movie i <UNK> it and wish i never even wasted the hard drive space if i spent 10 bucks to see this in theaters i would kill myself
<START> surely this film was <UNK> up by the studio perhaps not but i feel there were serious flaws in the storytelling that if not attributed to the editing process could only be caused by <UNK> bad criminal indeed writing and directing br br i understand the effect burton wished to achieve with the <UNK> acting similar to the gothic fairytale atmosphere of edward <UNK> but here unfortunately it falls flat and achieves no mythical depth of <UNK> but only the offensive tripe of <UNK> ie bad acting and shallow characterisation even for a fairytale br br finally not that scary indeed only mildly amusing in its attempts the use of dialogue as a vehicle for plot background was clumsy and unnecessary the mystery of who is the <UNK> <UNK> would suffice no need for the myth about a german <UNK> although christopher walken did cut a dashing figure but not that menacing seeing the head makes him seem far <UNK> that a decapitated <UNK> nine foot tall spirit as in the original legend br br no real rhythm or universal tone was ever established and not a classic in <UNK> stilted and <UNK> as my <UNK> shot
<START> just saw this film the other day at the santa <UNK> film festival i was delighted by its honesty and humor it was the most thought provoking movie i've seen in a very long time i just can't get it off of my mind for some reason it may not be for everyone because it makes you think i don't know if people like to think in movies so much anymore which is a shame the actors who play the are quite a find i couldn't imagine playing these complicated people with such <UNK> though i thought a couple of the supporting characters were not as good as the i can totally forgive it because this is an important movie in my opinion i didn't expect to like it so much but as i've thought about it for a few days it's proving to be a very relevant piece of entertainment
<START> having been a marine i can tell you that the d i is as accurate a portrayal to date depicting marine <UNK> boot camp and how boys are turned into men jack <UNK> is excellent as sgt jim moore a tough but fair <UNK> <UNK> in paris island north <UNK> the film centers on one <UNK> who doesn't seem to get with the program a more recent film full metal jacket also shows life in basic training and is well worth viewing
<START> all right let's be realistic about this nobody goes into a movie produced by wwe films whose owner has challenged god to a wrestling match directed by a former porn director the man gave the world the between the <UNK> trilogy starring a wrestler named kane and expects a little slice of art on a golden <UNK> if you do then you probably need to find something other than watching movies to <UNK> your time br br so what exactly are we to expect from a movie like this well here's what i was looking forward to br br 1 bad acting 2 a fairly non existent clichéd storyline 3 kane walking around with a sour face that <UNK> his <UNK> just found the <UNK> <UNK> he misplaced a month ago 4 tons and tons of gore br br well if you're hungry for some so bad it's funny entertainment then this might satisfy your <UNK> because it delivers on all counts br br obviously movies like this are best seen for free but if you do choose to sacrifice box office bucks then have some fun and make a game out of it the filmmakers are nice enough to introduce us to each of the annoying <UNK> by flashing their names and legal <UNK> on the screen this makes it easier for you to write down which ones you want to see killed and in what order you and your friends can see whose <UNK> are most accurate br br i also suggest that you and your pals write down every single moment of stupidity and <UNK> that you can find <UNK> them up at the end and see who comes up with the most i think my grand total was <UNK> can you beat that i personally want to know how after 35 years and a fire does this abandoned hotel still have electricity running water and a working elevator br br i know i know the filmmakers are assuming that if you pay to see this then you obviously don't put much thought into what you spend your money on and therefore likely won't put much thought into how silly the movie is but that doesn't mean we can't point it out and laugh at it br br i also like how the city wants to turn this huge hotel which would be condemned and recommended for <UNK> by any sensible inspector into a homeless shelter and they think the best way to get it <UNK> up is to give eight <UNK> a few <UNK> and <UNK> uh huh br br i think you pretty much know what to expect but i feel the need to provide you with a couple of <UNK> first if you hate crowd interaction no matter the movie then you might want to stay away the people in the audience acted like they were at an actual wrestling show shouts of kill him kane and i hope you die first and <UNK> <UNK> through the theater <UNK> what i hope is not the best of what america has to offer i usually don't appreciate such audience interaction but for a like this i thought the commentary added to the entertainment value however i can see how others could be annoyed by it br br second and this shouldn't even warrant explanation the film doesn't shy away from the gore if watching a big ugly dude rip <UNK> right out of their <UNK> doesn't scream fun night at the movies for ya then you know good and well to save your <UNK> br br i must say that i was a little surprised by the extreme lack of dialogue on <UNK> part i wasn't expecting him to put on an acting clinic but i was hoping he'd have some cute little <UNK> like say <UNK> his character's last name is <UNK> right before he killed a victim instead he <UNK> four words in the entire film <UNK> and i see it but hey he delivered them <UNK> br br if i were a bad guy in a movie then my <UNK> would be something like place your <UNK> or all <UNK> are off br br it'd rule and you know it we need a new genre term for bad horror films like see no evil that <UNK> so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to label them comedic feel free to send me your <UNK> for now we'll just call 'em
<START> wayne <UNK> direction may be the <UNK> which made this film much more impressive to me than <UNK> of beverly hills which covers remarkably similar ground the interplay between susan sarandon and natalie portman is riveting real chemistry there this film succeeded in bringing me inside the dysfunctional life of these two women without dragging me down into depressed frustration susan <UNK> character <UNK> at all the nerves which a <UNK> parent is capable of touching in an insecure adolescent she amazingly manages to do this without coming across as insane or intentionally sadistic and natalie portman <UNK> each attack on her character's ego with the <UNK> grace of an intelligent <UNK> child <UNK> by the smug cynicism of the natasha character in <UNK> of beverly hills <UNK> character is an adolescent with dignity under stress an unusual creature in modern films the film reaches a very satisfying resolution without trying too hard i highly recommend this film to the viewer who wants to be challenged and entertained
<START> i don't understand what the big hype was about this film all the horror sites were saying that this movie had all the <UNK> of an <UNK> american <UNK> flick that it would satisfy your needs even though this was similar to an old american slasher flick my needs were still not satisfied br br my big problem with this movie is that we are now in the <UNK> not the 1980's 1980's horror is the past and should stay in the past horror movies have changed so much that older movies now look cheesy and unrealistic even though they are fun to watch they don't offer the same realistic blood <UNK> gore that the recent films offer br br <UNK> is cheesy unrealistic and down right awful if we wanted to watch an old american slasher flick i can just go back to the friday the 13th series nightmare on elm street series or the halloween series i must admit the movie is better than some of the horror movies being released but it is among the worst the jokes are not funny and the actors are horrible br br i would personally stay away from this movie and never look back
<START> a talented high school <UNK> senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all star high school football game when he meets and falls for an attractive local girl she helps him realize he has a shot at a <UNK> <UNK> if he plays well br br all too often these dramas fall into formulaic traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teen full matt certainly fits this profile but below the surface is a much more unique individual than we usually see in this genre matt is the center of the action and he is a realistic teenager both over confident and vulnerable optimistic and cynical by turns influenced by amy matt grows into a man of character and heart he in turn forms friendships with his <UNK> which influences his growth as an <UNK> and as a team player br br full ride has all the elements we love to see in a movie great acting admirable characters exciting sports scenes poignant drama and a love story still while one may have seen these elements in other films full ride is <UNK> by performances that are sincere and occasionally even moving perhaps what's most impressive about full ride is its sense of reality although the author of the previous comment would seem to disagree clearly a disgruntled student who for quite obvious reasons received a poor grade in his film class director mark grounds the film in a believable situation and location and does a great job of getting down to the <UNK> of what life is like in a small town these characters are real people <UNK> in realistic situations which often create the most compelling entertainment on one level it is a love story on another it is a character study and yet another it is a simple football film all of these ideas come together to form a cohesive vehicle
<START> the films of the science fiction channel sci fi channel have become <UNK> predictable the seem low on budget originality and plot br br in this creation the government is out to get a bunch of and <UNK> a poor soul by <UNK> means to help there is plenty of over worked recycled twists on evil government organization theme black <UNK> shadows short meaningless lines make these one dimensional cartoons br br daniel kim stands out as a good actor in a small role he brings a bit of the style of his angel character to the role it is hard to miss the link that his <UNK> character was a <UNK> and this is a film on was this a sci fi casting move to try and draw fans from the other show who knows thankfully he is a decent actor and a pleasure to watch br br the movie is definitely low budget it reflects the sci fi channels current model of canadian location few well known characters few effects and woefully terrible plot and character development one would think they believe science fiction fans will view anything labeled scifi br br if you want a good <UNK> movie check out the fury 1978
<START> this movie is bad really bad so bad it made me want to shoot myself in the <UNK> i hated this movie first off the plot went absolutely nowhere and anything shocking about this movie was seen in the 30 second <UNK> trailer secondly anyone who saw the original in 1979 knows that it was a bad movie too and completely <UNK> of a remake by far the best part of the movie is the house it takes place in which is not saying much for the actual movie there were parts in the movie when the music gets very suspenseful and you're positive someone is around the corner and it turns out to be the maid or the cat but when someone actually is around the corner it is impossible to be even <UNK> because you've been expecting it all movie so save yourself the money save yourself the time save yourself the headache and just watch the trailer there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie not in the theater not on dvd not on tv never
<START> what to say about this movie a married couple has more then just each other after playing around for some time things gets more serious a difficult choice has to be made continue the old situation or start all over by following the heart guess what happens at the end br br this movie seems to be very low budget but a good story don't have to be expensive it looks like a play that has been converted to a movie only by using several cheap locations at least very little other people visible more than just the stage in this one the house from the first minute future developments are clear as water nothing unexpected happens sometimes you may think watching a soft porn movie in which case you know in advance that there's no story br br i find this movie disappointing so that's explains the vote 4
<START> spoiler alert and i really mean it read no further unless you are prepared to have a major plot element revealed br br okay first i've gotta say that i have a relatively high tolerance for depressing films i'll watch and appreciate films about true life horrors such as war and the holocaust or where death and sadness are important to the plot but i hate films like steal <UNK> and terms of <UNK> where the film is built around a manipulative death of a main character so already no matter how well made this film is it's got a major strike against it because one of the main characters dies from a disease at the end though they never say what he had in the english subtitled version br br so you might ask yourself then if this blow hard hates this type of film then why did he watch it in the first place you would have an excellent point to ask this though i hope i am not really a blow hard well when i found it in our local library i had no idea what it was about the movie was not intended specifically for <UNK> as the subtitles were in korean english and japanese and the box was <UNK> all in korean well being a fan of trying films from any nation i've seen films from probably at least 30 40 different countries i gave it a try br br well apart from the obligatory death i loved the film and so hated the way it ended while i usually hate hollywood type <UNK> endings i wanted to see the guy saved through some new drug or experimental surgery i was really <UNK> that he had to die particularly since he seemed like one of the <UNK> people i've seen in films in a long time his smile was <UNK> and i really wanted him to get the girl in the end oh well at least i can appreciate the film's message that you need to <UNK> the moment great acting music etc but just not the most satisfying ending for me this film was good enough to encourage me to try some more korean cinema
<START> there was something about the original three films that made them so special and delightful probably the length of them unfortunately this lacks the charm but it still ends up being a fun film br br the bright <UNK> side is that our favourite figures are still doing a cracking great job there is good animation used there is a silly but well structured and entertaining plot an exciting fun adventure a good plot idea a were rabbit and a giant competition and good new characters br br as well as lacking the original charm the only other slightly gloomy side of the film is that the humour though good is slightly overdone especially compared to the original films br br the popular giant competition is drawing near and wallace and <UNK> are helping control <UNK> from eating any now they are anti they are doing a good job but soon there is danger <UNK> a were rabbit is nearby br br recommended to all wallace and <UNK> fans and to people who like films enjoy wallace and <UNK> the curse of the <UNK>
<START> though i had sort of enjoyed the satanic <UNK> of dracula 1974 i knew i shouldn't expect too much from its even more <UNK> predecessor surely the least of the hammer marcus on the audio commentary for the <UNK> flesh 1973 even goes so far as to call it the <UNK> <UNK> the film really <UNK> due to its totally and now embarrassingly dated <UNK> of the myth the modern day setting actually suited satanic <UNK> rather better even if truth be told it's still vastly <UNK> to dreck like dracula 2000 2000 or van <UNK> 2004 br br despite christopher lee's bashing of the film he still cuts an undeniably striking figure as the undead vampire even if he appears very little and is inexplicably confined to one setting likewise peter cushing delivers his usual committed performance the only other noteworthy acting job in the film is that given by christopher son of director ronald as johnny <UNK> even if that's only because of how unbelievably hammy it is unfortunately the two best known female members of the cast both of them horror <UNK> stephanie <UNK> and caroline <UNK> can't rise above their physical attributes br br the camera work is by dick bush who had shot the blood on <UNK> claw 1971 and for hammer when dinosaurs ruled the earth 1970 and twins of evil 1971 but is perhaps best known for his longtime association with ken russell which manages some nice atmosphere throughout especially during three crucial sequences the <UNK> ride <UNK> at the properly gothic beginning the hysterical black mass sequence followed by the <UNK> of dracula and the final confrontation between lee and <UNK> van <UNK>
<START> on the enigmatic singer <UNK> who according to <UNK> accounts spent the last 15 years of his relatively short life seemingly on a mission of self destruction he died at <UNK> overweight and <UNK> of heart disease after a <UNK> rampage of virtually non stop <UNK> in alcohol <UNK> marijuana and cocaine <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> of his vocal <UNK> he to a friend that he <UNK> out his lyrics at one performance with such force that <UNK> blood was left on the <UNK> br br all of this despite the fact that he was 1 widely considered to have perhaps the most gifted pop singing ability of his generation 2 successful after years of effort in terms of industry acclaim a <UNK> an oscar a decent recording contract with a top label and at least two stellar albums originals and 'a little touch of in the <UNK> standards and 3 very happily married for the third time with a lovely young family that he seemed to adore br br the film's strengths begin with the <UNK> of its account of life including fine use of <UNK> film footage and many stills of <UNK> the <UNK> do an especially good job of bringing movement to the stills we learn of his close ties to john lennon and later <UNK> <UNK> lennon often said that <UNK> was his favorite american musician br br even more impressive are the talking heads often a <UNK> weakest aspect here we get people like perry <UNK> jr ray cooper mickey <UNK> terry gilliam mark hudson eric <UNK> rick randy newman van dyke parks jimmy <UNK> and robin williams all telling amazing stories about <UNK>  many <UNK> funny others deeply pathetic and everyone conveying their deep affection for him equally informative and moving are interview segments with wives  annie and <UNK> his son <UNK> and cousin doug best set of heads i can recall in a br br the most glaring <UNK> of the film is that it crowds out music even the performance of his greatest hit without you is cut short after about 8 bars <UNK> there is no excuse for this not given that the movie runs a full two hours as it is lose a few head shots and we could have heard at least that song through and perhaps one or two more like one or his oscar winning cover of everybody's talking ' the filmmakers are simply too intent on <UNK> psychological <UNK> and not <UNK> enough to his music my <UNK> 7 5 10 low b seen at the reel music series <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the lines in the title of this review are the first lines in this film's theme song a wonderfully demented parody of the in my opinion horrible song my favorite things from the sound of music and this fun little detail isn't the only aspect that makes the body shop aka doctor gore 1973 <UNK> to my fellow gore trash fans the film which was created almost entirely by j g <UNK> jr who served as producer writer director and leading man as the eponymous dr gore is crap no doubt but it is also beyond doubt that it is amusing and that everyone involved probably <UNK> especially was aware that they were not exactly making a masterpiece br br dr brandon <UNK> a famous but totally insane plastic surgeon <UNK> his beloved wife a model in an accident along with his <UNK> assistant greg roy he <UNK> kidnaps beautiful young women in order to build himself a new perfect wife out of their body parts br br doctor gore is <UNK> a film of the <UNK> bad it's good <UNK> but it is also has qualities beyond the usual ridiculous <UNK> mad science has always been one of my absolute favorite horror topics and as a matter of fact it is also one of the coolest topics for ridiculous gore trash flicks obviously shot on a minimal budget doctor gore pays some homage to the frankenstein films especially james <UNK> masterpiece bride of frankenstein <UNK> and resembles the look of the early troma <UNK> gordon lewis gore flicks such as blood feast 1963 only that this looks a lot cheaper and <UNK> obviously j g motive was not merely to make a fun gore flick being a rather ugly weird looking fellow his role of dr brandon gave <UNK> the opportunity to make out with a couple of hot <UNK> dressed young women who would later end up as body part <UNK> in dr laboratory br br most of the gore is actually pretty well made regarding the obviously tiny budget the dialogue includes some extremely hilarious lines get that it might be the door and put a coat on so they don't see you're a <UNK> besides the aforementioned theme song doctor gore also includes a wonderfully crappy appearance by a country band called <UNK> <UNK> and the my new favorite band not for the rest of the film i kept wondering whether bill <UNK> and roy who plays the <UNK> assistant are twins or even the same person the two look exactly the same and having two unrelated <UNK> red <UNK> guys looking this weird in one film would be a huge coincidence other than j g <UNK> most of the cast members never did any other films this is the first film i've seen out of the few by <UNK> sadly the man died of cancer in 1975 br br overall doctor gore is a film that certainly isn't for everyone as a matter of fact it is total crap but it is also amusing and <UNK> to my fellow fans of weirdness and cheap camp stuff should show a from this film under <UNK>
<START> spoilers i am a fan of 60's 70's french cinema but not necessarily of the more modern so to be honest i watched this because of <UNK> she is very young here extremely beautiful and on top of this supposedly this movie is where they met with <UNK> so it gives it some extra importance br br the movie begins with a very nice style reminiscent of <UNK> then suddenly we are thrown to flashback and the back and forth goes on which gets <UNK> i don't mind one flash back but do it and get it over with man anyway the movie is still interesting to me until a point when the first and definite hole in the plot that allows for the rest of the story never lets me enjoy the rest i can allow for little holes here and there but not to base an entire plot on hot air this is the story of a man who is literally searching for an old flame this is the main plot i will go along when the story at some point will convince me that there are really mysterious things going on but in this story there's nothing really mysterious <UNK> <UNK> are a couple then <UNK> <UNK> has to leave for some job in italy not the <UNK> place on earth from paris and she leaves him a message which for reasons later explained he doesn't get ok so what don't these people have phones supposedly she was away for not a century exactly and wouldn't she call her boyfriend in paris to see how he's doing of course not instead even after she gets back she forgets all about him and thats fine but later in the movie she tells her friend that it was her greatest love and was ready to commit for the first time in her life yet she failed to give him a call for and then never tried to get back with him and what about <UNK> character he was supposedly unable to locate her in italy really hard to find someone in italy its probably like <UNK> especially an actress who is probably listed even in the arts papers and after when she would be back really hard to find her and ask for an explanation one thinks she wanted to avoid him but no we find out they simply couldn't meet so hard to meet in paris ok i don't need to go further because this is the incident where the entire movie is based what is even worse <UNK> is not really the star of this movie but this other girl is
<START> i won't say the show is all bad because there are some funny parts like spencer and a few random incidents but other than that let's face it it's just another dry sitcom that kids are buying into br br miranda <UNK> was cute and funny as <UNK> on drake and josh honestly she is mediocre in and is just not as funny as she tries to be the actress who plays sam seems to be half asleep most of the time and her antics are so clichéd that i would think of them they're not funny just annoying and <UNK> is okay but not that interesting br br of course the situations are unrealistic but it's not all bad some are <UNK> though here are a few br br 1 the girls are 14 and have a web show that gives away too much personal information with a weekly audience of 27 000 wtf with little to no advertising and they can still go on about their lives not being attacked by crazy people br br 2 their web show gets too much praise 100 000 <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> a free trip to japan plain white <UNK> performance and so on honestly anyone over the age of 6 would not find their comedy entertaining br br 3 how is it that they are so average yet they own a three story <UNK> spencer does hardly anything and can still afford many basic <UNK> and they have all the equipment for a web show 4 all of the adults are idiots all of them br br 5 no 5 foot high girl no matter how obnoxious and <UNK> can take down trained cops unless she's muscular sam is skinny and <UNK> br br 6 no one can fall down 9 stories in an elevator and live br br 7 kids can handle finding out about criminals better than cops br br the show is stupid really it seems harmless but making kids think that they can be obnoxious to their <UNK> live alone in seattle when they're only 14 with an irresponsible moron and give out personal information is just wrong br br i'm disappointed to say that my cousin who is 3 enjoys the show what happened to the cartoons when i was her age
<START> where to start i think only three other films have led me to post a review on imdb and all of those were positive as for this br br mind <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> embarrassingly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> completely and utterly beyond awful br br i am stunned this got made never mind given a theatrical release i think i am literally in shock br br i'm no <UNK> i didn't expect beautiful film making or intense character depth but this is truly beyond a joke we simply must demand more from the films we see br br avoid like the black death
<START> one of quite a few cartoon scooby doo films scooby doo and the <UNK> <UNK> monster turns out to be entertaining exciting interesting funny and also does a surprisingly good interpretation of the <UNK> of scotland one annoying aspect of the film is the voices of many of the characters american people trying to sound scottish in this film are unfortunately not <UNK> all that well although some people do better scottish accents than others br br daphne has come to the <UNK> to see her cousin shannon and the <UNK> games at blake castle <UNK> shannon tells the gang that she believes to have seen the <UNK> <UNK> monster when yet more chaos <UNK> the mystery inc gang have another mystery on their hands br br good for scooby doo fans and for people who want to find out more about scotland enjoy scooby doo and the <UNK> <UNK> monster
<START> the only reason to see this film is sung hi lee the stunning model actress from korea who plays <UNK> give me a break in this otherwise crappy movie br br she is given a fairly substantial part in this film and seems to handle it well though none of the parts is really interesting or well written even for a national <UNK> movie it's really stupid stupid humor is one thing but just stupid is another i may have laughed once and that was probably just me being polite br br warning watching this movie may be bad for your health on two counts 1 it like totally sucks 2 sung hi lee is so freaking gorgeous she just might blow your brains out of the back of your head upon first sight br br so don't say i didn't warn you
<START> pretty bad <UNK> <UNK> which i rarely bother to watch over again and it's no wonder it's slow and <UNK> and dull as a <UNK> knife mad doctor george <UNK> is at it again turning a <UNK> in <UNK> glenn strange into a wolf man unfortunately the makeup is virtually non existent <UNK> only of a beard and <UNK> <UNK> for the most part if it were not for <UNK> and presence along with the cute anne this would be completely unwatchable strange who would go on to play <UNK> monster for in two years does a <UNK> impression from of mice and men it seems br br 1 2 of four
<START> jeff powers lou diamond phillips young guns 1 2 a cop with a history of <UNK> up criminals is <UNK> into an elite <UNK> <UNK> division this doesn't sit well with <UNK> newspaper reporter girlfriend kelly <UNK> field who's looking for a story on the squad soon enough <UNK> conscience gets the better of him which puts him at odds with dan vaughn scott glenn the hunt for red october the leader of the unit br br this is a fairly routine dare i say mundane cop action drama that holds no surprises thanks to a cookie cutter plot that's content to go strictly from point a to point b the acting is all right for what the actors were given to work with however that's no real reason to watch the film kinda sad seeing as the six previous mark l lester directed films right before this one from class of 1984 to showdown in little tokyo were all highly entertaining vehicles br br eye candy <UNK> field gets briefly topless br br my grade d
<START> this derivative erotic thriller remains watchable most of the way mainly because a viewer is casually curious about how it will turn out and because the director peter hall manages to stage a pretty hot and quite bold sex scene but the finale though unexpected is preposterous and the whole plotting complete with childhood <UNK> and multiple personality <UNK> reveals itself to be <UNK> cliched especially as far as motivation is concerned 1 2
<START> this was on tv last night i painfully forced my way through it and barely made it through first of all except for <UNK> <UNK> and possibly <UNK> none of the other students we are supposed to care about have any discernible talent it's like had no standards just sign on the <UNK> line and you're in br br the story lines were grating and obvious doris was just <UNK> awful the gay guy was such a thrown away cliché funny how that school had only one gay guy right i liked the <UNK> character but calling your teacher an <UNK> and then <UNK> the school should have sent <UNK> <UNK> lisa looks like she'd rather be anywhere else and since she wasn't any talent i wonder why they kept her br br i would have rated this one star awful but the music wasn't that bad and i did like the premise it just would have worked much better if the students had been attractive and actually had some talent
<START> the comparisons between the 1995 version and this are inevitable sadly this version falls far short br br the casting is uninspired and the acting wooden one gets the impression the director did not read the book so did not understand the characters br br sir walter elliot is portrayed as pompous but his <UNK> silliness which redgrave brilliantly captured in the 1995 version is nowhere to be found br br the <UNK> sisters are so unlikable one doesn't understand why <UNK> or anybody else would give them a second glance br br the relationship between <UNK> and anne is devoid of feeling br br in the 1995 version <UNK> and root managed to convey the depth of emotion the two of them felt towards each other with their body language and facial expressions in this one it is hard to understand anne spent years <UNK> in regret unless one has read the book br br this production does not capture the emotional complexity of the main characters' relationship br br in the scene where <UNK> walks in on anne and mary having breakfast it seems to the viewer as mary thinks they are only slight <UNK> br br in the 1995 version when <UNK> walks in the first time he sees her in years the tension is thick <UNK> is coming off <UNK> in waves while anne is almost overcome br br in this version while <UNK> is <UNK> it is as if he is truly invested the <UNK> are missing in the 1995 version the viewer sees <UNK> anger at anne he is <UNK> his <UNK> in front of anne as if to say see what you gave up i don't need or want you anymore br br yet he still cares if she suffers as the scene where he asks his sister and the <UNK> to take anne back to house illustrates in the 1995 version the viewer feels <UNK> shock that he would care if she was tired we also feel <UNK> <UNK> that he does still care in this version he just walks on with as if nothing happened br br the pivotal scene where anne is <UNK> with about who loves longest man or woman is totally <UNK> the actors are just <UNK> lines with no emotional investment br br when anne reads the letter from <UNK> it is as if she is reading a <UNK> list br br contrast this to the 1995 version where the viewer feels <UNK> joy at her second chance we are there with her as she reads the letter the director had both actors reading the letter and you hear both their voices <UNK> is full of frustration passion and hope while <UNK> is at first <UNK> then <UNK> in to joy br br this production has more scenes after the revelation probably because it was needed to explain to the viewer what just happened the 1995 version didn't need to explain we knew and <UNK> for the characters the only thing this production has in it's favor is it kept the mrs smith sub plot intact while the 1995 version did not br br the 1995 version however did include part of <UNK> original ending the scene where <UNK> is <UNK> by the <UNK> to find out if anne and mr elliot will want to move back to her house which he mrs <UNK> are renting after they marry br br this is a production to avoid at all costs
<START> this movie is george c scott at his very best bernard hughes at his very best and diana <UNK> at her most <UNK> and of course <UNK> writing at masterpiece <UNK> there are also very brief snippets of future <UNK> like susan sarandon <UNK> <UNK> etc who have one scene lines that you don't necessarily spot until your fifth or sixth time watching nancy <UNK> as a young to middle age nurse <UNK> is also superb as well as practically every face in hollywood of 1970 br br it is one of the few movies that gets better the more times you see it watch for the surprise scene ala wait until dark this is one of the few movies i have ever bought on dvd it is that superb
<START> what you need in the run up to <UNK> you <UNK> every episode since 'the had been a winner to some extent this episode is the first major failure since the <UNK> script is again based on someone else's a short story by lewis as with <UNK> when the sky was <UNK> altered the content significantly <UNK> a scientist and his machine and <UNK> an elderly <UNK> br br <UNK> you <UNK> works best when it is being sweet the opening half in which the <UNK> provides customers in a bar with objects they will need in the near future has a gentle charm about it that may have worn thin throughout an entire episode but works well in the time frame it is <UNK> sadly the main plot which it sets up is full of <UNK> holes the minute steve performance as a two bit thug becomes the main focus the episode falls apart part is an <UNK> stereotype and his flat performance highlights this flaw his exploitation of the old <UNK> is dull and predictable and the revelation that he will murder the old man is totally unconvincing making the whole <UNK> shoes scene seem completely false ernest is good as the <UNK> bringing a magical mysterious but warm edge to the character but he's not good enough to help the <UNK> script br br to make matters worse the weak script is also full of inconsistencies for instance we learn that the power to provide people with what they need <UNK> from an ability to see into the future so how exactly does this allow him to produce a pen that will magically pick winning horses that seems like it should be a little outside his <UNK> of power also for a man who can see the future the <UNK> certainly acts surprised to find the thug waiting for him in his flat there are many more holes that can be picked in <UNK> you <UNK> but it's hardly worth it when the episode is so thin that you can see through it anyway
<START> a party hardy frat boy's sister is brutally murdered by a street gang sending the young man into a sudden psychotic rampage he and his buddies massacre half the city to bring his sister back to life br br savage streets was released a year after this film and was more entertaining <UNK> <UNK> who has a <UNK> role in this film as the sexy and briefly nude girlfriend of one of the guys also starred in savage streets br br this film is <UNK> though it delivers enough <UNK> entertainment and gratuitous nudity to please its intended audience me br br mpaa rated r for strong violence nudity language and some sexuality
<START> <UNK> br br i never thought i would see the day when i would be so disgusted by a movie that it would be a burden to finish it i was always a fan of horror movies and <UNK> included but in this case it's hard to describe how a movie could fail to qualify for any letters in that scale br br the movie is centered on a poorly developed back story a mix of <UNK> with an after taste and to top it up the performance of the actors is questionable horror b movies usually fall in two categories 1 a gem that was under looked and under <UNK> 2 so bad it's funny laugh or your money back well this movie falls in between i wasn't scare didn't laugh so i guess if you really need to see it you could but i recommend you don't
<START> this show is what happened to the screen after <UNK> got its hands on it taking it from a useful source of computer related information to a show that had as its high point the <UNK> of a <UNK> web <UNK> up someone's <UNK> br br as ratings <UNK> they moved away from their original target audience <UNK> to generic <UNK> driven young men adding eye candy to the staff and a sex advice segment now even the <UNK> who <UNK> the show initially are turning away in disgust i look forward to the show's and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and well deserved demise
<START> the acting is awkward and creepy and not in a good way at all the writing the dialogue and the chemistry between the actors is horrible nothing makes sense and every close up of an actor's expression or reaction lasts 3 or 4 seconds too long making it seem like a mexican soap opera everything about the writing is unrealistic and all of the actors involved make it that much worse with their campy interpretations of the script am i the only one who sees this to use the word cheesy to describe this canadian disaster would be the understatement of the century did the director even watch the final cut before it was put on the air
<START> this movie accurately portrays the struggle life was for the typical east german watched by the secret police friends and <UNK> most <UNK> simply existed br br the and the were two families that decided they weren't going to take it anymore br br despite the extreme danger involved in escaping to the west they feel the <UNK> far <UNK> the risks john hurt and beau bridges portraying the respective family heads hit upon the idea of flying over east <UNK> heavily <UNK> border br br there are tense moments as they gather and jimmy <UNK> the necessary <UNK> for the flight they work their day jobs and <UNK> the balloon at night right under the <UNK> of the authorities one of whom is neighbor <UNK> br br the first attempt involving only the ends in failure when the balloon crashes just a few <UNK> from the border the crashed balloon is discovered by border guards and an relentless search begins for the <UNK> who are determined to try again with sales of <UNK> being closely <UNK> peter and still manage to <UNK> bits and pieces of cloth with which to <UNK> a second balloon for their nail biting escape to freedom the film also features a heartwarming and effective soundtrack by the late jerry <UNK>
<START> good cinematography good acting good direction cannot justify a story that is not and cannot be acceptable to any society amitabh has often used the media to make this junk sell able by saying that if such an incident happens then what i would like to ask him if such a thing happens for your own child or your <UNK> say girl child then what will you do i think every parents will have to take special care before <UNK> with any 60 year old neighbor if you have one <UNK> with you such films should be banned and <UNK> otherwise you inspire more more cases such acts are villainous and villains in films are <UNK> that should be the moral of the story and not <UNK> their act or them
<START> at a time when hollywood thinks that <UNK> faster and <UNK> are better <UNK> from heaven is comedic and touching look at something we've all thought about what would i do if a load of money fell from the sky br br interestingly it took the characters many years to realize that the money hadn't made a single difference in their lives they all become what they were destined to be unfortunately in most cases what they became was unhappy in spite of their good fortune all those years ago br br while <UNK> offers the familiar hollywood storyline of good vs evil or in the case <UNK> vs greed what sets this film apart is that good wins out by <UNK> evil not by <UNK> it br br i think the important message of this film is that you can change the world even if you do it one person at a time
<START> i totally agree with the other poster nemesis is one of the best of the christie adaptations with a <UNK> plot and cast br br the scene involving liz <UNK> as the mother of the murder victim is a study in acting at the finest level this underrated woman was a <UNK> in brit films in the 1960s who never got a mainstream break in us films check her out as julie <UNK> friend in the 1964 the <UNK> of emily br br all of the in this <UNK> have a chance to shine with and without the <UNK> ms who was never for an emmy for her <UNK> work shame on them and dig the lesbian <UNK> agents
<START> this movie is very good in term of acting and plot the events and the setting i e how chris gets the job <UNK> work environment the face to face between the two sides etc thereof on the other hand are found to be less than realistic
<START> this movie makes <UNK> look like <UNK> list tarantino and the <UNK> really need to consider more carefully before putting their names on a product green lighting a p o s like this regardless of the friendships involved is just bad business larry bishop needs to be kept away from a movie camera at all costs writer director producer actor bishop shows that his skills are <UNK> for any of those jobs a vanity project gone south hell ride allows usually good actors to chew the scenery at least when the camera isn't centered on <UNK> feeble attempts to steal every scene he's in which is virtually every scene my final three words on hell ride are stink <UNK> <UNK>
<START> it's difficult to make it through this movie without <UNK> on your own vomit to be honest the shoddy animation doesn't help as it makes this look like a decades old video you'd find in <UNK> bin still it's better than the abysmal screenplay which spends about a third of its length on superfluous extras like <UNK> present day problems stuff about <UNK> dad and plenty of <UNK> around with choke two <UNK> mice these bizarre <UNK> eat up screen time at the expense of elements you'd think would be quite important like <UNK> dialogue and key <UNK> of his plot the movie up the game of twenty questions for example and at times fails to put scenes in the right order absolutely hopeless
<START> all i can say is this movie is made for the lifetime channel on tv which means no solid characters no particular style weak acting all kinds of suggested sex but no breasts and because boy that would just <UNK> the film into the depths of sleaze wouldn't it but the heavily <UNK> sex well that's ok br br when watching these films i have to ask myself when will these types of tv channels and their <UNK> ever grow up i think these companies are actually way behind the times they really have no clue what the younger generation is in tune with and if they knew they would demand we change the whole point of many american tv channels like these seems mostly to <UNK> the same <UNK> garbage over and over like a generic movie <UNK> line i guess it works for them or at least it has not sure about the future though br br don't bore yourself to death like i did seek out some real tv movies on hbo showtime <UNK> <UNK> etc any channel that puts effort into their work and doesn't have to ask a priest what they can or cannot show
<START> i love the <UNK> novel on which this film is based and while this modern version of <UNK> <UNK> story is a b film the casting of loy in her first top billed role is rather fascinating br br before loy became <UNK> <UNK> good girl in scores of <UNK> and comic roles she was an actress vanity fair was <UNK> follow up film to emma in which she played a <UNK> and greedy daughter who almost destroys the loyal <UNK> marie <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> is much <UNK> than <UNK> <UNK> version 3 years later in <UNK> sharp <UNK> <UNK> is very much a pre code film character with her <UNK> <UNK> and amoral ways it's the type of character that jean harlow or clara bow could easily have played but <UNK> here is still supposed to be of the <UNK> set that's what makes her fallen character so tragic br br in <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> barbara kent who is just not an interesting character mary forbes is good as mrs most of the other actors in this version are pretty blah <UNK> as walter byron as <UNK> anthony <UNK> as others are nearly <UNK> is their <UNK> billy <UNK> as joseph lionel <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> love as the marquis irene as polly the maid as the <UNK> br br loy is front and center throughout while the ending is rather shocking she has several excellent scenes such as the gambling scene in the casino where she tries to steal another woman's winning <UNK> bet the more <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> morally the more beautiful she gets until she is finally caught bottom line here is that this is a very solid performance by loy in a film that should be seen
<START> i've heard about this documentary for so long i knew i needed to take the time to watch it as a documentary it's very well done in that it takes a neutral <UNK> view of their experience there are no voice overs or <UNK> it is honest it is true it is also <UNK> two comments really stayed with me after the film was done one was how the boys are told to not to become like the american boys who wear the <UNK> pants and how in africa there is time but no money but in america there is money but no time the biggest impact was how the boys for education and how one of the boys totally <UNK> himself so he could go to school i watched this film with a high school <UNK> who said it upset him to see how the boys were brought to their new life without any real <UNK> to america he also said he knew so many american teens who simply cannot appreciate their lives are in america i would agree with him on both accounts a strong film that will leave a person thinking about many things
<START> not a balanced point of view the director shouldn't express her opinion as truth the movie has some criticism of but it always gives him and his family the last words so few critics of were provided that it seems the only reason they were included was to be able to say the movie provides both views but that is not the case br br the movie barely shows one of the <UNK> that is accused of and it gives him credit for the the murdering of the <UNK> that took the japanese <UNK> it is well documented that the cia did the planning there is even pictures of a well known cia <UNK> on the site published by magazine and other <UNK> br br the fact that such well known information was not used by the director gives us a few possible conclusions the director is pro and <UNK> and <UNK> chooses to give the credit to him the director does not want viewers to note that the cia and worked together or it was just out of ignorance since the director is not <UNK> and was not present in <UNK> at the time the events occurred br br the explanation provided by other <UNK> that is still fairly popular in <UNK> does not excuse the lack of accuracy and balanced explanations br br also the <UNK> provided in the movie for the actual support of were the highest i have ever heard of most <UNK> by major <UNK> <UNK> are much lower br br another point to mention is that the intelligence that was key in the capture of the leader of and discover the secret network was done by a police force led by <UNK> and he had complete <UNK> from and br br the first government of did experience an improvement in overall economic <UNK> but this improvement was <UNK> by the <UNK> of several national <UNK> with <UNK> that were not <UNK> for the country in the long term also the gap between rich an poor continued to increase during regime in his second term the economy was suffering and there was nothing else to <UNK> and by the end of second term the economy was about to collapse br br in terms of <UNK> in <UNK> of regime they <UNK> the <UNK> pattern they were created to raise support for but were not meant to last long these <UNK> needed continued <UNK> but did not provide political power for the civilians in order to demand further investment in fact regime was able to destroy most forms of political <UNK> such as <UNK> and grass roots groups and the increase in <UNK> <UNK> labor was immense br br finally the director chose to spend most of the movie talking to instead of <UNK> the cases of massive corruption in favour of the media business owners the military etc that were so wide spread it was impossible that was not aware of it
<START> people are stupid you shouldn't cheer when paris gets killed in the head with a <UNK> it is plain rude what did paris do to you what if that was you you wouldn't want people cheering for your death anyway it was really gory which i liked and it was cool when finger gets cut off it was weird with that twist that they didn't have 2 sons they had tree and all it makes way for a house of wax 2 or something paris was great acting in the chase scene elisha and <UNK> chemistry is great they deserve an oscar my friends and i were cracking up when that guy said that's hot when paris and the guy from cousin making out lol k bye
<START> need i say more the reason the good australian version of and kim was as mentioned good was because of it's hilariously funny originality the reason this new american version is so terrible is because a lot of it is taken straight from the original not to mention the <UNK> to the characters is meant to be a kim is meant to be fat <UNK> or phil as they have dubbed him is meant to be pathetic brett or craig is meant to be a loser not a person who acts like he's on heroin and finishes every sentence with thank god <UNK> didn't sell her rights to sharon she'd probably end up being a tall thin blonde who kim likes br br and kim are mother and daughter they are not meant to look 2 years apart and they are not meant to giggle like school girls this show is a disgrace to even share the same title as the australian version america get your own television shows
<START> honestly i was a big fan on <UNK> <UNK> trailer when it got released even some months before i kept on telling my friend how this movie has a great story plot and perhaps a good one anyway this movie is somewhat below my expectations br br the plot has a great potential but how the story unfolds along with the acting directing and bad cgi this film is a disaster the ghost doesn't make any sense and including the killings its all just too <UNK> creating a sense of in the audience's mind br br this film could be scary for some audiences but fear in a sense of shock due to the sound effect etc rather than enduring fear due to certain valid factors in the movie br br you should re consider watching this movie
<START> once again woody allen seems to be completely devoid of any inspiration other than <UNK> himself here we have a mock documentary like <UNK> the structure of the film is a series of <UNK> radio days broadway danny rose set in the 30's <UNK> purple rose bullets over broadway about a low life <UNK> harry who believes being a genius him from being a jerk <UNK> given this film and <UNK> harry one wonders if this is allen's justification for his own actions with <UNK> adopted daughter yes i was a jerk but i'm a genius so you gotta love me br br allen has only produced two good movies in the past ten years the fine but <UNK> bullets over broadway and the excellent but largely ignored manhattan murder mystery his other efforts range from <UNK> new york stories mighty <UNK> to edgy yet experimental husbands and wives to pure <UNK> alice scenes from a mall shadows and fog celebrity <UNK> harry his films no longer even try to have a narrative arc and his humor seems to aim at <UNK> amusing not funny after <UNK> harry i stopped seeing his films in theaters after sweet and <UNK> i may stop renting them as well
<START> simply put the only saving grace this movie has is settings costumes and an ok punk concert how h r <UNK> must feel about his cyborg picture on the cover of this movie i wouldn't like to know right away all i could do was make <UNK> comments about the films protagonists i was hoping that the freaks in this movie would <UNK> them in gory fashion i sense spoilers a <UNK> i was wondering if this film in the spirit of the first 20 min was intended to be as <UNK> half baked as the rest of it <UNK> all the obvious political police trying to rape a freak the discussion of <UNK> between the freak and the frat boy and the punk concert w the female <UNK> and the use of slow motion in the fighting sequences which screams martial arts <UNK> i just don't know the character named steve <UNK> me since he tries to pick fights w people off the street he <UNK> been <UNK> and raped and looks bad when he broke that guy's neck towards the end want me to show you how to do it i must say this though if they would've developed other characters better than they did splatter this might have gone somewhere if there was a 0 to give this movie it would've got it but alas it's a 1
<START> <UNK> runner is undoubtedly one of the most amazing books i have read in the recent past i perhaps had very high expectations from the film but none the less the movie was good the entire setting seemed realistic nothing was made to fancy the dialogs were not very attractive or powerful they were just right the movie was not a bad experience at all especially at the last <UNK> where it got real emotional and even the hardest man would probably cry but my imagination was far better than the movie i cried more upon reading the novel than seeing the movie but overall a good movie to see for those of u who are not readers but the readers the novel would be a better experience so if at all u want to see the movie read the novel first and then compare it to the movie
<START> i am a big fan of <UNK> <UNK> work especially fire and earth <UNK> unfortunately this movie of hers lacks all that is needed for a good film br br the movie attempts to showcase the plight of the <UNK> in india in the early 20th century and the new wave of ideas of their <UNK> around the same time shown with a child widow as a central character although the plot too banal from an indian standpoint it could still have been a very powerful movie alas the movie lacked both the sensitivity of fire and the intensity of emotion in earth <UNK> br br even if one assumes that the story is a given although there are hundreds of things i would have liked different in that as well the movie making is especially unfortunate everything is said everything is shown straight absence of sensitive implied sentences absence of things left <UNK> i just couldn't believe that this was a <UNK> <UNK> film br br there were some very standard hindi movie characters like an old widow with her own <UNK> interests or a father who has double standards of the highest quality can one not write a script without having these old style standard indian movie characters br br many people acclaimed <UNK> for making a movie and proving a point against <UNK> <UNK> well i agree that she took a bold step but should one not worry about the quality of movie or is it being a controversial one an end in itself its obvious that if you start with a story as in water you will end up feeling the pain of the <UNK> in consideration it doesn't take an accomplished director to achieve that and the movie had nothing more than that so where is contribution to the film br br and talk about acting etc pathetic lisa ray has a pretty face an extremely pretty face but thats where it ends she can't speak hindi she can't <UNK> john abraham is no better most <UNK> seem unnatural the saving grace are <UNK> <UNK> and the young girl they are fabulous br br and this was a period film but the hindi dialogues suck big time even there <UNK> is also as unnatural as it gets no <UNK> accents no local no nothing the only thing right was probably the shooting locales i thought that the set of the <UNK> was reasonably real the overall blue <UNK> in the whole movie is also apt br br but all and all don't watch this movie you won't get anything there is nothing in the story or direction if you have to watch it watch it for the little girl's acting
<START> christopher <UNK> first directorial effort a year before he did <UNK> and this is almost as brilliant as that classic he uses time in a similar manner to tell his story and it's a very clever one br br bill is this young writer who begins following complete strangers around just to see where they live and what they're all about one day he follows this man <UNK> who turns the tables and confronts bill who breaks down and <UNK> what he's up to br br <UNK> is a <UNK> and he takes bill along on a few jobs to teach him the <UNK> both men are <UNK> of a sort and a bond begins to grow between the two of them br br but there's an <UNK> motive for <UNK> <UNK> this relationship and it all ties in very <UNK> at the end no i won't spoil it but this is a very cool movie and i'm beginning to think christopher nolan is a genius br br if you like suspense films with surprise endings this one is a must see
<START> another example that we should stay away from trying to do spectacular action movies in sweden it <UNK> work except for still <UNK> <UNK> does the best he can i suppose and some scenes are mildly effective but the plot is full of holes why does hamilton continue the attack on the base knowing that his wife is held hostage it was fun to see mark <UNK> but his bad guy part was very <UNK> <UNK> constantly amazed that relatively big swedish movies like this get made without a sensible <UNK> script 1 out of 5
<START> the fact that there was so much fuss is ironic as the whole point of the programme was to highlight the way the media treat such <UNK> subjects such as <UNK> the set the suits the smug <UNK> the men at the scene shouting about things you can see behind them the pointless cgi and <UNK> the whole thing was a satire a very very funny satire the way c list <UNK> will say absolutely anything if their agent tells them it'll be good for their career there is no evidence for it but it is scientific fact it may be hard to watch with <UNK> and the girls as well as 9 11 but satire is supposed to be challenging and we shouldn't be afraid to stand up against the blatant and <UNK> grabbing media just because it's a delicate matter how this show failed to win any tv awards for it's intelligence observation courage acting and thought <UNK> is shameful but as watching it will show you not in the least bit surprising
<START> i came across this movie while channel surfing one day and decided to give it a chance to my surprise i enjoyed this movie i felt some genuine chemistry between <UNK> and malcolm <UNK> warner it was such a lighthearted and warm movie that when it was over i felt upbeat sure this movie was predictable from the very beginning but i give it high marks for the way that it made me feel when it was over i must admit that i have never seen <UNK> before but i feel that she can definitely act when you combine her good acting with her cute face and attractive figure she has the <UNK> of at least becoming a well known star
<START> by far this has to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life i watch practically every movie that is on at night either showtime hbo <UNK> etc three aka survivor island keeps you in as much suspense as watching paint dry only to let you down even more miserably if you want to feel like you just wasted what seems like an eternity on the worst film ever created then by all means watch this movie i must have screamed at a minimum <UNK> times from the idiotic twists if i had 4 hands i'd give this movie 4 thumbs down br br in my personal opinion i believe the only people who would like this movie are those with terrible morals
<START> a very <UNK> written film poor character and idea development the silly plot and weak acting by just about the ensemble cast didn't help seriously watching this movie will not make you smile it may make you <UNK>
<START> this film is a very descent remake of the famous fritz <UNK> masterpiece m murder it is well made and with a entertaining key to speak about pretty serious events and contemporary problems in but not only the whole world the ethnic <UNK> is such a huge evil and very nowadays so children of wax or as it is known in us distribution reveals the question of german and hatred in an amusing way no doubt it is well appreciated to be taken for distribution by the great brothers and there is another fact i liked most is the participation in this movie of the favorite actor of lars von trier the great <UNK> <UNK> who shows to play with such a pleasure for the <UNK> film director <UNK>
<START> with some wine some friends and some good humor i had a really good time watching this film i particularly enjoyed the performance of as randy who was such a kick in the pants his scenes with charity michelle were wildly amusing i wouldn't want him coming on to me but it was great watching randy try to score with michelle and even better seeing the results of course the girls in the film are lots of fun to watch too and a friend of mine showed me the playboy issue that had <UNK> as the <UNK> of the month she's definitely a <UNK> all in all this film totally served its purpose which was to entertain us in a light and care free way
<START> we loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat not your usual hollywood drivel br br my husband had a blockbuster <UNK> and passed on a string of new releases of violent hollywood stuff he was about to walk out when he saw this and decided to take a chance there was only one copy and with some <UNK> in the dvd that we finally had to flip to wide screen version and then back to the full screen version to make it stop <UNK> but it was worth it cathy bates is so good and she was so perfect for the role and she can sing too br br if only hollywood would learn from independent film makers maybe we would go back to the real movies but for now we're sticking with off beat and really entertaining films like this one other examples we've enjoyed include a box full of <UNK> pieces of april delivering milo the <UNK> <UNK> most of the ones by christopher guest such as best in show for your consideration a mighty wind and waiting for <UNK>
<START> this movie was one of the best i have ever seen just the other day i was reminded of this movie by something on tv it came back to me like a <UNK> <UNK> over i have never been more touched by a movie than by this one after the movie was over i actually could not quit crying for about 2 hours no movie has ever moved me that way before i was 15 at the time of the movie and have not seen it since but am hoping i can find a copy to buy so that i can watch it whenever i want to if someone suggests you see this movie with them go you will not be disappointed br br peggy <UNK>
<START> i can't believe i'm wasting my time with a comment but this movie is <UNK> bad if 20 different directors were brought in to film different parts of the movie without having any idea of the storyline being filmed by the other directors this is pretty much the result i would expect br br i also think some of the scenes were spliced out of order things don't always seem to progress in order the movie acts like we're already supposed to know about half the characters br br and steve <UNK> tries to do manic a la robin williams comedy in this movie <UNK> and the whole premise of putting an ex con in charge of a bunch of kids just doesn't seem realistic in this day and age
<START> <UNK> is a decent little euro trash horror yarn david <UNK> is pretty damn funny in this one and sadly he's one of the better actors linda blair is downright terrible and the lady who plays wife she is hilariously bad the plot of this film is ridiculous too it's got some holes which you can't help but notice but it remains entertaining throughout br br the gore in <UNK> is freaking outstanding i loved the part where the old bag gets sucked into the trash <UNK> and ends up in the <UNK> to <UNK> and the part where the lady gets taken advantage of by the devil was pretty damned disturbing i'd say this one is a must for <UNK> br br if you're looking for an <UNK> well acted flick look elsewhere but if you like old school style italian sleaze and over the top gore <UNK> belongs on your shelf br br i'm surprised by the low rating on here what were you people expecting the exorcist 7 out of 10 kids
<START> the thirty years that have passed since the making of this movie have made the suspense <UNK> somewhat and will not keep the public as <UNK> as i am sure it did in 1979 it is still entertaining enough though and <UNK> some of it's power when one finds out its sad relevance today check out the story of davis nuclear plant with the top of the line actors and steady pace one can learn to overlook the dated '70s environment and see it for the political critique that it is i doubt however it will survive the test of time it might not be entirely forgotten thanks to its cast but otherwise the dialog setting and score will make a remake of this movie <UNK> as the oil situation now is comparable to the situation in the 70's and alternative sources of energy are again becoming a <UNK> topic we can only hope the current generation gets blockbuster <UNK> about the risks of nuclear power like this
<START> another day this movie requires you to watch it another day to understand it i thoroughly enjoy watching and i was quite interesting in seeing how well julian <UNK> and appeared together following the roles they played in <UNK> i can certainly praise the acting skills throughout the film even the directing but the plot what happened i am at a loss for words because i am still confused i have to stay loyal to the actors who really did a good job considering the madness of the plot i also have to recommend you watch it because despite the plot madness i would still watch it over and over again
<START> i personally have a soft spot for horror films that are set in <UNK> and <UNK> so i had a good feeling about watching this don't look in the basement even though its reputation is <UNK> well turned out i was right this is great trashy entertainment with a couple of efficient shocks and delightfully absurd characters you have to of course look beyond the poor productions values and the completely illogical plot but if you manage to do that and if you're a fan of this type of horror that's an essential quality you'll be rewarded with an outrageous video nasty in which blood and insanity form the main elements the young and cute nurse charlotte arrives at a remote <UNK> where she's supposed to start her new job she finds out that the doctor who hired her was killed by a patient and the replacement doctor in charge masters seems reluctant to accept the new arrival the life inside the <UNK> is rather peculiar with the patients running around free and every door is kept <UNK> after a whole series of bizarre events charlotte discovers the horrific secrets that the institution hides the opening 10 minutes pre credits are great and so is the completely deranged climax everything in between is pretty much without surprise or tension but you <UNK> wait because you just feel that the finale will be wild fun the patients are <UNK> <UNK> but i love them nevertheless some of my favorites include the former judge who still talks exclusively in legal terms the suspicious army <UNK> and the mad raving old lady don't look in the basement is great low <UNK> fun especially recommended to fans of 70's trash cinema sick <UNK> and other types of <UNK> the <UNK> have taken over the asylum yeah
<START> it's a <UNK> <UNK> cyborg movie with a love story <UNK> it's not as bad as it sounds the action when it is there is decent and jack palance <UNK> <UNK> and angelina jolie are always <UNK> it's the fact that this is a sequel to the terrible jean claude van damme film or is that the <UNK> to the masters of the universe trilogy i'm still confused about that either way there was really no need for this movie what was there a need for angelina jolie she may play an assassin robot that can explodes mid <UNK> but what a way to go and even though this is her first movie she still has the presence that made her an award winner
<START> being a seasoned fan of italian thrillers and directors <UNK> <UNK> mario <UNK> sergio martino and <UNK> i thought of lucio fulci as an overrated hack i had seen the beyond which i think is totally overrated i found the new york <UNK> to be simply appalling and i didn't particularly like the house by the cemetery these three movies left me to conclude that fulci is the least interesting of these italian filmmakers but my <UNK> <UNK> and i had to check out more of his films city of the living dead was a film i found very interesting but don't torture a <UNK> is very nearly a masterpiece br br set in a small town in the italian countryside in a <UNK> religious community where young boys are being murdered the authorities are clueless as to who's behind these crimes especially after their prime suspect has been <UNK> an eager young reporter along with a rather <UNK> girl who <UNK> young boys investigate and eventually get to the bottom of it br br brilliant atmosphere combined with a good story and a good cast not always the case with 70's italian thrillers make don't torture a <UNK> a <UNK> good thriller the plot is well constructed not easily figured out and the end conclusion is very satisfying fulci creates a dynamic atmosphere of <UNK> and guilt in a very <UNK> and ignorant community and creates some very strong visuals particularly in a scene where a woman gets beaten to death by some local <UNK> <UNK> social commentary concerning religion and innocence are quite edgy and every aspect is well handled when thinking of his zombie flicks and his ultra violent giallo new york <UNK> it's amazing how well he <UNK> his critique with explicit violence and makes an even stronger point so far i haven't seen any fulci film made as <UNK> as this one br br while not a traditional giallo film <UNK> has many of the <UNK> <UNK> fulci displays complete control over the format only once going overboard with an unconvincing gore moment but overall he seems to be even better at making mysteries than full blown gore epics the extreme scenes here are much more powerful and really pack a punch br br so far don't torture a <UNK> is <UNK> best film by far in my opinion edgy social commentary combined with explicit scenes of violence and a <UNK> good mystery to boot
<START> if there's one good suspenseful film this is one of them james stewart puts on a dazzling performance as american dr ben <UNK> who with his wife and son are in africa on tour they stumble on a murder scene and dr <UNK> son is kidnapped hours later br br before you can say <UNK> your seat <UNK> dr <UNK> finds out too much about a assassination attempt and tries to stop it however other people know he can be dangerous dangerous to them that is and try to <UNK> of him br br eventually hank the son is found alive and well br br if you like suspenseful movies this is the one to watch br br my score 8 10
<START> everybody i talked to said that this movie would be good and really weird so i figured that i would rent it half way through the movie i was thinking to myself what the heck was going on and what is the point to this movie this movie from start to finish is so bad that even the sick parts of the movie didn't even bother me i mean what are they going to come up with next <UNK> 2 the return of the <UNK> i mean come on this movie is so stupid the characters are so poorly developed and eve robert englund makes the movie worse i mean he might as well be transformed into freddy and <UNK> people i was actually rooting for the bad guy to win that's how bad it was i mean look the father is a cop he didn't seem to care real much about the fact that his daughter is going through one of the most moments in her life i mean if my daughter was treated like that i would do everything in my power to keep the guy behind jail also it seems kind of obvious that dee character would turn bad again this is one of the worst films of all time right there with <UNK> and <UNK> do not <UNK> your time you will not enjoy it br br grade if there were a no grade on this site i would pick that thats how bad this movie is
<START> first the easy part this movie is pretentious <UNK> br br it put me in mind of <UNK> and then i thought wow somebody made a movie even dumber and more irritating than <UNK> br br i know nothing about the polish brothers but this film seems to have been made by someone who learned a lot in film school but knows nothing about storytelling the trite plot elements and <UNK> symbolism are bad enough but the dialogue is just pathetic br br detailed comments would just be a <UNK> list of failure the parts that are supposed to be funny or satirical are not the parts are nice coffee table pictures with mediocre music the emotional parts are simplistic br br the worst thing is that the movie shows no love at all for the characters except for a little <UNK> dignity in the priest br br i still can't believe the respect some people have given this picture
<START> s shines as <UNK> in this touching and vibrant look at the life of <UNK> <UNK> jr marcus franklin while growing up under the of <UNK> the film gives a good character study of both <UNK> and <UNK> and manages to capture life's ups and downs in a realistic fashion unlike so many <UNK> that are made into film the supporting cast adds much spark and many recognizable faces appear in smaller roles including <UNK> <UNK> macy gray <UNK> howard <UNK> <UNK> louis <UNK> jr <UNK> <UNK> jimmy ernie hudson <UNK> <UNK> and patricia loses some steam and <UNK> towards the end and the ending sequence leaves a bittersweet feeling but overall a great film with a truly outstanding performance by
<START> i knew that i was not about to see a quality film when this title was included in a <UNK> grade video <UNK> at a friends place despite the <UNK> i was still surprised at just how bad this film was it was fortunate that there were a lot of us there to share the pain with each other the film attempts to tell the story of a dark future one in which <UNK> a mad max type of character heads off to rescue a damsel in distress in reality the plot is a <UNK> disguised excuse for the producers to promote their own <UNK> on life watch the end credits and the people are not <UNK> <UNK> at the end for a real laugh the movie is frequently lacking direction and fails to develop its characters to any degree whatsoever what's even worse though is the editing of this film the film repeats scenes often 10 to 20 seconds long up to 4 or 5 times in a row i think that this was an attempt to <UNK> things like jean claude van damme fight sequences but if it is it fails utterly the film would probably be about 1 3 of its length if we weren't forced to watch the main character move his head in front of the setting sun half a dozen times yes that's all that happens in that repeated scene i give this movie my <UNK> film i've ever <UNK> award i doubt that it will be topped any time soon
<START> <UNK> <UNK> as mr is one of the all time <UNK> for comedy and remembering an innocence now <UNK> in the world i cannot understand why the networks like american movie classics and such do not show this movie although i have <UNK> it time and again br br this movie should be shown to children now for its portrayal of loyalty respect dedication and resolve to achieve the best possible on an individual basis there is so much low self <UNK> talked about in present daily lives but this movie among many many others would be a wonderful learning tool for the present day younger generation to see what can be accomplished by common sense and decency and pride in yourself and your achievements to better yourself sad that this type of movie does not appeal to modern audiences it certainly <UNK> to us <UNK> generation of yesterday old lessons are universal and timeless
<START> first i have to say that i have read everything about this subject and i know it inside out and i was excited about finally seeing it too but you have to read only the book this mini series is based on to realize that it's not the true story of what really happened almost 90 years ago it's loosely based on the facts the rest is taken from the <UNK> imagination and unfortunately these changes are anything but successful and mostly totally unnecessary br br where do i begin <UNK> and <UNK> didn't use the names and until their affair started and during it <UNK> also called <UNK> and julian it was <UNK> who chased <UNK> with a <UNK> when they were teenagers the scene when their affair started <UNK> was much more passive than represented here and certainly didn't kiss <UNK> first i could go on and on these examples were all included when the series was only just started besides all these <UNK> from the facts the characterizations are also all wrong at times <UNK> behaves like a mad woman especially the scene where she saw from the newspaper <UNK> engagement <UNK> is just ridiculous <UNK> kept her of emotion inside it was <UNK> who was <UNK> and let her feelings good or bad show all <UNK> did when she read it was that she nearly <UNK> that's all being a gentle nature harold avoided <UNK> in real life but here he is sometimes pretty stern and <UNK> harold and <UNK> always discussed their intimate things in letters not <UNK> and <UNK> i know that this series <UNK> concentrated on <UNK> and harold but that doesn't mean that all the other characters have to be mere puppets on the <UNK> here she is totally one dimensional character and the lines gave to her are mostly embarrassingly shallow actually she was intelligent gifted quite an extraordinary woman who has rarely given the credit she deserves i have always thought her much more interesting person than <UNK> in this series her <UNK> loneliness and her problems with her mother are totally ignored viewer has also little clue of her background and family what kind of relation and marriage with <UNK> she had or how hard she <UNK> over <UNK> <UNK> was the only love of her life her <UNK> <UNK> and if harold suffered during affair so did <UNK> after it her life was in ruins and it took time that she could pull herself back together again statue could have acted the role of <UNK> that much depth his character has lady <UNK> west is just a badly drawn caricature an annoying with <UNK> french accent br br the series ends to the totally badly written scene in and that was the end of this affair according to scriptwriter no it continued a whole year after that and it's ending was much more lingering and sad than what was presented here but what one cares about the stupid ending if the whole series has been stupid from the start i have to give some credit to actors they tried to make best of those roles given to them though janet <UNK> as <UNK> is the only one who really shines through one can't complain the settings either all complaints go to director and most of all scriptwriter instead of insightful character studies there are too many sex scenes and bland conversation many of the scenes are too long some are pointless and don't bring anything to the story line on the other hand many details are <UNK> or <UNK> altogether especially there should have been more information about <UNK> and <UNK> youth and how their friendship developed this is one fascinating story which would have deserved a much better adaptation maybe someday someone will do it at the moment one can make much more of this story by reading the actual book or <UNK> letters to <UNK> which are brilliant stuff
<START> one reviewer says of those who might not like this film that it will only be appreciated by film goers who weary of film as <UNK> this i feel is rather unfair to those of us who find it boring br br i have not become weary or <UNK> with film or with film makers but found this tedious and self indulgent but then it's true i'm not too big into deep <UNK> i feel that it may have great meaning for those in the know you know br br it is very slow and it spends a long time in trying to make its individual points using imagery indeed to do so but in such days as these it seems possible that a film like this might be the kind of thing that you'd come across in one of those dark and <UNK> in modern art <UNK> rather than on the screen of a popular cinema setting
<START> so this ugly guy with long nasty hair and his girlfriend end up in this house and they argue and argue about his old girlfriend there was suppose to be something scary in it but i didn't see anything scary at all there is some mention of a demon from the sea but that doesn't go anywhere at all i wish it did because then it would've taken the tension away from the jealous love triangle the title of the movie makes it look like it would be a scary and exciting movie but it is so far from it that i couldn't believe it i waited and waited for it to end and was so happy when it did it did not live up to the title like it should have so boo <UNK> <UNK> the cover had a cool picture but i shouldn't judge a cheesy movie by its cover
<START> this film did not <UNK> me while on vacation in turkey i noticed that it was playing at the local cinema and decided to take the chance to go see it the action sequences in the film are well choreographed however the story drags during the middle of the film br br one thing that i did not quite follow is how was able to get the money to <UNK> the guards br br the other thing that i did not particularly like was the missing segment of <UNK> life it did not go into detail as to how the bad guys were able to find him and re <UNK> him after he had gone missing for so long br br overall i rate this movie a 4 because i enjoyed the action sequences but they were too few to justify a higher rating as the dialog left me less than impressed
<START> if you like subtle psychological dramas thrillers this is a movie for you those who want to see an ordinary erotic thriller surely will not understand this movie as colin <UNK> obviously did when he called it rubbish but jennifer <UNK> is the real star of the movie anyway she is such a brilliant and beautiful actress along with the <UNK> and turning storyline that gets more and more psychological and makes you think about yourself the wonderful directing photography and especially the music make this movie a masterpiece also the small parts are very good especially <UNK> is terrific in her small scene i hope it gets released on dvd soon and a soundtrack album would be a dream coming true
<START> basically an <UNK> <UNK> and moronic 1 50 version of the nifty early 80's <UNK> creature feature favorite the <UNK> this <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> centers on a nasty <UNK> <UNK> monster who makes an instant meal out of any unfortunate souls <UNK> enough to go <UNK> around the <UNK> off limits gold spike mine your standard issue <UNK> assortment of <UNK> <UNK> hard <UNK> mine boss cute but insipid blonde babe <UNK> lady <UNK> <UNK> inexplicably aussie <UNK> seasoned old mine hand <UNK> <UNK> hunky jolly guy and arguably the most annoying character of the uniformly irritating bunch a nerdy <UNK> aspiring writer <UNK> who's prone to speaking in <UNK> melodramatic <UNK> trek into the dark <UNK> cave in search of gold naturally these intensely <UNK> <UNK> discover that the allegedly abandoned mine is the home of a deadly ugly multi <UNK> beast who in time <UNK> <UNK> b flick fashion proceeds to <UNK> bag the group one at a time directed co written co produced and co edited with <UNK> by <UNK> anne phillips acted with <UNK> <UNK> by a rank no name cast further marred by <UNK> pacing a meandering narrative murky under lit eye <UNK> cinematography a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> pseudo john carpenter <UNK> score and a <UNK> <UNK> jerky stop motion animation <UNK> that's only quickly <UNK> at the very end of the movie this extremely clunky amateurish and hence quite <UNK> dreadful would be <UNK> commits all the necessary bad film <UNK> to qualify as a real four star
<START> well i have to admit that this movie brought some occasional laughs to my face ok but that does not make it a good movie most of the characters are terrible stereotypes and truly unconvincing not all of them give great acting performances but some really try but fail because their characters are badly written the perfect example is julia she changes her eating <UNK> from one talk to the other on one talk she does not drink alcohol on the next she is <UNK> to <UNK> she feels too beautiful for most people in fact she is but still ends up with the perfect fit concerning the looks and refuses to give some more realistic guys a chance and so on the end is very cheesy although i like one of the final scenes when everybody finally stops talking and the director gives us a chance to catch our breath again is basically a movie that offers some cheap <UNK> mostly because it is about sex and relationships i assume and maybe some short entertainment still the whole picture is one big stereotype and nothing is really special about it
<START> this is a superb film and was immediately put in my top ten trust me i know films it's one of the movies that really makes you think not necessarily about the storyline but about yourself the film is about a fifteen year old kid <UNK> fitzgerald who kills an <UNK> boy he is sent to juvenile hall where he meets pearl madison his teacher his relationship with pearl slowly grows and eventually pearl decides to write a story on <UNK> and his peers but as he gets closer to finding out motive he learns he must deal with his own issues first br br this is a great film and a must see with great music by the <UNK> and a fantastic score watch it
<START> <UNK> is really not a movie about star trek <UNK> it's a freak show about those star trek fans who have no sense of reality as a freak show it's fine but it is a mistake to think that this movie gives you an insight into star trek fans most star trek fans cringe at what this movie shows
<START> all right let me start by saying i love the original <UNK> for the 64 the graphics were new the ships were really fast and cool the missions were a challenge but you had a <UNK> to come up with the computer didn't tell you every step of your mission you could wander and explore br br that's the first thing that's wrong with <UNK> everything you do is under a <UNK> and controlled by other people i mean shouldn't you as the leader be telling people how to handle each and every mission br br and speaking of missions why do they <UNK> the original trilogy with completely made up crap never mind br br i was so waiting for this game when i heard they were going to allow you fly through the <UNK> field from empire strikes back i think anyone who is a fan of the films wanted to do this so they give it to you it's the stupidest level in the game you start by flying through the <UNK> field with ties chasing after you and your whole objective is to get <UNK> into the field while shooting the ties you have to kill them all to get ahead hey remember how many han killed when he was in the field none they all had poor <UNK> skills compared to him i just wanted to be able to dodge the <UNK> as they came at me but instead i have to use my automatic aim guns to kill ties behind me br br that was the biggest disappointment you have no control over your flying everything is <UNK> all except for the a wing probably the <UNK> and most ship in the entire fleet but oh yeah didn't han say the <UNK> was anyway br br you finally get to the battle of <UNK> here is the ultimate level you get to destroy the death star everyone's first instinct is to pick the <UNK> and be the leader but of course you get there and have to do stupid pre chosen <UNK> like finding not to mention <UNK> the difference between the tie <UNK> this is impossible in the <UNK> by the time you have spotted one group the gets destroyed the only way to get passed this part is to pick the a wing after this you have to attack the star <UNK> and that's a real stupid chore this game makes you feel like you're the only one defending the rebel alliance br br after you <UNK> get through that <UNK> fight you get to the death star and here you might think i get to destroy the death <UNK> and again like in the <UNK> field you have to do some tedious thing while <UNK> getting passed the <UNK> of impending doom your mission is to protect the ship in front of you remember that from the return of the jedi it's so moronic because if you pick the <UNK> you'll die because you're not enough but if you pick the x wing you have to keep <UNK> and <UNK> your s <UNK> so it's a choice to either kill the bad guys or try to catch up to <UNK> who apparently doesn't know how to <UNK> thus dying in the process br br the bonus stages aren't even worth aiming for as each level just gets more and more frustrating it makes me feel the way i did when i saw the new three films upset and in need of killing something lucky for me smash bros <UNK> exists br br i hope with the <UNK> they come up with something a lot better and have the original trilogy levels to full capacity i'm going to sell this game the first chance i get
<START> in 1965 producer kevin who owns a part of the bond cinematic rights associate with <UNK> productions harry and albert <UNK> for making <UNK> the fourth film of the <UNK> franchise the star is sean connery of course br br in 1982 wins a legal battle and can produce an independent bond film never say never again is one of the two <UNK> <UNK> films made outside <UNK> the other is the 1967 comedy spoof casino <UNK> is a remake of <UNK> and stars the original bond sean connery who comes back to the role after many years of absence br br the film is released some months after <UNK> with roger moore the 13th episode of the <UNK> series at the time press calls it war of the bonds both films are a big success in 1983 even if <UNK> earns more money at the box office br br is a <UNK> film made by excellent <UNK> director <UNK> <UNK> who led the empire strikes back douglas cinematographer of <UNK> of the lost <UNK> and screenwriter <UNK> <UNK> jr who wrote the three days of the <UNK> among others br br the cast is excellent with connery a then relatively unknown kim basinger barbara <UNK> <UNK> maria <UNK> max von <UNK> edward fox br br although all that the film remains inferior to the original <UNK> it lacks many fundamental ingredients for being a real bond movie there's not the traditional gun barrel sequence there's not the james bond theme m and q are not played by the traditional actors it's a <UNK> reason <UNK> only is allowed to use these elements briefly lacks the classic cinematic <UNK> atmosphere br br on the other hand the film is exciting and enjoyable <UNK> is a very good villain and the women basinger and <UNK> are sensual and gorgeous but the main highlight is sean connery he's once again wonderful in the role he's older but looks <UNK> and <UNK> here than in <UNK> are forever his last performance in the role of the british super spy before
<START> first of all nothing will ever compare to the original movie but for gosh <UNK> they're not trying to it is just one persons opinion about what could have happened after <UNK> left scarlett at tara i for one thought it was a terrific movie and would like to add it to my <UNK> collection the scenery alone would make me want to watch the movie just view this movie as an <UNK> of the original and don't think they are trying to replace vivian leigh and clark cable and you will enjoy it a lot they really captured the spoiled <UNK> of scarlett in many of the scenes and you can see from the longing in the looks from <UNK> that he is clearly still in love with scarlett the fact that you can recognize many of the actors in the movie is another plus even though some of them have only been seen on tv i always wanted them to have other children after bonnie blue died in the movie and this satisfied my need perfectly br br
<START> this movie was an embarrassment thurman looked like she had some kind of disease and john travolta looked like he was walking in his sleep i was expecting this to be a so so sequel to get <UNK> not a half baked remake of the exact same movie except that some of the character's have different names and clothes br br i would not recommend this to movie to my worst enemy i feel like i was ripped off and hollywood has once again tricked me into seeing another horrible sequel i also suffered through alien vs predator br br the best thing that i can say about this movie is that it has my vote for the worst movie of 2005
<START> to start with i have done some further research on the film jules <UNK> directed and acted in this extremely imaginative and different film noir crime film secondly this was a very low budget film created in the <UNK> of the prime moment of film noir <UNK> the where the robbery was attempted is an actual the producers of <UNK> asked them to film their surprisingly i quote jules <UNK> in a recent interview on the subject surprisingly for some not very obvious reason they were delighted at the idea of a crime film being set in their shop br br it's impeccable characters and plot fit in so beautifully with their surroundings to add on to my praise i will say this some might say that this was a typical hollywood film on the contrary this set the base for the regular plot of a hollywood crime film br br i would like to say that i support this fresh idea of a film where not only one side wins and that side doesn't always have to be the good one for once i can say that a film is not predictable ten stars
<START> one of the most unfairly <UNK> <UNK> of all time was also one of the most popular sitcoms of the <UNK> and <UNK> br br it started life as <UNK> ever but when eric <UNK> decided he didn't want to write any more it changed into this hence the dropping of <UNK> and the <UNK> becoming the br br yes it was <UNK> domestic middle class stuff the plots ran the gamut of clichés from the boss coming to dinner the <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> sale and <UNK> relatives coming to stay for the weekend it was certainly not lazy <UNK> as for it being <UNK> it was not meant to be it was funny and well performed and that was enough br br i too loved the boom of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 'the young <UNK> etc but also enjoyed conventional stuff such as this if nothing else it provided alternative comedy with something to be an alternative to i found it sad though when the likes of ben <UNK> took against both this and benny hill well family oriented comedy has all but <UNK> from our screens but where has it left us take a look at the latest t v <UNK> all <UNK> and reality <UNK> the few comedies left are aimed at teenagers meaning they are jam packed with swearing <UNK> function jokes and explicit sexual references and they are not remotely funny either br br the <UNK> boom was good in many ways but had a dark side it made conventional sitcoms appear old fashioned drove away talented writers and performers such as spike <UNK> and ultimately led to such <UNK> drivel as <UNK> <UNK> and heaven help us if it ain't broke don't fix it
<START> when you're used to <UNK> turner in the <UNK> always rings twice and compare it to this low budget low talent low quality film well i was just embarrassed for <UNK> <UNK> more like talking and non piano playing scenes when the first non singing scene started and all the people just <UNK> <UNK> at her i was positive they were all going to roll their eyes and start leaving or at least talking among themselves she stinks c'mon let's get out of here the actors are flat emotions are <UNK> and <UNK> is a real spoiled <UNK> throughout just a 100 <UNK> this was like betty <UNK> on conscious <UNK> meets a gas station attendant in <UNK> usa the story was flat the music was flat the acting was flat her chest was no never mind i felt sad for the rest of the actors perhaps if the right actress was to have been given the lead role and the men actors had more emotion then the film could have had a chance sorry for <UNK> those of you who thought it was out of this world i wouldn't have minded if it stayed out of this world
<START> low budget mostly no name actors this is what a campy horror flick is supposed to be all about these are the types of movies that kept me on the edge of my seat as a kid staying up too late to watch cable if you liked the 80's horror scene this is the movie for you
<START> i have this movie on a collection of <UNK> b movies it's not restored in fact the audio was difficult to <UNK> for the first few minutes br br at first it seemed like a typical haunted house film and feels very much like the <UNK> of clue murder by death house on haunted hill etc br br about a half hour into the film the storyline takes a really interesting twist and it goes from being a cliché melodrama to something entirely different and far more entertaining than i had initially thought br br check it out it's a great deal of fun even if the long clips and wider shots and near lack of music score make it feel a bit <UNK> by today's standards
<START> this movie really proves that the world is all too often an unfair place especially the world of motion pictures the assignment received barely any attention upon it's release and not surprisingly <UNK> at the box office but when history will be written this movie will most surely receive some long lost praise br br thank god i'm surrounded by friends who knows what's good for me being a movie buff like myself a pal highly recommended the assignment a movie i hadn't even heard about i decided to check out what leonard <UNK> gave it and not surprisingly he gave it 1 2 knowing that this is the same grade he gave classics like alien the usual suspects and the matrix i kid you not i knew his meaning didn't mean <UNK> jack s so without <UNK> i went out and bought it on dvd this was about 3 years ago and the movie is still one of my <UNK> <UNK> in my dvd collection despite a cover design that echoes a low budget stinker with casper van <UNK> br br the assignment is expertly directed delivering some really intense moments that will hold you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie on top of that it boasts an at times brilliant story that you know will be <UNK> with unexpected twists and turns it stars <UNK> quinn in one of his best performances and serves him with great support by donald sutherland and ben kingsley who are both in great form br br something like 40 out of <UNK> user comments like this movie most of them can't seem to praise it enough so what are you waiting for if you call yourself a fan of action thrillers you should have bought it rented it seen it yesterday
<START> it's one of the of low budget independent film making that so many with so little in the way of real talent fancy themselves the <UNK> of talent <UNK> by these <UNK> <UNK> is there for all the world to see case in point flight of the living dead or as i quickly came to know it <UNK> of the living dead there's nothing wrong with paying homage to one's heroes i've done it many times over the years myself in many different ways in fact in the book the night riders co written with m <UNK> i <UNK> it in part to the six writers whose work <UNK> me still richard <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shirley jackson edgar allen poe h p <UNK> and robert e howard had it been a motion picture i would've dedicated it to the directors whose films have inspired me over the years very high up on that list would've been george romero it's nothing less than a crying shame that the makers of this film weren't truly as inspired by romero as their title suggests
<START> no <UNK> of female flesh but still not interesting at least is capable of so far greater probably <UNK> at <UNK> and starting with kiss me kill me br br the hard gore <UNK> dvd release may be cut at <UNK> minutes but this movie contains one act of <UNK> and one victim a scene with a native girl who is <UNK> and by the cannibal tribe we are warned of and who later set fire to some <UNK> <UNK> holocaust <UNK> anyone br br certainly not a cannibal flick but was there ever a decent one made avoid
<START> this comment may technically contain spoilers but it sure doesn't contain surprises br br my cousin and i rented this the other day hoping to get a good laugh at a typical amateur crappy excuse for a horror movie unfortunately we didn't get too many laughs and we certainly didn't get too many scares either br br plot outline a plane containing a company <UNK> daughter and some weird piece of technology crashes in an area where our <UNK> friend lives so the company head <UNK> a team of personalities rather than skilled hunters to recover it br br for the first 3 <UNK> of the movie things get pretty boring it mostly consists of shots of big foot lurking in the trees with the party members occasionally hearing him and passing it off as nothing we also see several shots of the party through big point of view and he apparently sees in <UNK> vision br br to set up the plot we have to watch sequences of the group sitting around the <UNK> talking about possibilities to justify the <UNK> existence and actions maybe he can dodge bullets if he sees them coming sure enough we later see he can there are many <UNK> lands that the sasquatch may live in maybe this is one of them that was over looked and obviously it is maybe the sasquatch is angry because the plane hit one of his family members and sure enough thats the case along with those scenes there are a couple of oh my god its the sasquatch oh wait its just you scenes and sadly they are among the scariest br br then finally people start dying well 2 people at least plus the bodies of past victims are discovered the death scenes are pretty lame it mostly just leaves it to our imagination by showing the sasquatch grabbing them then cutting to a different scene but first we are treated to some horrible screams off camera br br then at last we get to see the <UNK> final showdown with the monster i gotta admit i found it pretty exciting while it lasted but alas it's pretty short lived and after we are treated to an ending that makes a half <UNK> effort to seem <UNK> then some closing text with a rather boring conclusion br br i can't say i recommend this movie it's not quite bad enough to give the mystery science theatre 3000 and its definitely not scary enough and boring to enjoy as a horror movie just don't bother with it
<START> it's just that <UNK> 1 was good <UNK> 2 was better <UNK> 3 sucked now the 4th in the series which is in my opinion the best out of the series jennifer <UNK> was just great in this movie for dolls they were better than a few actors that come to mind <UNK> prince jr for one and funnier than many comedies i've seen in the past br br the plot wasn't great but i really didn't care about it just to see <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and fight each other and the ending leaves it wide open for a <UNK> sequel which i hear is in the works <UNK> hands <UNK> next week and looks to be another horror comedy but i doubt it'll top this one
<START> 'the english <UNK> can rightly be compared to the films of david lean whose sweeping epics such as <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> on the river must have inspired the director anthony the film is beautifully photographed and like is set in northern africa but during the second world war the story is complex but it <UNK> down to a forbidden love between an <UNK> and often difficult <UNK> played by ralph <UNK> and a married woman played by <UNK> scott thomas br br the story based on a novel by michael is told in flashbacks by <UNK> count de the titular character the fact that his name does not sound like he's english plays a key role in what unfolds he has been badly burned in a plane crash occurring just as the film opens and is being cared for back in europe by <UNK> an army nurse played by juliette <UNK> what makes this story epic is the vast <UNK> across place and time and the development of characters beyond that of the two ill <UNK> lovers the film makes clear that true love and passion even with <UNK> consequences can make life worth living or worth dying for if you're a romantic at heart and can appreciate a film without the standard happy endings and simple moral <UNK> you may find that 'the english <UNK> speaks directly to you br br
<START> ok let's get this out of the way first as a piece of cinema <UNK> is rubbish as a bit of cheesy entertainment for sf buffs it's got a lot of merit if you enjoy watching those old black and white sf b movies giant mutated <UNK> <UNK> or alien monsters wandering around the desert you really will get a kick out of <UNK> br br bad things the story makes little sense and the acting is pretty poor good things the special effects are halfway decent it has a different british centered story it's set in london which gives different feel to most sf movies and it has the well <UNK> <UNK> may <UNK> billed as space girl wandering around stark naked br br in short it's fun br br i've seen it half a dozen times now and every time it comes on tv i make time to watch it admittedly this is partly to do with the naked ms may but it's also to do with the enjoying a bit of <UNK> and silly sf
<START> this fake documentary is flawed on a lot of points it's badly made has uninteresting characters but the biggest problem i have with it is the basic premise br br this film uses the idea that h p <UNK> has traveled to italy and that some of his work is based on real supernatural events that he witnessed i'm willing to go along with the notion that he traveled to italy only for suspension of <UNK> but that some of his work is based on reality and that exist is total nonsense br br first of all <UNK> didn't believe in the supernatural in his letters he clearly states that he considered himself a mechanical his monsters where there to show that humans weren't so special after all another myth used in this film is that <UNK> was an expert on the occult he wasn't all his knowledge on the subject came from the most basic sources br br so we end up with a film about people at each other a lot and when we finally see the monster it's so bad that you can't even laugh at it you just feel a pain in your love for horror br br after seeing the film frankenstein <UNK> said that he felt sorry for mary shelley because he felt that her work was butchered i feel sorry for <UNK>
<START> this production was quite good the usual fabulous scenery interesting quirky characters it was just so strange not to have captain <UNK> miss <UNK> and <UNK> office <UNK> so <UNK> featured in the original <UNK> bbc mysteries br br in the original series so much took place at the office <UNK> reading the paper while <UNK> <UNK> his little gray cells miss <UNK> <UNK> in whenever needed br br <UNK> without capt <UNK> would be like holmes without watson he can most certainly solve the crime but it is not as interesting br br and what would a <UNK> mystery be without <UNK> with his impeccable manners falling for some beautiful <UNK> woman
<START> this very forced attempt to <UNK> robert altman and quentin tarantino who is wildly overrated himself is neither informative nor entertaining the character development is <UNK> and unbelievable especially in the final scene of the thugs and the little boy as other reviewers have noted also a couple of humorous moments aside the film is not as funny black humor or otherwise as the director seems to think it is
<START> <UNK> <UNK> was a waste of money and time big time i wonder y govinda did this movie govinda dude m your big fan u have to make right decisions now in choosing movie i wonder he had any role in that movie <UNK> role could be given to johnny <UNK> akshay kumar steals the show here akshay dud u rock u have created space in everybody's heart all over the world lara <UNK> u guys deserve better <UNK> <UNK> is good at his witty overall there were few scene where i laughed otherwise i was just wondering y the hell did <UNK> made such a stupid movie anyways lets wait and watch upcoming movie
<START> part of the movie's low rating is the emphasis on <UNK> and the suffering we have to endure while this is good for drama in comedy we know the pains it need not be <UNK> as a result fun with dick and jane is not an appropriate title and i was just plain disappointed failing to see any fun with dick and jane it is true that this is a copy from the movie of the same name but it fails on the execution and the title was not appropriate for the story line br br however if the movie was <UNK> to be the art of the steal and the emphasis on <UNK> slapstick comedy more takes on the robbery and the plans to steal <UNK> of course would have given the movie a major boost while at the same time the movie should show the <UNK> at least in the beginning to be a crook so it will be easier to project the pains to someone responsible early on and just leave it at that the movie suffers a viewpoint issue and with that in mind a comedy cannot work if the viewpoint is not done properly a scheming husband character who is that of a <UNK> e <UNK> on the road runner would be more funny including the slapstick comedy but in this case a steal instead of the capture of the bird with <UNK> <UNK> would be extremely funny here i mean you can make many of these and put them in the movie but since the viewpoint was done wrongly the robbery part had to be limited br br you will enjoy the movie the first 15 minutes during jim <UNK> great rise but to make the problems they had to faced to be more comical since it is a comedy that is the part that needs a major <UNK> it can be funnier if problems were faced more like john <UNK> civil action during the downfall that movie was a serious one but the problems they faced were somewhat comical
<START> this movie is the stupid comedy of the year and quite possibly the best thing from mike judge since office space if you are a mike judge fan or enjoy shows like <UNK> then you are doing yourself a grave <UNK> by skipping over this little known limited release although the dvd <UNK> very few bonus features this film is certainly funny enough to make up for it's perceived lack of value br br this movie is about an army <UNK> by the name of joe <UNK> played by luke wilson who is part of a top secret army experiment designed to <UNK> army <UNK> in peace time so that they can be in war time to fight for our country however things take an interesting turn as the general in charge of the operation is <UNK> in a prostitution ring and the experiment is all but forgotten <UNK> and his sidekick rita played by <UNK> <UNK> both find themselves awake in the year where through the course of natural selection the population of america has grown increasingly stupid now joe and rita have to find their way to a time machine to get back to the year 2005 with the help of played by <UNK> shepard br br what i really enjoyed about this movie was mike <UNK> comedic satire on the course of us history over the last 50 years and how mankind progresses over the subsequent 500 years this is most <UNK> by the advertising in the movie which has become a <UNK> of the american culture with shows like south park in the mainstream media it's easy to see how conclusions could be drawn that in the future profanity has become a marketing tool this is portrayed in the film <UNK> with subtle things such as <UNK> changing their name to butt f <UNK> and a <UNK> which displays the <UNK> if you don't smoke f you i also cannot stop laughing at jr 's role in this future with their <UNK> f you i'm eating and their <UNK> <UNK> self advertising their extra big a with more <UNK> this film contained everything i go to the movies for excellent sharp witty comedy as well as an engrossing plot make this dvd one for the ages be warned however if you are not a fan of mike judge did not care for <UNK> and <UNK> or do not have a sense of humor then this movie probably isn't a good match for you otherwise i would say this is probably the funniest movie to come out of i mean 2006
<START> prior to airport these movies were rather good they had decent special effects all star cast and good acting this movie destroyed the franchise and there are many reasons for it lets talk about the special effects wow they are horrific what was the director thinking about i know it's only 1979 but lets look at other very good special effects movies such as star wars 1977 and <UNK> 1979 i like the idea of the and this could of been the best airport movie but they did too much with it how about joe <UNK> george shooting a <UNK> out of the <UNK> window to prevent a heat seeking missile from hitting the also he is doing 90 degree <UNK> and <UNK> this completely far fetched and unrealistic wow believe me the special effects don't help this scene and really are beyond poor they almost look like a cartoon and this is how the whole movie is finally lets talk about the acting which in my opinion is extremely poor to fair at best over acting is a major issue in this movie especially george kennedy which i really like as an actor but just doesn't cut in this movie the full blame has to go on the director who did a very poor editing job and really whacked out the airport franchise too bad the isn't still used today it was a marvel of air travel
<START> not too long ago i bought a cheap vhs tape entitled just rambling along supposedly featuring laurel and hardy being somewhat familiar with their <UNK> and not <UNK> this title i made the <UNK> decision to part with a whole dollar and buy it upon playing it i identified the film as hop to it of course mr laurel was nowhere in the cast making the <UNK> of this product criminally <UNK> even worse the quality is terrible it looks like it was <UNK> from an <UNK> film source it did have a somewhat appropriate musical score actually in all seriousness the tape is worth a buck if you just want to get an idea of what the movie is like in my opinion it is a decent but <UNK> short imdb should add just rambling along as an alternate title for this film which incidentally was the name of a <UNK> stan laurel film
<START> one of the more interesting films i've seen lord <UNK> is br br black lord <UNK> is in charge of the porn industry that was br br handed down to him by <UNK> not to mention the <UNK> of fingers the <UNK> of heads etc etc br br another troma hit this beats the toxic <UNK> this is by far my br br favorite troma flick and there's a priest who fights like bruce lee nothing can beat br br that
<START> this short deals with a severely critical writing teacher whose criticism <UNK> into his everyday life when he learns why that's not a good idea we learn a bit about the beautiful craft of writing that he's been <UNK> on
<START> dark <UNK> is a very low budget production made by a bunch of rank amateurs which manages to come off as a kind of semi professional movie unfortunately the poor effects wooden acting and unoriginal story makes this a very mediocre horror slasher at best by no means is dark <UNK> the worst horror movie i've ever seen it just isn't anything special and has nothing in it to warrant a second watch or hope for a sequel you know a director has doubts about their own horror film when a there is some pointless nudity and b the movie's so short they add some rather boring <UNK> at the end credits that nobody really cares about because the movie wasn't that good a slightly better movie which i can't help feeling was the inspiration for dark <UNK> is the eighties movie <UNK> which is an ok movie but still pretty average br br dark <UNK> isn't as bad as some of the other comments say it is but don't think that you will be entertained much either one thing i also have to comment on is the character of angela who has a really terrible english accent what was the point in that to maybe give it a certain touch of class yeah right english people do not say when they mean to say water and i don't care what part of england they are from if you can't find a genuine english actress or a non english actress who can put on a brilliant english accent not many of them about then don't bother <UNK> final score 4 10
<START> the word actually means a small sharp wooden game <UNK> that is used in a game called a <UNK> to <UNK> in india the use of the word as <UNK> for the principal character is stylish as it <UNK> one who is sharp fast and can hurt badly when <UNK> in the wrong way br br is one of the best movies for <UNK> and in it is <UNK> in its pace and action the movie never <UNK> for a moment and keep you always with some exciting action the movie is set in and <UNK> and its story core is simple a rich <UNK> tries to a beautiful girl in his town and his <UNK> power and authority <UNK> the girl from seeking a justice the hero tries to rescue her and the majority of this movie portrays the week in which all this action happens br br a very exciting movie and though the story is nothing new the director and the actors receive praise for the full paced action
<START> whenever i see a video like this i have to ask myself how it was <UNK> hbo or showtime or whatever must pay for the production company to go through the motions to hire someone who may or may not actually speak english to get high and hammer out something approaching a plot to pay <UNK> with terrifying <UNK> jobs to <UNK> up and down on grossly <UNK> <UNK> to find people to design and light sets to purchase the rights to cheesy <UNK> music etc but i have to imagine this has to be a vanity project for <UNK> serving as executive producer he had to have nailed all of those girls right and not wrong about the spanish looking girl but to call the cops stunning is awfully generous in fact i'd go so far as to call them something much closer to hideous or <UNK> watching these women <UNK> around sometimes clearly high on pain killers was so far from erotic that my <UNK> actually <UNK> inside of my body gross br br why waste time with this when there's so much <UNK> available hardcore porn on the internet i wonder whether the of internet video will slowly kill the <UNK> video industry one can only hope right
<START> the japanese have probably the most sadistic movies around the world and this is one of the strongest examples with a running time at about an hour it contains enough sexual violence and gore to disgust every single sane person on earth even those who are hunting this type of movies three men and a woman are making a porn film after some normally shots which are <UNK> the girl is tied up and the <UNK> cut her food arm and <UNK> after that they make a hole in her <UNK> and a man has sexual <UNK> with her intestines he is knocked unconscious too and has his penis cut off the special effects are good for an obviously low budget production only the <UNK> cut scene looks fake and we can't talk about acting direction or screenplay after hearing a lot about this film i was very happy when i finally found it the first part is pretty boring but the second one totally f k up my mind the torture and killing scenes being some of the most extreme and disturbing i have ever seen the gore <UNK> will be satisfied by <UNK> doll of flesh but an <UNK> viewer shouldn't even read the synopsis
<START> i had been amazed by director back in 2003 his first american project <UNK> was less impressive but a decent start <UNK> is his second feature and while the visual signature is recognizable the film never rises above the level of a b movie br br it's a shame because the main premise has all the ingredients for twists and turns and the ensemble cast featuring many quality actors should be able to deliver could have made a great heist film but instead goes for an action flick then again he could have shot a cool action flick but it doesn't really deliver in that department either br br what you are left with is one implausible situation after another a group of poorly <UNK> characters <UNK> and fight over a sum of money if you look past the sharp cinematography cast and the tight music score you're left with what could have been a below average direct to video featuring van damme or seagal br br this was probably the most disappointing movie for me in quite some time
<START> as i sat watching this episode i kept <UNK> at the clock waiting for something to happen as the hour wound down i thought they were really going to give us a big pop at the end and then nothing the whole family is <UNK> around the christmas tree like something from the hallmark channel then fade to black br br perhaps one of the <UNK> season <UNK> i've ever seen nothing at all to drum up any excitement for next season the only thing thrown out as any sort of <UNK> to watch the next season was the ambiguous <UNK> offered up by agent harris while <UNK> a sub <UNK> that the guys in new york were looking to get one of the guys in new jersey wow really i would never expect something like that from <UNK> i'm on the edge of my seat br br it almost seems like they're trying to get everyone to lose interest they start more plot lines that end up just disappearing than any show i've ever seen they <UNK> and hint but rarely deliver any more br br what's with the <UNK> that hang out at the bing they keep throwing them in front of us and magically nothing happens br br paulie <UNK> <UNK> some kid after tony promised his mother that nothing would happen to her son and <UNK> gone in the wind br br and how many more meandering drug montages with christopher are we going to have to endure please have him get arrested or <UNK> or something interesting br br this was one of the few shows that i used to looked forward to watching but now bout it
<START> possible spoiler alert though there's not much to spoil about this film i saw project a part ii not having seen the first movie i don't think i missed much project a part two is not only the worst jackie chan film i've seen to date yes worse than fantasy mission <UNK> this film is one of the most unwatchable films the world has ever seen it's right up there with plan 9 from outer <UNK> on the sleep inducing scale the plot is twisted up and like a 50 foot ball of yarn the <UNK> been playing with and finally left for dead the if you could call it that seems to have been written by an annoying high school <UNK> who despite how many people tell him he's not funny is determined to get his lame humor out no matter how painful a movie is made and this movie is painfully bad the plot involves jackie chan as a navy officer <UNK> by the police force to round up all known he rounds them up in the first half hour of the movie and i <UNK> for a quick ending which i didn't get why the movie bothers to progress from this point i haven't a clue the movie drags on and on and on with no purpose no plot and attempts at humor that fail so miserably they make <UNK> top look like a comedic genius the kung fu in this movie is lame and forgettable there's better kung fu in that movie about the 3 ninja kids project a part ii is neither an action movie nor a kung fu movie it is however a complete waste of the talents of jackie chan and maggie cheung who have made films worlds superior to this as jackie chan repeatedly escapes certain death i enter blair <UNK> mode asking and wishing is he going to die now so the movie can end an example of how ludicrous this movie is jackie chan is <UNK> to another man a gang of pirates that look nothing like pirates throw <UNK> at jackie does jackie grab one of the <UNK> <UNK> and break the chain on the <UNK> no you see that would spoil the gag of him being <UNK> to another person if you have a friend who laughs at everything i encourage you to watch this movie with him or her and watch as even they won't get a chuckle out of this film if you're an <UNK> this movie is sure to put you to sleep do not operate heavy <UNK> while watching plan a part ii possible side effects include headache strain and death by boredom 0 9 stars
<START> this is one you can watch over and over and laugh just as much each time we have been on a keaton fest around here after <UNK> some of his films in this one buster is mistaken for an escaped murderer and there are lots of chase scenes and crazy scenes but also what is best about buster his creativity the opening scene is really funny and it just keeps going from there
<START> william h macy is brilliant as <UNK> caught in a desperate situation starts off with a bang and never lets up twists and surprises are fresh unpredictable use of film noir clips and frequent quotes and references to 30's and 40's flicks makes this a delightful must for movie buffs
<START> i absolutely love promised land the first episode that i saw was while i was on my mission from 2003 2005 i really loved the rich family background portrayed in the show here was a family with struggles of their own but instead of <UNK> on them they would reach out with love to others who may have had the same problems in an effort to forget themselves and go to work this is what caused me to fall in love with the show all of the actors especially <UNK> <UNK> had demonstrated the true meaning of family which has left an <UNK> mark on my life i have been down the same road they have but it has taken <UNK> of time for me to develop that kind of character i love this show so much that i have wanted to share it with friends but i was really stunned when i had heard that it was taken off the air i thought and still think they should bring it back so many lives can benefit from heaven inspired media i honestly believe that this show was <UNK> inspired because it brings the spirit every time i see just one episode this show really in my book has truly defined what a promised land is it is the love that you hold in your heart for others which brings you to a higher destination the spirit of love is one of the most potent messages in this series and all i can say is bring it back robert
<START> this is the essence of the early eighties the <UNK> the credit card machines the food the punk hair color the soundtrack i am in love with this movie this sweet intelligent romeo juliet teen flick is instantly <UNK> br br martha <UNK> is one of my favorite directors she really employs her actors like john hughes and steven <UNK> so check out joy of sex and real genius the <UNK> for valley girl are great if you can find a copy of the film buy it it's out of print and very hard to come by
<START> wait wait wait wait wait wait what this movie is terrible absolutely terrible 1 the only reason <UNK> sutherland is on the cover is to sell it to <UNK> fans only to have their hearts broken he kills one guy gets shot and dies before half the movie is over not to mention he was only in the first 10 min and then disappeared until the point which he died why put him on the cover if his character blows 2 where are the epic battle scenes promised in the preview on the back cover 3 it was way too confusing i mean whats up with the girl she had to <UNK> the movie to try to get our attention she failed 4 if <UNK> dies in a movie it fails now i am going to go watch 24 this movie fails
<START> an extremely fast paced <UNK> interesting detail rich book its a huge shame that the film had none of these qualities not only was tom <UNK> mild mannered portrayal or robert <UNK> laughable but the name changes to key characters huge <UNK> from the original story line and poor irish italian accent from played by ewan <UNK> made for the worst book to film ever br br as a huge fan of a d the book i had high hopes for a more lavish true to book detailed movie where it would start and finish just as the book did leaving me wanting more br br all the film really did was <UNK> me within the 1st 10 minutes br br what was impressive was how the sorry i couldn't even finish that sentence without laughing br br in short was the token <UNK> a very second to audrey <UNK> and there were some very nice br br i would recommend reading the book to understand that if ron howard must insist on making another book to film i would be happy saving my <UNK> 40 for a <UNK> <UNK> meal and some chicken wings far more entertaining and deeply more satisfying
<START> i'm a fan of b grade 80s films in which the hero is a bit of a bad guy a strong male who finds love and this film delivers br br towards the finish you do not know how <UNK> will not be killed and doesn't he take a beating realistically portrayed i believe however he does and it's not via some overdone <UNK> <UNK> stunt the <UNK> team he works with comes together hence the title his team are all characters people on the <UNK> at work because they don't quite <UNK> these portrayals are funny and sympathetic they have a real feeling to them they're up against an <UNK> of an assassin with a good team of his own the result is a great film noir
<START> i really wanted to see this film i thought the plot was really unique and intriguing a cop andy garcia has a son who is dying and needs bone <UNK> replacement in order to live the only match is a convicted serial killer who escapes from jail to save his son he has to track down the killer br br michael keaton plays the convict in one of many disappointing aspects of the film keaton is a great actor at times but here he is pretty much boring it's over the top to the point where you just stop caring br br garcia is better but tries too hard for a film that isn't up to par <UNK> <UNK> at one time such a promising director with films like <UNK> that <UNK> to pretty much nothing in the american market directs well enough i honestly thought the script was the <UNK> here it's just a big mess br br the film ultimately wastes a lot of good material good actors and a good director all because of a <UNK> script what should have been a tense and thought provoking film is just a hollywood action dud
<START> frank sinatra starred in this odd little short from rko that is now in the public <UNK> the film came out at about the same time the war ended and is a nice <UNK> for religious tolerance br br the film begins with sinatra on stage singing after leaving the stage he walks out into the alley and finds a group of kids picking on another because of his religion instead of yelling at the boys or helping them for that matter sinatra delivers a nice <UNK> lesson on religious and <UNK> prejudice with <UNK> the kids seem to get the lesson but then out of the blue sinatra begins singing a song that frankly get it kids would have hated he had a lovely voice but unfortunately i think this <UNK> from the excellent message he gave to the kids about tolerance it's a case of a good message with too much singing even if the guy singing is frank sinatra it's also an interesting <UNK> a nice historical piece that is often overlooked plus it's quite touching even if it seems a bit <UNK>
<START> i absolutely could not believe the levels of <UNK> on display in this production i honestly thought gay men had better taste than this i know i do br br the bulk of the blame doesn't lie with the cast but let's get them out of the way first the only one with real talent was joe <UNK> plus he had the best <UNK> in the cast he had a nice clear theatre style voice okay and voice was so so but he had a <UNK> expression in every number the rest couldn't hold a note in a bucket even though the music was obviously dubbed in after the fact must have been really dreadful hearing them live they were also all <UNK> boys except for maybe three if i wanted to see naked women <UNK> i could go to the <UNK> bars not sure why anyone would choose to film the l a production instead of new york i would imagine ny has more readily available singing talent though one would think in l a they would be able to find better looking guys apparently not br br but i <UNK> the real blame here lies with the creators and producers this score was the most banal insipid tripe i have ever heard it sounded like some theatre queens took all their musical <UNK> threw them in a <UNK> and <UNK> the goo onto a page sadly i'm sure there are many who can't tell the difference between good theatre writing and whatever this is i mean seriously i was laughing my ass off through the whole thing but not at the lame jokes i think the morbid <UNK> lover has died of aids <UNK> entitled kris look what you've missed was the most hysterical thing in the whole show genius writing kris missed wow they almost rhyme must be a good <UNK> and jesus the end of that song oh kris <UNK> kris <UNK> kris over and over my other favorite was you gotta be a <UNK> <UNK> boy to be a boy wtf the whole show was full of the most <UNK> lyrics just because they <UNK> where did these people learn to write songs apparently they listened to <UNK> and said he's not so great i can do that as <UNK> by the retarded bobby bobby bobby reference from company in one song another <UNK> why are 20 somethings singing about robert mitchum and <UNK> hunter obviously coming from the mouths of the <UNK> and not the actors again bad writing br br if you love torture and pain and i know many of you strange <UNK> do go ahead and watch it but you've been warned
<START> this is my fourth review of a charlie chan movie in series <UNK> order on these <UNK> days this is also my first comment of one i've seen previously though it's been about 24 years since then so i didn't remember much of it in this one the <UNK> detective is investigating an espionage ring that was initially <UNK> by a former scotland yard <UNK> who has turned up missing in the big apple this is the best of the chan entries i've seen so far in current memory with every clue being connected though of course if i look at them at closer examination there could still be some holes though i can't think of any right now and no 2 son jimmy victor <UNK> <UNK> is somewhat of a help when he first <UNK> the poison that results in some murders early on though of course he <UNK> a little later among the returning supporting cast from the last chan film charlie chan at the wax museum are blonde joan valerie as june preston and stanley <UNK> who's brother john g <UNK> a lost chan one called charlie chan's chance as a <UNK> expert nice intrigue especially with an exciting climax aboard a <UNK> plane oh and watch for a certain <UNK> at a police line up
<START> i did here this movie was good from various people plus i do like natalie portman and <UNK> <UNK> as well as the director <UNK> <UNK> yet after watching this movie i really had nothing to admire about it br br first off the acting was very much below average the performances were just not powerful enough to really feel shocked by what the <UNK> did <UNK> <UNK> did give a solid performance and was probably the only one who actually had as spanish accent it is pretty obvious why this <UNK> was the only one natalie portman who i think is a very good up and coming actress did not really make me feel sorry for her being tortured like the movie there was nothing to admire about her performance <UNK> who i do like gave a very average performance like the other actors giving a boring performance this movie was essentially about him since he plays <UNK> yet he did not become what he needed to be to make this movie good what about randy quaid you have just got to be kidding me him playing king carlos iv look he is great in comedies but him playing a king that just describes the whole movie for you br br the directing was just horrible in this movie when a movie is a mess there are usually two people to blame for that the director and the writer i get the feeling that <UNK> <UNK> really didn't want his actors to put a spanish accent on from the very few battle scenes in here they were all displayed horribly also as a director he needs to give you the feeling of shock of what the <UNK> did after this movie i felt like i could <UNK> about the event to sum it all up he poorly shot the scenes and misguided the actors br br the writing which was also done by <UNK> <UNK> was just as bad or maybe even worse than the directing there really was nothing memorable of the movie except for one seen where <UNK> does get the same treatment that <UNK> character has gotten other then that the movie did not give you the feeling of the time period and at least it could have made up for it with a quote or two br br after finishing this movie i was just looking at the t v thinking ok why should i care about any of this i do care and are very much interested in history but when movies like this come up it feels like the producers robbed you of something good that could have been taken away from the movie when movies are this bad we highlight a lot of the technical faults in a movie than if it was good like the accents i'm not sure people would have <UNK> the lack of spanish accents if this movie was good br br whole point of this review is to say just don't watch it
<START> acting of course think about it closet land could easily have turned out so horribly an entire movie filmed in one room with only two people they better have some damned interesting things to chat about br br but it didn't turn out horribly on the contrary thanks to incredible portrayals by both <UNK> and <UNK> closet land is a masterpiece in its own right br br that's not to say it is for everyone persons who have had their attention <UNK> <UNK> through <UNK> sex scenes and random gun fire may have trouble <UNK> closet land however those who can appreciate good story telling without explosions should give it a look no matter how many video stores you have to call to find someone who has it in stock
<START> i was born in <UNK> china and moved to the united states at the age of 9 been home to <UNK> several times since and loved it each time one of the many things i love about <UNK> is the people and the ambiance they bring to the city you which translate more accurately to if you have something to say say it nicely delightfully and <UNK> captures that feeling of <UNK> i suppose you would have to have lived in and kinda understood <UNK> and its people to get the most out of this movie though you might enjoy it regardless br br the story is not complicated intentionally kinda quirky and captivating i will leave it to unfold by itself and not tell you too much except some comments each detail from the pictures on the wall to the <UNK> the streets and <UNK> feels like home zhang <UNK> most likely shot everything on location but more importantly the characters our hero the girl the kind hearted but unfortunate <UNK> man and the night club owner are each native to <UNK> and lovable in their distinct ways their conversations really capture the essence of each character the story mostly driven by situations and conversation save the brilliant near the end is intriguing and always interesting br br i am 21 now my parents and i love this movie we are always so amazed by zhang <UNK> ability to <UNK> ordinary people into believable screen characters and everyday life into extraordinary situations br br keep cool different hilarious meaningful
<START> mud and sand is one of stan <UNK> spoofs of the popular movies at the time this one being of <UNK> blood and sand hence stan being while partly inconsistent on characterization how did he defeat those <UNK> in the beginning is not explained this was mostly funny from beginning to end with one of the best sequences being a dance he does with his then common law wife mae laurel another funny sequence concerns his <UNK> with <UNK> a femme fatale <UNK> de sole while his wife <UNK> is waiting for him that shows some glimpses of his later innocent character with oliver hardy well worth seeing for anyone interested in seeing mr <UNK> early work before his <UNK> <UNK> that made him popular around the world
<START> this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon later episodes in the series of which there were four in total were not actually based on original dr seuss material although all but the last continued to use his familiar <UNK> style the three sequels were <UNK> <UNK> 1953 how now 1954 <UNK> on planet <UNK> 1956 although he also appeared in a later episode of mr <UNK>
<START> well this film came on on a <UNK> at the cute little actress who played billy caught my attention initially and after the 1st 15 minutes i was held captive to my television till the very end it has you on the edge of your seat then throws in clever bits of comedy during the most tense sequences br br the only draw back is that the story was not substantial enough to fill hour an a half film causing certain sequences to drag just a little nonetheless it was still very entertaining and i recommended it to all my co workers the next day
<START> <UNK> <UNK> looking as sexy as ever plays a spoiled but innocent daughter of a french <UNK> she cons one of her father's top <UNK> <UNK> michel into marrying her and it turns out to be the best thing for both of them michel is soon <UNK> with his old girlfriends and in order to teach him a lesson <UNK> <UNK> heavily with a married prince charles michel is surprised by his jealousy a cat and mouse game ensues between and michel i'll have an affair no you won't and finally michel realizes she just might and <UNK> to give up all the other ladies in his life <UNK> and michel settle <UNK> into their happily ever after while prince charles <UNK> home to england br br it's an admittedly light piece but it's incredibly charming while some may fault it as a product of it's time i found that completely enjoyable worthy of a rental
<START> the reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short every element of the piece <UNK> in <UNK> a pure emotional response to the script well acted directed shot and written i was surprised to hear that there was no rehearsal before shooting not even a read through the performances stand as testament to some fine <UNK> acting in response to a well written script the actresses work was excellent and there was never an indication that their work would slip into the purely sentimental less is much better in this case this film is a prime example of how these low budget <UNK> benefit actors as well as film makers
<START> sigh i'm <UNK> when i see a short like this get attention and <UNK> and <UNK> i saw this film at a festival before the filmmaker got any attention and forgot about it immediately afterwards it was mildly annoying to see it <UNK> the grinch who stole christmas heart gag along with the narration the set design seen many times before the whole weak tim burton ish style and the story that goes nowhere and we got the joke about shooting the <UNK> with the 45 the first time alright br br but i guess what's really <UNK> is that it even <UNK> its basic concept from a comic book circa 1999 called <UNK> the cute little dead girl by roman <UNK> as any quick internet search will reveal i mean what is this this is what they base a hollywood contract on and opens doors in canada for a filmmaker give your head a shake as don <UNK> might say
<START> this is a below average martial arts films which is worth watching for the comedy value due to the part where a pair of symbols are used as weapons thats it really there is much to say about this film it lacks in every department because the martial arts are not that great either and with all movies of this type the dubbing as bad
<START> as one other imdb reviewer puts it imagine 2001 a space odyssey in the desert and you wouldn't be far off from a brief of what to expect from this piece of cinema i deeply hesitate to use the word film a lecture on philosophical views on <UNK> the <UNK> surrounding <UNK> existence the before and after that was has been the what is and the what will be this for some maybe a 2001 on sand but they tackle different philosophical <UNK> one about evolution and the future the hope and potential for mankind while <UNK> morgana itself is a somewhat more <UNK> trek i only hope i can convey it effectively enough br br style will not to be <UNK> liking and those who are not of a perceived hardcore branch of cinematic viewing may and most likely will find this extremely hard going and may not even see it through to its finale after <UNK> minutes <UNK> together a montage of footage from the <UNK> including <UNK> villagers and various other places for a somewhat <UNK> ending music of various genres and an almost mythical narration <UNK> morgana is severely slow paced but ultimately hugely rewarding br br opening with a montage of various filmed shots of planes landing for <UNK> on five minutes you already arrival at the introduction of the film immensely confused and the sense that this will not be like anything you have seen before echoes clear in your mind divided into three sections creation paradise and the golden age <UNK> morgana attempts and succeeds in being able to <UNK> images of the natural beauty of the desert with the man made <UNK> that <UNK> it its three segments are narrated by different persons each <UNK> specifically to the particular section they are <UNK> and provide extra emphasis on the long and desert montages br br <UNK> morgana is a film dealing with the existence of man on our earth it looks at the natural beauty the earth was designed for and <UNK> looking at the potential beauty we have within us more notably shows us our negative <UNK> to the world in which we live each shot has been <UNK> constructed using what can only be described within the context of this film as 'the holy <UNK> of in pictures words and music each part of these three pieces provides something notably to each shot but when brought together they create something greater than the whole of their parts they create <UNK> beauty and deep thought within our minds i will not be able to do this film the justice it deserves with mere words alone perhaps if i had pictures and a score and i do know this will not be appreciated by the masses but this a profound and i will not use the term art film because this is simply just art this is moving art which moves the mind and <UNK> the soul whether or not <UNK> is your want is irrelevant because this film is about intelligent design
<START> i caught this movie on local t v at about 4 30 a m i didn't have expectations for it but after the opening credits i knew i was into something good br br there are situations that are left for your interpretation to find out what really happened so your attention is a key factor br br the whole psychological thriller situation deals a lot with character development and the way things are executed by the main character br br your sub conscience also plays an important part because through a series of events and dialogs you will be able to make a correct interpretation and generate an opinion br br the technical aspects are very good really good in fact kelly <UNK> is extremely sexy and she's candy for the eye although she's most of the time in her white clothes br br the fear factor is almost <UNK> but there's plenty of mystery and tension to dig from br br i would recommend it for those who enjoy supernatural and psychological thrillers
<START> the other is a supposed horror movie made during the 1970s it is not to be confused with the similarly titled the others which starred nicole kidman br br the plot is as follows a woman with strange supernatural powers teaches her twin <UNK> something referred to simply as the game one of these twin boys <UNK> is supposed to be good the other one holland is supposed to be evil br br the idea sounds interesting enough as an abstract concept and the movie was adapted from a novel i can only hope the novel was interesting as the movie was incredibly boring from beginning to end br br the execution of this movie is very much like a tv movie of the kind uk residents might see on channel 5 in fact this movie looks like it was made to be the daytime afternoon movie for this tv channel a slight <UNK> to one or two scenes and this would be a u rated movie of the kind disney produce but even the youngest of children are more likely to be bored than scared by the other br br you don't need to check out the director's <UNK> to realise horror is not his <UNK> br br mr <UNK> relies heavily upon the characters to drive the story this is obvious from the get go i haven't seen any of his other movies but to kill a <UNK> is a highly regarded crime movie on this site unfortunately in the other the characters are given too little to do and the plodding script <UNK> the movie never really takes off in the way one might expect br br the direction is as bland as you could possibly find almost every single scene takes place in the daytime think about this a scene shot in the open landscape in rural america during daytime with the camera focusing on vast area does it sound scary or atmospheric believe me it isn't it comes across as something more akin to an episode of little house on the <UNK> than a horror movie and yes both the aforementioned tv series and the other were shot in california br br there is a noticeable absence of danger or <UNK> that makes the whole exercise seem rather pointless br br the ending was clearly meant to be highly disturbing and perhaps influenced that of another movie from this time period i won't reveal which movie but i'll give 2 clues a young boy was a main character and the movie is well known and i'll add that the concept was used to much greater effect in the latter movie br br the acting is actually quite good and is the only reason why i have awarded 2 stars the actors playing the twin boys along with the actress playing the grandmother all try hard with the poor material they are given br br diana <UNK> is completely wasted in a <UNK> role as the mother of the twin boys do not be fooled by her high billing on the cast list she gets very little screen time and her presence just comes across as a <UNK> to cash in on her long established tv career in order to help attract tv viewers br br i paid careful attention to the <UNK> on the back of the dvd cover of the region 2 version in the uk comparisons were made to the exorcist which i thought was a complete insult to that movie there is no comparison the exorcist had everything this movie should contain but does not suspense tension tongue in cheek humour highly disturbing content great acting superb characterisation and viewer involvement ironically the exorcist was made only a year later but in terms of style and execution seems like decades ahead of the bland drama known as the other the other comes across as a work that would have seemed tame in the 1950s let alone the 1970s br br the 1970s was a great era for horror movies with classics such as the exorcist the omen the texas chainsaw massacre the legend of hell house <UNK> lot to name just a few being produced for this reason the other proves an even greater disappointment br br if anyone finds the synopsis of the other interesting they might want to read the book or do a little more research on what the book was about i would advice everyone to skip the movie
<START> i had been looking forward to this movie since lost world came out it didn't bother me that lost world wasn't as intellectual as the original and here i was just hoping for a good monster movie it was all about dinosaurs eat people however it was disappointing even on that level br br for starters there were not enough people to eat and while i'll keep it a secret how many people get eaten it was not enough also while there was no <UNK> of variety in the dinosaur community there were not nearly enough dinosaurs and many dinosaurs like the <UNK> back and has a club on its tail just made cameos and didn't do much considering how cool they are br br start spoilers then there were the <UNK> the figures i've read put their body weight at about 15 pounds while the movie made them look closer to 300 worse they didn't get to eat anybody or even splatter them on the rocks by dropping them from high up there was no ending to the movie either it was just all of the sudden credits end spoilers i'm left wondering if the edition i saw was missing 40 minutes of film br br my only conclusion can be that they taught the <UNK> to stick their long <UNK> into your <UNK> and get your 7 go rent the <UNK> series at least you won't be disappointed
<START> aaron carter plays the pop star j d mcqueen in this movie surprise surprise this is a typical movie where the leading lady jane has a huge crush on j d mcqueen the pop star as well as many other girls but she's the lucky one that gets to spend the days with j d and forms a relationship with him that is more like a fantasy j d has to go to a public school to keep his <UNK> grade up in order to do his summer tour problem is j d isn't good at <UNK> he finds the <UNK> person in school jane to <UNK> him jane <UNK> and falls in love with j d j d in return falls in love with as well but j d <UNK> up and has to fix everything in order to win the girl and make the summer tour the movie is definitely worth watching aaron will be a great actor
<START> a previous imdb reviewer has stated that <UNK> is a <UNK> <UNK> that's the other <UNK> term of a german musical called <UNK> by day you by <UNK> apparently that reviewer is unaware that both of these films have borrowed their premise from and an english play written by john <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> this play deals with two who rent the same room from an <UNK> <UNK> each man believing himself the sole tenant because the two men have different work <UNK> the <UNK> is not discovered straight away this play was once so popular in britain that <UNK> box and cox <UNK> became a common term for an <UNK> in which two people willingly shared <UNK> meant for only one person br br the <UNK> of <UNK> and its predecessor is that the two <UNK> are now a man and a woman who inevitably develop a romance as is usual in these <UNK> movies the guy and the gal <UNK> each other until they fall into each other's arms <UNK> boy br br the <UNK> in this film is played by george sidney a character actor who <UNK> in playing jewish stereotypes that were meant to be sympathetic george sidney was never as annoying as the <UNK> harry green the jewish equivalent of <UNK> <UNK> but <UNK> depictions of jewish characters are still exaggerated and embarrassing to watch br br the single most notable thing about <UNK> is that to my knowledge this is the earliest hollywood film to make reference to hitler and the rise of <UNK> at one point in this movie <UNK> sidney discovers his teenage son <UNK> engaged in <UNK> on the walls and his son are clearly meant to be jewish admittedly nobody in hollywood in 1933 had any real idea of what hitler was planning for the jews in europe still it's surprising to see a film depicting a jewish teenager who thinks that <UNK> are a joke his father is quite properly <UNK> by this display of the nazi symbol br br a very shameful aspect of hollywood history is the documented fact that all of the major hollywood studios continued to do business with the third <UNK> as late as 1939 hollywood's leading ladies were <UNK> documented as so that their films could be distributed in nazi germany and <UNK> for the same reason hollywood's leading men were documented as and except for <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> century fox all the hollywood studio executives who in this policy were jewish but clearly had no <UNK> to doing business with hitler i'm surprised that <UNK> contains a scene depicting <UNK> <UNK> as this sequence would have rendered the film <UNK> in germany and <UNK> maybe the scene was cut out for german release it isn't crucial to the movie's plot apart from this the movie contains nothing notable robert does his usual unfunny <UNK> characterisation i've never understood the appeal of this man i'll rate <UNK> 4 out of 10
<START> first of all i personally adore demons and demons 2 i saw them although it was hard to find good horrors without good official movie <UNK> here in russia when i was a kid and that is an <UNK> part of my <UNK> then i heard nothing about mr <UNK> then i saw his ghost son well it is certainly not a good coming back why was the leading character whom we never really knew to at least like him in accident in the middle of an empty road why do african servants say so dumb and stupid things about human soul why is the plot so primitive haven't we seen enough ghosts for 100 years of movie production it is clear that <UNK> <UNK> has nothing to show us so far it is a shame
<START> boring horrible piece of italian euro trash about a scientist who seems to spend most of his time <UNK> beer this is what makes him american right our scientists spend most of their academic life <UNK> out of their minds sure that's where all the really great theories come from who's studying something <UNK> calls fish <UNK> <UNK> who knows he hears a weird sound through his <UNK> proving that his radio is picking up a station in at the same time a jack <UNK> girl with one of the worst most <UNK> <UNK> of bad 80's hair that it has ever been my pleasure to witness is trying to calm down the <UNK> in the she works at as they're apparently upset about the amount of fish she's been <UNK> out lately the beginning of the film was a really badly colored storyline about two annoying very italian people who's boat is attacked by something unseen under the water the whiny woman is never seen again best part of the story and the <UNK> corpse is found with no legs the dim alcoholic scientist who has an inexplicable english american italian accent and the stick girl with the <UNK> hair begin to <UNK> that there's some kind of giant monster lurking under the <UNK> off the coast of italy <UNK> florida br br they <UNK> the help of an <UNK> to set up an underwater mike so that the monster can sing <UNK> this guy has a beautiful girlfriend who's only <UNK> is that she <UNK> peter <UNK> but for some reason he's sexually drawn to the <UNK> <UNK> with the hair a situation that leaves one <UNK> br br the dubbing is awful the editor a <UNK> and the storyline generally a yawn there's a bit about how this weird scientific corporation <UNK> <UNK> this monster giant shark <UNK> <UNK> thing for some reason that makes no sense and a really unpleasant <UNK> haired guy goes around killing women again for no apparent reason a stupid sheriff and his <UNK> up deputy are along for the ride along with a female scientist who we know is smart because she wears huge glasses at one time the woman scientist takes on the huge terrible monster yeah right ed <UNK> giant <UNK> was more believable with only a small and she wins the contest <UNK> for skinny little women who obviously make the best monster hunters br br the solution to the problem of the giant thing is to blow up half of the <UNK> leaving a dead zone for several miles in every direction to hell with <UNK> and the environment right we have to kill this giant monster at the end the <UNK> and his <UNK> love ride off into the sunset on her <UNK> which is o k since she's gotten over her death and he's not very upset that his girlfriend got whacked by the crazy guy with the <UNK> hair <UNK> for true love wait a minute isn't there something <UNK> about all this
<START> i have not seen this movie since 1979 when i was a teenager i grew up with the <UNK> street muppets and later realized how much effort and time went into bringing these characters to life jim was a genius and master when i watched this movie the other day it took me back in time when i was younger and things seemed so much simpler for this bit of time travel i rate this movie a 10 br br the plot line explores how <UNK> goes from the swamp to hollywood the laughs and gags are classic i am glad these films are still around for the next generation i hope i never out grow the magic of the muppets
<START> the title of this documentary is very misleading at no time during the documentary do they show how the introduction of the <UNK> <UNK> fish into lake victoria has cause any of the problems facing the town of the film tries to place the problems of on an <UNK> cause but the truth of that matter is the problems <UNK> from a <UNK> outside force the documentary is very <UNK> paced with no narrative what so ever instead it relies on small of text between none related segments to display bits of information that do little to add or expand of the subject matter there are only two attempts to <UNK> the <UNK> effects of the <UNK> <UNK> fish one is a small segment about 10 seconds long where they interview the factory <UNK> where the fish is <UNK> and he briefly mentions how 50 years ago the <UNK> <UNK> was introduced into the lake and it consumed the other fish species the film maker makes no attempt to follow up on the matter or go deeper into it the second attempt is when within this documentary they film the showing of another documentary that is discussing the <UNK> impact the <UNK> <UNK> has introduced and again no real attempt is made to expand on just how devastating the problem has become br br the subject matter that this documentary does delve into has nothing to do with the <UNK> fish itself and more to do with the problems facing most african countries the film tries to link the introduction of the <UNK> fish with aids poverty and <UNK> in but never makes a direct connection as any intelligent person well read with problems in africa the problems shown here are not unique to but affect most of africa and have nothing to do with the fish it would have been great if the film makers would have shown how the local economy or life was before the fish was introduced and how it has been <UNK> <UNK> by the introduction of the fish but they don't the fact of the matter is that many of the people they interview say that the fish has provided jobs and opportunity for many yes things are bad within the town of but they are far worst in other parts of the country and continent for that matter br br a weak attempt by the documentary makers to link the fish to <UNK> problems in is quickly <UNK> by the documentary itself first off is a very large country and lake victoria is only a small portion of the country many of the individuals interview actually say that they can to the fishing town on the lake to find a job and feed their families because things were so bad in other parts of the country br br this documentary is very weak has no narrative and makes no attempt to actually link anything they display to the <UNK> <UNK> it plays on people's emotions by displaying images of the <UNK> of poverty <UNK> and aids making no attempt to show you how any of this is unique to the lake victoria region of or directly related to the <UNK> fish the fact is most of the problems have more to do with war <UNK> and christianity than and <UNK> effect of the <UNK> fish itself
<START> there are so very few films where just the title tells you all you need to know about the film such a film is i was a communist for the fbi another example would be i married a monster from outer space br br the really interesting thing about this film is how in <UNK> name did this get nominated for an oscar in the documentary category it is not a documentary in any sense of the word it's not even in that hybrid category of <UNK> it's just a rather <UNK> film about the work of an fbi undercover agent named matt who <UNK> the communist party in <UNK> and got active in trying to take over the union for the <UNK> and <UNK> on said activities to his <UNK> in the fbi br br a documentary of that work might have been interesting but what we got was a film to fit those paranoid times i found it fascinating that when finally broke his cover it was to the house un american activities <UNK> rather than the trial in new york of the communist party leaders there was a moment in the film where head communist james <UNK> tells his followers to start <UNK> the word that the house un american activities <UNK> was composed of a bunch of right wing <UNK> looking to get their names in front of the camera now what could have given him that idea anyway just connect the <UNK> and no doubt the word their came from j edgar hoover trying to give some <UNK> to <UNK> by having an effective undercover come out there rather than at an actual trial little thing there called cross examination br br warner brothers who produced i was a communist for the fbi later produced big jim which starred john wayne about a <UNK> investigator in hawaii <UNK> did grab on to credit for the work done by the <UNK> <UNK> in breaking up a communist spy ring there among the but at least in john wayne's film nobody claimed it was a documentary br br frank <UNK> is in the title role as and his fbi <UNK> are richard <UNK> and philip carey dorothy hart plays a <UNK> school teacher who says that there are 30 or so like here in that school system the young among whom is ron <UNK> son she has a change of heart about the <UNK> and <UNK> has to save her from a homicidal fate planned by his superiors ironically hart left the movies and went to work for all places the united nations which as we know has been accused often of being a communist nest in the usa br br over half a century later and we really have very few objective works on film or in print about the communist party of the usa they were in fact a very active bunch in the labor movement the real heroes in stopping them were labor <UNK> like walter in the or david in the but since they were people of the left they just don't have the following on the right to be suitable propaganda material br br anyway i was a communist for the fbi is an <UNK> work based on a real life character and a testament to those paranoid times
<START> the second part directed rapidly by joe <UNK> <UNK> in all kinds of of exploitation and interpreted again by miles <UNK> the budget of the movie to be <UNK> or minimal in spite of not being a better movie of his not <UNK> entertained <UNK> 2 either it has something something that makes it his introduction you prop it explains origin to us with images of the first part the script is incredible is like any comic book of the brilliant roy thomas has so fantastic elements inside world of the sword and such fantasy as invisible men black gentlemen cannibals monkeys the role of the villain this one interpreted brilliant the final this struggle very well lacking <UNK> violence and blood but this one well never it becomes boring it has everything what there was lacking <UNK> 1 be <UNK> with to my me 4 5
<START> even though this film's trailer and poster imply that sally <UNK> was an important character i might not have been as shocked to discover she was just a minor and i do mean minor character if this movie was suppose to being told by <UNK> very own family i mean if you are going to tell the story of a member of your family that has been ignored by history would you really tell it with the man who <UNK> her to obscurity at the main character his other lover who happens to be white as the actual love interest i know i wouldn't i am as pale as they come and normally a big fan of <UNK> flicks but i couldn't stomach this film's treatment of poor sally <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is insipid and unconvincing kline over acts as always as does <UNK> while <UNK> an english accent at least i assume that's what he's attempting and the tone <UNK> <UNK> between <UNK> and <UNK> as with most pet projects <UNK> a celebrity couple it's a relief when this shoddy piece <UNK> to it's forced and jarring conclusion
<START> is my favorite comedy movie of all time both <UNK> and salman khan have acted brilliantly while acting was far better than salman <UNK> khan is known as <UNK> in bollywood and he proves it in every of his film br br the story moves around two young guys <UNK> <UNK> khan and <UNK> salman khan both are from poor families and are a big <UNK> they want to become rich without bearing any pain so when they hear about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> daughter of mr <UNK> <UNK> who comes to india to find his <UNK> they both fool their fathers to marry <UNK> and the journey begins there is also a twist in the movie that makes movie even more funny <UNK> <UNK> is in double role and mr and has acted brilliantly as he always does <UNK> kapoor crime master <UNK> also adds a great comedy br br this movie is a <UNK> <UNK> comedy from first minute till last and it is one of classic comedy movies of bollywood
<START> according to <UNK> in his <UNK> de la <UNK> robert <UNK> 1973 page <UNK> character was not very <UNK> with women he had quite a number of <UNK> passions with female members of the <UNK> to whom he dedicated some but musicians even <UNK> did not qualify for husbands of fine ladies <UNK> was a servant of <UNK> von <UNK> died from drink or poison and was according to a frequent <UNK> of street prostitutes in vienna a british <UNK> newman says that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> before he was 40 that he became deaf because of that is possible but not certain br br the <UNK> <UNK> was premiered on may 7 <UNK> in the in vienna along with the <UNK> of the house <UNK> and the first three parts of the this was the <UNK> first on stage appearance in twelve years the hall was packed although the performance was directed by michael the <UNK> <UNK> shared the stage with him quiet br br so what remains of this female fantasy ed harris interpretation and characterization are quite good but too linear based on the painting by date i have it in front of me it shows a man that <UNK> perhaps hates the world with good reason
<START> crazy six is torture it must be albert worst film even blast and <UNK> are better i <UNK> believe how boring this film is how this even got <UNK> i saw this movie about 3 years ago and the only thing i remember is how bad it was this <UNK> good bad movie it is simply bad bad bad bad bad movie br br 1 out of 10 <UNK> out of
<START> back in the dark days of 1990 the hoped for heir to the spielberg throne after the failure of supposed <UNK> kid phil was <UNK> believed to be pretentious spielberg wannabe david mickey evans evans managed to <UNK> the studios for over a million dollars <UNK> baby <UNK> executives into believing his screenplay a combination of nostalgic 1960s references and a disturbing drama about child abuse somehow <UNK> good storytelling and a decent film br br as rod stewart once sang look how wrong you can be br br but the artsy <UNK> e t inspired script convinced enough people he was the next chosen one the new spielberg and so a deal was struck to not only buy the script for more money than 99 percent of the world's population will ever see in their lifetime but for evans to direct the film as well even though he'd had never directed anything in his life br br hey how hard can it be to be another film making genius after all br br two weeks into the shoot columbia found out his <UNK> were called totally <UNK> by the studio or at least those level headed enough to not to have fallen under the e n c <UNK> new clothes spell all his footage was <UNK> and recycled into guitar <UNK> br br so what's a studio to do after sinking 10 or 20 million dollars into something they still believed represented the <UNK> of steven spielberg hire spielberg himself to save the day columbia probably tried that br br enter old pro richard <UNK> hey he may not be a cinematic genius but he gets the job done superman wasn't too bad after all and the first lethal weapon was pretty good br br so <UNK> steps in and grabs the directorial <UNK> fortunately he manages to convince columbia that the worst of the film's insipid fantasy sequences which would have played out like a ten year <UNK> acid trip have to go unfortunately he leaves in the crying buffalo <UNK> how poetic and the ridiculous pseudo spielberg fantasy ending complete with clueless mom perfectly content for the rest of her life to get <UNK> from her missing son as he circles the globe in his red <UNK> right br br but <UNK> did manage to get a decent performance out of <UNK> wood and <UNK> <UNK> as the idiot mom wasn't bad either maybe <UNK> should be <UNK> maybe he's not such a phony hollywood hack as everyone has always believed br br the only reason i'm giving this over baked misfire a 2 rating is that someone was smart enough to cast the great john heard but in the wrong part of course the kids do okay though tom <UNK> horrible overly <UNK> narration nearly destroys every scene it <UNK> upon br br one might think that after the david mickey and phil and <UNK> of the world the studios might finally wise up one might hope that these hype driven film making <UNK> might prevent the <UNK> new clothes syndrome from ever its ugly head again br br <UNK>
<START> very strange but meant to be this director is his own man even through there are <UNK> if polanski bergman and <UNK> at least in the episode no 6 the <UNK> tom one what made it all so strange and reminiscent of the above three artists was that it went all over the place you never knew where it was headed and could have ended <UNK> and finally when it did end could have kept going the ending is hardly a <UNK> nobody could tell you what these two characters would be doing in even the next frame one other thing should be said about the director no wonder kubrick found him fascinating there is a lot of eyes wide shut in this episode somehow in the direct approach to character the realistic fantasy elements of both a kubrick placement of the camera without any of the stark effects much more washed out and <UNK> not as over that said back to the beginning still this guy has his own things to say and says them well yet for some reason there is not a single scene i ever want to see again but definitely did not feel ripped off in the least watching it one time around but i did keep getting the feeling of three or four other directors ghosts moving through the parade <UNK> everything the <UNK> being that it was only episode six the other nine might give me entirely different takes but since this episode <UNK> around <UNK> looking the absolute <UNK> of film i will say this he took none of the usual <UNK> definitely went his own way while carrying the <UNK> of a lot of good directors behind him
<START> creating a comedy is like walking a pretty thin tight rope it either works or it does not <UNK> boy is one of those movies that does not work it may have a few very funny parts but for the majority it's just a terribly unfunny comedy from the usual supporting characters in adam sandler films sans sandler himself he's just a producer br br alex allen <UNK> is a game <UNK> he's 35 and is the best <UNK> and game player at his otherwise kid filled <UNK> he ends up getting his apartment and his stuff taken from him for not paying the bills as it turns out his roommate had just been spending the rent money on <UNK> and not paying the <UNK> desperate he moves in with his grandmother <UNK> doris roberts of everybody loves raymond and her two roommates br br that's the basic plot of the film thrown in with subplots about a hot new girl named samantha linda <UNK> from her days as <UNK> in scooby doo trying to get the to complete a new game as fast as they can a robot like game creating <UNK> j p joel moore who works with alex and wears much of the same clothes as neo in the matrix and of course all sorts of sex and drug related jokes that's it br br the problem with the film besides the fact that the real conflict in the film occurs and is resolved within the last fifteen minutes of the film is that it just is not funny it is totally mind numbingly boring and only <UNK> funny nothing really happens at all no emotion no real sense of direction and a whole ton of intense swearing you find yourself maybe laughing at a few funny <UNK> that the actors say but otherwise sit in complete boredom wishing you had not even bothered with the film how this film was <UNK> and how fox thought it could make money will always remain a mystery to me br br there's just no entertainment value to come from it none of the actors are actually putting in good performances they are just acting like idiots for the camera and hoping for the best <UNK> comedy has been done before multiple times and on occasion actually works harold and kumar go to white castle and <UNK> and confused come to mind here it just makes for making the film even less funny than it is already the random inclusion of a monkey and a pair of bare breasts really does not make the film any better either br br other than a few funny one liners this movie should just be out right missed altogether it's not very funny the entire plot is silly it's boring and it just makes for one horrendous film avoid it like the plague br br 1 5 10
<START> what should have been a dramatic tale of life on the river murray turns out to be a silly <UNK> romance about an english <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with aussie accent who falls for the <UNK> first mate john waters of a <UNK> <UNK> br br the first half of this four and a half hour mini series shows some promise but it soon falls flat as it becomes predictable and thin some real <UNK> and spark was needed in the plot to give the movie some life gus <UNK> early exit didn't help as his character seemed to me to be the only interesting one br br perhaps the longer t v version has more depth because this video translation certainly lacked it br br sunday june 27 1993 video
<START> i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad even worse than <UNK> that movie was bad it was kind of like they popped it out in a week looked to be very low budget only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor everything it just blew
<START> this is a wonderful movie i've only seen it twice and i've been looking for it again for ever i'd buy it if i could find it while it's sad it shows three things how much a man can love a woman how hard some people want something and how hard people work to overcome their limitations
<START> <UNK> jules <UNK> france 1955 br br to me it seems a very <UNK> idea to attempt a hollywood remake of jules <UNK> 1955 classic <UNK> planned for release in 2007 al pacino apparently is gonna play the lead taking on the role of tony le <UNK> business how they're gonna pull this off br br ironically <UNK> was <UNK> in hollywood and went on to try his luck in france and made this little masterpiece <UNK> called by some the of all caper and heist movies in my opinion it remains a one of a kind classic beautifully filmed with one of the most memorable endings ever to be put on film whatever one's opinion of the film br br in the last couple of years <UNK> has become dangerously <UNK> nevertheless this french noir classic shouldn't be forgotten go see it before the remake is out there in order to have some <UNK> for comparing the two br br camera <UNK> 9 10

<START> deep blood its one of those movies you here about and you say not another italian jaws ripoff well deep blood is far from that it is a cheap as film making can get and on the other side it is creative as well in jaws and all the other shark films we all have seen or herd about they all use fake made sharks well in joe <UNK> film he takes a new approach by using all stock footage for his shark scenes this is one of the many reasons i like deep blood so much is because it didn't use stock footage br br in deep blood an ancient indian spirit <UNK> a beach town in the form of a <UNK> shark in joe <UNK> shark classic deep blood br br it seems that a native american elder once warned a group of youngsters about this great evil in the sea and years later the friends are forced to face their fears when one of them is killed by a shark in a series of attacks along their <UNK> now it's up to the remaining few to make sure that this monster is killed even if it means heading out to sea to do it br br joe <UNK> directed and produced this film under his company the <UNK> released in 1989 and was later used in bruno <UNK> cruel jaws jaws 5 along with many other shark films joe <UNK> shark entry is a great film and any joe <UNK> fan of shark movie watcher should give it a try
<START> i really liked the idea of traveling between <UNK> and i even liked the <UNK> quinn tension in early episodes some of the worlds they created gave the main characters extremely interesting backdrops for their stories however as the show went on there were more silly <UNK> among the friends and less of a true bond there was less wonder and excitement when they were involved in other worlds and more <UNK> and every world had one of the characters falling in love the writing just got boring and everything was way too over the top too bad it would've been nice to have a closely <UNK> band of friends a la star wars traveling to different <UNK> on tv for several years rather than a tired band of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> spoilers well made and interesting film about the <UNK> youth of america back in the 1950's back in those days many parents caught up with making big bucks and living high on the <UNK> forget that their children especially teen <UNK> needed a lot more then a car and and <UNK> <UNK> in order to feel part of the family they also needed love and attention to their growing up problems which is what 16 year old hal james macarthur never got from his successful movie producer dad mr tom james <UNK> br br never really connecting with his dad hal grows more and more distant from both him and his caring mom helen kim hunter as well as from society after his dad put hal down about him wanting to borrow his car a late model luxury <UNK> he and his friend jerry <UNK> silver drive in <UNK> beat up and <UNK> <UNK> 1930's <UNK> to the local to catch the latest western flick br br feeling like striking out at the world hal acts like a real first class jerk sticking his <UNK> feet almost into the faces of a couple eddie <UNK> jean corbett sitting in front of him and jerry trying to watch the movie this leads hal as well as his friend jerry to not only be kicked out of the theater but with him <UNK> the theater manager mr <UNK> <UNK> it turned out that at least hal was willing to leave the theater without even getting his money back but when tries to grab him hal <UNK> around and <UNK> him right in the <UNK> br br hal now in real hot water he's charged with assault and <UNK> <UNK> on his james dean act at the local police station making like he's either too cool or just plain stupid to realize what he's done almost knocked mr teeth out it's when sgt <UNK> james tells hal that his dad is coming to pick him up when he finally <UNK> up to the fact of what he's done br br the rest of the film has hal try to <UNK> himself out but is unable to do that because the low <UNK> that his dad has of him begging his father to understand that what he did in <UNK> mr was in self defense <UNK> father acts as if he's been there at the theater and saw the whole incident with his son hal acting like a street thug instead of of a young man being grabbed and pushed without <UNK> br br not <UNK> what hal did in laying out mr he in fact was willing to admit his <UNK> behavior but he wanted both mr and his dad to at least treat him with an <UNK> of consideration in the fact that he <UNK> hal and mr in not even bothering to hear him out feeling like a wanted criminal without anyone but his mom to really turn too hal slowly loses it only to later have both sgt <UNK> and mr agree to drop the assault charge you would think that by now <UNK> has finally learned his lesson but the real lesson more then a stretch behind bars that <UNK> so desperately needed was a lesson that his father totally ignored being there when his son needed him most and in that mr failed with flying colors br br things do in fact <UNK> out for everyone in the movie only after mr gets <UNK> ending up with a <UNK> of a <UNK> again by hal who going back to theater tries to get him to phone his dad and tell him that hal was only defending himself when he first not the second time around <UNK> him in the end hal learned a real lesson in getting along with people an not letting his problems become other peoples problems but most of all <UNK> father mr learned the most valuable lesson of all in how to understand his frustrated and <UNK> son and act like a father toward him instead of a combination jail keeper and a sugar daddy like the song says all you need s love to get things on the right track and it was both love and understanding for his son hal that mr until the very end of the movie lacked the most off
<START> waste of this nasty little film is one to avoid its like a cheap badly plotted cross between saw and a few other recent films about kidnap why the writer wrote this is obvious he has no soul and did it to try and me some money the twists were obvious when those in peril could escape they did the obvious and didn't etc only good thing about it is i've discovered 1 new actress worth watching <UNK> list don't watch <UNK> though there are too many better <UNK> films to watch rather than this that will make you miserable and think less of the world spend your time more wisely watch good films do some exercise cook a nice meal anything but waste your time on rubbish like this
<START> i found this gem in a rack the local video rental store had of tapes which are <UNK> among various rental <UNK> 'the man who down hmm never heard about it the box reads of some japanese fellow who always wanted to <UNK> down <UNK> and actually did it sounds interesting i rented it as expected it was documentary style the first part can be <UNK> so i always wanted to <UNK> down <UNK> <UNK> this is followed by some footage of <UNK> for the event lots of <UNK> footage ok i suppose it takes a lot of <UNK> then we are treated to a <UNK> piece on the <UNK> philosophy on life etc more filler follows and i begin to wonder where the <UNK> fits in to this show more <UNK> is shown and they begin to make the trip to the mountain more philosophy is shown at last they arrive at the mountain and maybe perhaps he will get around to <UNK> down the <UNK> thing lots of climbing footage later there is a description of the <UNK> device intended to slow speed on the <UNK> <UNK> finally he <UNK> on the <UNK> and gets ready to go br br he's off he <UNK> about twenty feet and his <UNK> shoot out from under him he <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> in an <UNK> <UNK> for some distance down the mountain and that's that end of story what the heck was that br br ok i can buy that he always wanted to <UNK> down <UNK> made extensive <UNK> and actually tried it with camera crew in <UNK> it didn't work and he ended up <UNK> down and almost killing himself so what <UNK> <UNK> would inspire the man to release a film of it and call it <UNK> down <UNK> perhaps the title the man who's feet shot out from under him and he <UNK> on his ass down <UNK> was just too long for the tape box
<START> i had to watch this movie with my 5 year old he didn't laugh once during the entire movie and he loves dogs and will laugh at nearly anything this movie was horrible from all aspects poor script even <UNK> for a children's g rated movie poor production the <UNK> camera shots made me feel <UNK> for the first ten minutes poor acting perhaps they were directed to act cartoonish and even poor sound quality there are parts where the audio level seems fine then you can't hear what the next actor is saying i'm willing to put up with quite a lot when it comes to watching a child's movie but this was worse than having a stick in my eye i also didn't like being <UNK> over the head with the god heaven belief thing in all it was the biggest waste of 90 minutes in my life and i've done some serious time wasting in my day
<START> i was disappointed with the recent 2000 american remake of this english mini series though it followed the plot line very closely it seemed to leave the heart and soul of the original out not to mention adding shallow preachy heavy handed so my advice is to skip the modern remake and stick with the original it's much longer but gripping and totally well done interesting complex and <UNK> without the preachy self <UNK> and it's beautifully shot as well br br i find it <UNK> that these heartless remakes of great overseas films get so much hollywood <UNK> at the oscars though i did like <UNK> del getting some deserved praise
<START> flowers if it's one thing you'll take away from this movie it's gonna be the flowers they feature so <UNK> and are used as plot devices you'll become an expert in <UNK> with daisies and black <UNK> by the time the movie ends br br set in <UNK> daisy tells the frustrating love triangle story between 1 girl and the 2 men in her life one a professional hit man <UNK> out a living the other an <UNK> agent featuring a pan asian cast korean hong kong and crew director andrew <UNK> from hong kong writer from korea and a <UNK> post production team i could imagine the <UNK> in <UNK> br br park <UNK> <UNK> woo sung is a hit man who found a soft spot for painter young played by the pretty <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it's love at first sight in the meadows of daisies where her <UNK> caught his attention however being shy and ever <UNK> of the dangers of his professional career he can only admire her from <UNK> do little or perhaps big things for her in an anonymous fashion but the one that takes the cake is sending her <UNK> daisies everyday without fail at 4 he becomes her guardian angel from <UNK> <UNK> her and keeping her safe from harm br br young is in love with this mysterious stranger she is constantly waiting for him to appear but i really wonder how difficult could that be given the almost daisy delivery nonetheless she's terribly moved and touched by this sole act however as the stars would have it <UNK> detective <UNK> woo lee sung chances upon young at a town square during one of his undercover missions and he too is captivated by her in a similar fashion because of his profession he is <UNK> if he should make the first move br br which is where the audience would find it frustrating the lady obviously would fall for the wrong guy then again it's the good guy park <UNK> being <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> pursuit but yet still refuses to step out and identify himself and <UNK> woo being the <UNK> in grabbing the free anonymous identity <UNK> it's almost as if you wanna give everyone a slap to wake them all up br br that aside it is precisely this tension that keeps you intrigued and it is <UNK> fun to watch the two male leads finding it tough to fall in love without <UNK> their careers or their loved one but <UNK> not action fans there are enough cat and mouse revelations and <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> of <UNK> affairs as well as ample <UNK> although i felt the ending could have been scripted <UNK> br br what rocks is the clever editing telling the story in a non linear <UNK> no <UNK> it ain't that bad you'll still be able to follow the narrative from the points of view of all the leads keeping you in suspense and culminating in a three way split screen <UNK> all their emotions in a single <UNK> event which i thought was extremely well done br br it's a beautiful film in terms of landscapes of lush meadows and busy city <UNK> with plenty of classical music to the soul as with romance movies all the leads are eye candy the girls will have a field day with the two handsome male leads while the guys have to make do with a somewhat <UNK> faced <UNK> ok <UNK> at certain angles <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br if you're into a romance movie with an equal balance in the action tension department then daisy would be your choice if you prefer a more conventional <UNK> then the other korean movie making its debut here at the same time you are my sunshine would be your alternative and yes i totally dig the ending scene which i thought only the <UNK> do it best kinda reminded me of the one
<START> i love the first and third but this one was an abomination it was almost as horrible as 'the never ending story <UNK> for the same reasons they took a fascinating fantasy world of barbarian <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> witches supernatural creatures and a cult of religious fanatics using a <UNK> and thought it would be funny to mix in our <UNK> pop culture world of rock roll <UNK> i think thats what it was and flashy sports cars these two worlds do not belong together i do not want to see a bunch of ancient barbarian looking people dancing to some rock song on the car radio i have a sense of humor but this is just stupid this is what hollywood does to good fantasy movies when they run out of ideas don't give up though the eye of is much much better that one i gave a 10 this one <UNK> of time i give a 1 believe me i don't always give such extremely high or low ratings i just tend to comment only such movies
<START> this marvelous short will hit home with everyone who as a child specifically asked for something because it was hip or cool only to be given something that would mark you for life with your peers and were told by your mom or dad or both that it didn't matter as you <UNK> began considering <UNK> in a witness protection program in order to avoid <UNK> for those u s residents who don't get the horror because you don't follow hockey it's like a dallas cowboy fan getting a washington jersey or a <UNK> fan getting a red sox jersey it isn't pretty for our european friends think of two great rival football soccer to us <UNK> and imagine a fan of one getting a jersey from the other <UNK> of c <UNK> themselves here br br <UNK> <UNK> du maurice rocket richard m richard
<START> compared to the acclaimed hollywood remake this film is less flashy but much stronger at providing an overall picture of the drug problem the remake loses the most interesting of the three plot threads that of a farmer whose <UNK> <UNK> depends on drugs as a paying cash crop and whose <UNK> involvement with the drug trade in an effort to better himself destroys himself and his family additionally the story of the daughter's addiction goes into the problems not only of <UNK> but the high <UNK> of this original miniseries makes good use of the additional time to go into the issues more thoroughly and remains stronger meat on this controversial subject
<START> spoilers throughout br br not good the movie <UNK> completely from the book not that the book was exactly a classic but it really was very good br br i guess <UNK> moore was ok actually i don't really remember to much about her performance one way or the other however the big disappointment wasn't with ms moore br br why did whoever did the rewrite decide to suddenly make the millionaire have a heart i'm referring to him as the millionaire because he also had a different name in the movie then the book version just another change br br people who didn't read the book obviously won't know <UNK> different but in the book version this guy is much more ruthless as well as complex overall he is also fascinating the fact that such a big change was made in the movie <UNK> the whole plot it was almost like seeing a completely different movie br br i know many movies <UNK> widely from the books but i also thought <UNK> character was a bit of a <UNK> this isn't <UNK> fault he's a great actor and could have played ruthless well but without those qualities he becomes just another <UNK> man in love hence the story becomes just another cliché love story involving 1 woman and 2 men that wasn't really the point of the book br br this could have been a lot better even if i hadn't read the book version i wouldn't have liked this all that much but changing so much around definitely takes it for me a few points down
<START> this was like watching the trailer of a up and coming movie except that there was no movie coming up the film is so unsatisfying and obviously unfinished as to be almost laughable the subject of this film is over a very short time frame and frankly nothing much actually happens in the 90 odd minutes of screen time i was hoping for the definitive australian film about our soldiers in wwii and how they fought against incredible odds in awful conditions this is most certainly not it br br having said that the acting was great and locations authentic this could easily have been a great movie given a lot more money and time instead it isn't even mediocre and i cannot recommend it at all
<START> <UNK> is the latest film to come from mike office space judge and it certainly follows a similar theme of that film in the fact that it is an observation of stupidity and how mediocrity can overcome <UNK> relatively speaking it is a story about joe bauer luke wilson who is quite literally the most average guy in existence joe and a prostitute named rita <UNK> <UNK> become the test subjects for a military project of a <UNK> chamber they were to remain suspended for only one year but due to lack of <UNK> joe and rita are forgotten about and accidentally wake up 500 years in the future br br here's the scary part this film explains in a very realistic and plausible way how the entire population of became absolutely retarded with no natural <UNK> the evolution of the human species does not necessarily favor the <UNK> <UNK> and strongest people for progression of <UNK> just the people who breed the most unfortunately those people happen to be <UNK> sucking trailer trash idiots who breed like <UNK> this <UNK> <UNK> of the stupid people has caused an <UNK> effect on societal growth and now joe and rita are the two <UNK> human beings on the face of the planet if it helps imagine the entire population as just a hybrid of <UNK> <UNK> and seeing this nightmarish <UNK> joe learns of and attempts to track down a time machine to see if he and rita can get back to when they came from and that's basically the whole plot br br but despite how one dimensional i may make it sound this movie is higher brow than you can <UNK> nuances are everywhere and anyone can see glimpses warning signs if you will of modern day dumb <UNK> <UNK> of everyday life and turning it into the train wreck on display in <UNK> the film has some truly awesome showcases of realistic <UNK> put on a <UNK> i don't want to give anything away and ruin jokes for you but let's just say that it is pretty <UNK> i can see how some would say that it is just a lot of toilet humor but it odd as it may seem has a purpose to show how dumb and crass these people are br br this film unfortunately is destined to see the same fate as its predecessor office space no one will see it in theaters but everyone will <UNK> about discovering this awesome funny movie when it comes out on video my only complaint for the film would be that the flow of the narrative sometimes gets broken so they can do a <UNK> guide to the galaxy type exposition on how things got to be where they are but it is a necessary evil and is <UNK> better here other than that good characters funny jokes and better than average social commentary wrapped up in a funny bow br br final note if seeing our youth becoming gang wanna <UNK> acting like redneck ghetto trash and being proud of it if you are educated and <UNK> in anyway and can see how our country is <UNK> out of control into an <UNK> of stupidity for god <UNK> watch this movie
<START> you could see the final outcome from a mile away all the signs were there the prom the <UNK> the fast ride the distraction of the females a good commercial for usage and later model vehicles that sit the passengers further back from the <UNK> also the ending is rather anti climatic as the ford van barely suffers a across its nose after hitting a bridge at high speed highly unlikely more damage to the van would have made it a little more believable and why do these films always take place during after a prom is it a case of once you survive the prom you will be good for life more than anything else it shows the lack of <UNK> the prom for <UNK> and not keeping <UNK> on the <UNK> who are leaving the dance for a <UNK>
<START> the defining scene to this movie is when the fat guy <UNK> but the evil doctor just gives him one more duty check on the dinosaurs keep in mind that he no longer has this job and so is absolutely not getting paid for this also keep in mind it's a <UNK> dinosaur and the doctor he's supposed to trust is evil and doesn't like him but he's still like yeah okay that just defined the stupidity in this movie one melissa proves that seriously anyone can <UNK> on some breasts and be in movies i can go ride a mountain bike between them but hey aside from that the people of <UNK> are very nice eric roberts gives his absolute worst performance so far there's no <UNK> to describe how bored he is throughout corbin bernsen saves what there is to save and you start rooting for him but they have to stick to the formula of course and i wonder how much your life sucks when you play like one of the army guys in this one how low can your acting career go the special effects are so embarrassingly bad you expect a sign saying studio 3 to get into the frame it's not even honest pulp it's all taken from <UNK> which even sucked all by itself and then i wonder why just anyone is allowed to make a movie
<START> this outing concerns the usual battle holmes vs but this time in an effort to save the british war against the nazis sherlock holmes <UNK> and watson bruce the <UNK> duo living in <UNK> baker street again are up against their old enemy dr <UNK> lionel <UNK> the film starts in switzerland where holmes saves from the nazis to an <UNK> of a bomb sight named dr post back in london hand over four parts of the device to diverse scientist but doctor is kidnapped by <UNK> sherlock must to solve his disappearance and some important holmes only holds a clue left his girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> the detective with an extraordinary <UNK> get <UNK> it but dead body scientific are <UNK> but have appeared murdered and <UNK> knows the keys as well holmes disguised as sailor goes out to investigate finding the <UNK> shelter the picture is based the dancing arthur conan doyle this is a <UNK> bruce effort for the wwii along with <UNK> voice of in which we are asked to believe the magnificent detective could have lived in this century both stories are completely patriotic and flag <UNK> movies in fact on the end there's an advertising buying of war bonds with evident propaganda br br the movie is an excellent holmes thriller with gripping wartime setting and unanswered mysteries and suspense in the film appear the from holmes series his nemesis <UNK> mistress hudson inspector <UNK> a funny dennis and of course the bumbling dr watson basil <UNK> performance is splendid he's the best <UNK> holmes similar to <UNK> peter cushing and jeremy brett <UNK> as whimsical sleuth is top notch he's in cracking form intelligent <UNK> and <UNK> he's finely matched in battle of wits with <UNK> his arch enemy a first range villain lionel <UNK> <UNK> bruce plays watson with humor <UNK> goofy and <UNK> he's the perfect <UNK> of holmes besides appear briefly distinguished <UNK> as paul fix and <UNK> <UNK> this classic gets an atmospheric black and white cinematography but available <UNK> in a horrible version adequate music score fitting to suspense by frank <UNK> the motion picture is <UNK> r william <UNK> the usual saga director and <UNK> in the monsters movies universal
<START> instead of writing a paragraph i'll give four good reasons why 2001 is the greatest cinema experience of all time 1 it is a visual odyssey that could only be told on the big screen the special effects that won kubrick his only oscar are the most stunning effects before that age of jurassic park and <UNK> they allow kubrick to give an accurate or at least are the most accurate depiction of space travel to date the silence that fills the space scenes not only serves its purpose as accurate science but also adds to the mood of the film to be discussed in a later point with hal the fact that kubrick shot the moon scenes before the apollo landing is a <UNK> yet fulfilling move many have said that upon its original release it was a favorite trip movie i can think of no other movie that has such amazing visuals for its time and even of all time sorry phantom menace fans 2 kubrick's directing style is terrific as in all his films kubrick likes to use his camera as means to delve into the psychology of his characters and plots his camera is not as mobile as other <UNK> such as scorsese but instead sits and watches the narrative unfold faces are the key element of a kubrick film like classic movies such as m and touch of evil kubrick focuses on the characters' faces to give the audience a psychological view point even he uses extreme close ups of <UNK> glowing red eye to show the <UNK> and determination of the villain i could go on but in <UNK> kubrick is at the of his style 3 hal <UNK> is one of the most villainous characters in film history i whole <UNK> agree with the late gene opinion of hal <UNK> most of this film takes place in space through the use of silence and the darkness of space itself a mood of isolation is created dave and his <UNK> are isolated between earth and <UNK> with nowhere to escape combine this mood with the cold <UNK> actions of hal <UNK> and you have the most <UNK> villain imaginable i still although having see this film several times feel my chest <UNK> in a particular scene 4 the controversial ending of 2001 always turns people away from this film instead of trying to give my opinion of the what it means and what my idea of <UNK> meaning in general is i'd like to discuss the fact that the ending serves to leave the movie open ended kubrick has stated that he to make 2001 open for discussion he left its meaning in the hands of the viewer by <UNK> the audience's intelligence kubrick allowed his movie to be the beginning not the end of a meaningful discussion on man's past present and future the beauty of 2001 is that the ending need not mean anything deep it can just be a purely plot driven explanation and the entire movie can be viewed as an entertaining journey through space no other movie save the great citizen kane leaves itself open to discussion like 2001 it is truly meant to be a surreal journey that involves not only the eye but the mind instead of waiting in long lines for the phantom menace rent a widescreen edition of 2001 and enjoy the greatest cinematic experience
<START> i am not quite sure i agree with the director of this version of the scarlet <UNK> i imagined sir <UNK> a very calm seemingly lazy aristocrat this particular sir <UNK> appears to be <UNK> with overwhelming energy and i did not appreciate the <UNK> james bond mission impossible style escapes that sir <UNK> <UNK> either in the previous versions wit was the tool for escape not technology neither were the characters of <UNK> and adequately portrayed there seemed to be little energy or chemistry in the interaction between the characters br br i do not wish to <UNK> any blame for perhaps the reason for my dislike of this movie might simply be a matter of difference in interpretation had the director's interpretation <UNK> with mine perhaps i might not have been irritated by what seemed to me bad character portrayals br br i much preferred the version from 1982 anthony andrews was quite efficient as the <UNK> calm <UNK> so were jane seymour and ian <UNK> in my opinion the style of this period piece seems to have been lost with this latest adaption i recommend sticking with the previous versions either the one from 1934 or the one from 1982 br br
<START> the script seems to have been <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> borrowed from a certain other movie involving using a self <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> machine scene by scene the two movies were almost identical just enough of the serial numbers <UNK> off in this one to prevent a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br but other than that i have to say i found this somewhat entertaining as i enjoy deep underground in the earth genre of movies it's a little bit on the stupid side as far as the science goes but if one is willing to <UNK> one's eyes real hard and pretend one didn't notice that scientific <UNK> here and there and all over this movie is almost bearable far better than <UNK> which was another flick that luke perry had a leading role in that was so dumb dumb dumb that nothing could save it a note to movie makers employ someone who knows something about the subject the movie deals with it would be a very small part of the movie budget but it would have a big effect overall in helping prevent your audience from <UNK> at you for doing dumb science br br production values almost passable i've seen far worse in my time br br a new thought for disaster movies instead of them always having a happy ending where the world gets saved yet once again how about some where things are a tad bit more realistic where sometimes even the very best efforts still end up in failure particularly when the problem that needs to be resolved was caused in the first place by sheer stupidity stupidity caused disaster movies with glowing heartwarming endings sort of justify stupidity by stating no matter how awful a problem is caused by <UNK> stupidity it can be fixed which is definitely not the case a self caused disaster movie with an unhappy ending would serve better as <UNK> tale of don't be so damn stupid in the first place should you watch this movie if you're bored and you've seen everything else in the scifi section at your local video rental store sure why not but do avoid <UNK> as i can assure you that you're not that bored that definitely was not one of luke <UNK> better movies this one is better that's not saying much but it is better br br one dead <UNK> up for being a deep underground genre movie one dead <UNK> down for <UNK> ripping off from the screenplay of another certain movie of the same genre
<START> my mate and i chose to watch this obvious piece of junk purely based on its after nearly 30 years of lousy and <UNK> teen slashers i can't believe that only just now some nerdy horror <UNK> come up with the brilliantly witty <UNK> they <UNK> for it other than that <UNK> massacre is just as random annoying and forgettable as all the rest out <UNK> perhaps even more the script contains all the typical clichés and features all the dreadfully <UNK> characters you wish a horrible and painful death to the gore effects are computer <UNK> and thus beyond <UNK> and the obligatory big stars karen black john philip law and richard lynch are entirely wasted in spite of their top billing cursed mines and abandoned ghost towns form an ideal horror setting  the creators of my bloody valentine already figured that out in the early 80's  but his dull film simply hasn't got any innovative ideas or even remotely surprising elements to offer bunch of greedy twenty something losers which refer to themselves as friends even though they clearly can't stand each other an ancient mine in search of the gold that is allegedly hidden there of course they <UNK> <UNK> the zombie <UNK> this way and he just 150 years of rest in order to prepare for a massive teen massacre <UNK> the cast is exceptionally irritating in this one the girls all have impressive <UNK> but refuse to show anything instead they all prefer endless whining and the taking of needless risks the dim witted <UNK> clearly just serve as screen <UNK> in her barely five minutes of <UNK> karen black still manages to make an utter fool out of herself by depicting the most <UNK> and hysterical local nut woman ever the zombie has a stupid and very unconvincing face but he looks okay and reasonably menacing when shown in the distant shadow of the <UNK> whilst swinging around his pick axe since the best thing about <UNK> massacre concerns the aforementioned <UNK> and you can read that on the box in the video store itself there's very little else to recommend here director john carl scored a few modest hits during the eighties like notably the original <UNK> and a fair friday the 13th sequel but it's obviously time to <UNK> now
<START> i had always eyed italian horror <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> efforts as producer with a certain suspicion and these were only confirmed after my fairly recent viewing of <UNK> <UNK> terrible demons 1985 the fact that this was supposed to be its third installment did not sound promising at all but i decided to give the film a rental regardless now that we're in full halloween swing i checked out the theatrical trailer on the anchor bay dvd prior to viewing the main feature  the undeniably striking visuals had me intrigued to be sure but then the film proper which makes no more sense than what's presented in that <UNK> two minute montage and in retrospect can be seen to have wisely <UNK> most of its highlights proved a definite let down br br opening <UNK> enough with a medieval prologue straight out of alexander <UNK> 1938 it goes downhill fast because it relies too much on surreal imagery at the expense of narrative consequently several characters randomly take center stage throughout  with the <UNK> male lead <UNK> to the dark forces early on the sinister looking bishop <UNK> <UNK> resulting a mere red <UNK> the mysterious black priest gradually assuming heroic qualities the leading lady is for whatever reason <UNK> upon by a goat shaped demon culminating in a sexual <UNK> <UNK> in front of the other <UNK> lifted all too obviously from rosemary's baby 1968 and a reasonably impressive 13 year old asia <UNK> as the rebellious but likable daughter who emerges as the only survivor by the end incidentally the older <UNK> also co wrote the film's story and screenplay along with director and under a <UNK> after they apparently fell out with <UNK> in the early stages of production original <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and prolific genre <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> whom i met at the <UNK> film festival in 2004 br br the extremely muddled second half of the film then sees a group of people  including the inevitable teenagers but also a <UNK> english couple whose constant <UNK> is given an <UNK> nasty punchline  similarly shut inside a building in the grip of evil spirits the church being the burial ground of a satanic cult that this horror outing is likely to <UNK> memories of luis <UNK> <UNK> surreal the <UNK> angel <UNK> you see in the end the film is all the more disappointing though sergio gruesome effects at least are notable given that i had thoroughly enjoyed the only other title i'd watched  cemetery man 1994 which i own via the <UNK> se dvd that said i'd still like to catch his debut feature  stage fright 1987  and the director's follow up effort to the church entitled the <UNK> 1991
<START> i am finally seeing the el <UNK> movie from what i can see it is an incredible film and lots of action <UNK> is good director but i must admit i love his acting the best br br also i saw the behind the scenes it was edited by some lady named she needs to go back to school and learn how to edit br br however the film el <UNK> is a pure 10 action epic why cant most people who direct put together films that keep you wondering what the plot is i am so happy to see someone i know to be a real great actor become a great director also br br i am one of those people who love to see artists make it br br b s
<START> this was a excellent movie i deal with a child who i am raising that has and watching this movie was more than word can explain i also purchased the book and it was great i would like to have a copy for my own use and so i can have my son's teachers watch it also i would like to know if anyone could sell me a copy of this movie let me use it for a time or refer me to someone where i could purchase it thank you myra i would recommend this movie to anyone who deal with children adults with special this movie should be shown again on tv the team of doctor's that have been tracking my son would also like to have a copy his special ed teacher has also asked me to try to locate a copy that he can have or that he can borrow br br thank you
<START> i don't understand why some of you or many have given this film <UNK> of 8 stars out of 10 do you understand that there are lower ratings for a reason sure this may be a zombie flick with some splatter but thats it i'm not a <UNK> on zombie films but this was awful really actually i should call it more like a zombie soap because thats how the acting is production is well okay barely an attempt at plot development awful acting silly effects clichés and an abrupt ending go ahead and like zombie movies but don't ever give this above a 5 0 honestly though the only reason you should want to watch this movie is to laugh seriously
<START> caught this 1969 film on cable tcm one night i remember when i first saw the film in hong kong i really enjoyed the songs and performances by peter o'toole and clark i love clark best in francis ford <UNK> <UNK> 1968 opposite fred astaire don and tommy steele simply <UNK> to learn that finally this delightful irish <UNK> pot of gold musical is released on dvd ah it's that old devil moon in your eyes br br peter o'toole as mr <UNK> yes he did sing quite a deliverance he may not be a veteran at musical like rex harrison but he inhabited the role <UNK> the scene of him running across the lawn in his cape a flying reminds me of the <UNK> series to serve them all my days a lovable <UNK> and loving man he is <UNK> ' clark and o'toole somehow gave us just the right mix of <UNK> and <UNK> the songs and lyrics by leslie are catchy as usual the tunes of you and i and walk through the world with me stayed with me the most all these years and there's what a lot of flowers and the sky <UNK> fill the world with love not <UNK> at all sometimes i think if the world is immersed in songs and words we would overcome all <UNK> on earth and <UNK> will be all our days yes talk to the animals too doctor <UNK> 1967 br br musicals are a <UNK> to the world of <UNK> they are somehow larger than life like the music and lyrics by the <UNK> brothers richard m and robert b who gave us <UNK> <UNK> bang bang 1968 and mary <UNK> 1964 who wouldn't feel absolutely delighted simply <UNK> i was <UNK> by even just one featured song dance number in the spanish film <UNK> 0 zero 2000 my all time favorite is french filmmaker jacques young girls of <UNK> 1967 with colorful cast of catherine <UNK> and late sister <UNK> jacques michel <UNK> gene kelly and george <UNK> singing dancing to michel music long live musicals
<START> just an hour ago i finished watching this my friend as a fans of <UNK> we think that this movie is so bad that is good we will say one thing without a <UNK> beers there is now way you can survive through this movie this movie should be watched with a many <UNK> fans to laugh their ass off the best character in the movie is the lord horn his makeup his laugh and behaviour <UNK> the unforgettable experience what we liked in this movie was the fact that the island of turtle man was the same as in cartoon version we believe that the only character similar to the one in the cartoon is the turtle man he is also a sex maniac and kind of idiot too
<START> first off i refuse to even consider this piece of work a music video i consider it a short film that uses <UNK> of the song thriller in its soundtrack to me a music video must be no longer than the song itself and the song must play the entire length of the video calling this a music video is like calling the great <UNK> a poem on top of this let's face it thriller is a boring 14 minutes including the extremely dated werewolf transformation the mindless vincent price poem just because <UNK> <UNK> it doesn't mean it's not lame and the least threatening zombies i have ever seen sure this was certainly a cultural phenomenon but don't forget this also happened at the same time the a team was the 1 show on tv so lets not give the culture too much credit on that one one last point on this film's impact on the media on music videos what exactly did this add to the <UNK> that <UNK> jean and beat it didn't already add from what i can tell it only added the practice of stopping the song for some dialog or a superfluous dance scene so you could say that all this video really did was give <UNK> the inspiration to make more annoying music videos not quite my definition of great
<START> i am a big fan of sci fi movies so when i saw this movie in the i thought i was in for a pleasant evening what a disappointment such a poor display of special effects i could not imagine in 1980 but in 2005 come on why would you do special effects of an helicopter flying in the desert when you can film a real one for a much lower price i guess and those killer muppets well i could do better than that in a couple of hours in the garage you can expect to have a low budget on a movie but i don't think it's reasonable to have a low movie for any budget as for the star of the movie i use a lot of quotes tonight lou diamond <UNK> the guy is not even remotely an actor maybe he should have stayed to the martial arts movies all in all an awful movie maybe i am in a bad mood tonight then again maybe not a sincere 1 out of 10
<START> my friends and i have just finished seeing a preview of this new australian film everyone who was in the cinema agreed what was the point of this film there was no good story to follow the characters were undeveloped and the plot seemed <UNK> i find it bizarre that this film that probably cost in the high millions got <UNK> and made it serves no purpose to the drama community its adds nothing to the palette of australian cinema it really was a waste of time creating this <UNK> <UNK> piece of work and more time really should be spent work shopping scripts and creating good stories not creating a mess like this hugo <UNK> and rose <UNK> were ok but severely <UNK> by a bad script pia <UNK> character was unnecessary and abstract from the plot and her lines were average at best a true waste of talent the saving grace was geoffrey simpson cinematography which like most aussie films was superb br br come on guys think about it next time please br br 4 10
<START> <UNK> combines humor military comedy and teen movie although it is somehow typically german movie like sentimental i think it's a great and very funny movie you will not only laugh in <UNK> but also get a bit of an insight in the eastern germany armed forces of the late <UNK> and how the young <UNK> as well as the professional soldiers experienced the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the german <UNK> republic br br you will enjoy <UNK> if you liked another movie directed by <UNK> but not necessarily if you enjoyed good bye <UNK> which is much more serious and less obviously funny br br the acting is acceptable but watch for former boy band singer kim frank who has only two facial expressions natural and shocked <UNK> eyed
<START> <UNK> terrorists hold hostage a military school in the u s until their demands are met the students decide to fight back will they be able to do it br br silly premise but the film actually works the group of kids who fight were all up and coming when this film came out in 1991 sean <UNK> looking very cute <UNK> <UNK> looking miserable keith <UNK> george <UNK> the token latino who is very handsome very muscular and is mostly shown in nothing but tight underwear t e russell the token black guy and shawn <UNK> none of them are very good actors except <UNK> but who cares this is a mindless action film the only other good performances are from <UNK> elliott having a ball as the <UNK> and louis <UNK> jr as the dean br br other than that there's lots of action suspense explosions and little brains in other words fun br br only complaint and this is minor it's a bit too long there are three endings and there is lots of casual bloody violence the r rating was well earned still i enjoyed it a lot
<START> oh i remember watching this show at 4 00 p m during my junior high days it was not a pleasant experience because i remember watching it when i made my <UNK> br br still the show caught my attention when alex displayed her special powers and dealt with the typical junior high problems br br but the show wasn't all about adventures and special powers it was more of an educational effort for a younger audience in order to get more interested in school and <UNK> overall br br the lead actress can't remember her name and i'm too lazy to copy and <UNK> from the main details delivered a fantastic performance she made the show watchable br br they just don't make shows like this one anymore
<START> i'm a big time horror fan and i bought this movie from all the hype it was getting on the message boards well let me tell you i don't know whom was giving it all the hype but let me speak on a few things br br first of all this film is not a lot of things it is not scary not suspenseful not overly gory not overly sick except for one season maybe not beautifully scored at all br br the premise of the movie is that a couple flee to a small island in <UNK> because they have done a little <UNK> in london we don't even know what they did but it is presumed that they killed someone br br spoiler alert br br the male lead kills a few people out of his <UNK> of <UNK> the island of <UNK> oddly enough the killings are cheap the characters are cheaper and the effects suck br br there is one part when he rapes a goat because his wife wont give him any in the morning but even that is done without any care for how it is shot br br end of spoilers br br the end of the movie is about the only thing that isn't totally predictable i especially enjoyed when the <UNK> <UNK> on the husband anyway if you can rent this and have 2 hours to waste go ahead it's nothing better than a <UNK> cheese <UNK> on <UNK> bread br br 3 10
<START> junior high and high school teachers will find the cure an excellent teaching tool both as a companion to <UNK> <UNK> or as a stand alone lesson although aids is supposed to be the main theme the strong text of friendship and love as they <UNK> between eric and <UNK> is a powerful message for teenagers writing <UNK> centered around the symbolism of the <UNK> shoe are particularly effective i also suggest directed class discussion about how eric <UNK> from manipulative user to loving friend
<START> directed by e <UNK> <UNK> is an experiment with a few interesting ideas that don't quite succeed in what they were trying to do the film is a <UNK> minute ultra slow <UNK> effective irritating experience that tries to present an intriguing philosophy about the creation of the earth and human nature br br it opens with god presented as a chair bound <UNK> man who tears open his stomach using a knife from the guts blood and human waste mother nature emerges she proceeds to <UNK> herself with the dead god's <UNK> later she gives birth to the son of the earth a <UNK> who is constantly abused a group of <UNK> people whom i believe to be the representation of mankind br br <UNK> takes a twisted and disturbing look on the origin of life <UNK> the self destructive nature violence lust and greed that have become a trademark for mankind the problem in the movie come from two points one is that the film is just too slow in it's <UNK> what we get is a good thirty minutes spent on showing how the son of the earth is constantly shaking naked on the ground while at the same time being <UNK> and tortured by mankind such tasteless <UNK> gets boring pretty fast and lacks the punch in delivering a blow to the viewer's senses br br another point is visual appearance and sound the grainy <UNK> black and white low frame cinematography <UNK> the disturbing factor of the plot but such <UNK> often work in only short periods of time then gradually begin to lose their effect as the audience becomes <UNK> to the look the audio suffers from the same problems it's constant repetitive and similar sounds become annoying so fast i had an urge to turn off the volume <UNK> loses it's charm shortly after it begins it tries to be original and creative but it fails to expand on the ideas hinted by the vague plot instead it repeats the same scene again and again br br the conclusion is that <UNK> is stuck in one moment even though plot wise it tries to move forward the visuals and audio remain the same throughout showing the same action in a slightly different way with just slightly a different sound a gimmick cannot alone make a movie it also needs pace and variety something seems to have forgotten
<START> words alone cannot describe the sheer beauty and power of this film br br think toy story now think toy story circa 1934 now imagine the animation looks as <UNK> as fluid think of the movie not as something adults and children can enjoy but imagine it as a <UNK> br br imagine trying to do something like that back in 1934 somehow the <UNK> delivers in a story where toys come to life and one of them is trying to deliver an orange to his sick owner <UNK> delivers a level of animation completely unexpected it's so fluid you will wonder for a long time whether what you see is really stop motion animation br br comparing toy story and the <UNK> is an <UNK> in <UNK> plot wise while toy story is a children's story adults can enjoy the <UNK> is a dark chilling story aimed at adults meaning no your kids won't like it one bit br br still get it if you can you might be able to find it along <UNK> in dvd and <UNK> and prepare to be stunned at what <UNK> was able to do back in 1934 with a couple of puppets
<START> i like bad films but this thing is a steaming heap from the shaky <UNK> to the horrible sound and devastating acting don't waste a second on this pile fifth <UNK> could have made a better film and first <UNK> could have written a better script want a real synopsis ugly chicks in <UNK> <UNK> dancing for way too long a disjointed plot made worse by hideous acting the on location sets weren't even passable the church scenes take place in a dance studio and oh yeah what's with the two tap dance numbers that come up out of the blue br br oh and the total number of naked breasts which couldn't have even saved this film 0 add this one to the trash heap
<START> there are interesting pieces here of and about bruce <UNK> likes and <UNK> maybe if a professional editor had put it together for biography i would have felt more satisfied instead i spent 8 at a film festival on it for an autobiography almost nothing is revealed about bruce <UNK> other than he likes to look at photographs shoot interesting people especially beautiful teenage boys and listen to jazz the director of would have made a much more interesting and cohesive film
<START> a good movie for horse <UNK> and most others it's a horse racing movie and it's a little man gets his chance movie and it's a how far would you go movie walter once again proves his as an actor he fits right in as lloyd a <UNK> <UNK> horse bum this movie gives you a rare screen glimpse of <UNK> horse drag racing he has a young quarter horse who is a top racing <UNK> had nothing but a filling station and a good horse the <UNK> the opportunity to make it big by taking the horse shadow to new mexico to get ready to run in the all american but how far will lloyd go to win the fame and fortune also memorable from this movie are scenes of lloyd spitting <UNK> juice and waiting for his truck to start
<START> this is one of those family movies that i can't imagine having much appeal to anyone over about 9 a group of siblings discovers a sand fairy yes really conveniently located at the end of a not so secret passage at the country home of their eccentric uncle to which they've been <UNK> from the london <UNK> and there you have it all in one sentence the story is about the role of magic in childhood and the danger of getting wishes <UNK> but neither of these issues is examined in a way that would be interesting to adults or <UNK> to children or vice versa the only reason i can think of for watching this is to see how <UNK> <UNK> outstanding talent stands out from the rest of the mediocre performances
<START> this movie sets out to do something very particular it also sets out not to do certain things in short it has a definite <UNK> <UNK> to deal with the idea of facing death with very few choices and all of them bad as grave and real rather than something casual or amusing in search of that realism it has <UNK> certain conventions such as obvious character <UNK> and <UNK> it not about the characters so much as about the human condition never mind what the actors would do what would you do in their situation br br open water may have been a starting notion for this movie but it goes a lot further unlike that film it doesn't cheat the audience in the end when you find out there aren't really any sharks to speak of at all this has a real monster not just the idea of a monster and not just an animated stand in it also has fine production values given what these very <UNK> filmmakers had to work with and again in contrast to that other film it has some <UNK> and brilliantly rendered action at it's climax and let's not forget the shall we say <UNK> screen presence of its youngest star she may prove to be quite a discovery
<START> thankfully i watched this film alone <UNK> me to fast forward through the worst scenes aka most of the film actually ok some of it is not all bad with partially good photography even some of the under water scenes and at times not too bad directing but it still doesn't save the incredibly poor script and way worse acting additionally when i don't find the movies <UNK> to be all that even the wannabe sexy love making scenes get dull really dull and for the drama you know it's always a bad sign when you get to dislike all of the characters so much you really don't care who lives and who dies br br if you still haven't gotten tired of the reality series survivor you may find something to your liking in this movie if not stay well clear
<START> people who know me say i have a weakness for animated films br br to be fair those people are half right my actual weakness is for exceptionally well done animated films such as this vintage family flick from max and david <UNK> br br you may be thinking to yourself well if it's so great why haven't i heard of it fair question this movie was released the same week as the attacks on pearl harbor the <UNK> bad timing caused the film to sink into relative obscurity things are looking up though because it has finally been released on dvd under the title br br it's funny that the film went through all this because it kind of mirrors the actual plot although some people claim that the movie is trying to send an <UNK> message ugh i personally think that the movie's main idea is <UNK> through <UNK> and hard times after all the country had barely pulled out of the depression at the time br br our <UNK> hero desperately wants to help his <UNK> community problem each time he tries whether through the ill will of others or through simple bad luck he fails miserably and slowly begins to earn the disdain of the very people he's trying to save although he does his best to maintain a positive <UNK> he occasionally breaks down and it's only through the <UNK> and support of his friends that he gets back on his feet and fights the good fight just a healthy reminder that when all is said and done no one is really self sufficient br br okay you're saying it has a good message two actually does that really make it exceptionally well done br br my answer partially br br it's not just the message that makes this movie special it's the characterization this is one of those films where you can just see the personality of each cast member in their animation you almost don't even need the spoken lines a good way to sum it all up is energetic or lively a lot of movies have used the selling point lovable cast of characters whenever i hear that line it always makes me think of this movie br br case in point the bad guys <UNK> the fly and <UNK> the <UNK> many movies have lovable villains but i don't think you'll find any as entertaining or endearing as these <UNK> forget that 3 stooges cartoon from the 60s <UNK> and <UNK> are the closest thing to an animated version of moe and curly but sadly not larry that you'll ever find virtually all of the funniest moments somehow involve this gruesome <UNK> yeah they're rotten no but you still care about them that's the kind of power you only see from a really talented writer director and crew br br the movie has two brief jokes revolving around racial stereotypes native americans and chinese i don't think they were intended to be <UNK> but they're there regardless they didn't bother me but it'd be pretty unfair of me not to warn someone who potentially would be bothered by them br br so if you share my weakness and i think you do give this one a go
<START> what is he supposed to be he was a kid in the past and the future this movie had a lot of problems is he a ghost or just a strong kid man what a piece of crap i'm still confused also is he supposed to be an abortion strange very strange this movie will mess with your mind and it's not very scary just confusing why was he where did what was the oh who cares milo isn't worth it br br my score 10
<START> i don't understand why this movie has such a low rating it totally deserves more sure it's completely ridiculous but that's what it was supposed to be don't expect cinematic <UNK> from a movie about beauty <UNK> contestants stranded on a <UNK> island what you should expect is a huge spoof of pretty much every relevant sci fi fantasy and block buster movie in cinematic history and even references to other all completely exaggerated and sometimes totally unnecessary but that's exactly what makes this movie stand out if you like parodies and enjoy say leslie <UNK> or mike myers you're gonna love this i sure did
<START> <UNK> 4 ranks as one of the greatest films of the <UNK> century the word classic has never been so <UNK> used as in describing this mind blowing epic i agree that the original <UNK> is the best of the series but the claustrophobic tension of the space station in which <UNK> 4 is set really must be seen to be believed i strongly recommend this to anyone interested in seeing one of <UNK> <UNK> major film <UNK>
<START> i just watched this film at an advanced screening i had not read the book and knew nothing of the story but went because the book was voted book of the year by two local <UNK> so i cannot compare the book with the movie as others have done br br in short i thought this was an incredibly moving story the acting was believable and the insight into <UNK> culture and political history was both interesting and shocking my oldest friend is iranian american and so i felt an <UNK> for certain middle eastern values and traditions that were portrayed in the movie as they reminded me of the times i spent with his family br br the themes of friendship family human values and courage under fire are universal and are well developed in the film i won't list the plot details as these can be <UNK> elsewhere but based on the film's technical aspects the acting and above all its heart wrenching story i would definitely recommend this movie
<START> the child's play series isn't a favourite of mine but bride of <UNK> is actually an okay movie this time we have two dolls <UNK> and his former girlfriend when he was human <UNK> together they go on a journey to find an object there are a few interesting scenes through the movie like the guy getting hit by the truck and literally exploding the sex scene between <UNK> and <UNK> and the ending which allows for another sequel to take place wasn't really a straight forward horror it mixed a lot of comedy and was a sort of spoof of the horror genre this made the movie better like comedy does do with many horror movies all up even if your not a child's play fan give this one a go
<START> no i'm not kidding with this one he was a guest reviewer for entertainment weekly and gave this movie positive marks and who can blame him this is a charming upbeat and rather funny disney movie who doesn't love <UNK> the music in wants to be a cat is <UNK> it makes me want to snap my fingers or something only years later when cats don't dance came out have i seen a movie that was that <UNK> fun what <UNK> lacks in animation and story it makes up for in charm plus everything moves at a relaxed pace and even the villain isn't all that scary it's perfect for the younger set while not being so sappy that adults can't like it if <UNK> was here i'm sure he would say the same thing yeah dig those crazy cats man
<START> in a village in the middle of nowhere in is the youngest son of his mother who had cried for five years when he is a young man he falls in love for <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> years old teenager that dreams to see the world and becomes an actress promises to bring the world to and once in <UNK> de <UNK> he <UNK> of a <UNK> television show and promises to travel to the fifty years ahead in the future or die for love with a deadly machine he had invented fifty years later <UNK> tries to fix what was wrong in his travel br br a is one of the best brazilian movies i have recently seen the refreshing and original story is a poetic and magic fable of love that will certainly thrill the most skeptical and tough viewer in a unique romance the direction is excellent the screenplay is awesome the cinematography and colors are magnificent the cast <UNK> by the icon <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is fantastic with marvelous lines the soundtrack has some beautiful brazilian songs <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> if this movie is distributed overseas please thrust me and rent it or buy the dvd because i bet you will love the story that will bring you into tears my vote is nine br br title brazil a  o o <UNK> the machine  the fuel is love
<START> this show is great for many reasons the father and mother can communicate with their kids this day in age its so great to see a real family instead of some <UNK> overacting family i watched this one time and became hooked it so great to see a black family on tv worth watching this show left too soon but on its way out it dealt with <UNK> sexy drugs bad dates death etc the best thing about the show was that it dealt with it in a real humorous sort of way great show for the family i cant tell you how many times i have sat up watched this show late at night sometimes and laughed my head off great pg 13 rated show i loved of this show
<START> for greta <UNK> first talking picture mgm wisely chose eugene <UNK> prize winning <UNK> play anna christie br br also wisely the producers backed garbo up with not one but two members of the original broadway cast george marion as <UNK> father chris and james t mack as johnny the priest <UNK> to johnny the <UNK> for films so as not to offend br br this little change is interesting like too many films accused by those who want movies to be movies and ignore their origins of being little more than filmed stage plays the problem is not the play but the movie makers who wouldn't be more faithful to the property by <UNK> a great cinematic stage work so it wouldn't offend anyone or opening it up because they could too many lose the very qualities which made the piece worth filming in the first place br br fortunately the respect the studio had for both o'neill and garbo allowed anna christie to survive the normally destructive process admirably in frances <UNK> generally sensitive screen adaptation wonder of wonders marion even allows the point of the scene where <UNK> anna reveals her past on the farm to the man she badly wants to marry and the father who sent her there in <UNK> what the league of decency must have thought of that br br the source <UNK> greatest problem has always been that <UNK> friend <UNK> tends to walk away with the first act and then disappears from the last two so that anna can take stage the two sides of the genuinely good woman men don't always recognize br br the perfectly cast marie <UNK> who had cut her teeth on the broadway stage as well before going to hollywood is the perfect balance for <UNK> anna in this area as well and the fast moving film at only 90 minutes doesn't allow us too much time to miss her one of the few benefits from atmosphere being shown rather than <UNK> described in the original and screenwriter marion is wise enough to stray from o'neill to bring <UNK> back for a touching scene two thirds of the way through the film that will remind many of julie second act appearance in show boat br br anna and early scene together on screen 16 minutes into the film taking each other's measure and setting up all the tension of the rest of the story is among the most affecting scenes in the entire piece not to be missed br br anna christie is great tragic play and a good film drama it's hard to imagine that a latter day remake which would almost certainly lose the <UNK> and atmosphere of this 1930 remake it was first filmed without sound in <UNK> also with george <UNK> original broadway chris could improve on this excellent filming br br the internal scenes <UNK> closest to the play but the <UNK> shouldn't be missed by anyone with an eye to atmosphere while the background screen work is not to modern technical standards the backgrounds give a better glimpse than most films of the era of the actual world in which the screen play is set especially in the new york harbor br br nearly all <UNK> <UNK> performances of the sound era have held up superbly only the too often <UNK> death scene from <UNK> 7 years later will occasionally draw <UNK> because of the heavy handed direction and the parodies but this anna christie together with the variety of her 1932 films <UNK> <UNK> and grand hotel and the sublime lubitsch touch on her 1939 comedy <UNK> garbo laughs surely stand as her best br br o'neill fans who are taken with this play at the edge of his <UNK> sea plays should track down the fine world war ii shaped film released in the year before the u s entered the conflict the long voyage home 1940 it is almost as <UNK> drawn from those sea plays as this one is from anna christie and features a <UNK> john wayne in one of his rare non westerns supporting a fine cast of veteran actors showing him the way
<START> great movie good acting a wonderful script it's exciting to find out what the people are thinking and how they react on the situation they are in a pity about the ending a of text of how life went on instead of moving images was a poor choice i hope this movie <UNK> a lot of people it's worth it
<START> ah hitchcock it's hard to find a bad hitchcock movie until he lost it after the birds 1963 and <UNK> proves the point having admired most of this director's work for many years i had managed to skip this one perhaps from lack of interest in <UNK> lane and robert <UNK> as lead actors i was of course familiar with the statue of liberty climax from having seen it repeatedly in film <UNK> but i wrongly assumed the story leading up to it might not hold my interest was i wrong the suspenseful plot gets cooking right off the bat through a chance encounter between the bad guy <UNK> and the good guy wrongly accused protagonist and continues <UNK> along through a series of further chance encounters and narrow escapes familiar <UNK> elements are all there the innocent person wrongly accused of a crime people not being what they seem to be dramatic or unlikely locations that <UNK> the suspenseful scene being played out within them an airplane <UNK> a ranch a bridge from which the <UNK> hero <UNK> himself to escape the police a <UNK> charity ball in a <UNK> mansion an upper floor of a <UNK> and finally the torch of the statue of liberty br br throughout is humor provided by supporting players generous <UNK> of early ww2 vintage social comment moments of human warmth where suffering people find it within themselves to lend a hand to help a fellow human getting nothing in return  in short there was always a basic humanity at the core of hitchcock however grisly the <UNK> a sensational cast of supporting players <UNK> otto <UNK> as the <UNK> villain this side of george sanders his broadway credits include the male lead in <UNK> <UNK> private lives  and that says it all and <UNK> norman lloyd as the titular <UNK> not to mention <UNK> <UNK>  no relation to otto  as a prominent society <UNK> involved in fifth <UNK> intrigue her character <UNK> that of claude mother in notorious <UNK> lane does a fine job with a difficult role for most of her early scenes we can't tell whether she believes the hero to be innocent or guilty and she seems constantly to shift her opinion not coming over to his side fully until late in the proceedings one cannot <UNK> whether her acting is at fault or whether we are meant to be kept in a state of <UNK> but the plot developments are so swift fun and clever that we really don't care what she thinks br br then there are the peculiar hitchcock touches that have nothing to do with the plot twice the lane character pauses to get change for a quarter  once to <UNK> her <UNK> for an ice cream <UNK> and again to make a call from a phone booth why these scenes were inserted are <UNK> guess perhaps to make the film seem more realistic and thus <UNK> the believability and suspense or perhaps to give the audience a moment to catch its breath some of the characters are over the top  the <UNK> truck driver the <UNK> kind and <UNK> blind man living alone in a <UNK> <UNK> forest cabin the political philosophy <UNK> human <UNK> and other members of the circus <UNK> who hide the protagonists from their <UNK>
<START> a brilliant professor and his sidekick journey to the center of the earth in a huge machine which <UNK> its way to the core there naturally they find all kinds of things that are intent on killing and eating them plus of course a love interest for the young sidekick ho hum does the plot never take a different <UNK>
<START> first i am a big fan of alien and alien ii in my opinion both of these movies created and defined the <UNK> fi horror genre as we know it today i noticed <UNK> was often compared to the aliens saga after viewing this movie i would highly disagree there are some okay special effects with the alien vampires and the story line might have been acceptable i just can't get past a naked woman space vampire throughout the whole movie this is absolutely absurd although she does look good add in a bunch of bad british acting and it's pretty much over most of the movie ends up taking place in london or somewhere in england so after the first 20 minutes you lose the <UNK> setting and any hope of some real <UNK> fi horror action and suspense br br
<START> after the lush inspiring <UNK> shot in fast motion in the opening of the movie this slipped into utter boredom and a one tone note right till the end br br where to begin well i'll start with the characters i really enjoyed them in the book here they all were types and one dimensional morons that either had victim or <UNK> written on their <UNK> from the get go how any one didn't see through the store owner <UNK> in a hammy and out of place performance by is beyond me br br this film lacks in thrills suspense and in some sense yes entertaining values it stretches itself for far too long with not a lot of pay off why introduce too many annoying should die quick type of characters and then forget about half of them half way through in the book practically everyone that went into the store met a grisly fate here besides one of the only decent scenes that translated well from the novel the fight between and <UNK> was a letdown and didn't have much balls i'm sorry but after one off screen death a boring shoot off and some <UNK> and then a couple explosions just didn't do it for me the brutality and mean <UNK> from the book was sadly missing the explosion of the church scene was so over the top and badly executed all of sudden the entire city was in a <UNK> it made no sense and characters that weren't introduced all the way through suddenly are who are these people and why should i care br br the story is all over the place and none of the scenes had momentum i thought ed harris and bonnie were good actors in this but the movie gives them not enough substance for me to give a damn amanda plummer was credible but too pathetic to really be sympathetic in the novel she was a sad and depressing character here it was a too one note j t walsh was entertaining but the role was far from interesting or layered too predictable br br the soundtrack was too classy for the material it was supporting it stood out like sore thumb easy there buddy easy something a little less theatrical i'd assume would have worked br br i will admit some of the gore it did manage to have was good enough i guess the director seemed to hold back a lot of the times though if your going to make a movie that reaches the 2 <UNK> point be sure to have far more going on then this disaster of a adaption of on of kings better novels br br i often found myself laughing at scenes that were suppose to be taken seriously ed harris speech at the end or the character hugh priest in general and was bored and <UNK> most of the other time personally the director should have done so much more with this story his approach is too tame and hides behind too much crisp cinematography to ever come off as a decent movie the movie looks good but not the look i think this story deserved i mean this dude <UNK> <UNK> not a good sign br br i'd rather just read the book as you should too as if it is far more entertaining layered character development grisly violence and mayhem a nasty sense of humour and far more <UNK> this is a butchered version that has not much to offer br br out of
<START> for a <UNK> <UNK> super dog that was supposed to be the answer to <UNK> crime <UNK> was a <UNK> br br all i ever saw <UNK> do was sit or walk or run or run then walk then sit and then get back up again and stretch and then walk and then <UNK> to k tel dance hits and sometimes it had all the answers to the daily <UNK> but mostly it just sat a lot br br all i am saying is in a celebrity death match <UNK> couldn't take out mr
<START> i remember when the love machine was first released to theaters i was a mere 13 years old too young to see the much <UNK> motion picture release but not too old to take my mom's <UNK> copy of the <UNK> <UNK> novel to school and <UNK> over the <UNK> with my <UNK> br br though i'm not sure what my problem was at such an early age but i was very much into the book i bought and wore an ring just like on the <UNK> cover and i remember the ads for the <UNK> <UNK> that was cross promoted and featured clumsily in the film despite such an interest i didn't actually see the film until several years later i should have left things as they were br br the love machine is hands down the worst of the many bad films adapted from novels which of course makes it the most fun to watch its faults are many from its script that jumps <UNK> from one incident to another with <UNK> a connecting thread its dated horny <UNK> <UNK> i mean music score of <UNK> <UNK> the flat first take performances the boring sexuality i've never seen featured so <UNK> in a movie before it's like a fetish whenever sex nudity or something sleazy is called for out pops somebody in a blue <UNK> very odd that and most certainly the circus train of awful 70's fashions that are on endless display poor <UNK> <UNK> performance which is no great shakes anyway but heads over the rest of the cast is consistently <UNK> by the jaw dropping get ups she's called upon to wear however the film's chief <UNK> is the stoic stone like john philip law as appropriately enough robin stone the object of every girl's and one top <UNK> male <UNK> affection br br law is just awful and performs as if he were pulled off the street handed the pages of the script in hurry and told to give a cold reading on the spot just lifeless not only that but he appears in desperate need of a blood <UNK> or something he looks wan and <UNK> throughout and is several pounds smaller than most of his female <UNK> robin stone should be a hunk not a <UNK> br br for anyone finding the film hard going it's rather slow by today's standards i beg you to stick around for the climactic fight scene here ms cannon <UNK> 23 pounds of <UNK> hair finally <UNK> her <UNK> <UNK> acting style and lets loose with that <UNK> <UNK> laugh of hers setting in motion a truly memorable free for all that should have become a cinema clip highlight by now trying to rival valley of the dolls 's infamous wig down the toilet scene the love machine finally does something right br br <UNK> unique brand of trash is sorely missed perhaps someone out there owns the rights to <UNK> the and will revive the genre
<START> i have seen this movie 4 times in 5 months and i never get tired of it just because it is perfect and it has also got the best film music ever and the best supporting roles ever written for a movie i mean you just have to love robert <UNK> marlon brando martin sheen and fishburne in this movie but specially <UNK> i can not believe that kramer vs kramer did win an oscar in <UNK> of this amazing war movie so this is my conclusion if you take the director of the worlds greatest movie the godfather and the best of hollywood actors you can only succeed now i just have to <UNK> something to get this preview so do not read this except the last line this movie rules
<START> during my childhood time i have seen the first three <UNK> movies and enjoyed 'em they were fun and entertaining horror comedies perfect for adventurous horror loving kids i have never seen <UNK> 4 so i finally decided to check it out my verdict forgettable and pretty bad flick with strikingly low body count the script by joseph <UNK> and david j is both predictable clichéd the plot rips off alien and star wars and the sets look bland and murky the tone of the film appears to be deadly serious throughout making it slow and dull <UNK> 4 was apparently so low budget that the filmmakers couldn't afford any <UNK> effects the ones taken from <UNK> look seriously dated 4 out of 10 one to avoid
<START> this is how i interpreted the movie first things first there was not a single scene in the movie where u see the bad guy taylor torturing or <UNK> ben's hands to the wall however the same cannot be told of the <UNK> in the end too u see taylor disappear as he walks looks like the message there was there was no taylor and the whole movie was a <UNK> of imagination of ben also there was no scene during the torturing moments <UNK> any of the <UNK> confront or are in the same frame as ben it was taylor all the time but in real taylor was ben if they were two different people then why was there no scene showing both of them in one frame during the horrific times but of course before that u do see both of them together and that just be ben's imagination at work also when ben was out of jail the text on screen clearly says that ben's story was unrealistic and there was no such place as he had explained read mine cars etc even after liz hunter leaves <UNK> and comes back to find ben she doesn't find him why because ben taylor was out looking for the <UNK> instead <UNK> has all the time in the world to check out <UNK> ben web <UNK> photos etc br br somehow everything sums up to just one fact that <UNK> and liz both of them knew that taylor was ben so my conclusion is that ben was <UNK> and the movie where you see him and taylor in one frame was nothing but <UNK> of his imagination otherwise if there really was a taylor then they should have found him out given all the detailed explanation coming from ben
<START> in this election year where so much <UNK> is attached to one of the candidates it is poignant to watch a film that warns us not to make an idol out of anyone running for public office br br luke is the writer and director of choose connor there are significant parts of the film that reveal that he is a when it comes to telling stories via the cinema br br go see this movie before the election and then <UNK> why and for whom you will cast your vote br br let you eyes be opened like those of the young protagonist br br a mix of citizen kane advise and <UNK> and paths of glory by a young director as talented as those who made the films listed above
<START> from br br the dialog is terrible awful drivel acting poor many plot flaws i don't recommend this at all br br from <UNK> br br artistic <UNK> the working <UNK> of the score is attributed to two 1 both of whom were male not female as depicted in the film br br the neither contributed to nor altered the score in fact they were <UNK> by <UNK> for any <UNK> that occurred from the original score br br the movie is set in <UNK> during the composition of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> throughout the movie <UNK> is shown to be hard of hearing but quite capable of understanding people who speak <UNK> in reality <UNK> had lost much of his hearing seven years earlier <UNK> never experienced permanent <UNK> his condition between total silence and terrible <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> was composed at a time when <UNK> hearing had <UNK> severely at this point in his life most of <UNK> conversations were <UNK> by the use of <UNK> it can be <UNK> however that he was also able to read people's lips <UNK> by his <UNK> that people face him when they spoke to him br br in the film <UNK> makes an <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> this is an <UNK> as the <UNK> no 14 quasi <UNK> <UNK> was not named <UNK> until several years after his death
<START> the main character of this sex filled drivel mel ethan hunt notes on several occasions she deserves better than this the she he refers to is ginger played by beautiful <UNK> davis who indeed does deserve better than this <UNK> deserves better than this film its lame script and perverted mel a guy who gets off at watching his dream girl have sex with another man even in virtual world seriously does not deserve her at all an a for the <UNK> sex scenes an f for the script
<START> as a flying and war movie buff this ranks at he bottom of my list it is historically completely inaccurate and the cast sounds and acts like they just stepped out of a high school play the acting script direction production standards and casting are all garbage the only saving grace is some of the flying sequences if the people they portray were <UNK> i might rate it a 2 but if there is one thing that <UNK> me more than anything else in movies it is pretending that this is history and that the great people they are trying to be actually did this its almost as if they tried to write in as many notable <UNK> personalities as possible there are many good <UNK> flying films and this is not one of them
<START> big disappointment clash by night is much to talky and <UNK> and the dialog doesn't <UNK> as true coming from these characters this is melodrama at its peak the acting is truly over the top and very unreal only marilyn monroe and keith as supporting players give this film any <UNK> wish they had more to do i'm somebody who looks at details in films two big questions 1 who is watching the baby the entire day when stanwyck and ryan are together and douglas is working then breaking up a fight in a bar with is father 2 when stanwyck is <UNK> to leave town why is she seen <UNK> at her brothers place where she hasn't lived for at least two years also when everyone goes to the projection room at the theatre who's taking care of the baby again such details really <UNK> me and cause me to give films much lower ratings what were the writers directors and everyone else connected with the film thinking said
<START> this movie is about people living at a later in the movie it gets obvious that those people are out of work comedians mainly old males well more or less they sit around the whole movie and talk about f ing but never there is any action just those people talking in the beginning i thought it's some cool perverted redneck stuff but after a while it got boring i mean how many versions can you think of saying f ing d k c t for sure this can be funny for half an hour maybe not 80 minutes but it was funny to watch those people trying to act i'm pretty sure that they often were reading their text on some sheet when playing but it does not <UNK> the movie it's cool like this because those individuals seem so poor f ed up <UNK> a that the style totally fits their wooden helpless reading of the <UNK> makes quite good atmosphere i fell in love with the characters a little br br spoiler ahead later in the movie the f <UNK> do some comedy shows <UNK> about f ing with just themselves as audience and imagined applause then one gets an <UNK> advice and so they decide to defend the trailer park and enter their <UNK> armed with some weapons then they got shoot <UNK> sounds like action but it's not just some trashy home camera takes spoiler end br br but the movie is totally <UNK> in it's style and i'm pretty sure it's just what the movie maker wanted to have it's the portrait of those f k ups in an <UNK> home camera style with characters who can not act but seem interesting personalities so they are nice to watch but the <UNK> about you know what the whole time get boring after a while br br pretty young director who also seems an interesting person as he played some teenager stuff in popular movies tv series but now got in more horror movies which is more his cup of tea i guess and this his first direction effort will be distributed by troma now don't know anything about a release i got this one as an advance <UNK> from this years cannes which says for <UNK> purposes only
<START> i am shocked and amazed to find reviews short of miserable for this horrible film i rented this movie or <UNK> whatever you wish to call it with several friends and after thirty minutes we had to stop watching just listening to the dialog left a horrible taste of sour milk in my mouth this film was about as intelligent as an ass <UNK> i hope i never see that <UNK> less <UNK> anne look alike <UNK> nicholson again it was like watching the most <UNK> pilot for a sitcom that will never make it to television but instead of being a quick but painful 30 minutes all i could bare this was an excruciating 90 minutes
<START> oliver stone is not one to shy away from a movie or theme for that matter he is eager to confront people with their fears or show them their ugly faces in the mirror look on his <UNK> for proof this movie is not an exception quite on the contrary it is another gem that unfortunately not many have seen br br as controversial movies go this is one that you should be thankful for a movie that should encourage you to think about you the people next to you the prejudices that do exist and that everyone of us has in one form or another either we like to admit it or not but it is easier to <UNK> people and be like ah he's yeah he must be like now i might be reading too much into it but i don't believe that i believe that oliver stone is a very intelligent filmmaker and that he was aiming for those things and if that's something you want to explore as a movie or within yourself than watch this film and be excited
<START> the presentation is very <UNK> to my notion as documentaries often are michael moore's <UNK> <UNK> is far more convincing but has far too much media and political influence cant wait till saturday when i get to see the <UNK> the game of their lives <UNK> goes right of center i have started a collection of <UNK> movies from off the internet due to out of on decade wanna see good documentaries stick to the history channel or try <UNK> you cant go wrong with them my friend cant go wrong the seventies were ten years of reruns or so the old times would have you to believe disco died and it is gone forever when elvis died o yes we all did <UNK>
<START> one imdb reviewer calls eaten alive a passable film for the cannibal <UNK> are there such people i didn't know but if you are one of them hey have a ball the rest of you might find this tripe a bit hard to swallow pun intended even if like me you consider yourself a horror film <UNK> i have been an avid horror fan for about 15 years now although i never got around to the cannibal <UNK> until a few weeks ago and i guess i owe my short lived interest in these <UNK> inducing movies strangely enough to <UNK> total disregard for <UNK> laws you see i bought a two disc dvd collection of all of wesley <UNK> films for 20 <UNK> about 2 75 which turned out to include last cannibal world mountain of the cannibal god eaten alive cannibal holocaust next with nicholas cage and something called voodoo <UNK> along with blade 1 3 in chinese nice br br being a second sequel i immediately got a sinking feeling when the movie opened with a cannibal in street clothes wandering around major american cities shooting unsuspecting americans with poison <UNK> and then <UNK> away at full speed having run out of ways to keep movie cannibals scary it seems that now they have made their way to the <UNK> later you may be shocked to learn that this guy is on a training exercise lock up your daughters br br before long the movie <UNK> into the old missing sister routine as a young blonde woman named sheila begins her own investigation of the disappearance of her sister who looks nothing like her in any way but she's willing to spend most of the movie naked so i guess that doesn't matter it seems that after shooting one of his victims the hapless cannibal we met early in the movie not used to big city life ran into the road and was struck dead by a moving van br br the brilliant police force find a mysterious bit of film on him showing <UNK> sister involved in some bizarre ritual behavior but other than the film the guy is a complete mystery as the <UNK> police chief <UNK> we know nothing about him except that he's dead poor guy he must be getting a headache from all this i recommend a <UNK> luckily sheila is the kind of girl who can throw around <UNK> of thousands of dollars like it's nothing in the search for her sister perfect for hiring a <UNK> backwoods guide caricature since the police are clearly going to be no help br br obviously nothing new is added to this <UNK> sub genre quite the contrary <UNK> almost seems like a background to a completely different kind of bad movie about the rescue of a missing person from the dangerous elements <UNK> the plot of that <UNK> is not difficult all you have to do is add in a cartoonish jungle cult of people who follow some guy who calls himself <UNK> who believes in using pain as a way to reunite man with nature a process they call <UNK> personally i prefer just <UNK> outside occasionally br br one of my favorite parts of the movie is when sheila is caught by one of the cult members an overweight guy who looks like he took a three day weekend from the office to appear in this movie as he pulls out his <UNK> medical <UNK> to give her an <UNK> he warns her if you don't believe in <UNK> and <UNK> through pain god help you he then gives her a shot and when she <UNK> from the tiny <UNK> he <UNK> <UNK> to her i sense a true believer in this guy br br as far as the gore there are plenty of nasty sound effects over random shots of animals getting slaughtered and more than enough disgusting footage of women being cut up and eaten alive so i guess right there the movie lives up to its name the acting is astonishingly bad as can be expected and interestingly enough the editing is also spectacularly <UNK> but still strangely effective br br unfortunately i think you have to be able to relate to people who believe in utterly insane <UNK> in order to relate to anyone in the movie there are plenty of outlandish religious <UNK> that take place which make it more and more difficult to understand why <UNK> sister decided to turn her back on normal society i'm all for <UNK> and doing your own thing but come on br br after a while the movie <UNK> even further into your basic run of the mill escape movie just before we witness the most wildly inappropriate rendition of glory glory <UNK> in film history wow br br note in this movie a woman is raped with a severed snake if you need any more reason never to watch it seek professional help avoid this mess at all costs
<START> <UNK> the lucky ones died before watching this br br i've never watched a <UNK> movie from <UNK> so i can't say this is the worst movie ever made but it surely is the worst movie i've ever watched i can't almost remember it br br all i can recall is a family of stupid people who don't do anything right their car has one wheel out of four stuck in the sand so they decide that there's nothing to do and prepare to live the rest of their lives there then there's an old man who is aware of the existence of a band of cannibals in the <UNK> but has never considered the idea to report the fact to the police br br and speaking of the police if those freaks have lived around there eating humans for years lots of people must have disappeared how come the sheriff didn't suspect anything br br but i gave up asking questions after the first five minutes or so the rest is bore an unbelievable bore br br i will be <UNK> and won't speak about the dialogues and the acting and the effects br br i will only mention the final scene where the freak girl <UNK> a snake the snakes they come out in the end what the hell do they have to do with the story with a sniper precise throw of a stone <UNK> the full disregard of mr craven for reality and for things that happen on planet earth in general br br i believe there have been <UNK> when the film was first released in 1977 br br even being eaten by a cannibal wouldn't be a fair punishment to the director for this attack on intelligence
<START> jack frost 2 was a horrible terrible sadly pathetic excuse for a <UNK> to a great movie the original was a low budget comedy horror film about a murdered who was turned into a snowman after an accident with some toxic waste and the snowman went around murdering people and avoiding blow like the plague this however was a far cry from the quality of the original it seems like this even had a lower budget because for some reason after an hour into this film i still hadn't seen the snowman some revenge he's getting if he's always in the form of ice <UNK> with a cheesy voice over and a little shake of the <UNK> he rests in to give animation to the character disappointing to no belief even for a fan of bad cinema
<START> ray <UNK> run and hide this tacky film version of his short story from the 1950s about time travel and the effect it might have on de evolution is not well known from the theatrical run did it have one and exists now as a dvd on the shelves released during a slow week br br what looks to be a fancy sci fi thriller form the opening scenes quickly fools us as the computer generated graphics are re run <UNK> throughout a film that is supposed to be about different back in time where a major company sells macho guys in the chance to hunt dinosaurs by paying <UNK> <UNK> to travel back in time to <UNK> <UNK> one slip of the foot <UNK> while on one of these <UNK> and the course of evolution is altered with <UNK> time waves rolling over the planet changing everything to man eating plants and <UNK> of course there is a pretty damsel who knows how to reverse the process and a hunky man to risk his life to act on her orders and everything is eventually ok br br yes that is the story and the most surprising fact about this poorly scripted <UNK> acted mess of a film is that it attracted some fine talent to portray the comic book flat characters edward burns all buff and hunky is our hero du <UNK> ben kingsley is the requisite bad corporate guy sporting a ridiculous white wig catherine <UNK> is the know it all woman creator and as an evil one all are superb actors and should have known better than to <UNK> with this flop and the saddest thing is that for those who like this genre of sci fi monster thrillers the creative department sold out with some of the <UNK> animation to hit the screen in a long time a must miss grady <UNK>
<START> i had high hopes for this film even though i had not read the book richard gere and diane lane together should be good already but the film does not deliver on the promise i kept waiting for more depth to the characters and there wasn't i have no problem with the fact that it only took a weekend for them to fall in love that can happen but we never really get to know the characters i would have liked more focus on them the film reminded me in places of bridges of madison county and that film was far better i really felt for the characters in that film and there was a chemistry much more passion between clint eastwood and meryl streep that there wasn't between gere and lane each of them are very good actors in his or her own right simply not the right movie for them together
<START> i can <UNK> the writers of this story thinking up this script br br 1 let's make a serial killer movie like <UNK> knight moves <UNK> and silence of the <UNK> people like serial killer stuff it'll sell 2 the killer needs to adopt some sort of pattern i know he'll copy it out of a serial killer mystery novel that hasn't been done yet at least not exactly like that 3 now we need some kind of way to make this movie unique of course the good guy can be <UNK> like in rear window 4 lastly we need a twist ending that will give this movie the success of the sixth sense and the usual suspects br br okay now that you know these things you know the whole movie so don't waste your money one thing i really hate about <UNK> is that they take a perfectly good concept for movies and completely run them into the ground i wrote better stories than this when i was in junior high i just kept checking my watch every five minutes when the twist ending finally came i wasn't shocked i just said oh who cares the characters are two dimensional they have your typical movie personalities this movie is just proof that stealing the elements of other successful movies is no excuse for a bad script i give this movie 1 out of 10 normally it would earn at least 2 or 3 but i'm so sick of the <UNK> when will they learn 1 10
<START> the story is a turn of the century <UNK> of actors along with producers and theatre owners have very complicated relationships a resident playwright has written a psychological drama he wants to get a good production on stage but can't unless he convinces a reviewer to <UNK> the production and give a positive review if his production does not go on then the <UNK> will put on the doll house recently written by <UNK> many different relationships among the principals are explored none of them interesting but the involvement of the characters with one another lead to giving the play by the resident a second shot br br this movie is purely an excuse for the director and his friends to get together and put on a movie the story lines are incoherent to anyone who isn't a buddy of one of the stars the only reason i didn't leave the theatre after about a half hour is that a fat lady was <UNK> a full meal <UNK> her stomach at the end of my row
<START> love and war did happen on the other side of the iron curtain and by looking at it love was just as strong as in the west and war was often more poignant should i say more realistic br br this film is as much about war and love as it is about the soviet <UNK> of mr <UNK> era it also reminds us than the best war movies were not necessarily made in the 1990's with rivers of and millions of <UNK> spent on special effects and <UNK> actors br br this movie is a classic of soviet cinema and a outstanding picture of one of the greatest human <UNK> war br br
<START> this is not a good film by an standards it is very poorly written and the acting is just a little above par some performances are well below par but <UNK> and grey do a very good job with little to work with br br what was good br br the dance sequences were choreographed very well and as stated above <UNK> and grey were high points br br what was bad br br the script the bad guys were simply too evil to be believable the best villains are the ones who aren't so obviously evil these guys the <UNK> nephew the <UNK> who <UNK> the girl do and say nothing that would leave me to believe they could be real people perhaps there are guys like them but i sure don't want to see a movie about it br br another scene the first where grey and <UNK> meet when the employees at the resort are dancing <UNK> and grey dance together and seem to enjoy themselves the next time they meet <UNK> is hostile towards her why what happened in between to make him dislike her so when they <UNK> well together br br and some of those lines i mean come on i <UNK> at the end when <UNK> <UNK> the line nobody puts baby in the corner how did he ever do that with a straight face br br another thing wrong the setting of the 1960's everyone looked and dressed like the 1980's who was in charge of the costumes and <UNK> br br the music original music for the film was laughable with the exception of i had the time of my life which was a good song br br not the worst film i've ever seen but definitely the most over rated
<START> i can laugh at just about anything but unfortunately there is not a single one to be found in this stink bomb i honestly watched this movie from beginning to end and did not even crack a smile i am shocked that sandler schneider spade etc would put their names on this piece of crap worse than the worst that ever came out of the worst that ever came out of former snl players what more can i say how could such tasteless extremely unfunny drivel come from such a pool of apparent talent maybe i have lost my sense of humor not likely but i cannot remember a movie that i have disliked this much in a long time what a waste of 2 hours i will never get back
<START> absolutely one of the worst movies i've ever seen the beginning was not the greatest either but better than this one this is not a good way to lead up to the original movie it's just simply awful the cgi <UNK> were so fake looking in both movies why not use real animals i enjoyed the old <UNK> movies better than this i was <UNK> disappointed the only good thing i can say about this waste of film is the cinematography and clothes which really captured that era well i understand why this movie was <UNK> as the beginning it's just that bad in my opinion where does the money come from to waste like this give me a multi million dollar budget and i'll show you how it should be done
<START> the feeling of the need to have someone play the role of <UNK> of public taste and political correctness always manages to get under our skin it does seem that these self <UNK> self superior pseudo intellectual types do appear everywhere be it in one's family church or <UNK> league br br these are the guys who would have society completely disregard and ignore all that went before us unless of course whatever <UNK> is does not fly in the face of today's acceptable language <UNK> and general standards of proper behavior br br so it is that these latter day high tech book <UNK> have targeted a great deal of what was hollywood's greatest achievement namely their participation in our own allied propaganda via their <UNK> crafted message and theme films br br <UNK> brutal in its generation the banned code and list of now <UNK> <UNK> into the wartime cartoons that don't meet with the new <UNK> <UNK> socially <UNK> <UNK> attitudes which these thought police have <UNK> down upon us br br we were truly surprised to see that there seem to be volumes of such animated short subjects the majority we are aware of are from warner <UNK> looney tunes and <UNK> <UNK> featuring bugs <UNK> elmer <UNK> all in conflict with hitler <UNK> and the like surprisingly though we found an ample supply of cartoons from mgm walt disney paramount famous studios and the brothers <UNK> br br you're a <UNK> mr <UNK> famous studios paramount pictures 1942 is a prime example of just what we're talking about br br being virtually <UNK> from the cartoons that were the <UNK> of the studios of max and dave <UNK> before the 1941 business coup de <UNK> that moved them out bringing the new name of famous studios you're a <UNK> mr <UNK> bore none of the bland plot elements that would <UNK> the latter day <UNK> cartoons down to the level of the ultimate formula short movie br br we all remember how we'd have <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> together enter <UNK> usually the <UNK> of wolf <UNK> and an on acceptable on screen version of a male reaction to feminine <UNK> falls for <UNK> less than honorable <UNK> until he gets a little too physical and <UNK> <UNK> out hey babe how <UNK> a kiss at this point we hear help help <UNK> and the <UNK> sailor shows up to save the day <UNK> with the obligatory can of <UNK> do we <UNK> <UNK> once again this <UNK> <UNK> cartoon is nothing like any of that oh sure it follows the storyline of now having <UNK> in the u s navy the brothers <UNK> put the little guy in the service in 1941 to <UNK> to the mood in the country and as an open gesture of support for the men now being <UNK> in the first <UNK> draft in united states history max and dave even put <UNK> in service aboard the mythical <UNK> the u s s br br our point is just this you're a <UNK> mr <UNK> and others like <UNK> <UNK> britain aren't cartoon vehicles for comic relief in the <UNK> program at all in the true sense rather they are a sort of <UNK> of <UNK> cartoons much like those from any great <UNK> newspaper these animated shorts much like those still one <UNK> <UNK> have characters that are highly symbolic and representative of nations ideas and ideals such as a just and lasting peace in most cases the hero <UNK> bugs bunny or whoever is alone with the symbol of the enemy both are highly exaggerated visual <UNK> for abstract concept and thought even if they are <UNK> in humorous <UNK> for wider br br our liberal the <UNK> of may not see themselves this way but for this sort of behavior they are no more than neo nazi book <UNK> br br please allow the future generations to view and appreciate a view of past happenings that is both historical and humorous br br <UNK> <UNK>
<START> a <UNK> self centered army <UNK> arrives at west point with a dangerous wise guy attitude towards the <UNK> br br in a role obviously <UNK> made for him william haines shines in this highly enjoyable tale of honor friendship a grade a scene <UNK> haines during the first half of the film is up to his usual silly billy behavior which under normal circumstances should have gotten him confined to the the last half however becomes very serious leading up to <UNK> moral redemption and giving him a fine opportunity to exhibit his acting talents if west point does not quite reach the caliber of <UNK> previous tell it to the marines <UNK> this is <UNK> due to the absence here of a <UNK> of the charisma quality of <UNK> <UNK> for haines to interact with however this tribute to the army is very effective entertainment and should be appreciated on its own merit br br joan crawford appears as <UNK> love interest playing the <UNK> daughter of the local <UNK> joan is <UNK> pretty and especially shines in her first scenes when she meets haines on a hudson river ferry and is subjected to his usual immature antics haines crawford made five silent feature films together and were tremendous friends for life he was the much bigger celebrity at this period and gave her many hints for getting ahead in hollywood a superstar herself by the early 1930's she <UNK> after his from mgm in 1932 by <UNK> his career change to interior decoration br br little william <UNK> is effectively cast as a who <UNK> haines their relationship is actually given more of a sentimental treatment than that of haines crawford br br the film was made with the full <UNK> of the war department extensive location filming at the academy helps tremendously with the <UNK> ambiance which was given splendid production values by mgm br br west point has been recently restored and given a rousing new score by david <UNK>
<START> i'm glad i didn't pay to see 'the <UNK> br br i sat there hopefully waiting for something original and or funny to happen br br it reminded me very much of those predictable english comedies of the 1970s br br i won't bother with a synopsis of the plot i suggest you do something else for 90 minutes br br
<START> i admire <UNK> <UNK> and this movie is a masterpiece i'd recommend to buy this movie on dvd because it's a movie you might want to watch more often than just once and trust me you'd still find little meaningful details after watching it several times br br the characters except for the grandmother perhaps are all very balanced no black and white even though you follow the story from the perspective of the two protagonists there is also empathy for the other characters br br i think the imdb rating for the movie is far too low probably due to its politically controversial content
<START> i watched primarily for the presence of michael <UNK> as i enjoyed his <UNK> portrayal on star trek <UNK> but had never seen him out of his makeup <UNK> appears to have a nice presence and probably has the potential for a <UNK> acting career this movie however gave him little dramatic challenge except to prove that he can indeed use the f word br br it appears that this movie was made by someone who <UNK> himself as a forward thinking type with a social conscience yeah for 1965 today the themes are so <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> that even spike lee's dreadful <UNK> looks good in comparison br br this crime caper flick has an intricate <UNK> of double triple and <UNK> crosses but the plot scheme is so convoluted that it <UNK> upon itself within the first 30 minutes mostly after that point i simply watched out of momentum and a mild curiosity about how each scene would play out there is a great cast here you will recognize virtually everyone as a character actor from much better movies why are they all in this i suspect it was 1 the work and some money even if modest 2 perhaps the director knows all these actors from acting classes and social connections around la you know perhaps they <UNK> to support him as a fellow struggling movie guy on the third and fourth of the hollywood scene <UNK> but the movie was half baked not really finished i gave it a 3 although my affection for the actors involved was from my admiration of their previous work let's hope everybody has moved on to more professional more carefully done and more <UNK> projects since
<START> let me start out by saying i love horror movies big budget low budget big name actors no name actors it doesn't matter and when it comes to judging movies i am very <UNK> this movie however is pretty bad br br the actors show little or no emotion when delivering their lines and the acting is worse than many lower budget horror flicks i've seen as the actors get killed off you could care less there is very little gore i have no idea what film other reviewers watched when they say there is good gore in this one because there isn't and the special effects are <UNK> at best they steal so much from so many better horror movies <UNK> <UNK> friday the 13th <UNK> and it still doesn't help br br luckily i saw this on showtime and didn't have to actually pay any extra money to see it or waste a spot in my netflix <UNK> on it there are so many better horror movies out there and i recommend you see those instead of this big letdown
<START> it <UNK> me that production companies will sue because of they will not supply i've been looking for this movie on dvd for a while and vhs for years one can get all sorts of movies on line old movies new movies but it all targets a particular group this movie is very nostalgic for many i'm not sure why i can't get a copy maybe if enough people will write in the <UNK> <UNK> will get a clue it's about time for this to happen yes it's date but so is the wizard of oz it doesn't seem like this should be so difficult so for now i'll keep seeing those illegal copies on search <UNK> like many others
<START> i was really disappointed with this movie i had heard some great reviews about it and unfortunately missed seeing it in theaters as a result of this i was really excited to see it when it came to dvd i thought that it was going to be a high paced horror movie with a lot of scary surprises but instead it was a <UNK> paced predictable movie it dragged and dragged without a climax in it and after all the difficulties that those people went through to try and escape the ending was completely frustrating i gave this movie two stars for one reason this is not your typical horror movie with one central bad guy <UNK> a bunch of people to death the story makes this movie unique and provides a change for people who watch a lot of horror movies even though i don't like this movie i recommend that all horror fans do see it at least once you may surprisingly like it as for this horror fan all i can say is that i hope there isn't a sequel to this forgettable movie
<START> what is night vision well according to the star <UNK> let's see one package store owner says to him <UNK> getting dark to which he replies <UNK> makes for better <UNK> vision ' what in the hell does that mean in fact what in the hell is this movie trying to say it has plot holes that you could drive the killer's van through not to mention a cop on duty drinking robert <UNK> <UNK> through this bizarre attempt at <UNK> in on the serial killer <UNK> and a killer who videos his murders that's actually all i remember br br the film took place in texas had a few car chases and a clichéd ending perhaps if one watches this film with their eyes closed it might be good after all without being able to see it it would make for better night vision did that make sense nope and neither does this film
<START> what can i say about kramer vs kramer on the surface it's rather simple but underneath it deals with emotions greater than life itself it delivers many fantastic moments it makes you laugh it makes you cry you sympathize with the characters and you care about them many films fail at this kramer vs kramer is a success br br i think everyone would agree the acting is superb once you watch kramer vs kramer for some time the acting in most other films starts to feel plastic and <UNK> the actors seem to get along well with their roles and the characters really live on the screen there's some beautiful chemistry between them i think the best performance in the film comes from the young justin henry he's different from any other child actor i've ever seen he's amazingly natural br br also there's some kind of neurotic beauty in meryl streep and dustin hoffman delivers one of the best performances of his career the story is very well written it's simple but complicated at the same time the concept is the simple part the feelings associated is the complicated part of it br br if you haven't seen this film yet you're definitely missing out see it now
<START> jack and kate meet the <UNK> daniel first and then the <UNK> miles and they demonstrate that have not come to the island with the intention of <UNK> the survivors locke and his group find the <UNK> charlotte <UNK> lewis and ben <UNK> shoots her meanwhile the group of jack finds the pilot frank who landed the helicopter with minor <UNK> that can be <UNK> jack forces miles to tell the real intention why they have come to the island br br the second episode of the fourth season returns to the island with four new characters stops the confusing flash <UNK> and it seems that will finally be the beginning of the explanations that i and most of the fans and viewers expect to be provided in lost why the interest of the government in ben <UNK> and how he is informed from the boat are some of the questions that i expect to see in the next episodes my vote is eight br br title brazil not available
<START> <UNK> on czech ww2 pilots  the older <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and in the background the quiet piano playing as the film opens it is 1950 the war is over and <UNK> and are imprisoned in a former monastery in their now soviet controlled native country they are of the <UNK> is severely by his communist <UNK> and dies br br in 1939 many pilots manage to escape german occupied europe and make their way to england where they join the <UNK> notwithstanding their high motivation and experience they face <UNK> <UNK> and british stiff upper lip finally they fight in the battle of britain however <UNK> and <UNK> find their friendship severely tested when they both fall for the same woman br br in terms of romantic sub plot this is very similar to the hollywood production pearl <UNK> however given the context of the film and eventual fate it is also possible to read the english woman's treatment of the two men as symbolic of british treatment of the czech and polish <UNK> pilots conveniently forgetting them once the war is over br br in addition the film is a lot less cliché than pearl <UNK> and the characters are more fully realised dark blue world also scores in terms of its stunning <UNK> <UNK> which were <UNK> created using a mixture of models actual live action <UNK> filming and out takes from the 1969 epic the battle of britain br br in short dark blue world is a well made moving thought provoking and exciting drama that puts the likes of pearl <UNK> to shame highly recommended
<START> when this show first came to disney i love it started watching all the time it quickly became one of my favorite disney shows ever but this show somehow transformed into something that is disturbing and disappointing br br i do now find any of the second and third season fun they seem like a re watch of some teens shows i hat that garbage the first season was very unique because it showed <UNK> who loved science and animals and creatures the first season was very entertaining i mostly don't like the second season because of ben he <UNK> me and <UNK> the crap outta me the plot in the second season also sucks and is just awful
<START> am a hardcore horror thriller fan when i was for good horror flick to scare me on my weekend night grabbed <UNK> with <UNK> blood <UNK> <UNK> movie poster added to average ratings in imdb but i was wrong after <UNK> this crap no characterisation sick dialogues with sexy babes <UNK> boobs i got the feel of <UNK> porno certainly and the which so called main theme or suspense of the story sucks big time and here comes the clown funny mask to scare think users rated this movie went nuts it deserves 1 out of 10 i give 2 for bare boobs babes n soundtrack it has
<START> this movie has some good lines but watching <UNK> less than masterful rourke <UNK> just left me wanting to see the original i like marisa tomei but she's no faye <UNK> br br also in my opinion the number one movie rule is to make the lead character someone you care about you might not love the character but you should care what happens to him this is achieved in <UNK> with the hilarious running gag about the fights with eddie the bartender the main fight in <UNK> is when completely <UNK> he stalks up to the lily taylor character in a bar punches her to the floor and calls her a whore br br the whole thing just didn't work again some great lines some laugh out loud funny but as a movie overall it's a fail mediocre attempt at <UNK> something that was brilliant and you can't get past that next let's remake breakfast at <UNK> with kate hudson
<START> i watched this on cable because i was a big <UNK> fan big mistake what a horrible film you don't care one bit for any of the characters in the movie chris <UNK> plays a guy who is a complete jerk in the film and steals away josh <UNK> longtime girlfriend if the writer knew what they were doing this film would have followed the <UNK> formula and made <UNK> an ass and <UNK> as the girlfriend trapped in a bad relationship from which she's saved by <UNK> but <UNK> is a really cool guy who shows a lot of emotion and love for <UNK> br br you then hate <UNK> because she <UNK> on <UNK> with <UNK> who is a jerk to everyone in the town that's trying to help him and really stuck up br br it's also really campy and the characters do everything but run around the kitchen dancing and lip <UNK> and using and <UNK> and fake <UNK> although they come very close br br what a horrible horrible movie you don't even care what happens in the end because the director never lets you care about the characters
<START> great movie great actors great soundtrack i loved it settings are perfect dialogues situations storyline all together mixed to give this masterpiece clooney and <UNK> are magnificent and the <UNK> bottom boys are simply charming and <UNK> with their music
<START> she's the man was everything i wanted it to be and maybe even a little more i love the teen type chick flick films and i knew this one would be great in the same vein as 10 things i hate about you one of my all time <UNK> she's the man is a unique well written very well performed comedy with some of the funniest lines and physical comedy i have seen in a long time it's probably the funniest movie i've seen this year with the exception of the hilarious pink <UNK> but she's the man is actually a more intellectual funny and most of the humor relies on the witty script <UNK> company style story of mistaken identities and mixed messages and the cast br br amanda <UNK> is a star even since the days of the horribly campy yet strangely entertaining the amanda show she has shown a brilliant talent for comedy she's probably one of the most talented <UNK> out there her style of physical comedy <UNK> and witty <UNK> makes her hilarious previously her big screen debut where she was the star was the rather hilarious and well made what a girl wants if that wasn't her break out vehicle than she's the man takes care of that hands down <UNK> is really the ultimate girl next door it's a shame she doesn't do more big screen work because she could be the next it girl she is the all american cute down to earth <UNK> teen although she's twenty now and whether or not she'll be able to carry her talent and style over to being an adult actor will remain to be seen but for the purpose of this film she is perfect she actually <UNK> pulls off the rather outlandish plot of her <UNK> her twin brother and makes it believable not entirely but believable enough most of the script relies on the comedy of her errors trying to be a guy but it's just hilarious non stop laughs <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> himself from his <UNK> performance in <UNK> havoc by plays duke he's the jock the captain of the soccer team and eventually <UNK> object of affection unfortunately he's also <UNK> room mate who is <UNK> he's a good leading man and the chemistry is perfect between them laura <UNK> is olivia who happens to be attracted to sebastian who again is <UNK> she does good as well although her part is small and she doesn't really effect the rest of the cast one way or another james kirk is great in his small role as the real sebastian his resemblance to amanda <UNK> is astonishing they are absolutely believable as twins and further more from a distance you could understand someone believing <UNK> is sebastian the rest of the cast all fit in there somewhere and their roles range from brief to more supporting but essentially they are all supporting the story between <UNK> and <UNK> but everyone is more or less supporting <UNK> terrific performance she easily carries the film with no and makes it worth while br br this is one of those films that shows so much in the trailer and yet it's not one of those films that when that part comes up it's not funny anymore the parts in the trailer that make you laugh are even more hilarious in the actual film relative newcomer director andy <UNK> does such an incredible job on this film he weaves together a potentially complicated storyline and makes it flow naturally and makes everything fall together the story which is loosely based off of <UNK> <UNK> night but it's remarkable how much they managed to translate over to this modern day film it's seemingly completely off the wall but more exact to the classic comedy than you'd think there isn't too much to say about a downside except that the last half hour drags a little and also becomes a might predictable but it doesn't change the hilarity of the first half of the film nonetheless you'll be laughing to tears and it's one of the funniest films in the theater right now hands down 9 10
<START> i actually liked certain things about this game i loved the first person perspective and wish we had had that choice in the first three games there's nothing like seeing the monsters up close in your face the graphics really weren't bad but i would have liked more things to interact with even though it was just a <UNK> the music was fine the things i hated were the movement kind of sucked and aiming was a total pain the story was too lame for words and too much of the same old thing with no originality the inability to save was awful some of us do have a life and would like to save to finish the game later i thought the weapons kind of sucked too this game is fun for awhile but it's nothing like the first three and only good if you just want to shoot stuff i'd recommend it for the novelty of playing in the first person but that's about it play it at your own risk
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a hollywood genre that has been done and <UNK> so many times that clichéd dialogue <UNK> plot and over the top action sequences seem <UNK> for any conflict dealing with large scale combat once in a while however a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen the civil war era cold mountain starring jude law nicole kidman and <UNK> <UNK> is such a film br br then again calling cold mountain a war movie is not entirely accurate true enough the film opens with a quite literally quick and dirty battle sequence that puts glory director edward <UNK> shame however cold mountain is not so much about the civil war itself as it is about the period and the people of the times the story centers around disgruntled <UNK> soldier played by jude law who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and <UNK> for the beautiful hamlet of cold mountain north <UNK> and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind <UNK> monroe played by nicole kidman at first glance this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant <UNK> <UNK> on the battlefield indeed the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived br br cold mountain soon takes a <UNK> turn though as the <UNK> hero turns out to be a <UNK> incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the <UNK> and begins a long odyssey <UNK> meanwhile back at the farm <UNK> <UNK> ways prove of little use in the fields soon she is transformed into something of a coming to <UNK> rescue is the course tough as nails ruby played by <UNK> <UNK> who helps <UNK> put the farm back together and perhaps more importantly cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon <UNK> br br within these two settings a vivid compelling and at times very disturbing portrait of the war torn south unfolds the characters with whom and <UNK> interact are surprisingly complex enhanced by wonderful performances of brendan <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> father ray <UNK> as an <UNK> southern <UNK> and natalie portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother all have been greatly affected and changed by the war of northern <UNK> mostly for the worse the dark <UNK> anti war message <UNK> by an effective haunting score and <UNK> beautiful shots of virginia and north <UNK> is <UNK> to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the <UNK> land and traumatized people for which the war was fought though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century it's <UNK> effect on the land is relevant br br director anthony manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film but the atmosphere is unfortunately <UNK> by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters the love story between and <UNK> is <UNK> tacked onto the beginning and end of the film though the <UNK> distant <UNK> and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot br br make no mistake cold mountain has neither the traits of a feel good romance nor an inspiring war drama it is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly <UNK> the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible <UNK> altogether

actually enjoyed him in starship troopers that may be because he's good in action scenes it might also be because he didn't talk much in that movie in <UNK> he's unfortunately given just enough lines in situations that are just dramatic enough to showcase his entirely average acting abilities amanda crew is also okay and ryan <UNK> isn't bad either vincent <UNK> and <UNK> von are also both reasonably good but <UNK> is sadly on a par with van <UNK> br br what really makes or breaks a movie though is the story and the script while the story here is okay and actually has some real potential the script is just awful the science part of the science fiction is non existent starting with the <UNK> pushing the earth out of <UNK> and <UNK> with the notion that the <UNK> balance of the <UNK> system might pull the earth back into its usual <UNK> over time when the <UNK> in la hits <UNK> degrees cars start blowing up br br you know what's even worse than the bad science the bad continuity okay really hot why are people in the movie not only wearing long <UNK> shirts but <UNK> too why are people <UNK> each other for <UNK> water instead of turning on the <UNK> at home why are the streets completely empty but the <UNK> completely full and why are the <UNK> full of <UNK> it's almost superfluous to note that the sets costumes and production values were good especially when that only forces me to say that the edits were not br br so basically you take a pretty good story idea and combine it with mostly mediocre acting a terrible script low end special effects utterly irrational plot twists and poor edits and what do you have a movie that's even less than the sum of its parts i'm sorry to say that i can't recommend <UNK> days of destruction to anyone br br political notes there is mention here that <UNK> finally <UNK> the purse strings enough to <UNK> the <UNK> that start the movie rolling while the <UNK> here were wholly irresponsible <UNK> an <UNK> with a <UNK> and not knowing the composition of the big rock is in fact well beyond irresponsible and approaching the insane the fact is that such scenarios are a very real danger to the planet unfortunately we've <UNK> nowhere near all of the near earth <UNK> that could be <UNK> in some <UNK> some day and our ability to spot something on a <UNK> course with us is limited at best br br once we do discover we're going to be hit we quite literally have no system in place to deal with it there are no nuclear <UNK> space <UNK> we can launch the space <UNK> is completely incapable of going beyond earth <UNK> and if it were we couldn't launch enough of them or launch them quickly enough for it to matter i'm not big on the government doing anything beyond its <UNK> <UNK> but i certainly think protecting the planet from destruction coming at us from outer space could be <UNK> as defending the country don't you family <UNK> days of destruction is rated r for some violence i frankly didn't find the violence here anything beyond a fairly typical t rated video game if your teens are keen on seeing <UNK> and you can't talk them out of it the r rating shouldn't <UNK> you from letting them see it it's not however a good idea to leave the younger kids in the room with their elder siblings while the shootings aren't too graphic in the main some of the dead bodies are
<START> great fun for an evening on the <UNK> don't expect academy award stuff with this but it will leave you with a smile the performance by bruce <UNK> is truly good the soundtrack shows off some great old australian talent check out this and other true aussie films
<START> i have not read a time to kill by john <UNK> and perhaps that would have helped understand the film better but perhaps not i hear this is the most faithful <UNK> adaption yet and if that is true i can see why so many <UNK> turned down the novel when <UNK> introduced it as his first work br br a time to kill is one of those films that is seriously confused and wants to do too many things at once it wants to be a suspenseful crowd pleasing thriller and at the same time a film dedicated to exploring certain social and moral questions let's face it those two types of films do not go together in hollywood which is why dead man walking had to be made <UNK> br br the story involves a young lawyer named jake matthew out to defend a black man named carl samuel l jackson from murdering two <UNK> that brutally raped his young daughter the day before the trial carl <UNK> in a closet in the <UNK> and when the <UNK> were brought through the building he charged out and shot both of them dead to help out with the defense jack accepts the help of a former law student sandra <UNK> who proves that her role in this film was totally unnecessary and put in the film only for marketing purposes br br meanwhile one of the <UNK> kid brother <UNK> sutherland was <UNK> that a black man killed his brother and decided to act out a revenge all of this leads to a shooting in front of the <UNK> a kidnapping a brutal beating and race riot i'll admit that all of this held my attention greatly throughout the film in addition to the courtroom scenes what i later <UNK> to was the film's handling of <UNK> questions and its use of <UNK> in the plot br br the main question that the film constantly asks over and over again is whether a black man gets a fair trial from a white jury sure they can but that doesn't mean that the man has to be <UNK> in order for the trial to be fair this film however doesn't seem to think so besides that there several <UNK> holes in the plot used for <UNK> for example there is an unknown character called mickey mouse who is a member of the <UNK> and for reasons unknown is helping the members of the defense team escape from serious dangers of the other members of the <UNK> after <UNK> is kidnapped by sutherland and company and left for dead in the wilderness this unknown person comes and saves her and we never find out who he is and why he is helping out the people he should be <UNK> br br and speaking of the sutherland character's reign of terror it's amazing how witless the police and the <UNK> character are in stopping him throughout the film there's a scene when sutherland becomes a sniper from a building across the street from the <UNK> and tries to shoot jake as he comes out shooting one of the guards instead now you'd think since there are dozens of police around it would be easy to surround and capture the sniper no such luck from what we could see no one seemed to even care that a sniper was still on the loose even after <UNK> was rescued by mickey mouse she never ever mentioned who her <UNK> was nor was it even <UNK> why was this simple the sutherland character was needed throughout the film to add <UNK> suspense although <UNK> he should have been out of the picture br br besides <UNK> character there another <UNK> character he is <UNK> assistant played by oliver <UNK> there seems to be one reason for his character to be in the movie to supply a number of one liners for the audience in my opinion one liners show a major weakness in serious films when used it demonstrates that the filmmakers are not confident that the story and dialogue alone are enough to keep the audience's attention and so use them to make the audience laugh to <UNK> everyone that they are watching an entertaining film br br but enough of the film's many minor problems what about the film's message here it is clear that carl is indeed guilty of murder we saw how he planned for hours to murder the men who raped his daughter the lawyers argue that it was temporary insanity etc that caused him to kill in desperation jake asks the jury to close their eyes as he <UNK> the rape in detail as part of his closing after describing everything that took place he adds on one final line the girl is white we then see members of the jury with tears in their eyes br br in the very next scene a girl comes out yelling he's free he's free wait a minute do <UNK> base their <UNK> on their emotions or on the facts most of all why weren't there any scenes that showed the jury and what they were really thinking after their emotions worn off i'll tell you why they couldn't show the because no jury could <UNK> a man of such a crime no matter how much the closing touched their hearts what is the message that someone is justified in killing if it is a form of revenge for a previous crime done to them br br this film should have had the courage to say that murder is not ok in this situation because in reality there would not be an <UNK> but since dollars were at stake the filmmakers were more concerned about <UNK> the <UNK> feelings than they were about presenting a responsible message if people start killing as a form of revenge the makers of this film should be held responsible what a socially irresponsible film this is
<START> although this film looks like a crime thriller noir the plot is actually a bit simplistic and with very few surprise twists or turns at all and those that do appear are not exactly <UNK> br br however if you slip out of action <UNK> mode and into entertainment ' then this is really quite a fun movie with several hilarious moments most of these can be attributed to the witty dialogue between alan <UNK> and emma <UNK> characters but that said <UNK> said it all in her hilarious opening <UNK> to <UNK> and it left very little else for anything else to develop between these two characters i didn't find these <UNK> british actors version of the southern accents that bad ok thompson sounded like she was rolling <UNK> in her mouth as she tried to spoke southern but <UNK> was surprisingly rather good with very few minor <UNK> into his <UNK> english accent if you want to critique accents lets discuss that of <UNK> she only spoke southern <UNK> br br
<START> the king is alive is a flawed and contrived mess of a movie which comes off like a self indulgent <UNK> excuse to transport a bunch of actors to a <UNK> desert where he can play major <UNK> and film his <UNK> conceived silly overwrought drama with utter disregard for the real forces of human nature market appeal common sense and even good art in other words this is one flick and if you don't believe that your <UNK> is watching it only for critics and the like d
<START> i think this is <UNK> <UNK> best stuff he played the part perfect i really enjoyed this movie patrick is really funny as <UNK> the annoying little brother son in law is a good comedy worth your time but the only thing i wish <UNK> <UNK> was the farm chick instead of the one they had
<START> a nicely paced romantic war story that should have got more exposure the czech pilot who played piano gives a <UNK> touch to the story the flying footage may not have been enough for <UNK> buffs like myself but then again this really isn't an action movie though it does not have anything in common with the james novel the hunters that became the movie about korean war <UNK> pilots dark blue world had a similar feel but with more of a romantic element to it better in some ways than battle of britain in that it doesn't rely on big name actors suggest viewing this movie with some czech beer and some czech called <UNK>
<START> this film marked the end of the serious universal monsters era <UNK> and <UNK> meet up with the monsters later in <UNK> and <UNK> meet it was a somewhat <UNK> yet fun attempt to revive the classic monsters of the wolf man <UNK> monster and dracula one last time br br i say <UNK> because in the previous film house of frankenstein both dracula and the wolf man are killed according to how the vampire and werewolf legends say they should be dracula by the <UNK> and the wolf man by a silver bullet yet somehow they return in house of dracula with no explanation this movie could have played as a kind of prequel to house of frankenstein if the frankenstein monster plot wouldn't be continuing <UNK> into house of dracula from house of frankenstein and if the wolf man didn't get <UNK> then <UNK> be no plot holes but since this is not the case the plots of dracula and the wolf man make no sense br br however ignoring these plot holes house of dracula is a classic atmospheric horror film that's fun to watch it has many high points especially seeing the wolf man get <UNK> i know i just said that this shouldn't have been included but it was nice to actually see him get <UNK> after all this time and the scene with the lady playing <UNK> on the piano then all of a sudden playing a haunting melody when under <UNK> spell was very eerie dr transformation into the dr mr hyde type character was also done very well br br and it's great to see dracula frankenstein and the wolf man together one last time br br out of
<START> the andrew davies adaptation of the sarah <UNK> novel was excellent the characters of <UNK> and and kitty were superbly portrayed by <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> respectively the whole series was a total joy to watch it caught the imagination of everyone across the board whether straight or gay i wish there could be a sequel
<START> i liked this movie i wasn't really sure what it was about before i started watching it but enjoyed it nonetheless it was about a girl meredith monroe whose mom didn't want her to turn out like she did she meets and falls in love with a boy <UNK> smith who is town for a charity football game it's a good movie i just hope it will be on again or comes out on video
<START> i'm 15 usually not kids my age usually watch these old classic movies but this is one of my favorites i was totally addicted after watching it for the first time it's really good if u think about technology and movies back at that time music is great storyline is ok choreography is great must see it i don't know why there's a prequel for this movie not many people like this movie but i love classic love movies they're so much better than movies now this movie will make you smile cry and make you start dancing the music is absolutely ear catching and beautiful i haven't seen dirty dancing 2 nights prequel prequel should have star the original actors thats what i hate about <UNK> they ruin the original no one wants a prequel they want a sequel many people will agree that for a movie the original sequel and the 3rd one is enough beyond that people wont be bothered to watch it who remembers the movie about the st <UNK> <UNK> i think there's 5 movies altogether
<START> it's <UNK> to see that other imdb reviewers have had the good sense to pan this disappointing film at the risk of against the great <UNK> and fellini br br these directors may be talented artistic in their own right however in attempting to pass off this <UNK> of attempted <UNK> and 60s <UNK> as in any way related to edgar allen <UNK> stories they exposed themselves as <UNK> either a they didn't bother to read the poe stories or b they read them but were so <UNK> by their own <UNK> agenda that they didn't pay poe any mind br br imagine if <UNK> <UNK> in their <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> up to 11 and out 3 <UNK> claiming it to be <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that's the feeling you'll get after sitting through this film if you're a <UNK> fellini fan <UNK> you'll dig it if you're a <UNK> fan poe you'll <UNK> br br br br here we begin with a bizarre porno version of poe ok porno may be a bit extreme haha but at the very least you have to call it a <UNK> version including i don't doubt some of jane's outfits coming directly from the set of that scifi romp falls into old clichés of his own the girl lying on a bed being <UNK> by some man whilst from the <UNK> <UNK> we see the <UNK> in her eyes the general and <UNK> of a woman who finds no satisfaction in <UNK> cute stuff but ain't the place for it and in addition to the <UNK> outfits and irrelevant erotic themes jane <UNK> awful american accent and unconvincing performance as a european <UNK> made this the worst casting since julia roberts in that lousy version of dr <UNK> mr hyde br br william wilson br br here's a great poe story about the madness that claims a man when he realizes that he is no longer unique in the world if you really want to see a fantastic visual interpretation of this theme go watch star trek episode 27 the alternative factor but here <UNK> over that central theme and instead focuses on any <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> ho hum <UNK> role is a complete <UNK> to accomplish that end and once again the director <UNK> a classic poe story into a <UNK> <UNK> of his own <UNK> sexual issues do it on your own time <UNK> i thought we're here on <UNK> dime br br toby <UNK> br br the absolute worst of the three and possibly the worst film i've seen since staying alive at least fellini showed some <UNK> in changing the title but his departure from the original plot theme and humour of the story is so vast i wonder if he just picked this reel out of his private collection of home movies <UNK> edgar allen poe story on it and <UNK> it to this collection i strained very hard to find any thread of <UNK> with <UNK> works but there was absolutely none br br the original poe story never bet the devil your head is a short and hilarious dark fable about a man who constantly <UNK> i'll bet the devil my head on a <UNK> morning the devil takes him up on his offer the result is the <UNK> and <UNK> thing you've ever read this was poe the comedian at his finest yes poe wrote many comedies also check out a <UNK> and devil in the if you want a taste of his witty satirical works br br this fellini version it's bland soulless and not funny at all unless you consider it funny to see a drunk stumbling over himself for 45 minutes here <UNK> <UNK> rant is about an artist struggling with the <UNK> <UNK> and mediocrity of cinema most of it is set at an awards ceremony where fellini beats us over the head with sarcasm cynicism and that classic sour <UNK> attitude that we find in all fellini films dealing with cinema note the sarcastic <UNK> at the critics a recurring theme in <UNK> films for someone who considered himself above the critics fellini sure spent a lot of time talking about them at any rate i feel like fellini just took some <UNK> from 8 1 2 spliced them together and sold it as a poe story worst adaptation ever br br i think i put more effort into <UNK> this review than any of the three directors put into making a poe movie
<START> eddie murphy put a lot into this movie by directed wrote starred and produced this story about two owners in the 30s who try to fight <UNK> and corrupt cops from taking over their club a great cast in murphy <UNK> foxx richard <UNK> danny aiello della reese and a gorgeous <UNK> guy that would make it worth seeing on its own but the story just <UNK> hold up interest or give the great cast enough to work with on a scale of one to ten a 4
<START> i was looking at the <UNK> reviews ebert etc for this film and they were all pretty much negative however after reading many of them i noticed that they all made the same point critics were upset that the film centers around what appears to be a senseless murder of an <UNK> child certainly this is a disturbing image critics like ebert want a traditional detective story that <UNK> why the killing happened and <UNK> places blame on the guilty they want blame to be cast and resolved well that status <UNK> theme is kind of what the movie is <UNK> just like society the critics wanted a very quick resolution so they could move on to their next tragic opera perhaps there is no simple question to be answered here there is a whole lot more to what happened then what is on the surface the film does not seek to <UNK> what happens but rather understand the why what also <UNK> me so much about these inane reviews is that all they look at in the way of performances is spacey and cheadle who were both great and generally are but there are other great performances at work here other than just the two current icons of hollywood <UNK> gives an incredible performance that really only somebody of his extreme talent could deliver somehow <UNK> is able to make the killer of an <UNK> child sympathetic this <UNK> many i am sure however if one watches the film they see what motivation is it is wrong but it is not evil malone is also on top of her game as yet another confused young character basically the killing of the child in this film is not the main theme of the movie the main theme is life itself and how people go about dealing with it the <UNK> and <UNK> and how they attempt to sometimes help others deal with their lives which does not seem to work out very well there is a lot of good and bad in this world and how we handle each has direct impact on how much more good and bad will take place and sometimes a confused attempt at doing good can lead to a whole bunch more of bad i think this is one of the more memorable films in sometime and has an ending that is as touching as anything in recent movie history i strongly believe people should view this film with an open mind
<START> a blatant rip off of air bud this movie is really about parents worrying too much about <UNK> all the <UNK> of the characters <UNK> adult <UNK> who dont know the game are taken to the extreme so much so that they are totally unbelievable not funny br br there is no semblance of reality here folks and you'll not develop sympathy for any of the characters br br the best thing about the movie is the good looking <UNK> uniforms of the <UNK> team in the first game the dog plays perhaps chosen because the setting is supposedly near <UNK> heights <UNK> the home of the <UNK> <UNK> franchise player brian <UNK>
<START> wow i think the overall average rating of this film on this site is incredibly low there's really no reason to dislike this film michael is a simple but fairly original and easily enjoyable romantic comedy the plot involves a group of <UNK> experts going to examine the mysterious appearance of an angel john travolta in the <UNK> the angel proves to be less <UNK> and more <UNK> than we would expect and that's what makes it entertaining his interest in women and the beatles takes a new spin on the angel thing the romantic side of this film involves michael the angel trying to get <UNK> <UNK> and william hurt together the two of them may not have the all time greatest on screen chemistry but they certainly have enough to make it work well everyone who has rated this film so low a 5 4 come on the film is not that bad in fact i found it quite funny and memorable sure it's not the best thing you'll ever see but it's still good this is a film i feel has been remarkably underrated it's fun romantic and recommended by me br br out of
<START> you don't see the meaning of the title till much later but you get the point of it in the first few minutes this directorial debut from golden globe nominated for actor danny <UNK> also playing owen ned <UNK> lift is a terrific hitchcock like film about one man's hate for his wife's book she stole his and one man's hate for his mother basically owen wants to be a good writer like his teacher larry <UNK> billy crystal and he inspired by murder stories larry suggests he see a hitchcock film quite ironic and that is when owen has the idea to kill <UNK> ex wife margaret star trek <UNK> kate <UNK> owen is inspired by on a <UNK> <UNK> murders so larry must kill <UNK> horrible <UNK> oscar and golden globe nominated anne <UNK> larry was convinced owen killed margaret and also that he had to wanted to kill <UNK> <UNK> but there is a happy ending when months later both larry and owen bring out books <UNK> died naturally and they went on a holiday with beth ryan kim <UNK> also starring rob <UNK> as joel and oprah <UNK> with hilarious moments a great director actor and his support this is a must see comedy very very good
<START> when i went to the cinema i expected not much i knew nothing about this movie but it was the only movie i could see 'cause i was in a small town then so i saw this movie and i was fascinated la che non is a trip through the new industrial china and it shows it honestly you see most of the time the ugly places of china and you see what really happens with this new the main characters are sad but hopefully people he's the naive italian guy who can't believe what he <UNK> she's a <UNK> from china who's missing her son sometimes sad sometimes funny but every time poetic a wonderful movie with wonderful actors so only one star is missing
<START> this movie reminded me of the live dramas of the 1950s not like the recent which seemed more of a stunt than anything else but a true moral drama that is both engaging and thought provoking anne <UNK> is more than credible as the army officer having an affair with her superior played by sam shepard and eric <UNK> is wonderful as her lawyer defending her against the military establishment i found myself waiting for their affair to begin if only because they look so good together this movie is apparently based on a true story and it's a relief to be asked to think about real issues for a change br br directed by christopher who also did the passion of <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> and the prime suspect series this is a movie with <UNK> and style and is absolutely worth seeing
<START> i went into this movie with low expectations knowing uwe <UNK> legacy as a film director and screenplay writer and i was still disappointed uwe boll finds a way to make each and every movie he is involved in worse and worse the overall concept wasn't a bad one a man bored with his life as a stock <UNK> becomes a serial killer but the problem with the movie is there is no in between he goes straight from stock <UNK> to serial killer the film has no name actors and i can see why after watching the movie i can't see why any actor with a career would want to even be involved in this movie anyone who turned it down did their careers a favor and if you haven't seen it do yourself a favor and don't br br i give a 3 out of 10
<START> the game was made in 1996 but it is still good today the graphics is not that hot and the actors are not oscar worthy but the plot is twisted <UNK> and highly enjoyable the dark story is compelling from the first film and is continuing throughout all the play we played several people together for several reasons 1 to use all our minds together 2 not to be so afraid br br play this game and you won't regret this just don't try to find a <UNK> engine in there
<START> i've been strangely attracted to this film since i saw it on showtime sometime in the early 80's i say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft core fluff a genre i'm not particularly interested in the dialogue is and philosophical making sense no doubt only to it's franco italian producers and the plot completely <UNK> what it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood the scenery the beautiful <UNK> soft focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today it is truly one of my great guilty pleasures i was fortunate enough to find it on an old <UNK> and have watched it more times than i think is healthy a worthwhile
<START> it hurt to watch this movie it really did i wanted to like it even going in shot obviously for very little cash i looked past and told myself to appreciate the inspiration unfortunately although i did appreciate the film on that level the acting and editing was terrible and the last 25 30 minutes were severe thumb <UNK> territory a 95 minute film should not drag the ratings for this one are good so far but i fear that the friends and family might have had a say in that one what was with those transitions dear mr editor did you just purchase your first copy of <UNK> premiere and make it your main goal to use all the goofy transitions that come with that silly program anyway some better actors a little more passion and some more appealing editing and this makes a decent movie
<START> this was a very faithful presentation of <UNK> life in the mid 50's the dialogue on <UNK> and the banter with his follow colleagues was exceptionally good michael <UNK> book c s lewis creator of <UNK> deals with this time frame in a very parallel way <UNK> <UNK> acting was superb in catching the <UNK> lewis the movie took great pains to be presented in an accurate english setting the development of a strong bond between jack his preferred name lewis and douglas son from her previous marriage was enjoyable to watch the movie did avoid the <UNK> element of <UNK> jack's older brother drinking problem but it would not have moved the story on so it is best left out
<START> i was half <UNK> as i watched a late night selection of short films but sat <UNK> <UNK> from the first frames of i shout love and could not take my eyes away for its full brief perfect length with incredibly assured pacing and performances this film maintains its funny sad insightful tone throughout the credits at the end went by so quickly and in such small type i had to go online to find out the person responsible for this master work what a pleasing surprise to see the name of sarah a major actress who is too seldom seen br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and matthew <UNK> bobby turn in rich touching performances as a couple in the <UNK> of breaking up as they work through a <UNK> of favorite moments from their time together both actors reveal <UNK> of their characters and their relationship in ways that bring nothing but honor to their talents and to the director writer's skills the film creates a moving narrative with laugh out loud moments and caught breath sorrow br br i shout love is <UNK> one of the greatest and most memorable short films i ever expect to see it has wit heart and stunning originality it matters
<START> i will give it a second chance but was very disappointed in the first one it wouldn't hold a candle to the other series it has a lot of meaningless dialog that doesn't add to the storyline at all i agree with the others that it doesn't seem to develop a story that is interesting it is slow and plodding and i only know what the are planning to do maybe it will all tie together in the second installment but i am going to have to force myself to watch it and find out i am of <UNK> <UNK> from the texas new mexico area but i don't recognize much of what is happening maybe i am just ignorant of the facts but this isn't doing much to <UNK> me
<START> a very very very slow moving <UNK> movie about a <UNK> <UNK> young man not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out br br attempting <UNK> with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non existent very little music or anything to speak of the best scene in the movie was when is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head he goes to a used record store to buy it for his lover and has to sing the song for two sales <UNK> before they find the album cute scene gave promise but it went downhill from there the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if it's about <UNK> it works i guess because it's empty wasted two hours
<START> gentle and <UNK> film seems to have been overlooked as a <UNK> and to be fair the narrative is a bit <UNK> and lightweight as drama but i feel the simple wonder and joy of the scenes depicting the first impact of a new art on an alien and <UNK> society have a <UNK> and <UNK> which capture the century long romance between cinema and audience better than any film in years immensely sympathetic performance from jared who seems to have inherited all of his fathers charisma hopefully without poor richards <UNK> for and and charming offbeat <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> combine to make this a real <UNK> location photography including beautiful scenes at the great wall and sensitive direction by ann <UNK> give film added impact in short a must for anyone ever enchanted by a shadow <UNK> to life and making magic in the dark
<START> while <UNK> miyazaki's movies have always been hit or miss with me with regards to story they are <UNK> gorgeous to the eye with characters of simple animation against a backdrop of artistic images sticks to that formula with a lead character so adorable i want a <UNK> doll of her and scenery so pretty it wouldn't look out of place framed up as a picture on a wall br br the story on the other hand i didn't enjoy quite as much as his last two wide releases spirited away and <UNK> moving castle it was just a tad too juvenile coming across as more for kids and leaving adults to just enjoy the animation br br i was also disappointed that the score done by joe <UNK> who also the scores for the above mentioned two movies wasn't nearly as memorable this time around while i can't quite recall <UNK> score now i still remember it being one of the most beautiful i had ever heard <UNK> though i only remember it being very <UNK> to the movie maybe it's because is more juvenile fare that the score isn't quite as haunting in any case this movie is still a must watch for fans of anime or miyazaki
<START> i saw the world premiere at the toronto international film fest this is a great film br br real life husband and wife paul <UNK> and jennifer <UNK> star as charles and emma <UNK> in the midst of their struggle through the writing of and decision to <UNK> origin of species their consideration of the <UNK> it may have for their family and the future of <UNK> are conveyed in such a manner that one suspects only an off screen couple could achieve br br jon who gave a heart felt introduction and john do and excellent job of bringing biography to life they created some very poignant and human moments great cinematography and sets and a generous helping of tongue in cheek about the still <UNK> theory of evolution br br the surprise star is martha west who plays annie <UNK> the character around whom much of the story <UNK> she plays the <UNK> young girl to a <UNK> if this performance is anything to go by her star should be on the rise br br all in all a great film and although it is a period drama the issues that drive it are still very much alive today
<START> without a doubt the worst movie i have ever seen in my life there was nothing entertaining about this film i know it was supposed to be a comedy but it actually made me cry at the thought of losing the 4 75 admission price
<START> just watched it on the hallmark channel i was surprised to john denver this movie was full of clichés but that is to be expected a made for tv christmas movie come on the acting is as good as any other <UNK> made for tv movie the story is as i said before predictable and cliché but still good if you are looking for a campy christmas movie it will certainly scratch your <UNK> br br i was also pleased when i learned that it took place in <UNK> <UNK> it is a real mountain town west of denver very cool as this is my home region br br i was never a big john denver fan i always found him to be pretty but he was a decent actor he is very good as the good old boy like he played in this film br br if you get the chance to watch it than do i'm sure it will be on again in 2007
<START> it could be easy to complain about the quality of this movie you don't have to throw of money at a movie to make it good nor will it guarantee that it is worth watching but i think that is totally missing the point if your expecting fast cars t a or a movie that will spell itself out for you then don't watch this you'll be disappointed and <UNK> br br this movie was thoroughly enjoyable kept us on the edge of our seats and made us really think the writer obviously put a lot of thought and research behind this movie and it shows through the end just remember to keep an open mind br br note the school scenes were all filmed at <UNK> university and most of the rest was done in toronto
<START> <UNK> <UNK> not quite a household name yet is a winner of the <UNK> prize for literature her novel <UNK> a film that won second prize at cannes and top <UNK> for the male and female leads am i a dinosaur in matters of aesthetic appreciation or has art become so <UNK> that anything goes br br <UNK> <UNK> is the <UNK> <UNK> representation in britain of the <UNK> noise made by a turkey in the film world a turkey is a monumental flop as <UNK> by box office <UNK> or critical reception <UNK> <UNK> and the piano teacher are perfect partners br br the embarrassing awfulness of this widely praised film cannot be <UNK> it begins very badly as if made to annoy the viewer credits <UNK> <UNK> scenes for more than 11 minutes we are introduced to professor erika <UNK> apparently the alter ego of the <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> professor of piano she lives with her <UNK> and <UNK> mum dad is an <UNK> madman who dies unseen during what passes for the action br br reviewing the piano teacher is difficult beyond <UNK> its <UNK> what we see in the film and might read in the book for all i know is a <UNK> exploitative nonsensical tale of an emotional <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> without moving on br br erika whose name is <UNK> used is initially shown as a person with intense musical sensitivity but otherwise totally repressed not quite because there's a <UNK> at two <UNK> scene with her <UNK> voiced <UNK> early on that ends with <UNK> apologies if a reviewer has to yawn <UNK> a <UNK> why not use a pretentious word when a simpler one would do <UNK> violently <UNK> <UNK> would be it br br a young hunk walter studying to become a <UNK> <UNK> engineer whatever that is and playing ice hockey in his few <UNK> moments is also a talented <UNK> he encounters <UNK> at an old fashioned <UNK> in a luxury apartment in what may or may not be paris in the <UNK> fashion of so much art he immediately falls in love and starts to <UNK> la <UNK> br br repressed erika has a liking for hardcore pornography shown briefly but <UNK> for a few seconds while she <UNK> a <UNK> taken from the waste basket in the private booth where she watches br br walter performs a brilliant audition and is <UNK> accepted as a private student by erika whose teaching style is <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> br br he soon declares his love and before long <UNK> erika into the ladies where they engage in mild <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> sex erika <UNK> control over her <UNK> <UNK> she promises to send him a letter of <UNK> for further <UNK> <UNK> br br in the meantime <UNK> jealous because of <UNK> kindness to a nervous student who is literally having the <UNK> before a rehearsal for some future concert erika fills the <UNK> coat pocket with broken glass causing severe <UNK> to those delicate piano playing hands br br the next big scene by passing the <UNK> self <UNK> etc has walter turning up at the apartment erika shares with her mother erika want to be <UNK> bound slapped etc sensible walter is for the moment <UNK> and <UNK> off into the night br br at this point there's still nearly an hour to go the viewer can only fear the worst erika tracks down walter to the <UNK> <UNK> where he does his ice hockey practice they <UNK> to a back room <UNK> <UNK> is unable to resist the hands <UNK> at his <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> is soon <UNK> with other stomach <UNK> ho hum br br <UNK> but hooked perhaps <UNK> of revenge for the insult so recently <UNK> on the floor walter returns to <UNK> apartment can you guess what happens now it's not very deep or difficult yes he becomes a <UNK> while erika becomes a victim one moment he's <UNK> <UNK> in her room and <UNK> erika the next he's kicking her in the face having sex with her and <UNK> his <UNK> of love br br am i being unfair in this summary watch the film if you want but i'd advise you not to br br anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if they're in the right mood i could <UNK> at the challenging depiction of human relationships conveyed by this film if i wanted but i <UNK> not <UNK> because this is a cheap and nasty film that appeals to base instincts and says nothing br br i'm supposed to say that <UNK> repressed erika <UNK> for love <UNK> seeks it in pornography <UNK> rejects it when it literally appears pink and <UNK> under her nose <UNK> realises that she doesn't like being hurt blah blah blah br br the world has for reasons not explained <UNK> her she apparently makes a monster out of someone who appeared <UNK> loving but surely we all know that any man is potentially a violent rapist because that's his essential nature however much he tries to tell himself and the world otherwise br br at the end if you have the patience to be there there's a small twist before going to the final scene where she's due to perform as a substitute for the underwear <UNK> student with the <UNK> hands erika packs a knife in her <UNK> for walter br br yes you're ahead of me she stabs herself in a none life threatening area and leaves roll credits br br if this earned the second prize at cannes just how bad were the rest of the entries
<START> its hard to decide where to begin i bought this for a few <UNK> and its the worst few <UNK> iv ever wasted the back of the dvd had no pictures and a few lines plot summary this should have warned me but i usually like bad movies for a laugh so decided to give it a go the movie is made up of three short stories each revolving around someone who was on a particular bus at one point its never made clear what the significance of the bus is or what city its set in br br possible spoilers as if there is anything to be spoiled the first story is about a man who is <UNK> by a car to it against his wife's wishes the car is sort of like a demonic and takes over his life br br the second is about a <UNK> of a man who never <UNK> his <UNK> and a monster <UNK> man grows out of it br br the third about a woman who goes to a dating agency only to discover her date <UNK> all that normal br br <UNK> these we are treated to shots of the bus or a bus anyway while a narrator on a load of garbage about relationships really its like he is on <UNK> for saying br br the movie actually has no redeeming features whatsoever the acting the costumes and the little are all disgusting there <UNK> even any attractive female cast members to admire simply put this movie is a <UNK>
<START> <UNK> la <UNK> was one of those shows that i didn't have high if any expectations for before seeing it and i never even knew about it until i saw my friend watching it i had thought jackass was pretty funny but the stunts were just that funny and i never really got into the show when i watched <UNK> la <UNK> for the first time it was the complete opposite effect i loved it it had more of a tv show feel to it which a lot of the reality shows have today i was hooked and i wanted to see what new scheme they were going to cook up for each episode all the way to the last episode it held my interest and even though some of the ideas seemed <UNK> at times it always had a newer and funnier twist to it <UNK> la <UNK> is one of those shows that get you hooked and i have yet to see another show that is quite like it
<START> de un combines the worst <UNK> of mexican cinema a rare feat nowadays br br it's pretentious it wants us to believe that it is deep only because some scene is out of focus another is pseudo surreal yet another plays with the <UNK> tradition of laughing crying faces the edition is <UNK> and it is all so <UNK> br br it has a weak script the main story hardly develops so it has other three smaller needless stories stuck into it they are only good to make the film last longer br br most of the acting is bad a true feat <UNK> in mind that many of the best known mexican actors were cast br br there is an abuse of foul language to the point that the character of who <UNK> the dreams of freedom of a child uses it <UNK> br br it is <UNK> the character played by <UNK> is the <UNK> and most <UNK> representation of a <UNK> i have ever seen br br it is very boring i ended up <UNK> the people that left the theater before the end of the film br br whatever it tries it has been done better in mexico and elsewhere br br in other words <UNK> la <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this is a little film with a big heart excellent acting throughout and directed with love if you missed it in theatres and who didn't catch it with someone you love frankly i cried and i'm a guy for out loud
<START> this film is a masterpiece to put it simply especially the double exposure made by the cameraman <UNK> it is <UNK> made even with the standards we are used to today <UNK> eight years later <UNK> the director also plays the main character david <UNK> on the night of new years eve he is killed in a fight and the legend says that the first one who dies on the new year will have to work as a soul collector in the form of a transparent ghost there is a new soul collector to be <UNK> every year br br the scene in which the alcoholic david <UNK> rises up from his dead body like the soul is leaving his <UNK> body in the where the fight took place is a real award for a eye also when the present soul collector arrives with his horse and <UNK> is a beautiful but also a scary scene david <UNK> <UNK> this soul collector as a from earlier life it is now his turn to take over just like scrooge in dickens story a christmas tale david is shown what his life and <UNK> has led to for the people around him br br the film is about the danger of <UNK> drugs in this case alcohol it is based upon a book by <UNK> prize winner <UNK> <UNK> filmed a few more of her books but this is the one with the best outcome maybe because this book is the most <UNK> of them br br
<START> i love the other reviews of this movie they mirror my attitude i am a 70's sort of guy minus disco and star wars <UNK> there was nothing great about this movie except for a chase scene that is why it was good because it was tough basic and <UNK> roy <UNK> carried the movie which was based on the crew the 7 ups that backed up gene hackman in the french connection the people in it were believable and average who burned themselves <UNK> coffee showed fear in chase scene and almost lost it after a close call crash br br maybe it would be easier to tell you what it lacked there was no fancy weapons just basic <UNK> and crude <UNK> off <UNK> there was no tough guy <UNK> ala tarantino there was no kung fu or samurai nonsense and no fancy trick shooting either there was no clever guy who carries out some complicated scheme based on hundreds of things going just the way he planned including everyone else's reactions the criminals were bad guys but they didn't shoot people for the hell of it as a matter of fact there was a body count of just three something that the average movie these days would pass in the opening credits it could be a g movie today no bus load of orphan school children were kidnapped nor were terrorists threatening to kill half of the city there were no high tech <UNK> nor were the crimes themselves very moving or ingenious the highest tech thing i saw was a touch tone wall phone it had no subplots or amusing character developments also no sex or women except for one <UNK> wife who did some screaming as the buddy our hero had her <UNK> br br it was some little undertaker who exploited his connections with the local mob and the police to kidnap local <UNK> for some easy <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> was played by tony lo <UNK> who did a great job as good as roy schneider buddy the head of 7 ups cop whom he informed and exploited what ever happened to tony lo <UNK> he seemed like a pacino shoe in good looking and talented what it did have was a great nyc backdrop to a simple crime story locations that were bleak and <UNK> without being a <UNK> study it had a simple plot that involved this kidnapping scheme where one of <UNK> cop got accidentally involved literally accidentally dragged in then accidentally shot dead since buddy and his 7 ups are a hot dogs unit both the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> thought he was involved since the <UNK> <UNK> as plain clothes cops to lure the <UNK> into <UNK> obviously the <UNK> figured they had lawyers and rights to protect them from normal police even the <UNK> were plain old and ugly no godfather <UNK> or soprano <UNK> here br br it is a good basic movie with a standout chase scene between two 70's d even the cars were plain and <UNK> not even a <UNK> or a <UNK> am like the acting and the story in the days of batman uber hype or 24 levels of intensity <UNK> scenarios this movie reminds us that less is better it should be shown to movie screen writers and directors as a <UNK> not to <UNK> <UNK> then ultimately insult us with stunts <UNK> and clown psychotic behavior <UNK>
<START> a recent <UNK> of children in the uk re <UNK> the notion put forth by this film 27 years ago that being more than anything else young people want to grow up to be somebody famous it used to be doctors and <UNK> that kids wanted to be now everyone wants to be famous fame is a story of a group of kids accepted into the high school for performing arts in new york city we seen them first audition then take classes and learn about life for the next four years the film has a lot of fine qualities but ultimately leaves you feeling a little <UNK> br br alan <UNK> bold directorial style fits the story pretty well the film has been classified as a musical but more than anything it is a drama musical numbers and dance routines break out here and there and parker keeps them as close to realistic as they really could have been filmed the acting is for the most part top <UNK> with a few exceptions the pacing is a little off particularly toward the end of the film but by that point the story has already taken a few wrong turns anyway br br first off the <UNK> at the beginning of the film should have a couple of the principle characters out it seems unlikely that anyone would show up and audition for one department then stumble their way through to another some of these people just don't look that talented or interested to begin with once the first year of classes gets going the film <UNK> into a nice groove the interaction between students and teachers is very well handled and it leaves you wanting more the film begins to lose itself later on as we see more and more of the <UNK> lives out of school some of these people just aren't worth caring about br br the film's biggest mistake is making the ralph character so prominent this guy is a <UNK> self centered jerk a professional a hole as he proudly declares on stage during his comedy routines the audience is supposed to somehow feel for this guy and his tragic personal situation but i was just hoping they'd throw his butt out of school irene <UNK> maureen paul and the late gene anthony ray are the people you'll care about by the time this film is over try as i might i still can't develop <UNK> like gene anthony ray had in this film br br overall this film is good it is memorable interesting and full of daring scenes and performances it runs maybe a little too long and perhaps some of the wrong characters get fully developed while others kind of <UNK> in the background the musical numbers are great and there is even a surprise or two waiting to be discovered by the time the film is over though not perfect fame will be a film that lives on in one way or another for many years to come br br 7 of 10 stars br br the <UNK>
<START> this film is a disaster from beginning to end 75 percent of the movie is made from scenes taken from <UNK> the haunted world and <UNK> the captive women badly edited together with original scenes that do not add up to anything but a complete rip off i'm a big fan of those two movies and seeing scenes taken from them re edited and re dubbed with nonsensical dialogue made my head spin these kind of cheap producers tactics to make more money by <UNK> unsuspecting audiences basically killed the sword <UNK> genre back in the 1960s br br there is one memorable scene in the new footage and it's the one when <UNK> fights with the bad <UNK> the fight is albeit cool and <UNK> who plays definitely stands out he makes a memorable nemesis to but the rest is borderline embarrassing that was probably shot in a day br br avoid at all cost
<START> spoiler alert br br i don't go into <UNK> movies expecting them to be 100 accurate on all things computer related but somehow even the average 'i have a user is supposed to believe that br br 1 a computer professional with a top secret special data br br 2 is going to keep the primary copy of said data on a 1 <UNK> <UNK> br br 3 and make absolutely no <UNK> of this special secret data br br even high school students back up their <UNK> for goodness sake br br also this is the worst of a computer nerd ever even though she is super cute we are supposed to believe that she has no friends neighbors extended family or <UNK> who can identify her even the had a family that could turn him in br br end spoiler br br these aren't just minor mistakes that had no bearing on the movie these are the major plot points that <UNK> the storyline the characterization was awful the plot wholly and if you haven't seen this don't bother
<START> it was good to see john denver again though he passed several years ago i found this film to be very heartwarming and a great film to sit by the fire on a cold winters night <UNK> what christmas is all about the scenes of <UNK> <UNK> were magnificent and make one want to move there immediately as i sit here in my own mountain seen in so california i loved the story and the plot i hope all who see this somewhat older film enjoy it as much as my mother and i did merry christmas a great film for all the family too see <UNK> and tell others about it thanks for the memories we need to have more films like this come out of hollywood
<START> wow so my boyfriend and i went to the movie store to rent a film i like dumb horror movies so i <UNK> the variety of terrible films they had to offer while he went off in search of michael moore's so then i found the worst of all of them as i would soon find out it looked good on the cover and the description on the back seemed decent enough the fact that there was an imdb quote on it as a review was proof that it would be bad in a good way so the next night we put it in the dvd player and from the first five minutes we were so incredibly confused br br the movie is utterly incoherent with badly placed time jumps from past to future that leave you asking a major ' the plot has no sort of coherent story other than the vague <UNK> to a local myth about a murder but this only actually comes into play in the movie in the last twenty minutes of it so pretty much for the first hour you have this random confusing time jumps incoherent plot parents who don't age bad acting bad dialogue a boy who magically changes hair colour and a host of obnoxious characters for you to get bored with br br the movie moves so slow that it's a chore to actually sit there and watch i'd rather be <UNK> the <UNK> honestly don't bother with it
<START> this film is all about humans this film stayed as my all time favorite short cartoon for years br br isn't it the <UNK> things that make life so much more interesting we humans are so soft compassionate funny caring to each other one moment we <UNK> the most beautiful and amazing machines to kill as many people as possible with the least effort the next in our short lives we destroy our world each other and often our own lives than spend the rest of our lives trying to fix what we've destroyed sometimes there is nothing left to fix br br this film can entertain <UNK> and even help us realize what is wrong in our lives life is short and can be even shorter the ending is way too optimistic i am afraid br br i love richard mind and what he makes happen with it br br enjoy br br h k
<START> if you are home on a weekend very bored and lack the will to move with absolutely nothing better to do with your life for the next couple of hours you could enjoy making fun of this movie the acting and script and general movie making of this film isn't actually all that bad which is why it makes it possible to actually sit through this this is a movie they would show in high school health class to teach the dangers of pre marital sex or they could also show it to teach the dangers of very lame music that band brian austin green is in is really terrible i think thats a much greater threat to society than <UNK> parents
<START> why did i vote 10 10 for this movie that is just completely off guts quite simply because if you just let yourself find it funny you can just laugh until you choke some people might find that it goes too far it is certainly not for everyone but whenever i'm down and just need something really really stupid to laugh at chuck on bottom or and i can forget all of my troubles and be transported into a magical dark and weird world br br completely off guts is an australian expression it has no literal translation
<START> this is the fifth part of 'the <UNK> a collection of animated short movies that tell us a little more about the world of 'the <UNK> this time they introduce <UNK> carrie anne moss in a story about a detective who is hired to find her with great black and white animation and an interesting story this is again a great animated short from 'the <UNK>
<START> <UNK> sums it all up for me really boring story bland dialogue dull action scenes how do you make something like a fight or a shootout boring do you actually have to try to do that no real characters etc just dull snipes is a gifted actor and physical performer but none of this has come to the surface in any of his <UNK> work when the opportunity is there to give the audience a much more superior product than they are used to imagine a decent script with a few solid characters that you care about and some damn explosive action fights <UNK> etc how can it be that hard to handle my personal opinion is that the primary players in the productions simply do not care there is no evidence of enthusiasm for what they are doing look at snipes in the first 2 <UNK> passenger <UNK> rising sun new jack city <UNK> man etc awesome intense performances <UNK> by decent if not always outstanding scripts good supporting casts and wicked action br br none of that is evident in any of these releases so far which is a tremendous shame the <UNK> slap face on the cover knowing the audience will lap them up as they haven't realised yet that they haven't seen him in theatres for nearly 2 years br br i'd love to see snipes work with somebody like <UNK> <UNK> who really knows how to make the most out of a <UNK> production and work with <UNK> stunts who are simply some of the best action guys out there together they would all make an awesome team and a snipes action vehicle we would all be proud of seeing br br <UNK> sucks it's not as bad as the <UNK> which <UNK> but it still really sucks
<START> i am shocked to see that this movie has been given more than two stars by some people they must either be kidding or be totally blind for the art of acting directing and other flaws of the movie br br i must admit that i just could not force myself to sit through the whole movie it was just too bad br br the three first characters not including the <UNK> were just awful actors and i mean awful maybe the director didn't care or may be he is a worse director it was like watching a bad school play the movie was of course filmed with a video camera <UNK> not real film and the light settings were not very good either in addition the sound man if they had one must either have been a <UNK> or a drunk as the sound were amateurish even in one of the first scenes from the kitchen awful acting btw the sound from the dialog was pretty bad for example when the woman moved her head while speaking you could hear her voice disappear and come back it sounded like they had tried to correct that in post production by turning up the volume a bit when she turns her head in addition you had the ongoing irritating <UNK> sound from either camera equipment or other sources in the kitchen br br all these in the first 5 minutes or so need i say more br br a good school project or fun project for friends to watch but should never have been released for a real audience especially not for a paying audience this was a rip off unless you have a very low standard regarding movies or just bad taste you are warned <UNK>
<START> although dated this film is definitely worth a watch i saw it about eight times as a teenager when it opened and it changed my life i just had to live in new york it has great opening shots of the manhattan <UNK> with johnny <UNK> <UNK> romance is still the best of everything that rival those of west side story there is a rather stilted performance by the world's real first <UNK> <UNK> parker sorry about that <UNK> d but it's great eye candy it also offers a bit of insight into late 1950's american <UNK> our obsession with and <UNK> of sex in the <UNK> no less romance and marriage before women's <UNK> it represents an era in which new york was at it's finest and a super bitchy performance by joan crawford is just the <UNK> on the cake
<START> i remember this film <UNK> from seeing it in the theatre i recently found a copy on vhs it held up to my memory of it while obviously not a big budget film the acting is quite credible the scenery locales costumes are very well done i only wish the <UNK> had been in more of the picture but when you see them they are also well done remember <UNK> was done in those days without benefit of computers some poor devil had to actually put all that hair fake <UNK> on real elephants the same effect was used on the elephants in quest for fire a better than average adventure film a chance for the star rod cameron to play something besides a cowboy which he also did very well over the years
<START> a nicely <UNK> 1930s setting provides much interest for a viewer in the early 21st century unfortunately london belongs to me has little else to recommend it besides <UNK> of quaint english charm all of the problems rest with the deeply <UNK> story the main plot concerns the actions of young <UNK> richard attenborough the problems he gets into and how the community in which he lives bands together to save him from <UNK> laws or something the main issue here is that <UNK> character brings everything upon himself and quite frankly is guilty of almost every <UNK> brought against him so it's <UNK> why the film and all the characters have so much sympathy for him he's treated as a victim of <UNK> when he really really isn't and what's more he isn't shown to have very much <UNK> for his actions only caring about getting away with things he didn't mean to do <UNK> <UNK> gets a lot of screen time in a subplot that has absolutely nothing to do with the main plot line and you wonder what he's doing there though <UNK> is as always superb you know there's a problem with the structure when the main plot <UNK> constantly against the subplot but not vice versa and following a <UNK> pace and a careful build up the plot completely falls apart in the last 20 minutes with a deeply unsatisfying and unexplained conclusion which doesn't even show us if <UNK> character has developed at all from the previous proceedings the film doesn't end it just stops br br the acting direction and the general feel of the film can all be <UNK> but unfortunately the story and structure of the piece <UNK> constantly a last point of trivia alec guinness based his performance in the vastly superior film the <UNK> on <UNK> performance in this film right down to both the characters having almost identical first scenes
<START> this movie is really an entertaining good clean fun movie for the <UNK> <UNK> played by talented amanda is the sidekick to a <UNK> boy who has a hard time telling the truth he eventually works this into a movie script that gets stolen i won't bore you with the details if you have children and want to see an entertaining if not thrilling kids movie i highly recommend this one
<START> the story of the bride fair is an amusing and engaging one and it is to the <UNK> credit that he sets out to portray rural with the same respect <UNK> reserved for coast <UNK> it is weird though to find an independent movie the <UNK> of a single person that is as and cliché ridden as a <UNK> hollywood <UNK> br br the portrait of rural people is intended to be <UNK> i think but these characters don't ring true to me i have had quite a few <UNK> in small town <UNK> but never <UNK> a debate on the merits of different <UNK> century english <UNK> one might suggest that writer director has no more experience with rural culture than the <UNK> brothers and considerably less <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i remember when <UNK> had it's <UNK> in the 70s i <UNK> my parents for money to by a second hand <UNK> from a friend it was a piece of junk complete with clay <UNK> and everything i also remember reading <UNK> magazine and being both completely impressed and totally terrified of the <UNK> crew <UNK> never became a way of life for me but in some ways it has always been a part of my life whether it is using a board for <UNK> or just having a bunch of friends that <UNK> br br this film is a brilliant documentary of the real birth of modern day <UNK> watching this crew turn <UNK> from the flat boring <UNK> it was into the <UNK> lifestyle it has become had me sitting slack <UNK> for 90 minutes br br it's amazing that enough footage from this period still exists to have created this film and thank god for that the footage is brilliant it gave me the feeling of watching an old buster keaton film i've seen some of the tricks keaton did repeated countless times in other films since then but when you go back and see the first person to perform that trick it's amazing that not only were they the first person to try it successfully but that they lived through it and made it seem <UNK> that's the feeling this film gave me yeah i've seen people <UNK> <UNK> before but to watch the first people <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the tricks that eventually became the <UNK> of modern <UNK> is like watching the <UNK> of the house fall on keaton leaving him standing safely in the frame of a window it's absolutely brilliant to watch something that up until that point had never been tried before but since has been tried by almost everyone br br this film is beautiful to watch and incredible to listen to the soundtrack is one of the best i've ever heard in a film this is a film that will appeal to people whether they like <UNK> or not i've talked to a couple of friends of mine who made their girlfriends sit through this film after heavy protest and they all said that their girlfriends were <UNK> by the end of the film and loved it as much as they did br br as for the previous comments on this board that complain about the film being too self <UNK> i think that's an unfair <UNK> i liked seeing these guys get excited about their past they created something that influenced their sport and changed it forever they have the right to pat themselves on the back they were stars for doing what they loved to do most of these guys girls never achieved the <UNK> success tony <UNK> enjoys today but that kind of success wasn't available to <UNK> then sure they had some success but more importantly they have been able to live a life doing what they love to do and as we see in the end almost all of them still surf <UNK> or work in the surf <UNK> industry how many of us can say that we have been able to live our lives and have been successful by breaking all the rules and doing what we love to do they can my <UNK> off to the <UNK> and z boys for being themselves and changing the world of <UNK> forever
<START> this documentary is the most <UNK> film i have seen in a long while i must have had it on for an entire day the selected material included in the piece flow amazingly well and develop three characters that are impossible to ever forget the different layers of these people <UNK> back to make an oddly moving film about <UNK> loyalty and determination these characters ended up <UNK> fascinating and the film is unforgettable
<START> two popular actors are paired in showtime like de niro and murphy playing a police and an actor although they share the most screen time together they do not reach their expected performances such films like <UNK> this meet the parents dr <UNK> and nutty professor the film starts interestingly but becomes a thin ordinary comedy which is quite disappointing it feels like especially de niro doesn't enjoy being in showtime thats a shame because he really shows his feelings thats what i think unfortunately if the idea had been used cleverly this could have been a more interesting piece of work and could be followed with a sequel like any other popular hollywood movie well i don't think there would be a sequel to this at least casting de niro and <UNK> again out of
<START> i first saw this movie at a saturday <UNK> when i was very young i thought it was cool and often thought about it well i finally it on dvd it was still very entertaining but in a different way it has to rank as one of the <UNK> <UNK> 1950's sci fi movies it seemed filled with stock military footage the dialogue is stilted and effects are crude there is one line of dialogue that had me in <UNK> the line jeff <UNK> says while on the beach with the babe rent it if you need a movie to watch with a bunch of drunken friends it is a classic
<START> this movie was a disappointment the story is essentially the shining with a castle or a very cheap set <UNK> as a castle to be specific <UNK> as the hotel and a monster instead of the ghosts the budget is the same you'd see from a <UNK> <UNK> porn as is the photography sets lighting and video it was shot on the story is a failed attempt at sincerity there's no easier way to make your audience feel sympathetic for your characters than to show them experiencing emotional trauma and the trauma in this movie is pretty trite want an example a blind girl listening to a language tape teaching the italian words for colors begins to cry at what she will never see br br this movie had a few things going for it however the monster is actually pretty cool pretty scary looking and there is a pretty decent amount of nudity from herself a star of italian erotic films the gore however leaves much to be desired as does the acting even from the experienced jeffrey combs br br other than this i've only seen two other stuart gordon films re animator and from beyond both of which were outstanding but i won't let this little <UNK> in his career keep me from watching many more of his movies
<START> this film was okay but like most tv series it would of been better if it just made for television the best and most loved characters only had five minute roles whilst the three mediocre characters were all the way through the film br br unlike most british movies that are based on television series this film does kick off and it seems to be on to a winner but the pace suddenly stops when the three mediocre characters are in the real world waiting to capture the three comedians br br the film then doesn't go anywhere when <UNK> in a room with the captured steve <UNK> as steve and <UNK> somehow writing himself in to the medieval times which made me think <UNK> on how come he doesn't need a key to enter in to that world unlike the <UNK> <UNK> characters the medieval scene was okay but monty python did it a lot better and of course funnier with cameos from peter kay and simon pegg both didn't say anything funny kay had a line and pegg just sat up on wall looking bored br br what also <UNK> me was that they seem to forget what happened in the previous episodes such as <UNK> escaped to the <UNK> in the television in series 2 but in the film he's escaped from prison and also is a <UNK> vampire which wasn't mentioned at all in the movie which was also quite disturbing when he's left alone looking after the children br br there were lots of plot holes and unexplained situations such as how did <UNK> and the dark one escape from the medieval times back in to <UNK> <UNK> like series 3 it started of good but as the film progressed it slowly went downhill and had a very weak predictable ending br br they would of been better off doing what monty python did and remade all their best and classic sketches from series 1 3 and the christmas special and turned that in to a film which would of re introduced the characters to a whole new audience who can't be asked to watch the series or to tight to buy the dvds br br best advice is save your money and wait till it's on television where it belongs
<START> the brilliant australian comic genius barry <UNK> had a rare failure with this uneven and occasionally <UNK> comedy which was <UNK> back from release after only a few days drunken <UNK> australian <UNK> sir les <UNK> accidentally sets an arab <UNK> on fire at the un and is posted to his tiny country as punishment arriving just as a palace coup puts a new leader american soap star on the throne sir les with the reluctant help of dame <UNK> both played by <UNK> almost accidentally <UNK> a scheme by the new leader to release a deadly disgusting aids like virus on the western world joan rivers has a cameo as the female president of the united states her desk plate reading president rivers extreme bad taste <UNK> with slapstick and usual <UNK> satire in a film which is more enjoyable in it's many funny parts than taken together as a whole dame tv fans may be puzzled by the presence of a different <UNK> sadly one who lacks emily <UNK> wonderful drab comedy magic in the role the film was written by <UNK> his third wife diane and directed by the mad max man himself george miller for die hard <UNK> fans like myself essential all others beware
<START> the <UNK> of the plot has been noted by several <UNK> particularly the immense amount of trouble <UNK> <UNK> would have had to have gone to and the sheer <UNK> of some of the <UNK> he would have had to have made including that <UNK> was going to <UNK> each clue in minutes <UNK> is <UNK> a few seconds later he is giving orders and a few minutes later he is running literally around in charge of <UNK> in real life he would be in shock and as usual in thrillers the assassin doesn't kill the heroes giving as his only lame explanation that they were not on the list of those to be killed as though every other innocent <UNK> he shot was i have always used independence day as the hallmark of a truly awful film us president jet plane and beats off aliens ha ha and this effort runs it close for such an implausible film angels and demons contains a remarkable number of predictable incidents who didn't laugh <UNK> when the assassin went to get his reward in the <UNK> i felt like shouting you are going to be blown up who didn't know that the heroine was going to find a body in the lab who didn't spot the baddie technically also the film was awful the dialogue was more often <UNK> than clear while the races across rome to the next church were accompanied by <UNK> music moreover many scenes looked like mud the one redeeming feature was the shots of rome and what looked like the <UNK> an achievement because i am sure that the <UNK> officials would not have wanted this <UNK> shot in and around st <UNK> and the interiors were convincing rome is a magic place and i enjoyed seeing it <UNK>
<START> i first heard of this film from a friend she loved it and always watched it when she told me about it and said how old it was i immediately decided that i wouldn't like it i was so wrong dirty dancing was such an amazing film i love the music and the dancing i bought the soundtrack and dvd immediately after watching it patrick <UNK> and jennifer grey were brilliant in it they captured the emotions and feelings of the characters so well they were both such good dancers after watching the film i wished i could dance like them and i'm hopefully going to take up ballroom and latin dancing soon i've become a fan of that sort of dancing and am now hooked on all films and programs about it dirty dancing revealed my passion for dancing and music my favorite parts of the film are when baby goes into the <UNK> and sees them dancing and obviously the last scene where baby and johnny dance together in front of everyone i believe that everyone must watch dirty dancing at least once in their lifetime if they don't it's their loss
<START> it wasn't until i looked at the trivia section that i found out that the original producer star of this movie <UNK> power died during its making this no doubt explains why everyone on screen seems to have their minds on other things a <UNK> of which appears in a very early scene involving a battle that can only be described as pathetic you know when you've been painting a wall until you're completely bored well that's the sort of expression the <UNK> have on their face when they're swinging their swords in a highly unconvincing manner br br the plot <UNK> on the king of israel having an affair with the queen of <UNK> and his people not being happy about it you can't really blame them since there's few things more beautiful in the world than those israeli though the israeli women here all seem to look like <UNK> blair modern day israel is also very <UNK> with the majority of <UNK> being born outside the country but would this have been true a couple of thousand years ago where everyone speaks in european and american accents br br after much talking and a dance sequence that has to be seen to be believed and no that's not praise we have a climax where the heavily <UNK> <UNK> have to defend themselves against a egyptian army who can't read a map otherwise they would have known there was a canyon in front of them this is what i don't get even though their <UNK> by the sun the <UNK> spend ten minutes <UNK> towards the <UNK> never ever <UNK> they're <UNK> towards a <UNK> <UNK> isn't this somewhat illogical it's also something of a revealing error since the horses <UNK> and men falling into the canyon are obviously <UNK> figures br br anyway the film ends with killing his <UNK> brother and <UNK> god for his victory but who needs <UNK> sharon or god when you've got an idiotic enemy who can't see a <UNK> in front of him or waves a sword like he paints a wall
<START> the original female convict <UNK> is an all time masterpiece the first sequel <UNK> <UNK> was not quite as good in my opinion though it's still notable for the fact that it took the idea from the original and created something in a completely different style director <UNK> has managed to do the same thing again with this film the story is a bit different here but still he's managed to take what made the previous entries excellent and better than many films of this type and craft something fairly original around it again the action focuses on <UNK> a k a <UNK> and this time she's out of the <UNK> and not too keen on the idea of going back after escaping from pursuing police officers one thing leads to another and <UNK> finds herself getting it together with a prostitute and her retarded brother the prostitute ends up getting <UNK> by the retarded brother while <UNK> is kidnapped and <UNK> up by someone who she made an enemy out of in prison but <UNK> doesn't like spending time behind bars and it's not long before she's back to doing what she does best br br the film gets off to a great start as we see <UNK> hack the arm off a <UNK> intent on taking her back to jail from there however the film slows down a lot and beast stable ends up being more of a drama than the previous two films that's not to say that there isn't still plenty of action <UNK> still spends a lot of time in <UNK> and the film isn't exactly short on general sleaze once again <UNK> her role as the sinister title character and it's another understated almost <UNK> performance her screen presence is great however and she manages to have a menacing presence despite being only small physically the plot structure for this film is similar to the other two in that it all builds into a <UNK> of revenge there are more people who have <UNK> <UNK> in this film than in the previous two so this section takes up a fairly large part of the film there's a few surreal sequences not as many as in the first film and nowhere near as in the second but the film stays in with the rest of the series on that point overall i would say this film is between the first two in terms of quality not as great as the original and slightly better than the second
<START> this is an interesting movie i think it's very humorous although the humor is very black fulci is good and funny acting himself it's a really funny and truly crazy self portrait of an artist i make horror films if i would make love films no one would buy tickets and it's really sexy movie also almost all the time there is some action or tension going on and many sexy girls women maybe it goes to the core of why anyone starts to do movies art in the first place it's a real psychedelic trip maybe best seen a little drunk or some similar state of mind there is some really nasty gore scenes also of course because it's lucio fulci as a matter of fact some of those scenes are quite disgusting anyway it's one of the three best and most complete fulci films i've seen the others are house by the cemetery zombi haven't seen the beyond actually the script is to my opinion quite ingenious you could see this movie as a portrait of an extreme neurotic or a person who suffers from obsessive <UNK> disorder <UNK> words the character has a <UNK> need to confess crimes or bad thoughts especially crimes he hasn't even done and he questions himself all the time what if i have done it what if i want to do it have i done it do i want to do it he <UNK> and <UNK> his thoughts i'm sure fulci has been interested of psychology and maybe even read something of the area in his house by the cemetery movie for example there is a character named this is maybe the most concentrated and personal movie fulci did i also like the simplicity of the photography pictures in this film only thing that <UNK> me a little bit is the <UNK> especially towards women i don't quite understand why is it entertainment is it art is it horror anyways and overall this is really interesting and well made movie definitely recommended classic film at least for fans or anyone interested of this genre for the others it may be too much
<START> my brain was screaming why do you keep watching turn it off and go to bed but couch won out and i watched until the predictable ending i guess when it's bruce campbell i need to give it a chance br br i find it hard to complain about a low budget movie purely because of the low budget time and time again we see low budget movies proving that a good story good writing and good acting are enough to make a good movie ted and bruce got their start on just such a movie but they didn't seem to learn from sam that it takes a bit more than <UNK> it on film to make a movie br br it's sad too because bruce has always been a favorite after the 70's and 80's i just can't believe movies this bad are still being made bruce i'm really disappointed
<START> denver fans the animation is a <UNK> classic one of my favorite too and yes it was broadcast in europe as well including my tiny central european country <UNK> oh how i miss the 80's cartoons honestly they were way better than today's children shows more imaginative creative full of fun with good morals more substance great storyline and excellent character voices computer animated shows of today lack all of these features so all of you who agree and want to bring back all the shows so that the kids of today's generation would see the entertainment that these cartoons brought to us please <UNK> on the side posted <UNK> and sign a <UNK> for a <UNK> of the 80's best cartoons br br http www com 1 we want an 80s child cartoon kids show channel br br denver br br
<START> a few years ago i saw this remake of the sixties classic with the mini <UNK> for the first time and i remember liking it a lot now about two years later it was shown on television and i just wanted to know whether i would still like it as much as when i saw it in the cinema well the answer is yes br br the movie is about a team of robbers that will do one final job in <UNK> italy the plan is flawless and the execution perfect they escape and won't have to work for the rest of their lives but there is one problem they didn't take into account someone within their own ranks doesn't like to split the <UNK> but wants to keep it all for himself even when that means he will have to kill the rest of the crew but all but one survive and they are out for revenge one year later in los angeles this time the surviving team members create a smart and <UNK> plan to steal back the gold and get their revenge on the <UNK> br br the story on itself is of course not very original since this is a remake of the original 1969 movie but it has plenty of <UNK> to offer to make you forget about that this is a typical heist action movie but it certainly is one of the better ones in its kind the action is very nice the landscapes and <UNK> are real eye candy the story is ok and the special effects are stunning even the acting is very good something which you'll not often see in an action movie i must admit that i really liked what i saw and i give this movie a well deserved 7 5 10
<START> other than cop rock and that show where the kid dies from eating a spoiled <UNK> he found under the bed this has consistently been the worst and dumbest show to survive prime time if not for jason lee's <UNK> success in film this show would have never made it out of conception if pitched with a relatively unknown as the lead br br the concept is terrible moron redneck <UNK> spends his <UNK> <UNK> to redeem himself with the white trash of his past is it funny <UNK> but not consistently is it stupid each and every single episode br br i've seen a lot of great shows come then go before their time yet this <UNK> has survived longer than i ever could have imagined the dialog is incredibly unfunny as are the episode themes every episode for someone with an iq over 100 is an absolute struggle and the <UNK> on the cake jason lee's annoying voice <UNK> each episode if it weren't for the <UNK> southern culture and <UNK> of the south this show wouldn't have an audience br br if you're a moron and need a show completely lacking humor yet <UNK> with bad taste bad dialog and <UNK> characters failing at life well then you're probably an actor on this show
<START> the biggest problem with in search of historic jesus is that there is very little search to it at all <UNK> produced these documentary films in the 1970s and just into the '80s which featured interviews with experts and discussion of science and facts to make a case for whatever the title of the film was looking to cash in on br br sadly historic jesus is really little more than a third rate <UNK> of the life of christ unlike more superior in search of <UNK> <UNK> which spends the majority of its running time discussing the possibility that the <UNK> is <UNK> on the earth today and where that might be this film is basically the story of jesus with no effort made to prove or <UNK> his existence the famed <UNK> of is mentioned but little other detective work is given much screen time br br for fans of these quasi documentary films like <UNK> menace and in search of bigfoot etc this movie doesn't offer much
<START> what a joy to watch this family grow up and see the same children acting in this series eight years later anna <UNK> randall is a beautiful young lady working for a <UNK> in town she is in love with his son justin who went away in the army and was injured in war and the <UNK> daughter of <UNK> and sarah cassie is an <UNK> <UNK> so <UNK> honest she often is embarrassing br br on a cold winter day a stranger shows up at the farm he is slow to reveal his identity when they find out he is <UNK> father john thought long ago dead hard questions about the past are difficult to get answered br br glenn close is magnificent as a loving mother who wants only the best for all her family and is constantly wrestling with the forces that tend to separate them sarah talking to <UNK> said it's all so fragile this life anything can happen in the blink of an eye i could have died in that <UNK> think of justin and john probably more ill than we know time moves on the moment passes then it's too late it's a shame don't you think br br life lessons on honesty and forgiveness make this a meaningful <UNK> entertainment
<START> if you like your films to pull your emotions out of you if you like your films with a guy you can root for and relate to if you like your films in black and white you gotta see this film watch it from start to finish because you don't want to miss a beat it is sometimes slow and it makes you wonder when something is going to happen then when the plot begins to unfold you will be on the edge of your seat i know i was my mother told me about this film as our family had some of the same things going on in it as the film does we loved frankie who plays the lead convincingly what ever you think about frank sinatra put that aside in the film he is skinny and he doesn't sing so keep an open mind for the era it was made in it tells a story that is still being told today in homes all across the nation and quite possibly the world please watch if you like older films give this one a try
<START> unless you want to be bored half to death i've never been a fan of gus van <UNK> and as part of what previous posters have described as the new youth generation i was very disappointed and slightly angry at the stereotypical depiction of the characters in the film especially as they were used to string along the film's ridiculous storyline which is pretty much <UNK> to the viewing masses that are social rejects and should be blamed for crimes as a <UNK> myself i watch a lot of <UNK> films and the filming during the <UNK> scenes which is obviously a major part of the plot as the lead protagonist is a <UNK> was awful and bourne identity esquire shaky camera technique was used with slow motion to give a horrible effect this film is just full of ridiculous stereotypes as shown by the soundtrack which just adds to the media myth that all are white <UNK> simply just a really bad film
<START> most of <UNK> films seem like <UNK> to me meant to expand mind and soul the characters are not very believable are <UNK> are <UNK> nevertheless the way <UNK> presents their <UNK> ways through life their complicated interaction with others with the universe with chance or destiny makes me understand faith makes me want to believe in god that at some point it all has a meaning if not to me then certainly to someone br br <UNK> and especially <UNK> comes closer to making me touch feel experience the truth the meaning than perhaps any other of his films the only problem being the paths of the <UNK> explored are a bit too similar to his other films and at some point they become somewhat predictable there is still plenty of joy to be had here it is like a familiar brand of wine you know what to expect and it delivers sometimes with a newly found <UNK> which might come from aging either the wine or yourself
<START> walking with dinosaurs is an amazing documentary educational for both the ignorant of dinosaurs and dinosaur lovers like myself alike i admit i was very young when i saw this on discovery but i was obsessed with it immediately <UNK> the series contains 6 episodes going from the late when dinosaurs were just first <UNK> to the late at the end of reign of the dinosaurs when i first saw this film it was like i really had traveled back in time the <UNK> of the the adventures of and the caring mother version of t rex all <UNK> my family and me it is an amazing film and i believe that bbc managed to do just what they set out to do awesome job
<START> i have to say this is one of the best movie i have seen so far for <UNK> the action was a lot better then the first movie because it had a lot more fight scene and it came to u at a faster pace it was amazing the <UNK> was excellent as well as most of the visual effects br br the story line is something new to <UNK> but it is basically the same as the first movie in the series u see them fight against other ninjas but in the movies 1 2 u see them fighting against machine of mass destruction it is nice to see them fighting something other then ninja and that it was great to see some other power other then <UNK> and how other people from other land across the ocean fight also <UNK> finally killed someone that is more stronger then her she have truly become strong it was a lot better then the <UNK> on the series that i'm watching now when u watch this movie the fast action scene will surely make your heart pound with new and in the movie u know it is good and the music was good as well but i find it to be lacking something but the ending theme song was a plus <UNK> <UNK> i think was a really good song i totally recommend it br br all in all i give this movie a 10 because i just love it if u do decide to watch it enjoy it lol
<START> as a big <UNK> fan i had always been disappointed with hollywood's <UNK> attempts to get into the russian romantic aesthetic case in point <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> i had thought the whole problem was a poor casting decisions but then i saw <UNK> as major and changed my mind when given an intelligent script to work with he suddenly came alive and was as noble sexy and conflicted as you could ever want a neurotic russian officer to be so he was a better as major than he was as but that's because writer <UNK> actually gave <UNK> as the conflicted russian officer the kind of conflicted russian officer lines that are worthy of real literature and that have real meaning and pathos in them for example a of folk music he says you hear a man crying in the dark and if you listen carefully enough you know what he cries for you look surprised lady despite what you may have heard <UNK> and <UNK> aren't the only things the russian cares for there is always time for music br br brilliant
<START> for those unfamiliar with <UNK> this is a very good introduction while deals with the reality behind the <UNK> of many things including medicine this work is surprisingly <UNK> of the way medicine is going today two decades after the movie was made and over a decade after his death beyond that some insights into view of life in general are the movie as well the 20th century may well turn out to be the first and last century of the united states in the history of the world if it turns out that the contribution to the arts by the united states was in the dimension of the <UNK> ' this is a prime example of that art
<START> oh dear this was quite possibly the worst film i have seen in years i mean what more can be done with the old woman inside mans body storyline it was full of cliches <UNK> the nerd coming into his own sequence the <UNK> getting whats coming to him etc im not calling these spoilers because any one could guess what happens the only thing it had going for it was laura <UNK> who gave an average performance and as for the dream boy that was the piece of acting ever even the bad guys were instantly forgettable br br terrible movie
<START> great movie i thought it would never be as good as it was great special effects great story big laughs it didn't take itself seriously which is why i think it worked so well even the acting was surprisingly good overall a very funny and sometimes chilling story
<START> plants in an ancient <UNK> <UNK> structure killing all who come close yes it is weird as the <UNK> do not figure it out until everything starts doing crazy and in a movie like this i just wished it went absurd and had <UNK> bands being attacked by plants wielding <UNK> br br anyway a group of people from america vacation and go into the mountains with a couple of other newly made german friends who know about the place when they get there <UNK> began shouting at them and hide on the structure and when there thats when the plants decide to take them out <UNK> cell phone noises humans and ancient <UNK> dead people br br nothing was really scary about the movie and was not even entertaining not even the weird ending could save this piece of crap i kept looking for something really good to happen but nothing oh well f
<START> this film was great i love the way it mixes dark humor with drama there are times when you think there is no possible way you could laugh at the situation presented and yet you experience a surprising giggle it is wonderfully acted with great performances by <UNK> weaver jeff daniels and <UNK> <UNK> it is well written with a stylish surprising ending i'm not one to say that everyone will like it as much as i did but give it a chance and rent it the dvd has great special features including full length <UNK> by director dan harris and <UNK> <UNK> and one by <UNK> weaver that give you interesting information about the film i hope my comment is helpful and that you enjoy the movie
<START> <UNK> the cat <UNK> upon a ship that <UNK> bird happens to be on with his owner <UNK> oh i don't even have enough words to convey how much i disdain both the <UNK> and <UNK> characters they simply are not funny to me and made this short quite the chore to sit through indeed <UNK> is a great character on his own but there's only so much he can do when confronted by the sheer awfulness of that <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> old witch of a <UNK> this animated short can be found on disc 4 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 1 and features an <UNK> commentary by micheal <UNK> br br my grade d
<START> unfortunately a boring flick and obviously the only way to see it is the butchered <UNK> public <UNK> version which is so <UNK> and dark that at times you have hard time making out where the screen is the leading actors are a <UNK> the man spends most of his screen time trying to appear <UNK> charming and sexy forgetting totally what the film is about and that he is a murder suspect because of some dame who played him for a <UNK> to start with the dame herself merely walks through the flick being <UNK> if she's not busy appearing cute it's a rather badly written stuff never interesting or witty no good camera work no memorable soundtrack no glamorous actresses or atmospheric sets it only <UNK> the surface of the genre and nothing happens if you miss this totally <UNK> flick
<START> what i liked best about this feature length animated film from 1941 is the great feel it gives for the early 1940s it's the songs the clothing <UNK> buildings <UNK> of the day etc you feel like you've stepped back into time br br from reading some of the reviews here i see this was a hard luck film being released a couple of days before the pearl harbor attack wow no one would be interested in going to the movies for a feature length cartoon during those <UNK> and shocking days i'm sure too bad because the folks missed some nice animation would have really impressed back then almost 70 years ago the colors are nice drawings are good and story involving as we root for the bugs led by and and his beautiful girl honey to make it happily ever after and out of <UNK> way it's also about all of them finding a spot they can live and not worry about humans <UNK> them br br there is a nasty villain though c <UNK> beetle and two of his henchmen those <UNK> <UNK> the fly and <UNK> the <UNK> are comedians complete with their brooklyn <UNK> accents the story is a familiar one where a nasty old man wants to marry the sweet young thing and uses <UNK> means to force her hand the good guy meanwhile has the <UNK> <UNK> against him but in the very end of course <UNK> br br my favorite part this will sound worse than what it was was when good guy got <UNK> <UNK> and he <UNK> in black and white that was fantastic animation br br you know it's a good thing i didn't see this as a very little kid i would have been afraid to play outside and <UNK> all those nice bug people you never know what or who is in that grass beneath your feet
<START> in this peculiar movie the themes of the end of days and satan versus jesus are treated in a new fashion jesus doesn't want to open the two last <UNK> and satan is <UNK> in his attempt to get another soul into hell <UNK> <UNK> and turns out to be a company and the book of life is a little hard to open br br what's memorable about this movie are the <UNK> image out of focus shots and light effects which are effective but sometimes irritating and of course <UNK> is great as a <UNK> jesus trying to come to terms with what the world and its people have become so do see it if you get the opportunity
<START> having avoided seeing the movie in the cinema but buying the dvd for my wife for <UNK> i had to watch it i did not expect much which usually means i get more than i <UNK> for but utter utter <UNK> i like <UNK> i like the songs i have the old <UNK> but this film is just terrible the stage show looks like a bit of a musical but this races along with songs <UNK> following one another no characterisation the dance numbers which were heavily choreographed according to the extras on the dvd are just thrown away with only half the bodies ever on screen the dance chorus of north europeans appear on a small greek island at will while the set and set up of numbers would have <UNK> cliff <UNK> musicals in the sixties meryl see me i'm acting streep can't even make her usual <UNK> effective in an over the top musical her grand piece 'the winner takes it <UNK> is meryl at the met note to director it should have been shot in <UNK> with the camera gradually showing distance growing between streep and brosnan some of the singing is awful <UNK> on amateur night the camera cannot stop moving like bad mtv one can never settle down and just enjoy the music enthusiasm and characters but what is even worse is how this <UNK> piece of has become the highest <UNK> film in the uk and the best selling dvd to boot blair campbell and new <UNK> really have reduced the uk to zombies critical <UNK> anyone
<START> this is a good episode but it's not my favorite a lot of people love it and on a creative level it's brilliant most of the episode has no dialog which is such a cool idea and <UNK> handles the silence really well plus this episode introduces tara who i like a lot but i don't like or the or maggie walsh and they seem to get a lot of screen time in <UNK> plus i don't think the gentlemen are that scary and i get tired of watching the <UNK> around <UNK> i know that i'm in the minority but i tend to fast forward parts of <UNK> of course there are other parts of the episode that i think are great so if you're watching on dvd i recommend seeing this episode it really is a classic br br <UNK> revolves around the entire town losing their voices looking demon guys called the gentlemen arrive to gather seven hearts from human victims but if they hear a human scream they die so they steal the voices of everyone in town buffy and the try to figure out what's going on while the also start investigating meanwhile <UNK> comes to realize how much <UNK> means to him and <UNK> meets a fellow witch named tara buffy and finally come face to face while fighting the gentlemen they are both stunned about what they learn he's a <UNK> and she's the <UNK> in the end buffy saves the day but she now has to deal with her new knowledge of secret life br br really the creativity of <UNK> can't be seen in a basic outline of its plot it's the overwhelming silence of the episode that makes it so great the characters try to communicate in different ways white out boards <UNK> obscene finger gestures etc and it all just works really well after a while you forget that there's no dialog because they're all so good at expressing themselves during the talking parts of the episode there are a lot of references to the importance of really hearing each other <UNK> claims that <UNK> won't really talk to her ignores spike and <UNK> and insists that spike move into apartment buffy quickly <UNK> the word <UNK> for <UNK> when she talks to so she won't have to explain her calling and then at the end when buffy and really do learn the truth about each other they sit there with nothing to say it's all pretty cool br br there are a lot of good parts to this episode i love that people keep forgetting that they can't talk buffy and <UNK> both try to use the phone <UNK> can't use the voice recognition thing in the elevator people try to scream it's basically what everyone would really do if they suddenly had no speech and i think it's hilarious that spike has to move in with <UNK> they'll also share an apartment for a little while in season seven <UNK> and spike have a fun <UNK> <UNK> that's just hilarious also i like the beginning of tara and <UNK> relationship tara plays an important role for the rest of the show and she and <UNK> are pretty cute together it's nice to see them just starting out br br on the downside i don't understand how the gentlemen are choosing their victims they just seem to <UNK> around <UNK> and pick random people also i don't like i've never liked him but from <UNK> on i'm pretty much just waiting for angel to come back to town and beat him up finally what happens to olivia after this it seems like we just met her she and have a relationship <UNK> going fine and then she's suddenly dropped i don't get it br br my favorite part of the episode who are the gentlemen lecture to the the whole scene is wonderful and his over heads are just hilarious he makes some similar looking in season first date pretty much anytime starts drawing monsters it's just gonna be fun
<START> despite looking dated and the bird is my opinion an enjoyable and charming cartoon the artwork isn't extraordinary but good enough this cartoon has no dialogs just sounds and music but this combination works out pretty well the cartoon itself is good funny old fashioned creative entertaining and amusing br br this cartoon also makes the difference because it focus in just 3 characters the little black girl the bird a very strange bird and a hungry lion that wants to have both and for breakfast so he chases them both during most of the cartoon br br i actually find that lion very handsome hilarious and cool i really like that lion that poor lion is so silly and loser that you have to feel sorry for him for me the real enemy is the bird not the lion at one point the lion almost eats it too bad he doesn't get to <UNK> it because it deserved to be eaten br br back to this animated short there isn't a single dull or boring moment at least for me the only bit that i find stupid is the ending because the bird has a major fight with the lion steals his teeth and puts them on itself other than that i have nothing major to criticize about this aside the fact that the <UNK> should've definitely have gone for the lion and not the bird br br in my opinion this is a very forgotten and underrated little jewel that should definitely get more credit
<START> this usually all sounds a lot better in my head so forgive me for rambling i'm hardly <UNK> biggest fan and will try not to <UNK> to calling him a which is quite hard i don't like to mock or critique a movie before seeing it so with <UNK> <UNK> i walked to the cinema today to watch br br now to call it a <UNK> off of a rip <UNK> would be unfair here tarantino is happy enough to take the title from <UNK> less than spectacular dirty dozen clone but not it's plot points that he takes from all other genre of movies opens with a nazi officer and his lengthy <UNK> against a farmer who is hiding jews in his basement this is such an anti climax in that it's dialogue is stale and outcome <UNK> a mile off of course one of the hidden jews makes her escape but more of her later we the obviously easily pleased audience are treated to the introduction of lt <UNK> <UNK> ha ha that name almost sounds like b movie king <UNK> ray ha ha quentin keep those coming and this character is played by none other than brad dallas pitt sorry dallas was about the only good thing he's ever starred in and with jaw <UNK> mr jolie treats us to a <UNK> <UNK> southern <UNK> <UNK> nazi killer meanwhile mr tarantino forgets that actual grown ups may be in <UNK> so assumes that the won't have heard of the <UNK> br br raines consists of john <UNK> looking blood <UNK> jewish soldiers all looking to get the big <UNK> on <UNK> hitler tarantino in all his superior knowledge pays special attention to two of these men by casting his long time best buddy and fellow homage <UNK> eli roth as the baseball bat wielding the other man is called hugo and i'll <UNK> more than half the <UNK> fan boys had never heard this name before this movie keep up the good work tarantino you've managed about 6 or 7 so far in the first 15 minutes keep adding them and it may detract from the plot or lack of br br anyhow cutting a long and extremely boring and <UNK> story short both <UNK> and his men the and the sole survivor from chapter one both have separate plots to kill hitler at the showing of a nazi propaganda movie in a french cinema owned by the <UNK> mentioned survivor now grown up br br more boring and pointless conversations follow two and <UNK> as pitt <UNK> away at an audience past caring and any genuine suspense leading to the assassination of the most deadly <UNK> of all time is thrown away by the directors <UNK> of placing a 1980's david <UNK> song in a wwii movie br br my problems and there are many with this movie is the re occurring problem i have with most tarantino product he rarely knows when to either start or stop i don't need <UNK> after <UNK> to get the joke whatever it may be i knew of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ray hugo and the ultimate crime of the entire movie <UNK> <UNK> haunting score from revolver i go to the cinema to see the stars if the best you can do is the dire pitt i'll assume you mr tarantino are the main draw here i don't want the audience directing the movie i pay to see your vision your ideas your creativity not how you can <UNK> time and time again endless scenes from endless movies it's high time the fan boys on imdb employed some <UNK> <UNK> on your god knows if you don't the studios should br br the tired old argument with tarantino <UNK> is well if you can do better do so let me tell you if i was a <UNK> year old director with the unfortunate pull <UNK> has i'd want to offer you a lot more than a <UNK> up muddled re <UNK> of better wwii movies than this tripe the directors he attempts to <UNK> made movies so bad by accident or due to <UNK> constraints it's a cop out time and time again to hear his fans campaign his lack of imagination as <UNK> i'm sure he's capable of better but after giving him the benefit of the doubt once more and not to mention 2 and a half hours of my life maybe he isn't
<START> the youth in us is a pitch perfect gem i saw this stunning short at this year's 2005 sundance festival the story took me on a profoundly <UNK> journey the directing by joshua leonard the acting of <UNK> garner and lukas <UNK> the art direction the cinematography the score every element was true to the bone one can only hope that this exquisite and excruciating film is <UNK> to more great work from this gifted director br br just as a short film is shown before a feature at sundance commercial movie theatres used a similar format in times past it would be wonderful if <UNK> masterpieces like the youth in us could reach a wider audience this way
<START> for all losers who gave it negative review its because you probably have sex once in 2 years or you are in <UNK> with one girl for years and guess what she is going to cheat on you when player like those on that show approach her somewhere off course any male who is not as good as these guys are going to hate them and hate the show and that one chick who thinks this show is meant to mock these guys its more actually how to show clueless man how to pick up woman what these guys are doing it way better then what most man are doing not approaching at all for anybody who has open mind i recommend to read the book the game by neil <UNK> it deals with similar theme as this show
<START> how does anyone keep on seeing horror movies after this one really this one it's so bad that makes me sick and love horror movies but come on who could had remembered to do such a awful movie it as no history it's only a men who chases a bunch of teenagers because they take something from him and what have they took gold it's typical the movie is boring from the beginning until the end and what is karen black who is a great actress doing in such a ridiculous movie like this but what can i say i think everyone should see it because my opinion is my opinion may be you would like i don't think so but
<START> i don't honestly know what legal or illegal substance they the writers were on when the wrote this horrid piece of tripe br br the cast sucks the plot sucks the editing sucks the whole premise of the movie is that a girl with psychic <UNK> powers comes across a lesbian vampire <UNK> you just have to be totally out of your head to watch even 1 minute of this br br the only reason i had to watch it it was on the here network as part of a two picture purchase and the movie that came on after it was the real one that i wanted to see i fast <UNK> through the whole thing and was just amazed how stupid this movie was in double speed br br do not rent buy or watch this movie the vampires in the movie don't suck as much as the overall movie and production does br br if you want a good lesbian vampire movie the <UNK> with david <UNK> susan sarandon <UNK> <UNK> excellent movie to watch own rent in place of this piece of pure sh t
<START> <UNK> army defies formula instead of selling out for cliches and big stars it relies completely on the excellent acting from a strong cast the strength of a well written script and a fascinating and bitter story the result is a raw and realistic film that moves along fast with a heavy emotional current one of the best i've ever seen about the civil war and i think it can owe that to the pleasure of being an independent film if you like this film try to see the similarly brilliant indie civil war film wicked spring as well br br <UNK> simply tells the true story of a small expedition team of union men who ride into a <UNK> farm to take <UNK> but end up stuck there because of an accident of one of the men tensions and relationships are made and broken nothing happens the way hollywood would write it this movie comes from the mind of someone who actually cares about quality film and the telling of history superb dialogue and plot exposition move along a film that looks highly professional but often doesn't feel like you're watching a movie more along the lines of hearing a story br br the film boasts an incredible performance from chris cooper who shows an amazing <UNK> in the exploration of his role he transforms but is always at the height of believability and is easy to emotionally relate to patricia <UNK> is equally as stellar and realistic in a role that many actresses would <UNK> in she shares an interesting chemistry with <UNK> character and where she's the more severe of the characters is still as easy to identify with the rest of the cast is quite capable and fill their roles in well br br the art design and the set are wonderful and personally i love the cinematography it all has the feel of a civil war period photograph with the camera presenting strong <UNK> colors and shadows and a tin like <UNK> but always keeping the <UNK> look of the <UNK> setting they seem to have used natural lighting but whatever they used works beautifully everything looks like it belongs where it is it feels period something i find rare in american period films the actors act 19th century not like 20th century people in old clothes br br above all this film is very personal i think that as an indie it can afford it the film is nearly flawless with an outstanding script that effortlessly creates and explores the relationships and personalities of these characters and lets them grow in a situation as bad as it is it doesn't fail in getting it's point across and it gets it's point across without the usual and <UNK> techniques that are used in all war films these days it's brave it relies on it's characters a fantastic script human emotion and in the cold hard fact that the civil war wasn't all cgi big stars and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i've never understood this type of spoof movies you get some serious semi serious movie that everyone knows about and takes the seriousness out of it through immature fart jokes and such we've seen it many many times and it's never really been funny it's just an easy way to laugh at something you don't understand in my opinion this seems to be one of the more obscure and less liked of the genre though i honestly don't see anything in this that is much worse than that of spy hard or hot shots this movie as is clearly understood simply from the title concentrates on making childish fun of pulp fiction that's the main reason i decided to watch it as i found that film to be overly indulgent of <UNK> sick mind and <UNK> overrated i had hoped for one or two good jokes making fun of the overly violent and pointless type of movie that pulp fiction was in every aspect in my anything but humble opinion i was sorely disappointed the plot is pretty much a rip off of <UNK> film with a few scenes <UNK> other often better films in the same childish and <UNK> fashion the pacing is poor and often you'll sit there being able to guess the outcome of every scene <UNK> every joke often thinking of a better one at the spot bored out of your mind the acting is bad the characters are clichés and stereotypes and are intentionally paper thin in order to make fun of the characters they're based on problem is it doesn't work it just makes the movie that much harder to sit through the humor is juvenile and lame the only positive thing i can say about this film is that they managed to find some actors that looked like the people they were supposed to look like the film is an awful waste of the actual real actors involved possibly slightly entertaining to fans of the typical spoof movies of the same kind i recommend this only to people who truly <UNK> pulp fiction or fans of the <UNK> parody films everyone else avoid 1 10
<START> i haven't reviewed on imdb before but this documentary is so overrated that i felt compelled to <UNK> i wouldn't have even finished watching if i hadn't been a guest at someone's house the film was poor on many levels first video footage was contrived the more i watched the more he seemed to be acting as a person desperate to be famous instead of one acting out of conviction br br second the others in the film with the exception of parents and the <UNK> pilot were just as contrived and corny as he was god they seemed artificial br br third mission to protect the bears doesn't even make sense as he did more harm than good by making the bears grow <UNK> to human presence i believe that really did love the bears but there is much research which <UNK> his efforts were misguided sometimes we have to sacrifice our enjoyment of <UNK> to really help br br fourth the film's entertainment value wasn't half that of other <UNK> films such as march of the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the filmmakers in my opinion did a poor job of <UNK> scenes and gave little <UNK> to keep watching br br as a person who loves <UNK> bears and other <UNK> i would love to see more people dedicated to the <UNK> of our hopefully their efforts will be less people centered
<START> <UNK> <UNK> has chuck norris as a truck driver and a karate master talk about <UNK> two <UNK> careers he gives a load he can't deliver to his younger brother michael and then when the young man doesn't show up chuck goes looking for him br br what young has got himself into is a speed trap run by judge george <UNK> who comes from the roy bean school of <UNK> of course norris deals with matters in the usual chuck norris way and when he gets in trouble the call goes out over the <UNK> for all the <UNK> to come and help their good buddy this speed trap known as texas city has a bad reputation and the drivers are only too happy to help a pal br br <UNK> of course quite a bit younger and with no facial hair in this one he's got the tight <UNK> look of a man who realizes the academy won't be looking at this <UNK> george <UNK> is overacting outrageously as the judge roy bean wannabe br br this one is strictly for the fans of chuck norris
<START> possible spoilers br br i thought pitch black to be quite enjoyable with some nice effects i liked the larger <UNK> although they aren't a <UNK> on the aliens from the alien series it had quite a good atmosphere which i felt <UNK> <UNK> helped contribute toward br br one thing which kind of <UNK> me was how it if the planet has three <UNK> and is in almost continuous daylight where did the <UNK> come from to form clouds and therefore rain br br i liked the fact that <UNK> died at the end it reminded me of the new hollywood films of the 1970s with the main heroine not making it to the end
<START> alright so not every australian movie is all that good yes maybe there have actually been very few with much merit take away however is an absolute bomb <UNK> as one of the worst movies i've ever seen i wanted to like it i figured i'd give it a fair go i've even met one of the screen writers dave <UNK> so i feel kind of a <UNK> giving this movie a bad review but the plot is fairly thin i won't bother relating it read the synopsis which i can forgive there are plenty of movies that can cover that up with a few decent jokes unfortunately take jokes cover its plot up like a 2 <UNK> <UNK> probably the only laughs that came from the 6 other people in the cinema was at the poor acting and dialogue take away goes down like a week old dim <UNK> you might understand that joke if you see the film but the <UNK> not worth it
<START> okay people i have to agree with almost everyone else's reviews here the characters are stupid they're all stereotypical and yet have nice clothes and are always skinny br br don't even get me started on jamie <UNK> role as <UNK> <UNK> is a pretty popular <UNK> blonde young teen who everyone just loves she has a rebellious great personality that everyone agrees with no matter how dumb or extreme it is most annoying of all her voice is so darn <UNK> and obnoxious <UNK> br br take for example the first episode the moment she steps onto the huge campus everyone seems to love her the boys want to ask her out the girls want to be her friend etc thinking she's all that the episode plays out with <UNK> always being the center of attention she is the so called best player of the <UNK> girls basketball team confident and has everyone pity her when she <UNK> gets hit in the face oh boo <UNK> br br my favorite character by far is this whole series is a girl that appears much later into the show lauren or something who is the only person ever introduced in the show to hate <UNK> br br and <UNK> doesn't even seem to be very loyal to her friends sometimes in one episodes she even calls her friend a freak without ever <UNK> and doesn't show the least bit regret in doing so br br <UNK> is always the best br br <UNK> professional t shirts and which become a big hit br br coming up with very elaborate schemes by herself to teach a single person a lesson br br flawless <UNK> br br taking the blame for stuff that wasn't even related to her just so everyone else could be happy br br coming up with a commercial that was so good it was put on tv the list goes on and on br br ugh she has no acting talent she's always the perfect person she acts <UNK> and rebellious and <UNK> and ugh can't stand her br br not only that but everyone in the show always has great clothes even the nerd her wardrobe is better than mine and mine is pretty freaking decent br br no one cares if everyone at loves you <UNK> and would do anything for you even if it meant giving their right arm br br but regardless of these cardboard characters the plots are creative not everyday things they're interesting and amusing the humor is usually good natured and fun but the characters are so paper flat that it's hard to enjoy it br br this show would be really good if dan put a bit more time thinking of the type of characters he wanted because they are so typical so boring that's it's lame and stupid br br point no one's the least bit overweight everyone has stylish clothes <UNK> is the definition of mary sue the story lines are well thought out and the humor is laughable but again i want to emphasize that the characters <UNK> the show watch the show if you must but don't say i didn't warn you if your eyes start to bleed
<START> this christmas gift arrived courtesy of tcm we had never seen the film even though we have seen most of the films of barbara stanwyck this comedy made us laugh so much that at times we had to <UNK> ourselves in order to hear the dialog br br this is a movie that should be seen by people suffering from <UNK> situations especially around christmas it would certainly lift one's spirits by just letting go the movie would make a perfect gift in the form of a dvd or a vhs tape br br christmas in <UNK> was directed with great <UNK> by peter <UNK> based on a story by <UNK> hamilton br br the best thing in the movie is the pairing of two of the most popular stars of that era barbara stanwyck and dennis morgan barbara stanwyck always played strong <UNK> women obviously this was a change of pace for her in this film as well as lady eve ms stanwyck displays a knack for comedy she and mr morgan who played in a lot of musical comedies make a winning combination br br there are no weak performances in the film sydney <UNK> an actor notorious for playing is a delight to watch as the rich and fat alexander <UNK> the man who owned a media empire and who knew a good thing when he saw it <UNK> <UNK> an accomplished english actor adds <UNK> to the stellar cast behind the two principals br br s z is another source of continuous <UNK> he plays the hungarian chef felix who has a hard time with his own version of the english language also <UNK> <UNK> makes a perfect <UNK> the <UNK> in the <UNK> perfect <UNK> farm br br in reading other comments in this forum it's sad to learn that the glorious black and white cinematography is not appreciated by some people after all color was not widely used in the 40s and most of the classic movies have to be seen in its original format because what would be accomplished in them br br this film should be a <UNK> for anyone looking to spend almost two hours of <UNK> fun at christmas time because total <UNK> is assured watch it with an open mind and heart an maybe you'd like to see christmas in <UNK> every year
<START> the lone ranger <UNK> set out to bring to justice a band of <UNK> <UNK> who have killed three indians for what appears at first to be no apparent reason that is until the lone ranger discovers from a conversation with the indian chief that each man possessed a <UNK> the five given by to his friends as gifts we later learn when combined will provide the mastermind behind the <UNK> <UNK> with a map to a legendary lost city of gold can the lone ranger protect the remaining two individuals in possession of the before the <UNK> <UNK> get their hands on it is there really a lost city of gold somewhere upon native land br br watching this i kept knowing what was going to happen beforehand and everything seemed really familiar until eventually i realized i had seen this exact same movie when i was but a little kid suddenly the memories <UNK> back and i remembered having quite a fun time as a child enjoying this one with a bunch of my friends as an adult though the plot is somewhat predictable but you know this while not quite in the same league as the 1956 film remains a lot of fun to watch <UNK> moore is perfect as the lone ranger and jay as <UNK> steals a lot of this movie as he's probably in more action scenes than even the lone ranger there's some very familiar faces on hand here including douglas kennedy as ross brady of the <UNK> <UNK> gang charles <UNK> as a <UNK> sheriff and ralph moody as a kindly <UNK>
<START> for the first time in reviewing films i found myself immediately <UNK> in this story i don't know if it was the way that it was filmed or the story behind the characters but it felt bland <UNK> and completely unoriginal within the first thirty minutes i found myself rather <UNK> with all the characters and the story i felt as if i had seen this structure before and <UNK> was providing nothing new to surprise me after thinking that it may just be my mood i stopped the film and chose to start it fresh in the morning but the same feeling <UNK> i just didn't care that is not a good sign the characters were bland when i say bland i literally mean that by watching them develop you will never have any flavor hit your <UNK> the story seemed recycled nearly to the point of <UNK> now i am not saying that christina wayne stole this story but she added nothing fresh to the perspective the casting was horrid the underlying symbolism and themes were so far lost that no critic could find them nor the characters and the stories were vague and sloppy you knew nothing about anyone or anything and instead of pushing more emphasis on the characters we instead found ourselves with drugs minor sex and money pushed into our faces these are themes we have seen in every film since the dawn of film time yet somehow could not be <UNK> captured by wayne br br what immediately pulled me away from this story it was mainly the characters i have seen most of brad work and honestly he needs to <UNK> himself director larry clark has defined him and oddly he cannot get out of that stereotypical character within the first twenty minutes of screen time i was bored i knew exactly what he was trying to portray and why it was spectacular nor impressive just repetitive he needed to bring some excitement or suspense to his role instead of just <UNK> playing this random <UNK> without a strong character the final climax of this film comes instead as a letdown did not showcase the best of his abilities in this film while i am on the subject  nobody <UNK> the best of their abilities what is going on with <UNK> <UNK> outside of <UNK> i don't believe she has really emerged as an actress and following up with roles such as cat storm doesn't help <UNK> phillips was the only actress that i witnessed actually try to bring something remarkable to the screen sadly due to everyone else's horrid acting she was lost rambling here and there and honestly nearly forgotten about during the second act <UNK> griffith was a pointless cast and most of this film's budget probably went to her two scenes that she was in maybe the rest of it went to the random guy from the kids in the hall who desperately needs to place himself far away from this project br br my biggest problem outside of the acting was the pacing of this film nothing and this is hard for me to say but nothing <UNK> together there were so many sub stories happening throughout the course of the film that no actual substance was formed the <UNK> the teenage angst and <UNK> the wealthy <UNK> learning how horrible real life is the random kids in the hall guy and even the ending just felt rushed and horribly edited together with this shoddy <UNK> the whole story never really formed any true shape family <UNK> were never defined characters were never given any emotion and all we are left with are bits and pieces of honest <UNK> wayne did not complete the task at hand br br while i hate to put the entire burden on the director with this film i am left with little choice with a horrid title that just screamed the complete opposite of what this film was about with amateurish <UNK> ability the cast pretty much was able to give every emotion in every scenes leaving us with disgusting acting and poor developments and with vague storytelling it is hard to place any good behind <UNK> this was a film i had heard nothing about and after viewing it i can see why all wayne has done with this film is random take <UNK> from other films that have done a better job of defining all the elements above and cut all together to make the film <UNK> it is hard for me to say this but wayne ruined this film while i don't believe there was much to fully take from the story any remaining elements of excitement were <UNK> as wayne took the <UNK> while most of the time you can credit some of the story perhaps strong acting or even the music in <UNK> you can credit nothing from the opening sequence until the end i felt like i was swimming through very <UNK> <UNK> no <UNK> no strength br br overall this film is a waste of your time if you are searching for some deep symbolic elements or possibly some banter on our society you will not find it in this film while i know that was what wayne was attempting to show the final product seems like it was edited on an <UNK> a sketch it was an embarrassing film to sit through and encourage nobody to pick it up wayne threw to the wind all the <UNK> of her columbia university education and destroyed two hours of my life avoid at all costs br br grade out of
<START> while i thought this was a good film about <UNK> jr it was a little hard to follow the <UNK> it jumped around quite a bit without ever mentioning what year they were in otherwise not great acting and not really a great film but it was nice to learn a little more about who <UNK> jr was
<START> i went through the <UNK> i went through the <UNK> cried laughed <UNK> my ever loving guts out but through it all i was made whole i became a better person for having sat through this experience in self <UNK> <UNK> it's not every day we can say that we have lived through the worst and come out the other side with something closely resembling our sanity whole and intact friends neighbors <UNK> and be as one now go out and find this film and <UNK> in its place it high on the and kiss its <UNK> box take it to bed take it out with you when you go shopping or have blind dates with strange people they will appreciate you all the better for your sublime and uniquely <UNK> <UNK> on cinema and then they will throw their <UNK> of choice in your face but you will have the last laugh i ran for <UNK> with this little beauty under my belt and you can too it is a treat worth having again and again
<START> on a routine mission in iraq a group of <UNK> soldiers recover a computer hard drive from an training camp <UNK> the location of weapons <UNK> dr walsh after witnessing the <UNK> of his top secret weapons development program dr walsh finds an alternative funding source and sets up a new research facility deep in the notorious forest in where he is developing weapons and selling them to rebels the team of <UNK> is sent on a black <UNK> mission to retrieve the doctor and his technology before the russians find him and his lab what the <UNK> team soon discover is that the doctors latest weapons is a flock of large <UNK> bats that have been <UNK> altered to develop a taste for human flesh i found this movie to be much better than what i was expecting there is lots of action and lots of blood its more or less what you would expect from a creature feature the acting isn't great but its passable i have certainly seen worse overall its an enjoyable movie for what it is a good popcorn movie
<START> it's been mentioned by others the inane dialogue in this series and i agree br br if mom and daughter were really that sharp witted they should be queen and princess of the universe not kicking around in some little town br br i've really tried to watch a few episodes but when the witty <UNK> <UNK> pop culture drivel starts i flip the channel br br i watched a bit of a new episode to see if anything had changed for the better i'd hoped but nope same old we're so clever with our references to pop culture that i nearly <UNK> br br long time fans who aren't happy with the newer seasons might just be up and getting sick of the <UNK> that never stops
<START> this is probably wayne's <UNK> movie at least the <UNK> in which he had a starring role it's just incredibly bad the editing is especially awful it really appears that the editor if there was one literally picked up pieces of film off the floor and <UNK> them together the opening has to be seen to be believed john wayne must have <UNK> every time it was mentioned i know there are b films but are there h films if so this one's an example and i say this as a devoted fan
<START> a really realistic sensible movie by <UNK> <UNK> no stupidity like songs as in other hindi movies class acting by <UNK> <UNK> br br much similarities to real
<START> dr wants to save his son <UNK> who's dying of heart disease he decides a heart transplant with an ape will cure his son no i'm not kidding he does the transplant and somehow his son changes from a <UNK> guy into a muscle bound man with a dime store mask that sort of resembles an ape naturally he gets out kills men tears the clothes of women and <UNK> havoc this is all inter cut with the boring romance of police lt <UNK> <UNK> and lady wrestler lucy we also get pointless female wrestling sequences that add nothing to the plot it all ends by <UNK> the end of king kong this is obviously a pretty stupid movie the plot makes little sense there's the gratuitous female nudity a <UNK> of any exploitation film and very graphic gore that looks laughably fake except for the open heart transplant still this does have merit the whole cast takes everything dead serious and actually aren't too bad as actors also the dubbed in dialogue was for a film like this well done and interesting with surprisingly good dubbing also i saw an excellent dvd print with bright strong color which helps we're not talking a classic here but an ok exploitation movie
<START> if this movie were in production today it would probably have the christian right <UNK> screaming <UNK> <UNK> it is far from a great film in fact it is rather pedestrian however if you have an imagination and a fond <UNK> of youth and first love i recommend it
<START> never been <UNK> gives drew barrymore the chance to do something that maybe 70 of us would like to do go back to high school and make some necessary <UNK> actually the first time for me was bad enough and at my age i doubt i could pull it off the way drew does br br of course the reason could also be that once we leave high school it's like leaving a <UNK> and we have to deal with the great big <UNK> world out there i've known a few in my life who would go back and stay if they could in fact there is a law and order episode which explores the dark side of this same situation a girl looking young enough to pull it off goes through high school at least three times and kills the person who stumbles on her secret br br with drew though it's an assignment she's a copy editor for the chicago sun times who <UNK> to be a reporter <UNK> <UNK> marshall who plays the part like donald <UNK> took over the sun times gets this brilliant idea and just sees in barrymore a young enough looking person to pull off the <UNK> br br high school the first time was bad enough drew was not the most popular then and she's not doing better the second time around that is until brother david arquette also goes back to school and helps her over the rough <UNK> br br of course this raises a whole lot of issues for drew <UNK> pressure from two sources job and school what's a girl to do br br never been <UNK> is a light and charming comedy which to its credit <UNK> over the opportunity to be <UNK> <UNK> and gives us some good entertainment drew is very funny and sweet and her performance in moments of stress for her character moves nicely into pathos michael <UNK> as her english teacher is the kind i wish there were more of in the education field and <UNK> <UNK> and jessica alba play a pair of the empty headed cool kids that drew tries so desperately to hook up with br br still it doesn't inspire me to return to high school
<START> the acting is good thats the <UNK> out of the way is shallow and superficial almost all the characters are middle class and english the gay men are depicted as <UNK> sexual <UNK> aiming to use children in their empty lives this film could only appeal to people who know heath and would get minor satisfaction from pointing out any <UNK> there is no time to engage with the characters and has a result you really don t care about them catherine <UNK> at the height of her comedic fame stars as a woman seeking a divorce from her husband and on screen for about the same time as her <UNK> sketches failed to convince however if she had said what a f liberty i would have agreed br br i'd rather take a walk in the park <UNK> rubbish
<START> don't torture a <UNK> is an absolutely stunning giallo <UNK> for lucio fulci unlike other <UNK> <UNK> like mario <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> fulci takes a decidedly gritty grounded and socially <UNK> approach to the giallo narrative in this film there is nothing glamorous about the child murders and borderline <UNK> a <UNK> subplot for 1972 going on here and fulci wisely shoots with a <UNK> and <UNK> eye avoiding flash melodrama and directorial <UNK> the proceedings are <UNK> by gory and instantly mind <UNK> set pieces that are <UNK> even further by <UNK> jarring sense of the deeply disturbing witch killing scene in particular with its bald faced brutality feels like a snuff film composer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> these carnage filled scenes with <UNK> <UNK> string <UNK> br br the film is <UNK> by a simultaneously lyrical and violent conclusion <UNK> <UNK> morality <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> it is a deeply effective ending that has the capacity to leave the viewer in a <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br fulci couldn't have picked a better location for this film don't torture a <UNK> was photographed in and around the ancient city of italy as continues to <UNK> to this day <UNK> by its shift from an <UNK> economy to an industrial one it is <UNK> with its <UNK> reputation as a <UNK> for mysterious <UNK> ghosts the <UNK> of the real life are reflected by the characters in the film who wearing their christianity on their <UNK> confront any exotic <UNK> tradition namely witchcraft that <UNK> outside of the norm br br interestingly enough was also used as a stand in for <UNK> in mel <UNK> the passion of the christ if anything this adds even more <UNK> to <UNK> message catholic guilt and grisly <UNK> are such a <UNK> combination
<START> you don't have to spend much time watching this made for tv movie or series pilot or whatever it was intended to be to figure out just what lies in store the incredibly bad musical score makes its debut from the start seriously if this isn't the worst theme i've ever heard i certainly can't remember it while the acting talent is available here from jeff bridges to carl vera miles and <UNK> the writing is atrocious and the story is contrived filled with insipid stereotypes and an obvious ripoff from ken <UNK> why must hollywood always present tales from the sixties as if the so called hippies were all <UNK> morons it's too bad that such an interesting era in our exceptionally <UNK> social experience is generally depicted by out and out garbage so that the least offensive of the genre is now accepted as reasonably authentic when almost none of it comes even close to the way things really were the best i've seen to date is a <UNK> called looking back by a guy named <UNK> but who else has even heard of it no one in hollywood that's for sure they're too busy pushing tripe like this <UNK> of a movie to bother with reality
<START> <UNK> <UNK> stars as the daughter of a strict bible <UNK> father who throws her out of the house when <UNK> <UNK> her name in the big city she finds the dying wife of her own brother the two had secretly married and raises their child on her own years later she goes back home to confront her family br br this old melodrama is heavily <UNK> with fascinating feminist themes circa <UNK> but sounding remarkably modern some of it is laid on with a <UNK> as the father theodore roberts gives his <UNK> a real <UNK> but it's well put together dramatically and lovingly composed and shot by cinematographer henry sharp
<START> plots with a view of 2002 is a delightful little comedy like only the british could do it the film's sense of humor is both mildly morbid and black and yet very lovable and sometimes very slapstick ish it's the only film by director nick i've seen so far and while i am not <UNK> to watch any of his other films at the moment i'm not a big fan of romantic comedies this one is highly enjoyable and very funny the film takes place in a little town in <UNK> where betty rhys jones brenda <UNK> is married to the town's drunken and <UNK> major robert <UNK> the local <UNK> boris alfred <UNK> has been desperately in love with betty since their childhood but has always been too shy to confess his love to her apart from being desperately in love boris has some other problems as the eccentric american <UNK> frank christopher walken has opened a funeral <UNK> business in the same town the film's odd very british wit should <UNK> everybody with a sense of humor and the story sometimes becomes quite bizarre also plots with a view <UNK> from a wonderful cast brenda who has already proved herself to be a funny lady in <UNK> saving grace plays the lead and she is once again very funny and very lovable in her role alfred <UNK> who plays her shy admirer delivers a great performance as always and robert <UNK> fits perfectly in the role of <UNK> sleazy husband beautiful <UNK> <UNK> is also great as the husband's i'm becoming a bigger fan with every film i see her in the greatest role however is played by the <UNK> christopher walken one of my favorite actors walken is brilliant as he always is in the role of the eccentric <UNK> who <UNK> <UNK> that are quite <UNK> overall plots with a view is a vastly entertaining little british comedy that i highly recommend
<START> i understand that the budget was low on this film but come on this is really terrible film making the script is just plain awful and that was the free part the effects aren't bad but this film plays out like a conventional r rated movie with lame scares and cut away violence rather than a no holds <UNK> <UNK> gore fest that was intentionally made for video who were these guys kidding like this would have been released in theaters br br the acting is terrible the editing another free aspect of the film is beyond amateur and the plot as i said before leaves little to be desired there's nothing original about the film gore fans avoid this one to the filmmakers try for something original next time or stop making movies all together you're not good at it people hate a trashy rehash especially one of such low caliber avoid it isn't even worth making fun of
<START> in the animated series br br <UNK> <UNK> was an amoral rebel that was completely detached from everything and everyone she was cruel selfish loving unpredictable witty <UNK> confident sarcastic lethal ambiguous all at once the original <UNK> had layers upon layers of depth she almost never allowed her personal emotions to show through the original plot was deliciously ambiguous and thought provoking you could never tell what motives were <UNK> was a <UNK> <UNK> whereas <UNK> was a radical <UNK> because of this they could never have any semblance of a stable relationship br br in the movie br br <UNK> <UNK> works for the and her political motives and personal motives are very clear she was pretty loving vulnerable easily emotional and very predictable the <UNK> in the movie had one <UNK> of depth at most the plot was obvious and contrived everything is completely laid out for you from the beginning there was virtually no conflict between <UNK> and <UNK> at least in terms of personal <UNK> the only conflict between them was that they were on different sides br br the movie was a horrible disappointment to me i felt betrayed they took the idea of one of my favorite animated characters of all time <UNK> all the depth and personality out of her and <UNK> her full of hollywood clichés the essence of the animated series was completely lost in this movie br br the only reason i'm not giving this movie a 1 is because the visuals were incredible it was neat to see some of the familiar animated scenes like the fly in the eye done with cgi
<START> this film has been <UNK> to the point of the ridiculous american movie is a boring documentary about a boring person so ordinary you'll find <UNK> on just about every corner in america it takes a long hard look at a guy who's failed at just about everything in the interest of making an independent movie or two were his failures for other than his own selfish <UNK> or were they in the name of real art the movie might have had a chance america has an abundance of better stories to be told this one should be <UNK> and many critics have good reason to be ashamed two thumbs up indeed
<START> i happened upon this by chance i was at my friends house and he had just started watching it so i sat down thinking we would shoot the <UNK> whilst this was playing in the background however within seconds i was immersed in this <UNK> drama and we both spent the rest of the time completely focused on this and not saying a word to each other br br i never knew the tale of the the first solo around the world <UNK> race let alone the tragic events of one man's attempt against the odds which set out to be his redemption for all of his <UNK> in life but ultimately ends up becoming an example of them having not known of the story i did watch this with the same <UNK> as i imagine those who were reading about the race at the time it actually was happening <UNK> in what was taking place and eager for more information hoping the lone amateur was going to pull it off against the odds and beat the <UNK> which makes the shocking twists of the story all the more tragic i felt like i was living the story br br the story is told with great care and the <UNK> have clearly had time to reflect on the tragedy which gives great insights but is also <UNK> nicely by the archive footage of interviews at the time of the tragedy the <UNK> and photographs of the lone sailors is also excellently used and the insights into the minds of the sailors and how <UNK> was affecting them was superb br br i'm shocked that this story isn't more widely known or has been turned into a movie but also thankful thankful that we have this drama documentary to tell the tale from those who knew the man instead of some <UNK> <UNK> movie adaptation and thankful that i caught this gem of a film by pure chance br br it's a must see whether you like documentaries or not
<START> this sequel to the above and the final entry in the <UNK> series is slightly more enjoyable on the whole but it's also more contrived hell we even get a singing <UNK> <UNK> peter <UNK> is easily the least charismatic of the various egyptian high priests we've seen during the course of these films and martin <UNK> as his henchman seems <UNK> in the proceedings kurt <UNK> then is <UNK> with a ridiculous accent as the man who discovers the newly <UNK> princess <UNK> the latter in the form of virginia christine later a much used character actress gets her most substantial <UNK> and indeed the sequence of her <UNK> from the <UNK> is a highlight not only of this film but the entire series unfortunately here too <UNK> has precious little to do as once again the emphasis is on <UNK> as i've said his mummy to which he returned most often at universal apart naturally from his signature role of the wolf man remains without a doubt his least memorable monster for the studio
<START> <UNK> <UNK> of the board and his at t commercials are living proof that fly blown <UNK> matter is available in the color orange not <UNK> available however as hbo charges for such garbage the saving grace of is that it surely fills suicide hot lines across the country perhaps providing <UNK> for thousands of <UNK> <UNK> who lost their jobs when <UNK> memory treatment was <UNK> although sadly <UNK> top probably contributes to his <UNK> at <UNK> bottom line with the <UNK> phone traffic from <UNK> hbo viewers i can <UNK> the <UNK> of traumatized tv viewers phone in one hand and fully loaded 45 auto in the other hand <UNK> out of last minute desperation before walking off the <UNK> of life to escape the <UNK> of orange haired monster <UNK> in their <UNK> like the agony of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> it´s long time that i and my wife <UNK> see such a boring thriller it´s <UNK> not a gripping story and it is paced so slowly that we nearly fell asleep this could be instead a very low budget tv crime series there are some ridiculous scenes like the one where mafia boss wants to see the jury lady in a red clothes or another <UNK> cannot stop to think about her and so on okay perhaps this should have been a romantic thriller but believe me you really <UNK> miss anything we gave 4 10
<START> this one is a hilarious diamond in the rough the acting and plot aren't that impressive but the lines just keep on coming this catches a lot of <UNK> because it seems at first glance like well a bad movie but it's so <UNK> that you can't help but be amused the <UNK> <UNK> quick dialog and quirky characters keep it going i was especially fond of sharon the <UNK> on eh however the one that really stole the show was <UNK> little brother andrew ira <UNK> his high pitched whining was somehow endearing the whole movie <UNK>
<START> the thing with ali g is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character br br the humour is very much a <UNK> it or love <UNK> brand of totally politically incorrect <UNK> and self <UNK> type br br personally i totally love this film and so has everyone i have met who has seen it you can watch it several times and pick new gags up each time the humour is both <UNK> and visual and the timing is impeccable the humour is probably very english and specifically london so its possible that non english viewers may not get some of the humour think of yourself as a teenager and you will love it especially if the likes of kevin perry go large <UNK> you
<START> this is what disney channel shows to kids who are dumber than <UNK> it suits them well it's not funny the acting is the worst i've seen in many years there are more stereotypes than there are actors and everything about this show makes you <UNK> and roll your eyes wanna know why not only is this show a waste of <UNK> the lead actress <UNK> <UNK> looks like a pig jake t <UNK> character needs some <UNK> david character needs to visit a strip club and get wasted also the writer of the show is inconsistent in one episode the security guard is called sir by one character and referred to as a woman by all else br br hello it's called and editing do it sometime disney br br has anyone seen the <UNK> for the new four part <UNK> saga disney wanted their own version of the twilight vs harry potter thing except a million times <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> place movie think about it for a minute family goes away on vacation and 16 year old daughter wants independence from parents same plot from the proud family movie etc br br what's worse is all the <UNK> and it got and most of the audience are some what 4 13 and no life teenagers how many more years before <UNK> <UNK> is showing her tits br br and disney shows are all crap hack writers hack shows destroying the minds and <UNK> of today's youth
<START> being american i have not been exposed to this character before which is good because some of you have been disappointed i have nothing to compare it to i have found no enjoyment in the mindless idiot humor in the american teen movies and although this is a slightly similar type of humor i couldn't stop laughing i hardly ever laugh out loud at a movie and usually a movie has a few funny parts for me but this movie was funny from start to finish my only disappointment was when it was over i'm actually going to buy this on dvd when i find it
<START> good footage of world war i era ships and planes <UNK> this excellent war drama set in the <UNK> walter huston is excellent as the commanding officer who knows his place and his place has no room for personal feelings the safety of the ship and the mission must always come first robert <UNK> is the lieutenant who has not yet <UNK> the role that a leader must play in combat he makes bad decisions <UNK> the submarine and its crew but finally becomes a real man after he is court <UNK> and <UNK> from the navy robert young plays a lieutenant junior grade and jimmy <UNK> as a cook <UNK> the war drama is an equally important wartime love triangle between <UNK> and <UNK> evans who plays <UNK> daughter and the wife of a <UNK> injured <UNK> recommended
<START> i provided location services on the this film every sunday we would shoot in <UNK> berkeley square david niven ever the gentleman thoroughly enjoyed the role sadly to be his last we had a moment of panic when a <UNK> load of fake cast for the film <UNK> down a storm drain br br imagine frantic crew opening all the <UNK> to recover every last one if you know and love london you'll love this comedy romp also starts richard jordan who sadly died from a brain <UNK> a good film great crew superb cast look for the current stars of <UNK> street then playing crowd scenes or extras the car lot and <UNK> <UNK> were all shot in west london the entire shopping parade and the american used car lot were dressed overnight the car lot is still there as are the <UNK> a restaurant was suddenly turned into a funeral <UNK> if you see the film on the <UNK> make an effort to see it by the way sally harrison the bank <UNK> was married to the production designer tony curtis br br april 2007 just thought i would add a few extra comments on locations br br pub just off berkeley square <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in back road film studios <UNK> used car lot along high street and all shop locations near <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> factory on <UNK> opposite <UNK> jail see <UNK> above <UNK> box see <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it was the wooden studio prop box used in many films look for the lighting cable at level and the wood <UNK> on the door computer room near olympia graveyard grave just outside the <UNK> on common land bank interiors ceiling void and studios br br and just to add david niven ever the gentleman <UNK> and mixed with the crew extras and so on niven would <UNK> in the <UNK> hotel <UNK> join the crew for coffee
<START> i mean come on this movie had such nice potential but it's like they ran out of money to finish the script and just <UNK> the whole damn rest of the movie about 2 <UNK> of the way through characters start <UNK> this movies whole reason for existence to other characters who didn't ask for the information on extremely flimsy premises they also fall into some stereotypical behavior because that must be what's expected in this genre of movie it's really pretty sad because this movie could have been so much more br br i was really hoping this would be a good movie there was some good acting mark <UNK> does an excellent job until the movie falls apart so does sally <UNK> it was fun to see them working and <UNK> at their craft was pretty good for awhile until her lines just became <UNK> i felt sad for her that she had to say these lines that just shot the whole movies credibility for any thinking movie goers brad hunt does an excellent job he really has a surprising range of talent judging from another of his movies i recently saw lucky 13 which was a piece of crap this guy could be a star if he could pick the right scripts and get lucky with the right director br br almost forgot the music was so heavy handed you might think this project was handed to some minor film school to be scored i call this kind of music <UNK> music because you can just tell what's coming next based on the music less is more sometimes br br cut half of the music from this movie get a good film editor a small rewrite or two and this would be a very good movie
<START> i was under <UNK> that this was the cat and mouse duo but it wasn't instead it was something that shouldn't have been made not even for its time they disguise themselves in the <UNK> fashion because they fly to africa and they even act like <UNK> <UNK> and all the others rolled into one there are some cartoons that are racist but they are classics being a mixed woman i have the right to say this but if you are into the historical aspect of these cartoons try <UNK> <UNK> coal black and de <UNK> or angel <UNK> you won't find them on dvd because the <UNK> promised not to put them in the mainstream but you can find them on a site as youtube i don't recommend little kids seeing this but if you want to see how early america was racist and ignorant these are better <UNK> not to mention this particular cartoon has poor animation i know it was 1932 but i have seen better for its time br br plane unnecessary 1 out of 10
<START> im a big horror fan and i quite enjoyed this remake with all these horror remakes floating about i think this is one of the better attempts br br i watched it with my two little sisters and i think it made it even better as they were quite scared also with the shouting at the screen dont do that not that way etc i thought there were some good little <UNK> moments and it built the tension well br br <UNK> belle is absolutely stunning in the lead role and a very good actress so she holds your attention well br br overall a decent film
<START> just finished watching this one after getting sick of getting ready for the <UNK> bar <UNK> i wanted something that was mindless and that i could just sit back and say what the hell were they thinking i was not disappointed in this <UNK> but had i been watching this one in a serious mood i would have been <UNK> the company that made this thing just spliced cgi footage from the first <UNK> and added a little footage with a fake <UNK> that makes the one used in bride of the monster look like a masterpiece of special effect footage since when does an <UNK> have <UNK> the plot is that an <UNK> diver is investigating some murders <UNK> on the hudson river shortly before the fourth of july he and his partner who is soon to be transferred or soon to be <UNK> on by a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> investigate in a rather inept manner all the while believing that a huge <UNK> will kill people and are occasionally accompanied by a female <UNK> from the <UNK> office of course on one believes that an <UNK> can get that big until the thing attacks the cop and the girl from the <UNK> office surprisingly all hell doesn't break loose and only a few cops and a few more civilians are killed br br really lame don't bother with it
<START> ok i wanted to see this because it had a few good reviews but this movie was awful just plain awful the characters were 1 dimensional and nothing the actors could do could ever breathe any life into them the story was abysmal the wind stopped becoming a plot device halfway through it just completely becomes forgotten the visuals while were cool were <UNK> drawn out 5 minutes of a guy <UNK> on the ground 3 minutes of a girl putting on her makeup i don't know what this guy is trying to pull off it's like he had no plot no dialog and the movie needed to run just so long so lets not edit scenes at all foreign films are great for creating a story without using a lot of dialog this movie makes me think that there is no way american cinema can ever do this i want to give up watching movies altogether bad bad movie
<START> this movie was a heart felt piece of cinema that helped show the darker side of childhood and the little things that shaped who tom <UNK> was using a very <UNK> story they were able to give you an idea of what truly happened to tom <UNK> character as a child and while scenes like the flying machine may have never happened it helped to show how even denial can help tell the truth in all good conscience i could not rate this lower then a 9 out of 10 great performances from all the actors and while many may not have understood the <UNK> ending in which the brother is murdered by his step father and tom hanks covers it up using a far fetched story about a flying machine pay close attention to the little details such as the turtle that he still has even though his brother flew off with it truly a beautiful piece of cinema and every actor deserves recognition for it
<START> i just recently stumbled upon this show when abc family had an all day marathon before season 2 premiered i remember seeing previews for the show back in 2007 and thought it would be short lived and not very well written because it was on abc family br br never doubt an abc family show this show surprised me in the best way possible not only is the show well written story lines are realistic funny and enjoyable i was expecting a lot of talk about relationships something like this guy dated that girl who dumped me for that kid etc but this show is anything but the characters are appealing and you really feel a connection between them all there is a lot of chemistry between the actors and they can really make you feel like the stuff is happening right before your eyes br br don't doubt this show it is truly enjoyable to watch and get hooked on
<START> as a <UNK> talk about and gets my heart racing however i found this presentation too slow and not packed with enough information for the interested <UNK> who is most likely to see it if you have more than a passing curiosity in this sort of stuff go to the library and check out some books you will find they explain current scientific with far more detail while at the same time filling you with more of a sense of wonder than this movie does also to set the record straight <UNK> is not considered the greatest mind or the world's <UNK> person as <UNK> <UNK> even among the user reviews here at the imdb <UNK> himself has commented that it is rubbish it is just media hype they needed somebody to fill the role model of disabled genius at least i'm disabled to be fair he is probably a genius but among <UNK> greatest scientists people like einstein <UNK> and many others easily are even more highly regarded this is not to <UNK> <UNK> who is a undoubtedly a great scientist but rather not to <UNK> others who have done even more than he has anyhow see the movie if you are truly into science but if not i think it would be boring for you
<START> it's not fair i was really expecting this to be a hilarious entertaining movie i mean i like drake bell from drake and josh and leslie <UNK> is nothing to be <UNK> at since his earliest classics airplane and the naked gun however after seeing superhero movie i'm glad i didn't even have to pay for it it just wouldn't have been anywhere near the 9 per ticket more like a dollar and a few <UNK> because that would sum up for the hour and a few minutes and as disappointing as this film was i'm glad the running time was that short if not shorter i just cant believe how incredibly vulgar unnecessary and above all stupid some of the scenes were and above that i've seen better acting from a wooden <UNK> without the <UNK> it's as if craig <UNK> wanted to make a film that deserves its 3 7 if not lower and even try to be worse than meet the <UNK> very disappointing indeed
<START> this is quite possibly the worst documentary i have ever seen it looked so amateurish chris was one of the directors of the war room which was a great movie albeit a little one sided but it looked beautiful com looked like it was shot in some guy's basement the quality was so pitiful that i couldn't stand watching it i saw about 30 minutes or so and i had to take it back to blockbuster and get something else i can't understand how something so amateurish some from someone like chris how the hell did this win any awards to begin with the war room definitely deserved an award as did another great documentary called both won awards this documentary looked like it was done by uncle joe who also does <UNK> on the <UNK> shaky <UNK> lit <UNK> lighting bad sound a 10 year old could make a better film than that guy did
<START> despite the fact that there were aspects of this film that i felt were not developed enough i enjoyed it and would recommend it to others richard gere and diane lane are great in their lead roles the basic premise of the film is that both were in the wake of broken <UNK> when they meet both also are searching for healing unexpectedly they find that they can help <UNK> each other there were aspects of the film that i wished i'd seen play out more where simple flashes merely suggested themes that my mind had to fill in the <UNK> on such as the <UNK> to the <UNK> widower and how <UNK> goes from feeling guilty about having slept with paul to feeling okay with it soon after an opportunity for a tremendous love scene was lost when it was merely suggested they were going to make love with the <UNK> coming but in the end the film left me feeling deeply <UNK> of the relationship that my wife and i share and there were moments that moved me to the verge of tears so i have to say it is well worth viewing
<START> comment that ms <UNK> ultra <UNK> dance in this film is the most erotic in the history of films is certainly one <UNK> of an exaggeration it isn't even debra <UNK> most erotic dance her near nude <UNK> in fritz <UNK> the indian tomb make this number look decidedly tame as for being the most erotic in the history of dance well where do i start <UNK> performance as <UNK> in from <UNK> to dawn 1996 jamie lee curtis in true lies 1994 jessica alba in sin city 2005 rose in terror planet 2007 sheila <UNK> in dancing at the blue <UNK> 2000 blah blah blah br br don't get me wrong i love the sequence and have included it in my <UNK> dance series on youtube i just think that making a claim like most erotic in the history of film is really going out on a very fragile <UNK>
<START> this movie was awful plain and simple the animation scenes had absolutely terrible graphics it was very clear to see that this film had about the budget of my <UNK> bill the acting was just as bad i've seen better acting in pornographic films i would seriously like the hour and twenty minutes of my life back in fact i <UNK> on imdb just so that other people don't get sucked into watching this like i did don't get me wrong though i love sci fi films this one seemed more like the intro to a video game i'm glad i only spent a dollar to see this one the story line reminded me of the movie pitch black a prisoner on a ship in outer space escapes oh my goodness what are we gonna do i would not even let this play in the background of my house while i was cleaning bottom line here you can do better
<START> this movie was very disappointing and except for a few moments wasn't fly at all more than anything it was just <UNK> stupid the music was <UNK> bad and the plot played out like a <UNK> bowl game  very predictable avoiding embarrassment by <UNK> a late game <UNK> of a <UNK> that falls short and leads to a loss in essence the half childish half naive will the movie's and his <UNK> confused brother danny we'll just call him a <UNK> treat <UNK> the movie's sweet spirit the 3rd member of their hapless mormon boy band like crap until the man and father figure of the film the stage manager jill has a talk with will and <UNK> him out <UNK> <UNK> personality changes <UNK> degrees and he's instantly the mature and self aware leader of the band this would be a cute perhaps funny 10 minute <UNK> gig but the fact that the movie is <UNK> minutes long really sucks the life out of you if you watch it to the end my advise  take the money you'd normally spend to rent this show and either burn it in your <UNK> or <UNK> it down the toilet  more entertainment with much less time commitment if you want to watch a better movie of the same genre get saints and soldiers  not a comedy but an infinitely better show actually <UNK> has more funny stuff in saints than he does in <UNK>
<START> how does a movie become a biblical epic simply by <UNK> a couple of <UNK> using some names out of the bible for your characters the only thing that was biblical about this epic was the names of the characters oh i almost forgot the 3 <UNK> israel egypt <UNK> were also used where did king <UNK> get the rest of his story from it surely wasn't from the bible it was complete utter nonsense if you want to read about <UNK> reign as king in israel then read 1 kings 1 11 2 chronicles 1 9 you will even come across in 1 kings 1 2 the queen of <UNK> who doesn't show up until king <UNK> has been king for about 20 years or so which by the way is long after <UNK> had been dead can be found in 1 kings 10 2 chronicles 9 one of the first thing <UNK> does is make an <UNK> with <UNK> by taking his daughter br br yes king <UNK> did get involved with the <UNK> of false gods this is why the kingdom was split after his death not the temple being destroyed by lightning also i think <UNK> was too busy marrying providing <UNK> to the false gods of his 700 wives <UNK> to his 300 <UNK> to be fighting egypt let alone a dead brother br br like i said this movie was utter nonsense if you aren't gonna use the story in the bible then call it something else this could've just as easily been called romeo juliet or sid nancy br br
<START> i must give credit to billy dee for trying to pull this off knowing this was a <UNK> film i started my dvd with a certain expectation i knew it would be low budget the acting sub par but hoped for a few gems to be <UNK> throughout if there were any <UNK> or gems <UNK> within this film they were successfully buried under tons and tons of coal or perhaps overacting as an actor and filmmaker i <UNK> often when potential poignant moments were ruined with atrocious performances yet i must admit i could not look away i don't know if this was like a car wreck you can't turn your eyes from or some mysterious power in the film that kept me there this film is a good case for an excellent story that was told wrong if walter were to tell the <UNK> joke it would be a total flop although the joke itself is hilarious let dave tell it and we are all rolling on the floor laughing this film needed a <UNK> now with that said if you have the opportunity to purchase this film for the dollar that i did do it it is well worth the money perhaps i will take another dollar purchase the rights to this film and remake it who knows it might not be any better but it surely can't be any worse
<START> when alfred hitchcock made strangers on a train it was a <UNK> for the bulk of the film going public that he was back at the top of his form from 1946 to 1950 his films were not box office <UNK> and his <UNK> <UNK> with david o <UNK> ended because of this actually he made some really good films in the period such as notorious <UNK> under <UNK> rope and my opinion <UNK> but while notorious and <UNK> were liked the audiences were turned off by <UNK> attempts at <UNK> his use of a dream sequence by <UNK> in <UNK> was acceptable as was the setting among <UNK> but the experiment with long takes in rope confused the public making ignore the merits of that film and the <UNK> of <UNK> to have the audience fooled by a lie told by a leading character in a flashback was disliked far more disliked then it deserved to be in <UNK> a matter of bad timing for under <UNK> it was released just as the scandal of it's star ingrid bergman and <UNK> broke out made it seem to be a failure which it wasn't the case was another failure and one that really had little in it's favor br br with strangers on a train hitchcock <UNK> away from the special tricks that interested him in the recent films instead he concentrated on his favorite themes of shared guilt and mistaken identity based on a novel by patricia <UNK> the story was of how guy haines a professional <UNK> player meets a fan of his bruno anthony a playboy who is traveling on a cross country train at the same time as the <UNK> bruno is <UNK> and <UNK> and guy views him as one of the typical fans he has met if a little eccentric with his talk of wanting to be on the first rocket to outer space but bruno knows all about guy's personal problems he is married to a <UNK> young woman named <UNK> and is in love with anne <UNK> daughter of a senator bruno knows that <UNK> won't divorce her successful celebrity husband bruno mentions how he can sympathize he hates his <UNK> who is constantly <UNK> him then bruno mentions sort of off the <UNK> an idea he has about two men technically strangers <UNK> murders for each other and then committing two perfect crimes instead of <UNK> them guy <UNK> to the idea and agrees it is an interesting idea the train reaches guy's destination and his last comment is like a <UNK> of the idea he just does not realize that the eccentric bruno is a <UNK> and believes guy has just agreed to the two killing each other's <UNK> br br it's a wonderfully simple plot actually bruno of course does kill <UNK> but he fully expects guy to live up to the murder <UNK> and kill his <UNK> guy is horrified and worse he finds that he is the police <UNK> number one suspect when bruno to encourage guy mentions he has the <UNK> lighter he <UNK> it on the train and can plant it at the murder site guy finds himself in deeper problems how to avoid the police and how to control if possible the insane bruno br br <UNK> always planned the shots of his film carefully so that from the start we see both our heroes from their feet heading towards their <UNK> meeting in the train with each other there are constant cross contacts used in the film to show how the two men are drawn into each other's <UNK> it is like fate drawing them together yet both have their own personality and <UNK> with a typical twist makes the mad bruno actually more of an attractive figure his scheme may be vicious it will kill two people if successful and he will have guy live up to the <UNK> no matter what but he has a <UNK> for life one suspects that once guy too had one but his <UNK> failure coupled with his now dating a socially prominent woman has made him more <UNK> and dull than he was br br the cast is good too robert walker probably had his finest role in this film only a year before his death it was a far cry from the <UNK> boy next door of since you went away or the clock his <UNK> figure also looked quite elegant in tales in several scenes as guy <UNK> granger acts like a cousin of his co murderer in rope especially as the circumstances make him increasingly suspicious to the authorities as his earlier role made his <UNK> behavior increasingly suspicion to jimmy stewart as for the ladies rogers is properly <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> the audience to be prepared for her demise in a famous sequence shot in the reflection of her <UNK> so that they actually are cheering bruno in his act of evil patricia hitchcock appears as the younger sister of anne ruth roman who bears a close resemblance to <UNK> and accidentally sets off bruno at a social occasion she plays this rare role well ruth roman is properly supportive of granger but her role is <UNK> because she is establishment in her background and somewhat low <UNK> other supporting performers leo g <UNK> as the senator marion <UNK> usually a comedian as <UNK> <UNK> mother and norma as an unexpected <UNK> of violence from walker are all shown to best advantage all at the hand of a master
<START> the film begins with a <UNK> old broadway producer exceptionally well played by veteran character actor richard <UNK> being driven by a man hoping to sell him a story for an upcoming play however there is a bad storm and their car becomes stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night fortunately there's a mansion nearby though it seems pretty odd that the people inside know the writer and he says he didn't realize this was the home of a man he knew and <UNK> however while this seems like bad and contrived writing it is not as this is all part of an elaborate <UNK> by the writer to have a group of actors in the home act out his plot however part way through the <UNK> the producer and his assistant figure out that the murder mystery taking place in the home is fake and think the whole affair is pretty funny what no one realizes though is that an escaped maniac is loose and he is about to enter this contrived little plot making for some wonderful twists and turns so when it seems that there is a real murder the actors are truly terrified while <UNK> and his sidekick are convinced it's all a <UNK> while i have explained some of the plot there are many more aspects of the film you'll just have to figure out yourself and it's surely to keep you entertained and guessing br br considering that this is a b movie in the public <UNK> i certainly did not have very high hopes for this little film however i was thrilled when the film turned out to be a much better than average flick with a very interesting and novel twist on the old clichéd plot about a dark and <UNK> night spent in a mansion plus while the plotting of the film was very good the dialog was even better with lots of <UNK> wit and a nice light hearted pace full of pleasant surprises and well worth your time
<START> the beginning voice over sounds like 'the <UNK> could be quite an intriguing movie but as the story <UNK> i knew it was downhill from there the major things about this movie that blew were the terribly bad acting jobs all the main characters did except for a few scenes involving the inner turmoil of <UNK> there was a total lack of character development and absolutely no point to the plot what were the writers thinking br br michael won 2 <UNK> sci <UNK> awards for 'the <UNK> huh what was so scary about this movie nothing except for the resident evil 2 video shots the rest was more of a <UNK> for t v <UNK> it wouldn't even have to be edited if you want a far better movie about <UNK> among <UNK> rent shallow grave instead br br 'the <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is a somewhat self indulgent uneven <UNK> movie but as lord byron another visitor to <UNK> <UNK> to his friend john murray about his similarly self indulgent and <UNK> don juan it may be <UNK> but is it not life is it not the thing br br the connections to shakespeare's <UNK> may seem as another <UNK> here claims a bit <UNK> but watch the film again after re reading the <UNK> and they'll seem far closer what makes this film flawed is its uneasy mixture of straightforward normal narrative and sudden jarring apparent <UNK> particularly between cassavetes and <UNK> but to be honest these scenes are the most remarkable and gripping in the film if the hardest to watch br br the music of this film composed by is also overlooked particularly fine is the perfect little piece played to <UNK> the afternoon <UNK> as people animals and seemingly the entire island collapse to sleep away the <UNK> part of the afternoon it's a sublime moment and representative of the best aspect of this movie and the one thing that keeps it somewhat <UNK> the fact that aside from extensive flashbacks and the very end it is the story of one day on an island from awakening to night br br overall i'd rather watch this film a hundred times than see some <UNK> hollywood piece of crap once and in fact i probably have watched it several dozen times most times i see something i missed before br br confession i'm biased this was the second movie i took my greek american <UNK> wife to see br br trivia notes on this flick br br it was molly <UNK> first movie as well as sam br br it was actually not filmed on an island but in the southern tip of the remote <UNK> <UNK> of the of <UNK> br br the by today's standards primitive special effects were done by who later became head of disney and still later was an <UNK> to the us intelligence community br br paul <UNK> the director chose the title of his recent autobiography show me the magic from the script of <UNK>
<START> did people expect jurassic park 3 to be full of surprises not one moment of it is worth it many elements could easily scare people out of the movies and it's not the <UNK> tea <UNK> i think she's a great actress but i'm sorry to say that this time she reached the bottom line i wonder if she happened to strain a vocal <UNK> while shooting the movie laura dern she's ok but why not be more noticeable in the movie maybe exchange smart dialogs with sam neil <UNK> <UNK> have you ever heard of something called facial expression emotions he's got to work harder on that sam neil no big deal the soundtrack got to change that record or you get tired of it my applause goes to william h macy a talented actor who i've never seen playing a bad role unfortunately he can't save the movie nor can the well computer created dinosaurs
<START> perhaps i'm just a simple person but i prefer movies that somehow make me care about the people in them i couldn't care less about anyone in this movie this was supposed to be a comedy maybe the humor was too subtle for me all the way down to the <UNK> level the thing about it is it missed on so many things there were characters that could have been funny but they weren't there were characters that you could have liked but you didn't for instance the guy who thought the beatles ripped off his songs there was so much potential there but all he did was talk like a <UNK> and complain about how they ripped him off haha and the previous poster talked about the 'i am the scene like it was special what he played 'i am the on an old piano and sang out of tune is there an inside joke there it sure <UNK> at face value this movie has the feel to me of a movie people say they like because it sounds <UNK> or <UNK> to say you like it that you get the whole <UNK> art garbage message the artist is expressing if you want to be entertained stay away
<START> age of steel follows up the previous episode rise of the which was excellent in some respects lacking in others <UNK> had some positive elements the most important being excellent portrayal of the doctor indeed his sort of <UNK> <UNK> bears to this writer the shadow of tom <UNK> doctor with his sort of <UNK> <UNK> as when <UNK> off time periods when mickey is holding down the button in the <UNK> yet brings his own <UNK> <UNK> a la <UNK> doctor as he lets events <UNK> around him some reviewers and fans whose pieces i've read seem a bit <UNK> at having such a young actor portray someone who must by now be over a 1000 old but i disagree doctor does indeed bear the weight of the world on his shoulders as he points out in this episode and one can see this in his almost smug characterization as when he finally confronts the in the climax his world weary eyes rolling sort of attitude is refreshing especially after <UNK> excellent pseudo working class interpretation of the character more the man of action than fresh faced pseudo <UNK> best moment is perhaps after the end when he is <UNK> the <UNK> with his big goofy baker esquire grin as the <UNK> re starts here we begin to get a feeling for this new doctor a character who is little more than the average person's different personality <UNK> split up into 13 different people some <UNK> some more likable than others yet all <UNK> part of a whole this aside these two episodes were passable but weak the concept of <UNK> the is much welcomed and they look fantastic but the plot involving a parallel earth where this action takes place doesn't seem to work right true the allegory here of <UNK> <UNK> on technology and their need to serve it as the doctor points out is outstanding but this could easily have been placed on contemporary earth or <UNK> some other weak spots are as others have pointed out the ease with which the doctor and co get out of the tight spots <UNK> the death ray from the <UNK> <UNK> the seemingly endless array of uses of the <UNK> <UNK> my wife laughed when they were using it to burn through the rope ladder at the end she has barely watched who so i had to explain that it was used <UNK> as a plot device to <UNK> the characters from situations from which there is no other escape used here sadly some of the acting was wanting especially mickey who really needs his due and some of the supporting cast was creepy as he needed to be his voice even sounded esquire the score was horrific though with the <UNK> volume often out the scene overall i found rise of the more entertaining though the second half was passable the build up to what we knew was inevitable plays out well however the resolution was disappointing too many unlikely escapes no development of the supporting cast and not enough <UNK> in my opinion this new show is outstanding and davies is taking it in a good direction but the dialogue beyond the doctor's needs to be <UNK> up as illustrate which were pure ham
<START> this first and hopefully not last wallace <UNK> feature lives up to expectations there are plenty of jokes some a bit <UNK> as well as some great <UNK> to past science fiction movies with the <UNK> of awful and formulaic movies being <UNK> forth from hollywood it's great to see such a great film like this that's enjoyable for almost everyone if there is any justice it will be top of the box office and be at least nominated for best animation at the next oscars the animation is wonderful the characters are remarkably <UNK> and their adventures are great fun this is one of those films that the whole family can enjoy charming clever fun and well made what's not to enjoy
<START> i saw this movie when it aired on lifetime back in 2004 i have never seen it since then but have thought of it often it left such an impression on me i've been searching for it lately i found it finally and realized it was made just for television the movie is fabulous filled with great writing and acting william <UNK> is perfect as always this movie left me speechless and in tears it's a wonderful story of faith love and compassion does anybody know how i can obtain a copy of this movie for my home is that possible with television movies i really would love to see it again this is a must have among my collection
<START> while i hold its predecessor fast times at <UNK> high as a standard to which other teen comedies should be compared the wild life is one of the better lesser known films from that time and a worthy sequel if you can call it that i believe its <UNK> reads from the makers of something even faster this definitely holds true though it may lack the depth of the former which <UNK> issues like first dates teen sex and <UNK> the wild life is nonetheless a great flick it's pure chaotic fun especially due to chris <UNK> over the top character thomas drake if was high on coke instead of <UNK> he would be drake eric <UNK> in his first major role is great as the straight laced bill conrad the two characters work well off one another think a younger <UNK> odd couple complete with 80's <UNK> outside of them there are so many other great things about this film worth mentioning <UNK> has never looked <UNK> especially during the scenes of her working at the <UNK> shop jenny wright is just <UNK> and fun to watch rick <UNK> plays a great nerd <UNK> who is dying to get in her pants thomas <UNK> wrestler buddies are hysterical especially benny the little puerto <UNK> guy who says some pretty memorable lines one in particular that he yells out during a night out at a strip club had me on the floor the first time i saw it that's saying something finally the movie ends with one of the best 80's party scenes on film ever look out for special appearances by ron wood of the rolling stones leo penn sean and chris <UNK> dad and a random michael jackson look alike at the party throw in a score by none other than the man himself eddie van <UNK> and you can't go wrong for van <UNK> fans keep your ears open for <UNK> that would be found on such albums as and for <UNK> <UNK> knowledge br br if anything <UNK> the flow of the movie it is a small subplot involving randy quaid as a burned out vietnam vet it just seems out of place and unnecessary other than that it's near perfect if your a fan of mindless but fun 80's movies and have not yet seen this one you're in for something special rent it now br br p s the credits say cameron <UNK> has a cameo as one of the cops in the film does he have his back turned during his scene because i have yet to find him someone please help me
<START> this movie truly shows the farce and <UNK> of indian society what it tries to show you is only one side of the story the other side of the story is the hidden emotional and mental abuse of indian children which this movie does not show br br indian parents are <UNK> for the following a destroying the <UNK> of the children by making them completely <UNK> on the parents at a very early age such children grow up to be adults only in physical looks but remain children in minds since everything has been provided to them by their great indian parents they children automatically do not feel the need to work hard at something or learn the <UNK> of human communication with other human beings apart from their parents br br b i can show you so many indian parents who try to prevent their kids making friends going out or prevent them to do anything which starts making them to grow into adults br br the reason why they do is the same <UNK> indian parents expect their children to take care of them when they grow old they do no <UNK> for themselves and once they reach the age of 50 they cry out loud we have grown old now and so we are <UNK> on you children since we have done the great service of bringing you to this world and taking care of you and making you intellectually weak br br most of the indian parents at the age of 50 have <UNK> bodies and health and are <UNK> completely insecure most feel that they absolutely have no need to take care of themselves since they expect their kids to take care of them br br in the west the opposite of that happens people start planning at the age of 20 about their retirement and once they <UNK> they are <UNK> secure br br indian parents do nothing of that sort since like i said they have brought the kids in the world and what better investment at that br br i am a victim of my indian parents i am sure there are countless other indian kids like me who have grown up physically but are still struggling with their lives on their own and they continue to have 50 year olds who cry out loud for help all the time br br this movie shows only one side of the story utter piece of junk
<START> this is an alright show to watch its not the best nor the worst i've watched it for a long time and i don't like any of the new stuff this show has changed into some teen trash and is living much differently i dislike that crap i have no iq why they completely changed the theme of this show the first season was really enjoyable to watch and is was partly amusing the 2nd season is just out of this world dumb i seriously don't know why the writers directors changed this show up many more people liked the 1st season better than the 2nd and 3rd i will only watch the first season of this show from now on whenever i see a new episode ill change the f <UNK> channel ya heard me it gets a 3 10 because i somewhat enjoyed the 1st season but hated the 2nd and 3rd
