<START> a man wakes from a nightmare about bats he and his wife go out into the desert for a <UNK> on their honeymoon he seems to hear a strange noise and she is disturbed by the sight of a bat <UNK> across their <UNK> <UNK> he wants to go on a tour of a cave which has something to do with some kind of work he is doing but she wants to enjoy their honeymoon she <UNK> they go on the tour but leave the group to make out she falls down a <UNK> where she is disturbed by insects he follows her he hears the strange noise again and seems to know a bat is approaching one does and gets in her hair he fights it off her and it attacks him biting his <UNK> br br they get out of the cave but when they are in a <UNK> at a <UNK> resort he starts having <UNK> in which he has hallucinations or visions of bats attacking people he becomes angry when this happens he's unable to drink alcohol without spitting it out his wife <UNK> about <UNK> and he starts a <UNK> treatment for that but <UNK> violently to the <UNK> br br and then some people are killed we see parts of the man's transformation into a bat person it seems it is not just in his mind whether the bat bite causes these <UNK> is not clear since he already was having some <UNK> prior to the bite br br while the title seems inappropriate the <UNK> at the end is that the same thing is happening to another person not a very good movie but i liked the variety of the desert cave and <UNK> <UNK> locations and some of the <UNK> scenes i didn't think this was as bad as other people do and i didn't think the 1999 movie bats was as bad as others think either i rated that one a 5 10
<START> this u s soap opera <UNK> <UNK> has all the entertainment value of being trapped in an elevator every episode contained plots such as rape murder kidnapping and drug <UNK> not much different to the plots of other drama shows of the period as for the cast i've seen better actors on a <UNK> box from the mid to late <UNK> repeats of <UNK> <UNK> up u k gold like a mountain of <UNK> <UNK> i regret to <UNK> that i had to suffer this as my mother was a huge fan of the show and would watch it <UNK> though since then re runs have been few and far between let's hope it stays that way the only positive thing that can be said of <UNK> is the catchy <UNK> signature tune later used as the title music for the i t v sitcom 'the upper <UNK> great legacy that eh
<START> kurosawa fresh into color <UNK> sight of his usual themes of truth and perception of reality and <UNK> for a depressing take on <UNK> <UNK> kurosawa stretches for a style that was in my opinion his <UNK> that is to say i feel as if kurosawa wanted to make an <UNK> picture poorly paced poorly conceived this movie is a rare dud in this auteur body of excellent work while <UNK> while being mundane and depressing was still interesting and well paced and while stray dog depicted the <UNK> and social poverty of japan without being too heavy handed or boring do <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has all the <UNK> that one could expect with its content with none of the redeeming qualities of earlier kurosawa pictures br br be warned this is not a movie that kurosawa should be judged by
<START> i had the distinct misfortune of catching up on two of <UNK> worst films back to back this morning first the incoherent cgi driven <UNK> of the chronicles of <UNK> and then the embarrassing vanity project known as <UNK> one cost <UNK> and the other cost <UNK> but they're both bad really really bad br br up front i should state i'm not the world's biggest neil young fan but he has contributed his share of classic tunes from buffalo <UNK> whose best <UNK> were young compositions to <UNK> never sleeps <UNK> and mirror ball the man has penned some really great songs sadly there are no great songs in <UNK> and precious few good ones and the film around which they are built is truly <UNK> and simplistic political <UNK> completely without merit as art and unimpressive as <UNK> <UNK> is best left forgotten buy the book if you feel compelled to contribute to <UNK> bank account
<START> on the surface the idea of omen 4 was good it's nice to see that the devil child could be a girl in fact sometimes as in the exorcist when girls are possessed or are <UNK> it's very effective but in omen 4 it <UNK> br br <UNK> does not make me think that she could be a devil child rather she is a child with issues issues that maybe only a <UNK> rather then a priest could help she does not look scary or <UNK> rather she looks <UNK> and moody br br this film had potential and if it was made by the same people who had made the previous three films it could of worked but it's rather insulting really to make a sequel to one of the most <UNK> horror <UNK> as a made for tv movie special br br on so many levels it lets down it's cheap looking the acting is <UNK> and the effects are typical of a tv drama the characters do not bring any sympathy and you do not route for them i recently re watched it after someone brought it for me for christmas and it has dated appalling br br if your thinking of watching this then i would suggest that you don't watch one of the others or watch the exorcist or watch the good son just don't waste your time on this drivel
<START> this is apparently the second remake of this film having been filmed before in <UNK> and <UNK> and in so many ways it reminds me of the later film a <UNK> at <UNK> both films concern a <UNK> blow hard who arrives at one of the top schools in the world and both ultimately show the blow hard slowly learning about <UNK> and decency in this film william haines is tom brown and his main rival bob is played by frances x <UNK> and in a supporting role is jack pickford always remembered as the brother of mary of these three pickford comes off the best as the sympathetic loser who becomes <UNK> pal he actually has a few decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the big game all the standard clich√©s are there and the movie because it was done so many times before and since offers few surprises however it is pleasant film and is enjoyable viewing br br in my opinion for a better silent college film try harold <UNK> the <UNK> it's football scenes are frankly more exciting and harold is far more likable and sympathetic than the annoying tom brown the <UNK> is probably the best college picture you can find from the era another reason why brown at <UNK> is a lesser picture is that william haines played essentially the same unlikable and <UNK> character with the same plot again and again and again such as in <UNK> and the smart set among others and if you've seen one of these films you've seen them all well made but certainly not original and because it is just a rehash of his other films anyone giving the film a score of 10 is strongly advised to see these other films br br 4 25 <UNK> i just checked and saw this this small film was the highest rated film on imdb from the <UNK> talk about over rated there are dozens and dozens of better films how this film got to be 1 is anyone's guess
<START> oh my from the box description i thought it would be la crazy like 2 days in the valley or hugo pool <UNK> <UNK> must be a very strong man most after directing this would have driven off a cliff or at least committed a mass murder i confess to only watching the first half hour for now reading all the comments here i have a lot to look forward to professional reviews often mention the swedish film songs from the second floor as a parallel but that's <UNK> with humor and fantasy and this is <UNK> in its <UNK> realism what <UNK> the marshall plan and the <UNK> <UNK> seeing this in a theater with anyone i know would have only resulted in an <UNK> departure after many fewer minutes than i got through on dvd there's a more annoying creature in the universe than jar jar <UNK> the <UNK> from hell whatever happens to her it isn't enough soulless <UNK> that i thought only existed in arizona and florida <UNK> in lower <UNK> oh no i thought sex <UNK> had <UNK> to exist even in new york and san francisco and here they are in suburban shopping <UNK> was it <UNK> gandhi or <UNK> <UNK> who said when asked about western civilization <UNK> that might be a nice <UNK> if the world were truly like this film bring on that black hole we're ready
<START> where to start the film started out pretty well but after the 30 min mark i caught myself watching the clock the horror at the start of the film was good but then the story kicked in it just got <UNK> and <UNK> as time <UNK> by br br the actors gave an average performance in this movie however i got a bit bored of <UNK> jones constant <UNK> in the film br br as the film dragged on and take my word for it it dragged on it just got more and more far fetched br br spoiler alert spoiler alert spoiler alert just when i thought the film could not get any worse towards the end loads if <UNK> looking monsters turned up just to eat the dead people which made no sense at all it turned out to be some sort of flesh eating cult and the good guys die at the end the ending in fact just made me laugh at how bad it was once the lead role <UNK> of <UNK> jones he becomes the new killer br br in closing this film made creep look like the best horror film ever made i gave it 1 star because the female lead did a pretty good job but even she could not save this train wreck of a movie
<START> i read the book and saw the movie both excellent the movie is diamond among <UNK> during this era <UNK> and <UNK> dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of their characters without flaw this film should have made them stars shame on the studio for not putting everything they had behind this film it could have easily been a franchise release on dvd is a must and a worthy remake would revive this film look for it in your tv guide and if you see it listed no matter how late watch it you won't be disappointed do yourself another favor read the book same title it'll blow you away times have changed dramatically since those days or at least we like to think they have
<START> i think the majority of the people seem not the get the right idea about the movie at least that's my opinion i am not sure it's a movie about drug abuse rather it's a movie about the way of thinking of those genius brothers drugs are side effects something <UNK> again it's not a commercial movie that you see every day and if the author wanted that he definitely failed as most people think it's one of the many drug related movies i however think something else is the case as in many movies portraying different cultures audience usually fully understands movies portraying their own culture i e something they've grown up with and are quite familiar with this movie is to show what those genius people very often think and what problems they face the reason why they act like this is because they are bored out of their minds they have to meet people who do mediocre things and accept those things as if they are <UNK> space <UNK> on daily basis they start a fairly hard job and <UNK> in no time they feel like i went to work did nothing still did twice as better as the guys around me when they were all over their projects what should i do now with my free time and what's even more boring when you can start <UNK> behavior not because you're psychologist but instead because you have seen this pattern in the past so for them from one side it's a non challenging job which is also fairly boring sometimes and from another they start to figure out people's behavior it's a recipe for big big boredom and the dumbest things are usually done to get out of this state they guy earlier who mentioned that their biggest problem is that they are trying to figure out life in terms of logic <UNK> describes logic while life is not really a logical thing is actually absolutely right
<START> an incoherent mess with a <UNK> <UNK> sound track soul survivors is the latest entry in the who's dead and who's alive genre of horror films two <UNK> couples sean and cassie and matt and <UNK> prepare to go off to different <UNK> but before they part until <UNK> break they attend one last <UNK> at a rave type party in some burnt out church at the suggestion of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a k a faith the other vampire <UNK> <UNK> creepy guys start paying far too much attention to cassie the generic melissa <UNK> for reasons that are never explained and before long the <UNK> leave the party driving away in their <UNK> they are pursued and then passed by the <UNK> creepy guys who promptly and inexplicably do an intentional <UNK> in the middle of the highway causing a nasty and fatal accident as the <UNK> <UNK> over an <UNK> and <UNK> into a river sean is killed or is he and cassie spends the rest of the movie <UNK> with loneliness and guilt she was driving when she's not being haunted by <UNK> ghost or chased by those <UNK> creepy guys much unexplained <UNK> follows as <UNK> mental state <UNK> further until we reach the predictable conclusion so who is dead and who is alive after ninety minutes of this <UNK> who actually cares
<START> a beautiful movie especially if you like horses wwii films and the <UNK> hungarian <UNK> a story of courage compassion and loyalty that <UNK> generations the <UNK> is spectacular as well as the main characters' horse in his own training br br i will buy this movie and watch it again this is a family film and i recommend it highly a good <UNK> <UNK> movie although there are some violent scenes it was the nazi <UNK> of <UNK> the native people were very interesting in the way they stood their ground even in the face of certain death from a nazi officer who had his own personal reasons for hunting down brady a <UNK> beautiful film
<START> this movie was packed pull of endless surprises just when you thought it couldn't get worse they added more <UNK> and more pink fuzzy <UNK> <UNK> with raunchy sex scenes as you can guess i was a victim of the original version we were tricked into watching it thinking it was <UNK> the host box which promised <UNK> jail breaks and much more who would have thought a dollar store christmas present could have been so much fun
<START> not only is it a <UNK> made low budget bad acted movie but the plot itself is just stupid br br a <UNK> man that eats women and by the looks not virgin ones br br ridiculous if <UNK> got nothing better to do like sleeping you should watch this yeah right
<START> worst movie of all time wow <UNK> now you cannot be serious br br maybe it's all about what you expect a movie to do to you i live in <UNK> so i got to enjoy the beautifully filmed shots of familiar yet still amazingly beautiful smith rocks and other areas in central <UNK> as well as the sweet cameo of our own ken <UNK> and ken <UNK> looking down on baby <UNK> cradle at the beginning of the movie those alone were enough to <UNK> me to give the movie a better than average score br br or maybe it's all about what expectations you have having read the book ages ago and thinking to myself goodness no one could ever make a movie out of this interesting quirky weird book especially 20 years later when <UNK> <UNK> can't put in the accent mark online have changed i was actually quite pleasantly surprised when i first watched the movie when it came out in 1994 and even liked it more today watching it again br br sissy was <UNK> cast and i don't care what you all say i was also pleasantly surprised at rain <UNK> and john <UNK> performances i am not a lesbian nor <UNK> nor <UNK> but have met many folks who are similar to the folks they were supposed to portray and those real folks kinda acted the same way as these actors acted stilted a bit stage <UNK> always a bit on gus van <UNK> is one weird native <UNK> but by <UNK> he done a good job adapting this crazy book imho
<START> the plot of this terrible film is so convoluted i've put the spoiler warning up because i'm unsure if i'm giving anything away the audience first sees some man in jack the <UNK> <UNK> murder an old man in an alley a hundred years ago then we're up to modern day and a young australian couple is looking for a house we're given an unbelievably long tour of this house and the husband sees a figure in an old mirror some <UNK> year old woman lived there there are also large iron <UNK> covering a wall in the <UNK> an old fashioned straight razor falls out when they're <UNK> and the husband keeps it i guess he becomes possessed by the razor because he starts having weird dreams oh yeah the couple is unable to have a baby because the husband is firing <UNK> br br some mold seems to be climbing up the wall after the couple <UNK> the iron <UNK> and the mold has the shape of a person late in the story there is a plot about a large <UNK> of money the husband murders the body guard a co worker and steals the money his wife is suddenly pregnant br br what the hell is going on who knows nothing is explained was the <UNK> year old woman the child of the serial killer the baby sister why were iron <UNK> put on the wall how would that keep the serial killer contained in the <UNK> was he locked down there by his family <UNK> to death or just <UNK> who is mr <UNK> and why is he so desperate to get the iron <UNK> he's never seen again why was the serial killer killing people we only see the one old man murdered was there a pattern or motive or something why does the wife suddenly become pregnant is it the demon <UNK> of the serial killer has he managed to <UNK> the husband's <UNK> and why if the husband was able to <UNK> and murder a huge <UNK> security guard is he unable to <UNK> his wife and just how powerful is the <UNK> system in australia that it would knock him across the room simply cutting a light wire and why does the wife stay in the house is she now possessed by the serial killer is the baby going to be the killer <UNK> br br this movie was such a frustrating experience i wanted to call my <UNK> station and ask for my money back the only enjoyable aspect of this story was seeing the husband running around in just his boxer shorts for a lot of the time but even that couldn't redeem this muddled incoherent mess
<START> this movie is so <UNK> the main character looks like he's 35 and i've seen <UNK> <UNK> with more balls than this guy the plot twists are so predictable its not even worth watching for the humor factor br br also some of the worst dialogue i've heard in 3 years lets go find a small animal to torture br br ugh i can't even continue don't watch this pile of garbage it was made in 8 days br br the one highlight is the drunk dude calling the main character a <UNK> for drawing pictures br br 2 out of 10 unwatchable
<START> i can't really think of any redeeming features of this utterly bad rendering on <UNK> than the art direction forget the product placement disaster the unconvincing performance from will smith and the <UNK> plot holes this wasn't only laughable and but painful to watch even the action was boring a mixture of mtv inspired production values and utterly bad dialogue probably aimed at very small children br br what a shame that sci fi this bad can still be made after we've had <UNK> minority report or to a lesser extent dark city by the same director this one really belongs in the bottom 100 list truly awful
<START> i first saw this film when i was about seven years old and was completely enchanted by it then but for years was unable to find out what the film was called now i am twenty one and stumbled upon the film by accident about two weeks ago and bought a copy although my memory of the film was a little <UNK> i was in no way disappointed by what i saw the animation in this film is superb <UNK> up an entire world that is so believable and so well animated that you are drawn in to the film by that alone but this film also has a plot that will <UNK> and entertain adults and children alike with a floating island a mad general a friendly pirate <UNK> and a well constructed love story this film will not let you down i would recommend this film to any one
<START> i have spent the last week watching john cassavetes films starting with 'a woman under the <UNK> and ending on <UNK> <UNK> i am completely and utterly blown away in particular by these two films from the first minute to the last in <UNK> <UNK> i was completely and utterly absorbed i've only experienced it on a few occasions but the feeling that this film was perfect lasted from about two thirds in right through till the credits came up everything about this film from the way it was shot the incredible performance of gena rowlands the credits the opening the music the plot the sense of depth the pace the <UNK> the originality the characters the <UNK> little moments for me is truly sublime i couldn't agree more with the previous comment about taking it to a desert island because the sheer depth of this film is something to behold if your unlucky enough to have a house fire i guarantee that instead of making a last <UNK> attempt to rescue that <UNK> of money under your bed you'll be <UNK> your copy of this film instead
<START> i bought this game on an <UNK> buy from <UNK> i am glad i did it was very entertaining listening to sean connery and playing the game i thought the graphics were the best i have ever seen in a movie game remake the bonus levels were very hard the sniper one i think was too hard it made me so frustrated i didn't play the game for a week and a half there were too many people shooting at you with nothing to hide behind or life to handle it br br the only thing i might change was the <UNK> system i didn't notice any difference from un <UNK> equipment to the <UNK> such as buying an armor <UNK> didn't seem to make the armor stronger or more filling on my life <UNK> i really liked the q <UNK> i think the <UNK> did a good job
<START> i haven't seen this film in years so my knowledge is a little rusty i do remember thinking that this film is twice the film of braveheart it is simply more realistic and has more believable characters <UNK> roy looks like one would imagine rob roy to look like messy hair and beard with simple clothing also the liam <UNK> has a <UNK> look about him he looks like a <UNK> and more importantly looks like rob roy it's a comparison which <UNK> some people but compare him to mel gibson as william wallace gibson is supposedly playing a man who's legend has caused him to be described as a 6 foot 7 giant while gibson is almost a foot shorter the story contains a little romance conspiracy and an underdog story sound anything like braveheart but instead of a film that cries out freedom liberty and <UNK> we get a film which says honour love and justice this makes it a more interesting film much like gladiator the cast is fantastic and liam <UNK> is a very strong leader in this <UNK> the story is great with how it deals with <UNK> and humanity the scene where mary is raped and she walks out of the burning house with a look of true scottish strength is followed by her <UNK> the <UNK> from her <UNK> in an extreme panic this is something a heroine in braveheart would never do overall this is a stunning and almost flawless watch go and see it
<START> <UNK> this is one of the worst films iv ever seen and iv seen a lot i'm a film student i don't understand why angelina jolie would be in this movie did she need the money that badly i love <UNK> and have seen almost everything <UNK> ever been in so i watched this 2 <UNK> another one off it was <UNK> bad not even good bad just bad bad it had 1 or 2 funny little moments but all in all it was bad n a waste of 101 minutes i cant even say <UNK> looked good in it because well she didn't the plot is predictable unless you r expecting a re telling of romeo and juliet then its not all round disappointing maybe if your 12 this could be a good film otherwise i really don't recommend it
<START> sorry to go against the flow but i thought this film was unrealistic boring and way too long i got tired of watching gena rowlands long <UNK> battle with herself and the crisis she was experiencing maybe the film has some cinematic value or represented an important step for the director but for pure entertainment value i wish i would have <UNK> it
<START> if you're not in the mood for more than an hour long movie than this film could give you some variation what i love is the ongoing surprises it's not only once that you want one or more of the short film in <UNK> york i love <UNK> to be continue yeah some of the short films makes you curious some of them very short some of them longer some of them has it definite ends some of them don't br br most of the story presents the sad side of the capital city it shows many different <UNK> background many of it make it feels the same way where i have been once went to a capital city in other countries for a year where it has many people came from different countries this movie explore many type of things you might have known but for all the characters it's a new things maybe some of you have traveled abroad alone to stay for a year or two just to feel something new meet new people feel dreamy sad but the kind of sad you looking for because it is just that bored you were in your own home you might want to <UNK> it again by watching this
<START> this movie is another one on my list of movies not to bother with saw it 40 years ago as an adolescent stayed up late to do so was very annoyed to find that it was about 95 romance 4 everything else 1 history if that it's what i call a bait and switch movie one with an interesting title the actual movie is a <UNK> this is a subject which deserves a good cinematic treatment this movie is almost an insult to those who served the actual members of the <UNK> <UNK> were not on the run from the law nor were they the products of abusive homes they were in reality <UNK> who wanted to do something to help france and i suspect many of them came from a more upper class background than <UNK> <UNK> character flying school is not for the smart <UNK> and the know it <UNK> an individual such as the one portrayed here wouldn't have lasted two days it would have either been the <UNK> or the <UNK> discipline in the french army was often rather fierce in short another <UNK> version of an historical episode that deserves proper treatment
<START> this movie certainly proves that also the good americans can do terribly good propaganda no questions being asked no comments being made on power abuse or police terror when james stewart solid and convincing as always <UNK> all the stories from dillinger to <UNK> <UNK> more or less <UNK> june <UNK> as his regular love interest holds up the family values and e j hoover is executive producer and children or non guilty <UNK> are never <UNK> when the professionals <UNK> not to speak of civil rights which are never broken or homes which are never <UNK> and if the fbi service would not be enough <UNK> also gives his son's life for the country in <UNK> ii perfectly made if you wouldn't know better
<START> why a stupid boring crappy overrated film series like star wars gets all the hype and a truly amazing film like this one goes completely un noticed is beyond me this movie will really open your eyes to the dark disturbing sad and scary world we live in br br unlike the boring elephant this movie isn't one of those just a typical day until <UNK> pulls the trigger movies this movie focuses more on what happens after the event br br <UNK> played by the very hot and very talented erika christensen is a happy and healthy straight a student with great friends and a great life until she is injured on the day of the shooting by being shot in the head luckily she is not killed but is severely injured and has to be in the hospital for a while causing her to be in a lot of emotional pain in addition to the physical br br meanwhile alicia played by the also very gorgeous and talented busy phillips is a nasty cold hearted rebellious anti social <UNK> girl who doesn't have a single positive <UNK> on her and she is <UNK> when the shooting happens because it turns out she was friends with the <UNK> and knew he was going to do what he did which causes her to be brought into the police station and be asked some questions when she refuses to tell the cops if she knew the shooting was going to happen they constantly come by her house to try to convince her to say something and she still doesn't so the principal of the school makes her attend a funeral of one of the dead students and after she walks out on that the principal decides enough is enough and forces her to go visit <UNK> in the hospital of course she refuses this too but the principal says that if alicia doesn't do this the cops are going to continue to try to get her to say something and so she actually goes to see her br br the lonely traumatized and both physically and emotionally wounded <UNK> is more than happy to have someone visit her but of course alicia is anything but happy to be seeing her <UNK> attempts to give her a friendly welcome but of course alicia responds with nothing but harsh and <UNK> comments and a harsh statement on how she is only here because she is being forced and has no intention of being friendly with her at all but sooner or later that intention will change and that's all i'll say this is truly one of the most moving movies ever as well as one of the most dark and disturbing actually i think i would tie this with american history x as equally disturbing and moving at the same time br br warning watch this movie at your own risk it contains very graphic scenes and images excellent and criminally under appreciated movie i feel so ashamed that i'm pretty much the only one that knows about it
<START> excellent film i cried when she cried i loved when they loved i was frustrated when they were this film touched my heart it was a reality check for me since this is reality for me a 19 year old soldier
<START> the next time you are at a party and someone asks the other day i heard the expression <UNK> <UNK> does anyone know what it means tell them to sit through <UNK> above <UNK> the only way diaz could possibly have survived this movie was by means of this literary device <UNK> used by bad writers there are some comic scenes and you will have a few laughs however the film does not stand up to the most minor logical analysis why does keitel tie <UNK> hand in front of her instead of behind why so she can do the chainsaw gag of course for me the best part of this movie was that i saw it on a cable channel instead of spending four bucks at the video shop
<START> anyone new to the incredibly prolific takashi miike's work might want to think twice about making this startling film their first experience of this truly maverick director in keeping with miike's working practice of taking any work that comes his way and then <UNK> his own sensibilities onto the script this is at heart a fairly basic <UNK> thriller with a morally ambiguous cop chasing a gang which his lawyer brother has fallen in with what takes the movie out of the <UNK> of the same old same old however is the utterly <UNK> attitude so some of the most sudden and horrific violence seen in today's cinema and this isn't that nice cool clean violence so beloved of us cinema this stuff is nasty painful and hurts that said the pace is <UNK> the characters are unusual without being just being <UNK> with stock <UNK> miike's sense of humour reveals itself and the most unexpected moments and his camera is never quite where you expect it to be making it hard to look away from the screen whatever he might be showing you it doesn't have the <UNK> ending of dead or alive but if you're not <UNK> <UNK> the time to get on board the miike <UNK> before he ends up on some hollywood <UNK> new john woo shopping list
<START> arthur bach needs to grow up but that is unfortunately not the only thing he needs to do according to his extremely rich father arthur has to marry a certain wealthy susan johnson or he's cut off from the family money <UNK> million dollars worth the problem is arthur doesn't love susan though i hear she makes some good chicken and has just fallen head over heels for the waitress and part time shop <UNK> linda <UNK> arthur is an interesting fellow he's really just a big kid born into <UNK> with at least one person looking after him every second of every day working just <UNK> arthur the wrong way he likes to have fun <UNK> and of course drink drinking gives arthur a sort of <UNK> and hyde complex and while that gets him into all sorts of trouble it's absolutely hilarious to watch on screen br br dudley moore is great here in this film as arthur <UNK> an oscar nomination and golden globe win for his performance moore is fantastic with the comedic aspects of the film turning the already funny lines into unforgettable comedic gold but he is also great in bringing arthur down to a <UNK> level and making the character likable moore has some help in the co star department <UNK> minnelli is great as <UNK> the spirited nobody who arthur can't get enough of and john gielgud is terrific as <UNK> butler <UNK> gielgud won the best supporting actor oscar for his performance in this film and there's no <UNK> why <UNK> has a stone solid dry wit and stuck up attitude but he's always looking out for arthur and gielgud is perfect in the role steve <UNK> 1981 film arthur is short and simple but delivers laughs a plenty
<START> as a horror movie fan i try to watch all significant <UNK> of this genre especially those which are the products of my native cinema and i can say that that the power of fear or <UNK> as the russian title of it is one of the weakest film among them firstly it can't scary even a little kid it <UNK> so slowly and so predictable that there is no place for the real horror frankly speaking it's bad in all points from the goofy plot i don't know why the russian producers director decided to <UNK> the classic story about <UNK> witchcraft into some lame and ridiculous modern day america thriller i absolutely agree with the previous reviewer ¬ñ it doesn't thrill a bit and to the terrible and cheesy actors' work all actors including the leading <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> who are quite famous in russia look like wooden dolls or something like that and it seems to me they didn't even bother to play at all only spoke their english lines without any expression and at the end i don't really understand why they filmed this flick in english with russian actors i think it was their wrong turn at least they could cast some american or english actors for the leading parts to make them look more convincing the same i can say about so called small american town backgrounds which were shot in <UNK> and look like it the only positive moment i found in the power of fear is the visual effects they are not excellent but rather good for the russian film and the music is ok at least it doesn't <UNK> me that's why i give it two stars overall if you want to see good horror film ¬ñ don't waste your time and money on this boring flick and if you are looking for something that claims to be a russian horror i'd advise you to find a copy of <UNK> or the spirit of evil it's really the terrific movie based on the same novel as power of fear but much much better
<START> gotta start with ed <UNK> on this one you gotta god bless this kid 5 bucks says the character he plays in this film is what he's really like in real life he has a one liner or two that made me almost blow <UNK> because of the subtle humor in the script you know all the trials this guy has gone through in recent years and it doesn't even seem like <UNK> is even acting maybe that's why his performance was good same with madsen you keep thinking i bet this guy is really like this in real life does madsen even have to act just natural <UNK> has obviously moved on from the type casted mummy guy i think the biggest surprise to this film was <UNK> <UNK> performance her reactions are spot on in this film i <UNK> if she was hot or not but realized i would just like to see more of her br br not a big fan of shoot 'em out hostage type films but what i am a fan of are films with lots of twists and turns to try and keep you guessing it's not just your standard robbers take over a bank they kill <UNK> and the good guys win in the end type of film the twists keep on coming and coming br br the <UNK> scenes work best with the hand held <UNK> to show what it's really like in there not <UNK> over a bit think like bourne ultimatum <UNK> style on some scenes in the <UNK> br br and for those bo <UNK> fanatics out there actor curtis wayne who plays karl will make you do a double take these guys are twins br br as i watched i wondered why some of the actors had foreign accents and what were they doing in this small town made sense in the end that these people <UNK> stuff to other countries states so they might have these accents but more is revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this film for international audiences with some of their stars we might not have heard of and some of them are smoking hot <UNK> dean need i say more
<START> there is so much to love in this darling little comedy anyone who has ever built or bought a house or even just been short of space will find that there is more than just a grain of truth in the plight of the <UNK> mr <UNK> melvyn douglas with great comedic <UNK> both <UNK> and acts as the <UNK> attorney and voice of reason as well myrna loy is at her best as a rather <UNK> but extremely patient wife but the best performance is <UNK> he is the american <UNK> especially relevant at the time of this film's release when the nation was in the grips of a <UNK> <UNK> after the end of the war the themes are universal lack of money work strain fear of infidelity yes it does wrap up awfully neatly but you must keep in mind that this was a time when the world was just recovering from a terrible war and wanted a happy ending it is still relevant today and i must <UNK> up the poor reviews i see to a present <UNK> for <UNK> down gross out comedies the look of the film is slick and there are some great bits of comedy is well particularly toward the beginning while it may have lost some of it's social relevance nearly sixty years after it's release it is still a gem
<START> this is a delightful movie that is so over the top that my wife daughter and i found it irresistible the plot is just crazy but rings true to the world of soap operas in all its outrageous <UNK> and <UNK> br br i particularly enjoyed kevin <UNK> and sally <UNK> performances i don't anyone better than kline at playing <UNK> <UNK> character's truly desperate need for attention and <UNK> and her almost <UNK> <UNK> in mood played nicely against the background of <UNK> famous infamous you like me oscar <UNK> people who can take themselves with such a large grain of salt are all too rare in this world br br i think this is the only movie where i didn't find myself <UNK> with whoopi goldberg characterization i thought she was spot on in every note she struck robert downey jr <UNK> <UNK> cathy <UNK> and elizabeth <UNK> were also first rate as well just a great movie if you're in the mood to go along for the ride and laugh
<START> only the chosen ones will appreciate the quality of the story and character design of this movie superior <UNK> that <UNK> in the lands of <UNK> far beyond any average human <UNK> understanding this movie pulls the adventure genre into a unique <UNK> magical force of fantasy <UNK> <UNK> mystical <UNK> of <UNK> stories come and go but the idea for a good story is to think positive not negative thoughts to create a good versus evil battle like never before <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK> process that keeps imagination glowing in one dimension and out the other striking a quick flash of energy that <UNK> a human to another world
<START> not only was this movie better than all the final season of h lots but it was better than any movie made for tv i have ever seen br br looking at the top 250 i see that only one small screen movie has made it how the grinch stole christmas i think it is time to increase that group to 2 br br i will admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this but i didn't mind i just loved being able to enter the world of the <UNK> homicide squad again
<START> although some may call it a cuban cinema <UNK> the movie is closer to a how green was my valley a memory film mourning for a lost innocence the film <UNK> avoids falling into a political trap of taking sides pro castro anti castro focusing instead in the human <UNK> of the characters and the importance of family filled with good acting in particular from mexican actress diana <UNK> who plays <UNK> wife a masterpiece filled with references to classic movies from casablanca to <UNK> city lights <UNK> garcia <UNK> plays a small role which is critical for the dramatic payoff of the story tv director <UNK> <UNK> brown in a rare return to acting remember the <UNK> plays a homeless bum who acts as greek chorus superbly it is a pity that this movie originally titled dreaming of julia has been released in the states by <UNK> with the atrocious title of cuban blood which has nothing to do with the movie
<START> i spent almost two hours watching a movie that i thought with all the good actors in it would be worth watching i couldn't believe it when the movie ended and i had absolutely no idea what had happened i was mad because i could have used that time doing something else i tried to figure it all out but really had no clue thanks to those who figured it out and have explained it right or wrong it's better than not knowing anything who was the lady in the movie with dark hair that we saw a couple of times driving away how did first lady know that her husband was cheating on her at the end of the movie kate said she would eventually find out the truth does this mean that we're going to be subjected to end game 2
<START> jack lemmon and walter matthau began and ending their career together remember best as the <UNK> of old men as well as the <UNK> couple to have ever made us laugh lemmon and matthau were one of hollywood's best loved comedy teams of the last 100 years not as raunchy as <UNK> and wilder instead they were the classic comedy team that reflected a more modern marx brothers routine such as the physical comedy as well as the mixed blend of chaos that marx chaplin and keaton were so famous for in the odd couple lemmon and matthau play complete <UNK> that create the chaos the physical comedy is as unique as <UNK> the joke is usually on themselves as <UNK> to passing the joke onto another not your typical guy film it is in a way a coming of age comedy with two old men as <UNK> to two young teenagers in their prime the chemistry between lemmon and matthau is entertainment enough although this movie isn't for everyone this is a great comedy
<START> i have to vote this 10 out of 10 in the rare chance that she happens to see this review takes pity on me <UNK> me to hollywood and involves me in her freaky funny world but in all seriousness it was good first episode is obviously finding it's feet but it's got that silverman weirdness running all the way through it it's not a laugh out loud sort of comedy but that's good thing too much has a laughter track to it and this wouldn't be right with <UNK> when to laugh it's to the audience to hear their inner <UNK> laughing at the <UNK> of it all i can easily see this as being the <UNK> drew carey show with it's weird characters and incredibly strong central character well worth a watch look forward to the following episodes a very good chance from the usual comedy out there br br ps sarah call me
<START> the idea is a very smart title the film has a serious tongue in cheek feel to it but it is so subtle you don't know how to read it are these guys doing a full blown comedy or is there something else going on the little dialogue the film has isn't very delicate and this adds to the power of the film if all the sound was switched off from the film it actually wouldn't take anything away from the film the physical actions or the art of showing is so strong that it on its own carries the entirety of the story br br i is a <UNK> and with the <UNK> the emotion is followed by shame i first say this film as part of a black film festival after watching the film i was so impressed by the work but then i asked myself what next where can someone else see this work the common association of art without purpose isn't to be found here you can see the intention in the design from the start to the finish the usage of african music the style the casting everything seems planned and for a reason the character development is amazing the casting i think is the strongest aspect of the film the characters are easily defined within 2 minutes of the 6 minutes of actual film br br we need to see more of these kinds of films there really needs to be greater support for the development of short films across the board
<START> it's funny when you stop and think about it fright film fans tend to a deep and <UNK> affection toward those who scare the <UNK> out of them the texas chainsaw massacre may give us nightmares but who among us the faithful didn't feel a very real <UNK> of love for <UNK> <UNK> in brutal massacre or for ken <UNK> forever and ever the <UNK> hero of the original dawn of the dead his cameo in the remake made me want to stand up and cheer as did tom <UNK> cameo i kid you not and brian <UNK> and well you get my drift if not just stand <UNK> these are some of the heroes of horror to see this many of them gathered together in a single movie is almost <UNK> of at least to this degree to my knowledge if only the writer s had been up to such a monumental task maybe someone else somewhere along the line will try again as long as it's not another half hearted effort like <UNK> of blood for instance
<START> when i saw this movie i was amazed that it was only a tv movie i think this movie should have been in theaters i have seen many movies that are about rape but this one stands out this movie has a kind of realism that is very rarely found in movies today let alone tv movies it tells a story that i'm sure is very realistic to many rape victims in small towns today and i found it to be very believable which is something hard to find in other rape centered movies i also thought that <UNK> <UNK> and brian austin green were awesome in the parts that they played i definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies that have a bit of a harsh reality to them i enjoyed it very much
<START> <UNK> <UNK> best known for the <UNK> films again stars in this third and final movie in the <UNK> <UNK> mostly known for lone wolf and <UNK> directed saga of hanzo 'the <UNK> <UNK> feature the big <UNK> one battling ninjas <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> shady goings on at the <UNK> <UNK> the hanzo <UNK> was kinda getting stale and repetitive what was once novel in the first film was not any longer fortunately this one was better then the second thanks to having more humor i'm just glad that they choose to stop at the one trilogy i'm looking at you lucas br br my grade b br br dvd extras merely trailers for all 3 hanzo the razor films br br eye candy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> both tits <UNK> <UNK> just her left one
<START> so has it really come to this are we as <UNK> adults to blame for the next generation of cinema goers lack of cinematic understanding and celluloid <UNK> concerning the wayans and co latest addition to the moving pictures scenario little man this united kingdom p g <UNK> <UNK> anyone under the age of twelve must be accompanied by a responsible adult <UNK> movie is the epitome of what has now developed into the worse case of <UNK> down since <UNK> were wiped out from pictures of movie icons of the 1950's br br the <UNK> under <UNK> audience here who some without grown up <UNK> too sat there <UNK> taking it all in oblivious to their subject and the partly grown up features that little man portrays in part at least too movies in general can do better than this poor attempt while this nonsense is getting them in while they are still young and fresh the biggest fear for the future of cinema is that a child's ignorance just might carry on through to a grown up bliss cinema deserves more than this and so do its ever growing and in the literal sense too audiences this blatant cash cow <UNK> on the ever <UNK> minds of the young br br there is no cinema experience here no open eyed wonder no awe inspiring respect to the magic of <UNK> there is nothing but <UNK> and contempt for the lack of substance originality and its delivery of mind less tedium and parody of everything that is so now ultimately wrong with the hollywood machine for the sake of a quick buck we must endure our future cinema audiences to the likes of this <UNK> disaster movie br br will this have the likes of hitchcock fassbinder <UNK> kubrick and <UNK> <UNK> in their graves money they all liked no doubt but talent and <UNK> for perfection and quality and to a vast degree respect for their profession and audience they were never short off we are seeing once again with the works of the wayans clan another clich√© of bad taste while the likes of white chicks 2004 were in no doubt a stab at the <UNK> of american society the irony here is that the two leading protagonists played yet again by the wayans brothers are so much undercover that all recognition is non existent this makes for a better movie too and it is the actor terry <UNK> that gives white chicks its substance and personality not the wayans br br yet again with their <UNK> of 1970's <UNK> movies as with the 1988 movie i'm gonna <UNK> you <UNK> this to can be seen as a comical and amusing movie with heavy <UNK> as <UNK> hayes jim brown <UNK> <UNK> and the gorgeous actress <UNK> du <UNK> the point being that little man has absolutely no persona of any kind what so ever he is shallow and <UNK> with no appreciation or value toward his followers he quickly <UNK> in takes your money and before we know it has hidden himself within the <UNK> of <UNK> there is no <UNK> effort as to where our money has been spent after scary movie 2000 things could only have gone up but alas they did not no great <UNK> of artistic value and no doubt that the <UNK> from these <UNK> movie <UNK> next movies shall be straight to video one can only hope br br the wayans seem to have created a movie genre all by themselves to a certain extent they have <UNK> to death the movie parody they have watered down each and every <UNK> and with their inevitable style they have slowly destroyed the reputation of the last one hundred years that cinema have given us may the ghosts of movies past be ever so humble in their judgement as their growing audiences so far seem to be for when the bubble bursts may they be as understanding too
<START> aside from a few titles and the new sherlock holmes movie i think i've watched every movie guy ritchie has directed twice needless to say i'm a big fan and revolver is one of the <UNK> reasons why this movie is a very different approach from ritchie when you look at it <UNK> with lock stock and snatch revolver sets us up for a psychological thriller of sorts as a gambling con finds himself at the mercy of a set of <UNK> he didn't expect and a guided walk for redemption that he didn't know he needed along with seeing <UNK> benjamin of <UNK> fame <UNK> his acting ability other standout acts are ray liotta playing the <UNK> mr d <UNK> and mark strong playing <UNK> the hit man br br after being sent to prison by a <UNK> casino owner <UNK> jake uses his time in <UNK> to <UNK> a plot to <UNK> <UNK> and force his hand in <UNK> him for the seven years he spent when he wins a card game and <UNK> a decent sum from <UNK> jake finds himself on the brink of death as he <UNK> and is <UNK> with an <UNK> disease that's left him with three days to live a team of <UNK> sharks however have an answer for him and a ticket to life only if he gives them all the money he has and <UNK> to working for them all in a <UNK> to both take <UNK> down and show jake how dangerous he has made himself to himself along with having the air of death <UNK> and a pair of <UNK> sharks having a field day with his money jake also has to deal with having a hit put out on him which introduces <UNK> a hit man under <UNK> employ the depth with the story comes when jake realizes that some co <UNK> he spent time with in <UNK> may very well be the <UNK> shark team out to take him for all he has by <UNK> all of the unfortunate events that jake seems to find his way into when faced with this reality though <UNK> vincent <UNK> and <UNK> show jake just how twisted he has become from being in <UNK> having only the company of his mind and his ego then makes it so that their actual existence is <UNK> even to jake the movie <UNK> to a <UNK> process for both jake and <UNK> as they both come to grips with their inner demons br br the style of the movie is top notch as you get the gritty feel of the crime world represented and the characters it includes although a lot of <UNK> at <UNK> previous films are here it still has a presence of its own from the dialogue the sets and the experimental take on the gangster genre it's also a great trip on <UNK> and <UNK> when you can easily let your ego or a <UNK> notion mask you ability to accomplish what you want or overcome what you should the characters are well crafted in this movie with all sides being fleshed out and true to ritchie fashion they're all tied in by some <UNK> that throws a <UNK> in everyone's affairs i could and would like to go on about this film and its unique nuances but i don't want to take too much away from it if you haven't seen it yet br br it may take a few <UNK> to get through all the intricate layers but it's a great movie and it should be seen if you're lucky and you haven't seen the watered down us release see if you can get the original uk version as it will make for a great discussion piece among friends as you try to puzzle in your take i saw it with my crew around early 2006 and we're still talking about it with little things we've picked up on today it has garnered its cult status and it's well deserved as the film where ritchie stepped out the box and broke his norm a bit br br standout line fear or <UNK> me but please think i'm special we share an addiction we're <UNK> <UNK>
<START> may seem far fetched but there really was a real life story of a man who had an affair with a woman who found out where he and his new wife were staying and she killed the wife making it look like a murder rape br br in her <UNK> she had told everyone that the man had asked her to marry him so she quit her job in <UNK> and moved to <UNK> br br last i heard she was in a mental institution security prison br br she was still wearing the engagement ring that she has purchased for herself and had told everyone that he had bought it for her br br the events took place in a small town in <UNK> and the murder happened in <UNK> br br there even was a feature story in people magazine spring of 1988 i want to say on page <UNK> i remember this as i was in college at the time and a colleague of mine had met the individual in the security hospital

<START> while listening to an audio book <UNK> scott is the reader i was so excited to hear his voice and that brought back my disappointment that six degrees was canceled they never seem to keep the good shows on air long enough to capture an audience that can connect with the shows story what a shame and shame on <UNK> network for not giving this show a full seasons chance this was an excellent show to watch with a great cast the network gave men in trees a second chance witch is also a great show but they took invasion off and that also was something totally different to watch not the same old same old themes why can't the networks get it right
<START> who would've imagined hal hartley creates a <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> while <UNK> his signature <UNK> style the <UNK> is highly entertaining br br having not seen a hal hartley film for about a decade i approached this one with some caution his brilliant productions of the nineties had impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialog the director's earlier films featured colorful characters and offered close observations of life often in the region of long island new york or in new york city itself that were offbeat and insightful br br my initial caution <UNK> from the description of this movie as a spy thriller to my pleasant surprise hartley manages to <UNK> his well established style and focus to produce a highly original drama of international intrigue it works in more ways than one might imagine hartley's film <UNK> the dialog and character focus that are his <UNK> along with a <UNK> cinematographic style br br moreover it is highly appropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that has been <UNK> by dark elements on all sides hartley has brought all his skills to something new a political film worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as <UNK> truly he is coming into his own the cast does a fine job of <UNK> hartley's vision and style fans of parker posey will see her in full bloom here still with us and more <UNK> and gorgeous than before
<START> i would not hesitate to put this adaptation of <UNK> trap in a top 5 list of the best stage to movie adaptations ever caine and reeves an underrated actor who never really got a chance to do more than <UNK> romances and superman play off each other extremely well here even <UNK> cannon who i normally don't care for is perfectly cast in a role that exploits her annoyance value as an actress br br i'm not sure that comparisons of deathtrap with sleuth another brilliant stage to screen adaptation featuring michael caine are valid or even fair yes the two stories have a lot in common but sleuth is as much about class <UNK> as the battle of wits and the house in sleuth is set is at least as much a character in the movie as the two actors the house doesn't really have an equivalent in deathtrap and deathtrap isn't so much a battle of wits as it is a pointed <UNK> about how people are no damned good and never as smart as they think they are and deserve everything they get i'll just say that both movies are superb examples of the genre and well worth your time and money this is america after all you don't have to choose br br i won't give away the twists and turns of the plot but i don't think it matters anyway i've watched the dvd eight or nine times in a dozen years and still enjoyed the chemistry and the timing and the mean scary moments when things go all <UNK> shaped it's all done so well that the ride becomes more important than the actual destination br br anyone who likes black hearted comedy and suspense in the hitchcock style of film making will probably enjoy deathtrap immensely
<START> ok if you're looking for another <UNK> <UNK> this is completely the wrong film br br i revolves around two brothers max the younger has a major cocaine addiction adam the <UNK> is a doctor this movie is suppose to show the <UNK> from reality to the extreme <UNK> that drugs make possible it however does not it shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation happens to be present most of the movie focus is on max and his <UNK> ways eventually adam can no longer take the stress from his job and begins to use as well <UNK> drugs br br this movie has almost no climax doesn't <UNK> into what cocaine really does to you has boring and low budget scenes and the acting of the <UNK> brother adam is horrific br br i have no idea how this movie has managed to pass and receive awards it is not a heart <UNK> if you want a clear and true story movie on the extreme world of drugs rent if not buy 'the basketball <UNK> and notice the difference br br try to avoid this movie but if you think you will enjoy try and see for yourself
<START> oh if only i could give this rubbish less than one star there were two mildly amusing parts in the whole film and that is it one was where a line or two from the song don't worry be happy was sung by the slugs and the other was where <UNK> fell of the toilet roll and landed with his feet and legs apart so that everything else he landed on on the way down hit him in the <UNK> that is it there was nothing more amusing than that at least not for me anyway <UNK> is not right in saying <UNK> of the completely terrible shrek might enjoy but wallace <UNK> fans will probably turn away in disgust ' as i loved shrek 1 2 and 3 and i also love wallace and <UNK> you see what it <UNK> down to is that if an animation is done extremely well then it is definitely worth watching this however was about as far from done well as you can possibly get the continuity mistakes were too big in number some were pointed out by the makers of this site others were not i won't point out all of the others but here are a few more to see when the young daughter leaves at the start of the film the catch to the cage door comes down and the hook part of it that is on the right clearly goes back around behind the round <UNK> thus effectively making sure <UNK> would not be able to get out and yet he does just by simply kicking at it at one point the ruby falls down <UNK> back and gets pushed straight up into the the air by rita all the while the ship is moving <UNK> in the next scene <UNK> has caught it again this is impossible seeing as how the ship is moving <UNK> the only place when the ruby was <UNK> out from under the back of <UNK> shirt the only place it could have landed was in the water not in <UNK> hand there was a third one i wanted to point out but for now i have forgotten it br br too many for want of a better word <UNK> were repeated in one way or another there was not enough time to establish any sort of connection with any of the characters the characters were hollow shallow and empty and the whole film left you wanting wanting to watch 85 minutes of anything else paint <UNK> or grass growing are two superb <UNK>
<START> my siblings and i stumbled upon the <UNK> when our local station aired re runs of it one summer in the 1970's we absolutely <UNK> it there was something so exotic and mysterious about it especially when compared to the usual american re runs <UNK> <UNK> green <UNK> you get the idea it had a similar feel to the <UNK> not too much of a surprise since it was also british and in the spy adventure genre br br i would love to see it again now hopefully it holds up i've mentioned this show to others and no one has ever heard of it so i began to wonder if i'd imagined its whole existence but the wonder that is the web has allowed me track down information about it hopefully it will find a new generation of fans
<START> this film is hardly good not great at all a few memorable scenes and the unlucky choice of pairing norma jean with an actual actress jane russell has it all working for her <UNK> lesser woman and or actress one can only wonder why this is considered being one of the highlights of her lame career 3 10

<START> i'm an admirer of hal hartley's films especially <UNK> henry fool fay grim is a sequel to that film and has a similar style and sense of humor the plot however is completely different fay grim played brilliantly by the iconic parker posey tries to track down her missing husband's <UNK> and finds herself amid <UNK> and espionage the supporting cast most of the folks from the first film as well as jeff goldblum <UNK> <UNK> and a much welcomed return from 90s indie darling <UNK> <UNK> is excellent and the film has lots of surprises the director claims this is part of a star wars like trilogy serving as the empire strikes back of the series if this is true i can't wait to see the third installment i just hope i don't have to wait 10 more years for it
<START> plants are the most cunning and vicious of all life forms informs one dopey would be victim in the <UNK> a silly <UNK> remake of invasion of the <UNK> day of the <UNK> and about a thousand <UNK> <UNK> and why are <UNK> moore dangerous than plants one might ask because according to the same <UNK> <UNK> can chase us yes i can remember one horrifying incident when the <UNK> was just a <UNK> being chased all the way home from school by <UNK> <UNK> seed yeah right unfortunately the monsters in this seedy little turkey kind of look like shaggy little muppets some of which roll around like evil <UNK> others which <UNK> about on strings there's not even the <UNK> <UNK> of terror or suspense to be found here for reasons left unexplained the seed monsters are knocked out by 50 <UNK> ultra <UNK> lights even though they can walk about in the daylight which has about 1 000 000 000 000 times more <UNK> energy as you can see not much thought was put into this cow flop the <UNK> says go <UNK> <UNK> garden instead of wasting your <UNK> here <UNK>
<START> the previous reviewer has said it exactly i saw it once was enchanted saw it a second time when it was re broadcast within a week or two of the first airing i still remember some of the scenes the setting is the opening of the 20th century the war referred to in the title is world war i one of the scenes was set in a women only section of a public place which was an interesting historical note the moment when one of the women first touches the other is one of my all time great movie moments i don't think of this as a gay movie it's an interesting and tender period love story where the two principals happen to be women i would love to see this movie again i would buy this one if it ever came out on dvd
<START> if you are looking for a <UNK> boom special effects monster click the back button on your <UNK> br br deathtrap was written by ira <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> wives rosemary's baby it's a stage play adapted for the screen 95 of the movie takes place in the gorgeous home of playwright sidney <UNK> michael caine he's the author of a <UNK> successful broadway play but his last 4 efforts have <UNK> horribly br br an aspiring playwright <UNK> anderson christopher reeve who attended a play writing <UNK> given by sydney has sent him a copy of the play he has written sydney tells his wife myra <UNK> cannon the play is fabulous a sure fire hit but is it good enough to die for time will tell br br clever dialog and numerous twists and turns in the plot keep this movie entertaining from beginning to end the whole cast seems to have a good time it's reminiscent of another fun michael caine mystery sleuth worth watching br br
<START> this is one of the weakest soft porn film around i can't believe somebody wrote this stupid story before making some changes the guy mike is a major <UNK> and moron i can't believe he didn't want to take a shower with his bride to be toni and be in a <UNK> with the french photographer jan he does do a <UNK> with toni and <UNK> but that was short i hate that every time in soft core porn films <UNK> between a woman a man and a woman is short but a girl girl thing is about an hour to the makers of these films have the <UNK> alot longer this film should've have two <UNK> scenes not one but two
<START> i was initially dubious about this movie merely because of the subject but the richly drawn characters the fabulous scenes of the buffalo hunt and the dramatic conclusion make it well worth watching i initially had trouble <UNK> between the two buffalo hunters but as the movie progressed they increasingly distinguished themselves i am still haunted by the final scene
<START> those individuals familiar with asian cinema as a whole are aware that japan is renowned or notorious for it's hyper violent films and korea is now <UNK> a reputation for <UNK> brutal films dog bites dog while not necessarily getting as hyper violent as the <UNK> miike film nor is it as <UNK> brutal as some <UNK> more ambitious efforts it is a perfect in between with its own brand of brutality all it's own the greatest strength this film has though like the greatest of the japanese or korean efforts is that the brutality rather than <UNK> from the film actually develops the characters if not pushing the story forward the two main characters are both incredibly vicious individuals with their own motivations and emotional <UNK> for being as such sam lee's character for instance is on the edge from the very start and slowly and surely amidst various encounters with <UNK> character it is revealed why he is without spoiling this part of the story too much it involves the morally ambiguous nature of his father <UNK> character on the other hand has his most primal instincts <UNK> to if not perfection brutal <UNK> surprisingly <UNK> story arch while not necessarily revealing a more human side actually reveals a side to our animal nature which many forget about which is the natural ability to recognize a fellow broken animal and no i am not talking about sam lee rather <UNK> <UNK> garbage dump girl character ultimately however for the first 80 minutes or so it is a more or less straight forward cat and mouse or dog chase dog film in which every encounter ends in at least one death seriously once sam lee and chang square off some one will die and the fun part of movie is you never know who hands will commit the act which brings us to the film's one weakness <UNK> to delve into it would be yet another spoiler but to put it simply it is guilty of pushing one of the main points of the film since rather then letting the point be made as is 80 minutes into the film the film goes on for another 20 minutes or so to further emphasize it don't get me wrong if <UNK> better from the 80 minute mark to the climax and if the final act wasn't filled with sweet music in fact if it like the majority of the film kept the music to the <UNK> minimum and let the disturbing sound effects do their job it still could have worked and not detract from the film as it is though despite the third act having the most vicious and bloody of the encounters the way it was handled made it feel tacked on and almost insults the viewers intelligence since it felt it had to go this far to get it across nevertheless it is still a breath of fresh air from hong kong cinema since even the most bloody of the martial arts films never reaches the level of <UNK> and brutality while keeping the the character <UNK> in <UNK>
<START> this is one of the worst movies i've ever encountered but i want to say that some of the criticisms i had heard turned out to be <UNK> br br as far as pure film making technique goes this director is competent he's held back by the limited budget and the vhs camera but the actual editing camera angles camera movements and scene staging are pretty professional i've seen many movies where the directing was much worse at least the scenes flow in a way that is not confusing and he has a few clever shots here and there also the forest scenes contained a decent atmosphere there is only so much you can do with a vhs camera and he does a nice job as far as the <UNK> go as far as artistic merit there is none the scene where the camera pans down so that we can watch a guy <UNK> in the woods for 15 seconds sort of <UNK> the artistic style of the whole film this is pure trash total garbage br br the gore is decent for a film in this budget range it's obviously fake but there's <UNK> of it and it's very outlandish br br i saw the american version with the intentionally campy dubbing this was a good idea and it's the only thing that allowed me to make it through the film unfortunately it's overdone especially towards the end br br it's really a terrible film but i have to recommend it for it's camp value it's really hard to find a movie that's worse than this and that sort of puts it in a unique category
<START> in france it's considered polite from french critics to <UNK> to the apparently cohesive chain of films brian de palma left behind him however a good <UNK> of his films are marred by <UNK> effects carrie 1976 the fury 1978 scarface 1983 without mentioning his <UNK> from hitchcock here in dressed to kill it's impossible not to think of vertigo 1958 for the long sequence in the museum while the key moment in the lift makes inevitably think of the shower anthology sequence in psycho 1960 about our involved film i don't want to revive the old debate does de palma rip off hitchcock instead i would tend to be generous and to <UNK> dressed to kill in the category of de palma's winners alongside sisters 1973 and <UNK> 1976 with however some <UNK> and they're the ones i previously <UNK> which fuel the <UNK> between de palma's <UNK> fans and his <UNK> br br if there's one sure thing in dressed to kill which can generate general <UNK> among film lovers it's de palma's <UNK> in directing he <UNK> his camera just like a filmmaker expert is supposed to do his sophisticated camera work brilliantly <UNK> the suspense which <UNK> a rise of the tension and a <UNK> aura the audience is easily glued in front of the screen this is helped by the use of several long silent sequences during which everything depends on looks and gestures by the way in psycho there were also long silent suspenseful parts br br but the main <UNK> in de palma's 1980 vintage is that the quality of the plot can't be found wanting and appears to be a rehash of many formulaic corny ingredients <UNK> to an <UNK> number of murder stories the prostitute is the sole witness of the crime then she's suspected by the police and has to act on her own with a little help from the <UNK> son from the scene in the subway <UNK> to track down the murderer and to prove her innocence apart from the fact that de palma uses a type of character who for once isn't <UNK> at all it's a menu which <UNK> the <UNK> and the filmmaker ends his film on a sequence that echoes to the opening one yes it's superbly filmed but when one discovers its real function one figures it's almost gratuitous filler perhaps de palma wanted to stretch his film beyond one hour and a half when at this time the viewer knows and even before who the killer is br br the two central <UNK> in de palma's set of themes <UNK> <UNK> on manipulation and <UNK> the latter theme is well present in dressed to kill from the first scene <UNK> which makes the film almost look like a soft porn movie and the filmmaker isn't afraid to film his main actress and wife nancy allen in her underwear i find his approach about this theme rather <UNK> but maybe the first sequence was conceived to be a mirror of the viewer and de palma wanted to stir his <UNK> tom side br br i don't want to <UNK> at all de palma's work his <UNK> work in directing which <UNK> a <UNK> treat to film <UNK> the global weakness of the story and its <UNK> aspects twenty six years after the controversy he <UNK> amid movie goers isn't ready to <UNK>
<START> so you think a talking parrot is not your cup of tea huh well think again paulie is a wonderful film filled with touching moments the characters are all lovable especially paulie as he enters the lives of many people on his journey it is journey worth experiencing don't miss it it is available on home video
<START> anyone who knows me even remotely can tell you that i love bad movies almost as much as i love great ones and i can honestly say that i have finally seen one of the all time legendary bad movies the almost <UNK> mess that is myra <UNK> an adaptation of gore <UNK> best selling book he later <UNK> this film version the star <UNK> myra <UNK> is truly a movie so bad that it remains <UNK> entertaining from beginning to end the x rated movie about sex change <UNK> and hollywood was an absolute catastrophe at the box office and was literally <UNK> off the screen by both critics and audiences at the time of it's release not surprisingly the film went on to gain a near legendary cult status among lovers of bad cinema and i was actually quite excited to finally see for the first time br br director michael sarne who only had two other previous directing credits to his name at the time took a lot of <UNK> for the finished film and in honesty it really does not look like he had a clue about what he was trying to achieve the film is often incoherent with entire sequences edited together in such a half hazzard manner that many scenes become nearly incomprehensible also irritating is the gimmick of using <UNK> footage from the fox film <UNK> and <UNK> it into the picture at regular <UNK> this means that there is <UNK> footage of past film stars such as judy garland and shirley temple laced into newly film scenes of often <UNK> sexual acts and the process just doesn't work as intended this also caused a minor <UNK> as actors such as temple and loretta young <UNK> the studio for using their image without <UNK> br br perhaps sarne is not the only one to blame however as the film's screenplay and casting will also make many viewers shake their heads in disbelief for instance this film will ask you to believe that the <UNK> film critic rex reed in his first and last major film role could have a sex change operation and emerge as the gorgeous sex <UNK> <UNK> welch the film becomes further hard to follow when welch as myra attempts to take over a film school from her sleazy uncle played by legendary film director john huston seduce a <UNK> female film student farrah fawcett and teach the <UNK> resident bad boy roger <UNK> a lesson by <UNK> him with a <UNK> on <UNK> did everyone follow that br br and it gets even better or worse depending upon your perspective i have yet to mention the film's top billed star the legendary screen sex symbol of the <UNK> thirties mae west ms west was <UNK> year old when she appeared in this film she had been retired for 26 years and apparently she still considered herself to be a <UNK> sex symbol as she plays an <UNK> talent agent who has hunky men including a young tom <UNK> throwing themselves at her as if this weren't bad enough the tone deaf west actually performs two newly written songs about halfway through the film and i think that i might have endured permanent brain damage from listening to them br br naturally none of this even closely resembles anything that any person of reasonable taste would describe as good but i would give myra <UNK> a 4 out of 10 because it was always <UNK> entertaining even when i had no idea what in the hell was supposed to be going on also most of the cast tries really hard <UNK> in particular appears so hell bent in turning her poorly written part into something meaningful that she single <UNK> succeeds in making the movie worth watching if she had only been working with a decent screenplay and capable director then she might have finally received some respect form critics br br the rest of the cast is also fine the <UNK> over the top john huston who really should have been directing the picture has some funny moments rex reed isn't bad for a non actor and farrah fawcett is pleasantly fresh faced and likable roger <UNK> is also fine but he never appeared in another movie again after this i guess he just couldn't live down being the guy who was <UNK> by <UNK> welch and as anyone could guess from the description above mae west was totally out of her mind when she agreed to do this movie but that's part of what makes it fun for those of us who love bad cinema
<START> i just watched this movie and i've gotta say that with such a great premise and great talent this turkey just lays there a friend <UNK> me this movie and i watched with an open mind mainly because he had such high praise for the story br br well the movie started off with kevin <UNK> as a fighter pilot <UNK> why why did they make him a fighter pilot he was supposedly going to be hired by anthony <UNK> character to be his new pilot well we never see <UNK> go near a plane for the rest of the movie br br <UNK> runs into a <UNK> james <UNK> selling a horse to a big mexican businessman and <UNK> <UNK> along for a ride without knowing what happened <UNK> is beat to near death and <UNK> drives him to the meeting which happens to be with an associate of quinn but nothing comes of it <UNK> <UNK> why did they have <UNK> character why did they have the horse sale with the quinn associate if nothing was to come of it br br also after they leave <UNK> for dead they make <UNK> <UNK> character become a whore then she attacks one of <UNK> men that was paying for a turn she stabs him with his own knife and the next thing she's been moved to a convent no explanation as to why she was moved or when it was done br br too much talent wasted on such a weak script and poor editing i only watched this because a friend owned it and let me watch it i'm going to throw it at him for the 2 hours i wasted of my life watching the <UNK> thing
<START> description corny utterly stupid and worthless it's so cheap and lame it'll make you wonder why these <UNK> dumb people even wasted 2 months or so to spend a budget i'm guessing this probably no more than 700 dollars to make this movie it was just hysterical to watch with or without mystery science theater i am giving you the best advice in the world br br spare yourself spare your time life and money by not i repeat not even <UNK> about whether you should see this movie this movie is so corny it'll make your face turn purple of <UNK> boredom if you have a one <UNK> iq then be my guest and watch this absolutely despicable movie you might actually admire it like i said before if you have a one <UNK> iq br br with about 12 actors of your own a few puppets you bought at a garage sale and of course cameras and music i <UNK> you'll make a slightly more entertaining home video than this piece of absolute crap
<START> <UNK> horror is often regarded as the worst australian film ever made and described as a typical slasher film which carried the promotion <UNK> the movie that can't get an academy <UNK> an underground disco band members begins to die <UNK> to death by burned maniac as they are attempting to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the australian <UNK> badly acted and written slasher flick with zero suspense and annoying characters it certainly delivers the gore heads are split in half with a <UNK> throats are cut and a woman is killed with a <UNK> if you like cheesy slasher movies you can give this one a try but you have been warned at least it's better than swedish the <UNK> 4 out of 10
<START> a <UNK> develops a fabric that never gets dirty or wears out but it is seen as a threat to the survival of various <UNK> in this delightful ealing studios comedy guinness is marvelous as the mild mannered but <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with her sensual voice plays the love interest parker is her <UNK> father <UNK> is amusing as a <UNK> of the fabric industry while telling an engaging story the film also raises some intriguing questions about science the economy and politics it is <UNK> directed by <UNK> who would go on to make the <UNK> and the sublime sweet smell of success later in the 1950s
<START> basic meaning of the story is a reality cruel true reality situations are very funny you have to laugh when you see how people can be stupid <UNK> and crazy the best description will be if you watch it on your own
<START> i rented this movie because it sounded pretty interesting but to my horror this movie was the worst movie i had ever seen i read the comment from <UNK> 8 and he has to be a part of the cast or the crew unless <UNK> 8 is a 4 year old child or some demented cult member no one in their right mind would think that this movie had any potential at all br br i couldn't believe <UNK> <UNK> comments br br <UNK> from the <UNK> inspired opening animation to the quick pace this film keeps the eye moving and works so well that repeat viewing is not unexpected br br the animation is the only aspect of the movie that was interesting and the fact of that the film keeps the eye moving well that's because you keep looking for any type of suspense i mean give me a break halloween was shot with a budget of 100 000 00 and a painted mask and also by the way became a cult classic as far as repeat viewing is not unexpected i think he made a <UNK> br br another quote from <UNK> 8 the only fan the acting is also a strong aspect of the film br br with all due respect for the actors their performance is nothing more than the respective talent of robert <UNK> br br the catchy <UNK> beware the hour between <UNK> and darkness br br that's because there is no <UNK> or darkness in this movie br br mpaa rating rated r for some violence gore br br the only gore you see is some red paint on a sheet over a dead body you never see as far as i know it might be a <UNK> of grass br br in <UNK> i have seen horror flicks from the 50's 60's and 70's i have seen what i thought to be the absolutely worst and some that were very good the director of this film either did not make any attempt was asleep or took a hit of acid whatever the case i think the actors deserve applause for trying to salvage a very poor job of direction i would give this film a rating of 5 for a <UNK> movie
<START> i just watched this movie today and not only is it terrible and awful but it looks like the director just got a few friends together to make a movie about a sick man i also think that this movie has the look of a porn video with it's clear crisp just filmed view br br thank heavens i work in a video store and i didn't have to pay for it cause this movie is crap x <UNK> do not buy or rent this movie you'd have a better time watching dude where's my car than this piece of crap and that's not saying a lot for that movie either br br the acting is lousy and the movie is just very unwatchable i was watching this movie and i wanted to kill myself during and after the movie br br i walked home and threw up after watching this piece of dirt movie i then took a shower and burnt my clothes br br if i had half a mind i would of took the movie outside and burned it too cause no one should be subjected to it well maybe members of al <UNK> especially the ones we have in custody and also child <UNK> who are in prison on life sentences with out <UNK> just make a set up like a clock work orange and then force these cheese head to watch it over and over again
<START> i wanted to vote zero or lower i loved the commentary it is the worst movie ever made and <UNK> is the perfect word for it unless there is something worse that <UNK> never thought of i am also at a loss to think of anything negative enough to accurately describe bo derek the best that could be said of her is she's consistent
<START> reading all of the comments are very exciting but can someone please tell me the name of the real artist that painted the pictures for the good times broadcast i realize that everyone refers to j j as the artist in the family but there was a real family that has the real artist and he hasn't gotten any credit in this sight yet so if you don't mind if someone can tell the name of the real artist i would also like to tell him job well done i know this sight is for the good times cast but wouldn't you agree that he has also touched the hearts of us all i would like to know if he still paints or if he is still alive i would like to have some of his work displayed in my home
<START> when this first came out my dad brought it home we were amazed by it it was so different from anything we had seen before i was looking for a specific movie last night and i found 'the <UNK> <UNK> again the box is falling apart and i am surprised that the tape still works although it is not <UNK> <UNK> quality graphics it is still very good they should sell this again it is a landmark for computer animation imagery highly recommended
<START> a strange role for eddie murphy to take at the height of his career while there is a lot of the eddie murphy character he plays a truly decent person the rest of the cast is good particularly the lovely charlotte lewis her character's beauty and <UNK> held the tone of the film from getting to be too much murphy
<START> as far as i can understand <UNK> watcher is the first work of a young director my doubt is if this is the work of a regular guy who happens to love films or if this is the work of a cinema student since there is a reference to <UNK> school of arts in the final credits br br nevertheless director <UNK> <UNK> demonstrates with this movie a total <UNK> of some basic notions about cinema what is a movie how to tell a story it doesn't matter for the <UNK> director one of the first things you learn in school when you're studying cinema is how to tell a story you learn that just like in novels in movies you should also <UNK> your story in three acts the introduction the development and the conclusion you learn that your story should have a protagonist and an antagonist and that there should be a climax you learn this is valid for a 3 hour epic for the regular movie for a short film and even believe it or not for a 30 second commercial you also learn there can be levels of <UNK> in your approach to the academic structure and that ultimately you can even <UNK> it br br in rough terms tim watcher introduces us its main character and then the movie ends the whole movie sounds like the introduction of the characters in <UNK> <UNK> there are no second or third acts in tim watcher this is not a parody or an art film thus you can't even try to justify the <UNK> for the academic structure you are expecting to be told a story and it doesn't happen worst than that tim watcher <UNK> itself as a warning and one with no real purpose it doesn't make a point or at least not a valid one its point is childish with a sense of vengeance the situations portrayed are utterly simple and its approach is <UNK> br br i was expecting a lot more from this short the movie opens with a rather good looking credits sequence and you quickly realize you are watching something with better production values than the regular portuguese short film i don't know the budget for this movie but judging for the thanks list in the end credits merit must go to the production team for such good connections in a country where's difficult to have doors opened to young filmmakers br br tim watcher seems to be an exercise in style color and carefully chosen plans combined with a fine score that's all there's nothing else there's no plot and that's a shame because it feels like a waste of production values hardly you can see in the regular portuguese short such diversity of locations and so many available extras to <UNK> a story br br as absurd as the comparison may sound i must refer the <UNK> shorts as a fine example of how you can tell a good story in a very short film severely <UNK> to product placement and over the top stylish cinematography
<START> i saw this film at its <UNK> at sundance <UNK> br br since american beauty is a movie that had something to say i had hopes for <UNK> unfortunately it was a disappointment in fact of countless movies i've seen in almost a dozen sundance festivals <UNK> is the only sundance movie i've ever wanted to walk out early from br br the worst problem with <UNK> is that it so obviously <UNK> with a collection of provocative concepts concerning cultural stereotypes rather than with an <UNK> human drama the screenplay <UNK> from the novel of the same name by alicia <UNK> the famous edith <UNK> quote comes to mind i have never known a novel that was good enough to be good in spite of its being adapted to the author's political views that observation is especially devastating for <UNK> because its political views are so stale and simplistic if there ever was a time when <UNK> white male villains condescending portrayals of blacks ironic <UNK> of foreign cultures etc were fresh it's long past br br for a more detailed review please look up any of the many professional reviews available online almost all rate this movie poorly and expose the shallow and manipulative <UNK> it is based on br br on the other hand the amateur reviewers seem more easily <UNK> as you read through the reviews in this and similar sites you'll frequently come across <UNK> stunning breathtaking profound shocking it <UNK> me to read them but it does not surprise me indeed i've encountered many people who seem to regard any book or movie dealing with racial cultural gender or sexual issues as deeply moving thought provoking full of profound insight if you are such a person by all means rent <UNK> and be moved by it on the other hand if you set your standards higher you can safely pass on this one
<START> antonio <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> castle of blood is an eerie atmospheric <UNK> that succeeds on all <UNK> it looks absolutely beautiful in black white and it has wonderfully creepy gothic vibe alan foster is an english journalist who <UNK> an interview with visiting american horror writer edgar allan poe poe <UNK> foster that he can't spend one night in the abandoned mansion of <UNK> friend thomas <UNK> accepting the <UNK> foster is locked in the mansion and the horror begins the film is extremely atmospheric and it scared the hell out of me the crypt sequence is really eerie and the tension is almost unbearable barbara steele looks incredibly beautiful as sinister <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> castle of blood is easily one of the best italian horror movies made in early 60's a masterpiece
<START> while a 9 might seem like an unusually high score for such a slight film however compared to the hundreds and hundreds of series detective films from the 1930s and 40s this is among the very best and also <UNK> very <UNK> to <UNK> later thin man films now this does not mean that the film is that similar to the thin man movies as the <UNK> murder case is not a comedy but more a traditional mystery detective film now you'd think that not having nora charles or <UNK> or a traditional comic sidekick something found in practically all series detective films along for fun would be a <UNK> but i didn't miss them at all because this was such an exceptionally well written film having a genuinely interesting case as well as uniformly excellent performances by all br br the film begins at the dog show and is called the <UNK> murder case though this philo vance film actually spends little of the time at the dog show and dogs are not a super important part of the film instead a thoroughly hated man is killed and left in a completely sealed room an idea repeated in quite a few other detective films such as crime doctor's strangest case however how all this is explained seems pretty credible and fit together very well keeping my interest throughout i sure wish other detective films of the day had as intelligently written plots and exceptional acting as this one this one is definitely a keeper
<START> <UNK> <UNK> has taken the old myth of <UNK> <UNK> and stood it on its head to produce a dark gory <UNK> and terrific looking movie those unfamiliar with the legend won't need to be the story explains itself nicely as it goes along well worth seeking out even though there are no english language home video versions
<START> while not quite as <UNK> preposterous as later works this slow moving repetitive giallo offers some nice touches in the first half but grows more and more <UNK> and silly as it stumbles to its lame denouement br br to be sure the actors are above average considering this is an <UNK> movie and some moments show the director's visual skills but whole sequences should've been cut and basically it's just the same exploitative trash as ever <UNK> in fake science and <UNK> sexual <UNK> br br 3 out of 10 genetic <UNK>
<START> corky <UNK> has to be one of the most jaw dropping and horrific <UNK> ever made br br while the sometimes amusing chris <UNK> who pulled off a very funny performance in the hilarious <UNK> <UNK> his character in corky is so stupid and so unfunny which is a shame since the premise is a wonderful idea to bad they ran out of them when they got to page 3 on the script
<START> spencer tracy and <UNK> hepburn would roll over in their graves if they knew this guess who's coming to dinner rip off was actually in theaters along with sidney <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> these four brilliant actors made a great cultural statement with director stanley <UNK> 1967 master piece this present day rip off is a joke so a white guy from an overly stereotyped italian family in <UNK> island brings his african american girlfriend home insert gasp here to his grand father's funeral his family members reactions were of course predictable this movie was so painfully <UNK> from start to finish my girlfriend actually started fake <UNK> to <UNK> to me that she wanted to leave do yourself a favor and rent the original take a pass on wake
<START> here is what happened br br 1 head of <UNK> needs to make <UNK> aimed at different audience to <UNK> and <UNK> to keep <UNK> and job br br 2 <UNK> henry offers his unfunny friends up br br 3 head of <UNK> <UNK> them up completely ignoring the fact that they are not funny br br worst of all it is arguably racist as all the characters play up to bad stereotypes if a white person did this kind of thing <UNK> be <UNK> br br trash
<START> in the <UNK> coming of age tale <UNK> my father eric <UNK> of <UNK> fame plays an <UNK> german <UNK> struggling to raise his son raymond <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in rural 1960's australia the major <UNK> to the family's <UNK> and happiness is his wife christina <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> <UNK> her wedding <UNK> by shamelessly <UNK> up with other men despite her highly unconventional behavior <UNK> refuses to grant her a divorce <UNK> torturing himself in the vain hope that she will one day return to him it is unfortunately the good hearted and good natured <UNK> who must bear witness to all this marital turmoil and it is his <UNK> that serves as the basis for the movie <UNK> <UNK> would later grow up to be an author br br even though i admire <UNK> my father for what it is trying to do i can't honestly say i enjoyed it for while the film has some fine performances and serious intentions going for it these simply aren't enough to <UNK> the <UNK> storyline and <UNK> pacing which leave the audience as <UNK> and depressed as the people on screen a serious slice of life drama is one thing but this <UNK> downbeat <UNK> in adultery insanity and multiple <UNK> let alone attempted <UNK> is something else again
<START> here is one movie that is genuinely funny at every single moment that it covers how can it not be given that this movie stars the creators of south park and is directed by david <UNK> when i first saw this movie i <UNK> immediately realise that coop and doug were really matt and <UNK> but their talent in acting and writing came out as quite impressive i was pleasantly surprised to learn that they were really matt and <UNK> later on the humor is sometimes crude sometimes foul sometimes brilliant sometimes subtle sometimes loud and sometimes stupid but overall this is one hell of a movie that is without doubt under rated well actually its insane totally insane
<START> if you are hoping for anything new you have chosen the wrong movie who can think that a movie that is a virtual replay of it's <UNK> can be good maybe the producer and maybe the director but hopefully they were not serious when they made this thing this whole movie is like making a greatest hits dvd of the 1st 3 films but changing the actors <UNK>
<START> good lord what were they thinking here is your spoiler warning even though i don't think it'll really matter you won't be seeing this piece of trash anyway br br a group of <UNK> go chasing after a group of really stupid people who go on a really stupid hunt for them to try and kill them and the puppets <UNK> things by letting them live out their really stupid fantasies in other words the whole thing is really stupid br br you know it has to be bad when even mike and the <UNK> can't save something and they didn't i know some of their lines were funny like what to add to the sign hit and the hand comments but <UNK> this was pretty <UNK> sad br br all i can say is do not watch this piece o <UNK> it is not worth your eyes
<START> this was a great romantic comedy historically inaccurate einstein had no <UNK> or <UNK> as noted elsewhere in imdb but he made a great <UNK> he brought together two very nice people played by two of the best actors working the supporting cast lou <UNK> joseph <UNK> gene <UNK> stephen <UNK> etc all <UNK> on screen and made this a great viewing experience the fact he drove a car to get around seems to <UNK> all those images and posters of him riding a <UNK> to get around and did he wear <UNK> in one scene reportedly the professor never wore <UNK> two new entries for the imdb goofs section historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies aside this was a great movie to watch with a great cast i give it an 8
<START> this film's trailer interested me enough to warrant renting the dvd however the resulting movie is absolutely dire admittedly this is not the worst film ever made or the worst film this year but it came damn close br br the main issue is the film not knowing what it wants to be comedy adult drama thriller teen porn the story is interesting as it deals with the <UNK> of mail order brides but the film is a mess what starts out as a mildly interesting comedy a word i use in the <UNK> possible terms then goes totally in reverse and <UNK> into a very dark and <UNK> misogynistic thriller nicole kidman should know better and ben chaplin is wasted as are <UNK> <UNK> and vincent <UNK> whom i can only presume did this for the money br br this is a bad film in pretty much every single aspect it's not funny it's almost so sexist that you could almost forgive benny hill for everything he did and the dramatic elements are just downright nasty a film to be avoided unless you absolutely have to see kidman or chaplin in every one of their films
<START> although george c scott is the only actor in this version of <UNK> without a british accent he more than makes up for it with his over the top and larger than life interpretation of <UNK> scrooge br br particularly effective is when he confronts bob <UNK> in his office at the movie's end as scott stands before a large window <UNK> casts a glowing <UNK> over him all you can see is his <UNK> <UNK> by scott's voice a <UNK> <UNK> the effect is <UNK> much like marlon <UNK> first scene in apocalypse now the horror indeed br br however as they say the very thing that works for you can also work against you because scott displays such <UNK> <UNK> throughout the movie it proves <UNK> to put it another way the before scrooge is almost as charismatic as the after even though he really shouldn't be it's what you might call the doctor smith effect since jonathan harris used a very similar approach when playing that role and numerous other <UNK> stage and screen alike br br actually i myself don't consider scott's <UNK> rage a <UNK> but other christmas carol <UNK> might see the film and judge for yourselves
<START> based on one of the books by gabriel <UNK> and it might be brilliant literature this cinema adaption really sucks as it's more like fighting against sleep rather than enjoying some cinematographic <UNK> the story is about an old couple whose son died and living a life that is heavily dominated by poverty and <UNK> the main character is a <UNK> that hopefully one day brings some money for a <UNK> <UNK> i am in no mood to <UNK> more words on this useless pretentious piece just perhaps that you can see <UNK> <UNK> in here but sitting 90 minutes in front of your screen for just that no <UNK>
<START> this really doesn't do the blues justice it starts out badly with images from the voyager <UNK> and blind willie <UNK> or was it blind <UNK> <UNK> someone blind anyway apparently <UNK> from outer space and telling us the life stories of various blues musicians corny as it is this might be the visually most interesting part of this documentary afterwards the only thing to see is actors <UNK> <UNK> the classic tunes filmed in fake <UNK> black and white <UNK> with the likes of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the same songs afterwards this is a good device to show us why the old blues <UNK> were really so great but it doesn't make for compelling viewing there is hardly anything in here that could justify making it a film and not a radio play nobody should be forced to see these badly done <UNK> it's a shame for <UNK> scorsese and especially for the blues avoid at all costs
<START> i saw this film last night at a special movie theater showing in <UNK> and it was superb i do have to admit that the original music composition of the <UNK> player and <UNK> <UNK> player influenced the mood of the film but the film itself also had force in its portrayal of the tragic <UNK> saga br br if you are interested in silent films or in the <UNK> i highly recommend this film the costumes were fantastic and creative the sets were <UNK> and exotic and the acting was dramatic and breathtaking as is typical of silent film <UNK> unfortunately i have not seen the first part of this film duo that concerns <UNK> the story of this second film begins after <UNK> death when <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> versions of the story begins to plan her revenge against her brothers br br also i watched this film in german i am a native english <UNK> and have a basic german knowledge it was difficult to read the subtitles what do you call that in silent films at first because of the old style german script so i advise that if you watch it in german that you make sure you can <UNK> your <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in the old script
<START> this picture seemed way to <UNK> it's almost as bad as the drum beating of the right wing <UNK> who say everything is <UNK> in iraq it paints a picture so <UNK> that i can't help but wonder about it's <UNK> and bias also it seemed to <UNK> from being about the murderous carnage of our troops to the lack of health care in the states for <UNK> to me the subject matter seemed confused it only cared about portraying the military in a bad light as a an <UNK> that uses mind control to turn ordinary peace loving civilians into baby killers and b an organization that once having used and spent the bodies of it's soldiers then <UNK> them to the <UNK> <UNK> of the v a this is a legitimate argument but felt off topic for me almost like a movie in and of itself i felt that the war tapes and blood of my brother were much more fair and let the viewer draw some conclusions of their own rather than be beaten over the head with the film makers viewpoint f
<START> to anyone not familiar with c s <UNK> book this film should be interesting it is colorful well acted and depicts high adventure but to those of us who know the original stories it is appalling i could hardly sit through it br br for some reason screen writers seem compelled to rewrite the stories they are working on of course the spoken word is different from the written word and there are some episodes that would be difficult to film but why do the screen writers rewrite the story instead of just adapting it in this case the writers out did themselves br br just a few examples there was no <UNK> on the <UNK> the officers did take over the ship after the half insane captain was driven completely mad when he fell through a <UNK> for reasons implied but never given there was no court martial the court of <UNK> was <UNK> in an almost <UNK> atmosphere captain <UNK> does not appear appear in this part of the <UNK> saga nor does <UNK> <UNK> wife <UNK> himself was never in the <UNK> either on the ship or on shore there are plenty of such <UNK> of <UNK> story br br on a purely technical basis i think the film's repeated use of the flash back device hurts the continuity of the story br br why oh why did screen writers have to mess up a good story
<START> where the sidewalk ends deserves to be a better known film directed by otto preminger the man who gave the world laura and this time he's got the same co stars dana andrews and gene tierney it must be said that tierney here is under used in what amounts to more of a supporting role while the spotlight goes to andrews br br he plays a tough hardened cop used to dealing with a bunch of thugs in too <UNK> a way until one night he accidentally kills a man in the process of <UNK> him when suspicion falls on a cab driver tom <UNK> he goes along with the investigation into the murder but starts to feel guilt because he's in love with the <UNK> daughter gene tierney tierney by the way looks a little too elegant for the girl she's playing here and doesn't seem to fit into the <UNK> background elements of the story br br the story takes a grim turn as the investigation goes deeper and it's discovered that the murdered man had a silver plate in his head from his service as a war hero by the end it turns into a morality tale with andrews developing a conscience over his crime br br it's fascinating as film noir with capable performances from a strong supporting cast a good entry in the field of noir <UNK> directed by preminger and nicely played by andrews and tierney despite the slight <UNK> of her character
<START> written by oliver stone and directed by brian de palma scarface paints a picture not easily forgotten al pacino turns in a stunning performance as tony montana a cuban <UNK> than becomes a powerful player in the drug world as he <UNK> runs his self made kingdom of crime in florida this gangster flick is harsh violent loud gross unpleasant and must hold the record for <UNK> the word f k the most number of times almost three hours long and yes it can get repulsive a <UNK> hearted <UNK> keeps you in your seat cheering for the demise of a ruthless crime lord br br also playing interesting characters are michelle pfeiffer steven bauer robert <UNK> mary elizabeth <UNK> f murray abraham and angel <UNK> pacino proves to be one of the greatest of his generation he manages to bring reality to his character that leaves a strong impression this will not be a movie for everyone for you leave thinking you walked away from a disaster is that powerful enough for you crime does not pay for long
<START> today if someone mentions the name victor mclaglen the response most likely will be who or perhaps why well believe it or not victor mclaglen won the academy award for best actor in this film which is about a poor desperate man who is willing to sell out his best friend for <UNK> to the united states it's an interesting movie which shows how low even the most well meaning <UNK> will go just for a few bucks the movie takes place in british dominated ireland and while all the other characters are either directly or <UNK> fighting for the political independence of ireland all mr <UNK> character is concerned about is getting money and getting drunk the movie makes one wonder whether political <UNK> is worth all the trouble because while the <UNK> is struggling to make a point many others not only do not care they don't even know what the fuss is all about the <UNK> of this movie is look out for the friend he may sell you out for a dime
<START> this movie's full title is <UNK> race against time that's a race no one can ever win but you can certainly cut your losing <UNK> by not wasting any of your precious <UNK> on this <UNK> this movie was clumsy and manipulative in a way that made <UNK> look honest it strained my <UNK> too far it was ridiculously stupid in its storyline and deserves to be <UNK> for it br br it's not quite as awful as <UNK> or black but this movie has nothing to recommend it stupid pointless with a ridiculously <UNK> performance by <UNK> the central plot is another nasty example of the <UNK> manipulative propaganda that <UNK> so many family <UNK> films if my father who raised me and who i love <UNK> treated me like big b did akshay i'd shoot him myself to say nothing of the <UNK> of <UNK> illness
<START> baseketball is awesome it's hilarious and so damned funny that you will wet your pants laughing i have seen it so many times i have stopped counting but <UNK> it gets funnier br br trust me on this one baseketball is a <UNK> hit and i loved it and will continue to love it i hope one day there will be a special edition dvd brought out br br ten thumbs up
<START> i have watched this episode more often than any other <UNK> episode it is that enjoyable and it is quite scary but all in good <UNK> fun a woman kills her 2nd husband but runs into a problem when an escaped maniac in a <UNK> santa claus outfit decides to pay her and her little girl a visit at that very moment mary <UNK> who i seem to remember from snl or some other tv comedy skit show is the evil wife and larry drake plays the lunatic in the <UNK> santa outfit i had forgotten santa was played by drake over the years his santa is an <UNK> force and quite frightening at times you can probably guess how santa finally gets into the house the episode is played for laughs but it also can be pretty intense at times
<START> i had the <UNK> fortune to see this film at a showing in the us having reluctantly sat through the entire abysmal thing i am shocked to have seen so many good reviews here on imdb br br the original film was a turkey but an interesting one it <UNK> into that early seventies post 1969 revolution thing this film just stinks of well nothing really it's that bad br br imagine a badly done <UNK> commercial see what i mean br br madonna never could act and has been an embarrassment on the big screen for years she looks worse and worse with every one of those years increasingly coming to resemble a skinned <UNK> br br guy ritchie who has built his reputation on lock stock could never direct either his movies are shallow badly cut fashion shows he doesn't disappoint here either he wisely cast his wife as the star of this <UNK> br br please people take little <UNK> of the good reviews this movie has received from other posters below they are quite obviously business plants br br don't encourage ritchie to <UNK> himself further by giving him money br br
<START> i have to point out before you read this review that in no way is this a statement against iranian people if you really want to read something into it than hopefully you see that i'm against politicians in general but if you're looking to be offended i can't help you br br not in iran as this movie is banned there see imdb trivia for this movie which is a shame because the movie is great would it not be for <UNK> this movie would have won at the international film festival in berlin br br rightfully so it was the runner up or second place if you will why because it is a movie about <UNK> it's not even that this is a complete women issue it is about the government trying to keep the people down an <UNK> so clear that the government felt the need to <UNK> the movie but by <UNK> it nothing is resolved and or can they make this movie disappear br br another reviewer had a great summary line comedy about a tragedy that sums it up pretty well
<START> i really like star trek hidden frontier it is an excellent fan fiction film series and i cant wait to see more i have only started watching this film series last week and i just cannot get enough of it i have already recommended it too other people to watch since it is well worth the view i have already watched each episode many times over and am waiting to see more episodes come out i rated it a ten but i think it deserves a 12 <UNK> my <UNK> to the staff of the star trek hidden <UNK> on an excellent job if u like star trek i highly recommend checking out this star trek fan fiction film the detail associated with this series of films is excellent especially the ships and planets used in it
<START> a beautiful film touching profoundly up the simple yet divine aspects of humanity br br this movie was almost perfect and seeing as nothing in this world can be truly perfect that is pretty good the only minor thing i <UNK> object to is the pacing at some points in the middle of the story the acting is also very good and all the actors easily top actors in high profile films the actual directing seems to have been well thought through and the script must have been amazing there are some truly breathtaking moments of <UNK> and a quite gorgeous continuing <UNK> composition of the story br br the moment in the movie when the main character achieves that feeling of being in heaven is the perfect ending to a truly brilliant yarn
<START> on sunday july 27 1997 the first episode of a new science fiction series called stargate sg 1 was broadcast on showtime a spin off of and sequel to the 1994 film stargate starring kurt russell and james <UNK> the series begins approximately one year after the events portrayed in the film for ten seasons it <UNK> the adventures and <UNK> of an <UNK> team of <UNK> known as sg 1 originally the series starred richard dean anderson as colonel jack o'neill two l s michael <UNK> as dr daniel jackson amanda <UNK> as captain samantha carter christopher judge as <UNK> and don s davis as major general george s <UNK> for ten long years we watched the team battle against the <UNK> the <UNK> the <UNK> and many other <UNK> at the same time they <UNK> <UNK> with the <UNK> the <UNK> the rebel <UNK> the <UNK> and the <UNK> they saved the world no less than eight times over the years and never gave up not until death claimed them and sometimes not even then br br as with all long running series they were numerous cast changes michael <UNK> left the series in january 2002 at the end of its fifth season in order to <UNK> his <UNK> as an actor daniel jackson's <UNK> as the <UNK> resident <UNK> geek was <UNK> quinn an alien from a country called <UNK> on the planet <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> however <UNK> returned at the beginning of the seventh season in june 2003 and <UNK> left at the same time unfortunately he made only one further guest appearance and his character was seldom mentioned afterwards don s davis left the series at the end of the seventh season in march 2004 as he felt that it was time for him to go the show's original star and arguably its most popular actor richard dean anderson starred in the series throughout its first eight seasons his participation in the seventh and eight seasons was <UNK> less than in the earlier seasons he finally left sg 1 in march 2005 in order to spend more time with his then six year old daughter jack o'neill was by far my favourite character in the series and truth be told i never enjoyed the last two seasons as much as i did the earlier episodes for that very reason br br the <UNK> season represented a new era for the programme with the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the <UNK> and the <UNK> in season eight many fans felt the series should go out on a high regardless the series carried on for a further two years with the <UNK> replacing the <UNK> as the <UNK> main <UNK> three new characters were brought in to fill the gaps as it were and help <UNK> in this re invention ben <UNK> came in as the cocky southern air force pilot lt colonel cameron mitchell the new leader of sg 1 his <UNK> co star the lovely <UNK> black began to play a prominent role in the series as the <UNK> sexy hilarious and certainly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a former <UNK> host and con artist from another planet a recurring guest star during the <UNK> and <UNK> seasons she joined the cast full time at the beginning of its <UNK> and final season <UNK> off the cast was the legendary beau bridges as major general hank <UNK> the new commander of the <UNK> and an old friend of jack o'neill and general <UNK> for the last two years they starred alongside the sg 1 faithful michael <UNK> amanda <UNK> and christopher judge and became valuable parts of and made equally valuable <UNK> to the stargate franchise br br alas all good things must come to an end during the initial broadcast of the first several episodes of season ten ratings dropped considerably resulting in <UNK> in its august 2006 after ten seasons and <UNK> episodes the dream was finally over on march 13 2007 what began with children of the gods ended with <UNK> the series finale made its world premiere on sky one in britain and ireland before being shown on the sci fi channel in the united states on june 22 2007 br br in the ten years that the series was on the air it <UNK> <UNK> of fans and even <UNK> the science fiction series star trek in terms of popularity in certain countries it became the second longest running sci fi series in the world second only to doctor who 1963 1989 and the longest running american produced sci fi series having <UNK> the x files only a few months before it ended br br stargate sg 1 represents the <UNK> of the stargate franchise in 2004 its success and popularity led to the production of a spin off series entitled stargate atlantis which was <UNK> cancelled after five seasons and 100 episodes in august 2008 although plans for another feature film fell through two direct to dvd films stargate the <UNK> of truth and stargate <UNK> were released in 2008 and more are planned for the not too distant future a third live action series stargate universe is also due to premiere at some point next year there was unfortunately an animated series stargate <UNK> which ran only from 2002 to 2003 but the less said about that the better despite the end of sg 1 and atlantis as continuing series the future of stargate looks very bright indeed br br in conclusion while stargate has yet to gain the same degree of popular recognition as other major sci fi television <UNK> such as star trek and doctor who its still relatively new compared to those two sci fi giants and i have every confidence that it will continue for many many years to come
<START> i've been trying to track down this film just by <UNK> bad phrases about teenagers seduce and kill man in his house and such i think i first saw parts of this film when i was about 10 years old when it was running on cable it made quite an impression it's the kind of film that kids know they shouldn't be watching and switch the channel when their parents come in when i saw who the cast was i couldn't believe that some of these good actors were in such a horrible movie then again if you like to see men who cheat on their wives get murdered then this is an interesting film also if i recall there's some pretty interesting pseudo lesbian moments probably the dumbest ending of all time but still memorable
<START> all the world said that the film tashan would be a good movie with great pleasure but this is not the case <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> made a serious mistake to take as an actress kareena kapoor she was unbearable throughout the film her tom boy look does not really goes well even the film the story of the film is not making sense at all everyone said that the <UNK> <UNK> of india is <UNK> but its not at all <UNK> the talent anil kapoor was involved in this stupid movie anil is an actor of large caliber and this film is not akshay kumar has also been a victim of this film as all is saif the style and the <UNK> is not really good in this film i was disappointed
<START> this is a great show and will make you cry this group people really loved each other in real life and it shows time and time again email me and let's chat i have been to australia and they real do talk like this br br i want you to enjoy five mile creek and pass on these great stories of right and wrong and friendship to your kids i have all 40 episodes on dvd r that i have <UNK> over the last 5 years see my five mile creek tribute at www <UNK> com and hear the extended theme music let's talk about them br br these people are so cool
<START> put the blame on executive producer wes craven and <UNK> the <UNK> for this big budget <UNK> a <UNK> metal <UNK> of dracula with a condescending verbal <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> who probably wouldn't want his name on this thing anyway and nothing much for the rest of us except slasher <UNK> <UNK> and gore christopher plummer looks <UNK> as van <UNK> in the modern day not just a <UNK> of van <UNK> but the real thing he keeps himself going with <UNK> <UNK> from count <UNK> corpse which is <UNK> from its coffin after being stolen from van <UNK> vault and <UNK> to new orleans this is just what new orleans needs in the 21st century the film well produced but without a single original idea except for multi racial victims is both repulsive and lazy and after about an hour starts repeating itself from
<START> worst show i've ever seen the story is about a group of teenagers who for some inexplicable reason have super powers and when they use some special device they <UNK> into strange poorly designed suits the acting when they're not in the retarded looking suits is decent definitely not good but not the worst acting i've ever seen however when wearing their suits the actors' acting goes from bad to worse much much worse the hyper animated idiots have a <UNK> of unnecessary motions they do even when they talk they look like they're having <UNK> the villains are <UNK> than the rangers every episode some weak idiotic villain comes up with some plan to destroy the rangers he she then sends a force of hyper animated aliens to attack the rangers the rangers then <UNK> their 10 hour <UNK> animation then they <UNK> the aliens then the poorly designed villain which can either be an <UNK> villain that actually looks and acts evil to a <UNK> <UNK> like creature with <UNK> attached to its back that shows obvious signs of mental <UNK> the power rangers fight the villain off then the villain turns into godzilla whether it be by a rain cloud or a nuclear missile yes they fire <UNK> at the creatures and the creatures turn into giants the power rangers spend 5 minutes acting hyper animated and <UNK> their <UNK> which are obviously toys that the producers of the show used special effects on to make them look real the power rangers win the villain gets mad they all teach a valuable lesson and the show ends that's it twenty five minutes of brain <UNK> fake kung fu fighting
<START> think pierce brosnan and you think suave <UNK> intelligent james bond in this movie brosnan plays against type and has lots of fun doing so as does the audience this is a film about a hired assassin who befriends a <UNK> businessman and it works br br this is a fun movie with very good scenes a riveting on the edge brosnan and a good <UNK> off the edge kinnear have some good lines my only <UNK> is that hope davis playing the oh so <UNK> wife can i see your gun doesn't appear more often she could have been a marvellous foil to these men br br this movie is like a <UNK> it plays with the audience while going for a kill the ending is awesome because a storyline with a positive moral emerges this is a frenetic frantic and fun movie which does deserve a wide audience
<START> i was <UNK> by this touching and hilarious film not to mention surprised i was also surprised to find that the voice of paulie was performed by jay <UNK> the performance was so finely nuanced neither <UNK> into <UNK> nor becoming too hard under the new jersey <UNK> that i thought that this must be some <UNK> old pro not the baby faced mr <UNK> a very impressive performance indeed and it's <UNK> to see his talents being taken seriously in a string of quirky indie films
<START> <UNK> is very much a third act sort of film all the dialogue and character interaction that occurs within it comes out of the long wind down of a late southern day and by <UNK> the life of its main character <UNK> robert duvall br br this is the first collaboration of director peter masterson and writer <UNK> <UNK> six years earlier the worked together on the trip to <UNK> a film that seems almost action packed in comparison to this one masterson is not necessarily a good director in fact he's just barely this side of adequate the slow pace leaves a lot of room for cinematographer <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> the film with just the right sense of fragile light warmth br br because this is essentially a filmed play with little in the way of editing or directing <UNK> it all comes to the acting as far as i'm concerned there's no flaws here robert duvall and james earl jones two of the best american actors both born in january 1931 create characters that are wholly real <UNK> in anything besides living lukas <UNK> a young actor who i was familiar with from testament and witness plays a character very much like his other early roles he is quiet <UNK> slightly scared and sad somehow these are qualities that seem natural from him br br perhaps a title like <UNK> is a <UNK> to this film that title along with the opening scene seem to create an image of a far more high strung western type picture if slow paced stage productions don't interest you terribly you'll want to pass on this one as well otherwise this might be exactly the film you wish they made more often br br enjoy
<START> low budget brit pop melodrama focuses on a girl who wants to be a star becomes one and then finds it all a bit too much good cast and a sense of time and place cannot hide the fact that we have all been here before several scenes are a bit hysterical and <UNK> voice sounds a lot like mini mouse she disappeared from sight soon after making this movie so life can <UNK> art a must see if you want to see a punk version of a star is born though
<START> this movie to me is about family jimmy morris lived his dream not just for himself but for his family i can't begin to tell you how i would be able to tell my little girl that daddy was going to kansas city to cover priest holmes and the kansas city <UNK> she'd think it was the coolest thing like <UNK> son did living dreams with the family is what this one is about i think only a father who has a close relationship with his family can truly appreciate what jimmy morris did
<START> once again i have seen a movie made by people that know nothing i just recently reviewed baby face nelson now i've seen dillinger and i've had it br br this movie is garbage i don't know how anyone in their right mind could compare this to a classic like bonnie and clyde this movie is far from a classic someone called it brilliant that's an insane thing to say this movie can't get any facts straight and it has the worst casting i've ever seen i don't know whose dumb idea it was to cast warren <UNK> as john dillinger first of all he looks nothing like him second of all by the time john dillinger was killed he was <UNK> when <UNK> made this he was 45 you could even tell that he's older than the real dillinger just by looking at him not only was he too old but so was ben johnson as <UNK> <UNK> br br they show baby face nelson die then homer van <UNK> and finally john dillinger john dillinger was killed before both of them the last one to die out of the three was baby face nelson not only do the writers not know when they died but they also don't know how they died baby face nelson was not killed after he escaped from little <UNK> in a <UNK> homer van <UNK> was not killed by <UNK> with shot guns homer van <UNK> was <UNK> by the police in st paul and <UNK> down with machine guns another member of <UNK> gang harry <UNK> is shown being shot by police in this movie <UNK> wasn't shot harry <UNK> was captured and sentenced to die in the electric chair i go into what happened to baby face nelson on my baby face nelson review so i'm not going to go into it again here let me also add that richard <UNK> portrayal of baby face nelson is pathetic there's a scene where he attacks dillinger and then gets a bad beating while dillinger was beating him he was crying like a baby and screaming leave me alone baby face nelson and john dillinger never fought maybe dillinger didn't agree with <UNK> bank robbing methods but they never fought nelson also never cried like a little girl while getting beaten they keep calling him lester baby face nelson he was never in his life known by that name <UNK> real name was lester <UNK> and he changed his name to george nelson the black guy that escaped from jail with dillinger was herbert <UNK> but in this movie he is known as reed <UNK> john <UNK> doesn't know anything where the hell did john <UNK> get his information i could probably make a better movie than him br br finally the way they showed john dillinger die is outrageous and <UNK> the movie shows dillinger walk out of the <UNK> with the lady in red and his girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> by the way <UNK> <UNK> wasn't even there that night but a girl named polly hamilton was <UNK> <UNK> yells <UNK> ' dillinger pulls out his gun and is blown to hell it is a proved fact that dillinger did not have a gun that night the fbi gave him no chance to surrender and as soon as he was in sight they blew him away they didn't even have to shoot him they were so close that <UNK> burns were found on his face it was murder they also say that the man killed that night was not john dillinger after killing tons of civilians in the little <UNK> incident can you imagine the fbi <UNK> that they had just killed another innocent <UNK> man the gun they had on display that was supposedly on dillinger was also proved not to have been <UNK> until after <UNK> death i could go on and on how the man they killed wasn't john dillinger but i'll stop here if you would like to know more check it out here br br see the dillinger version with lawrence tierney if you want but don't waste your time with this inaccurate piece of garbage movie
<START> i saw this movie once as a kid on the late late show and fell in love with it br br it took 30 years but i recently did find it on dvd it wasn't cheap either in a <UNK> that <UNK> in war movies we watched it last night for the first time the audio was good however it was grainy and had the trailers between <UNK> even so it was better than i remembered it i was also impressed at how true it was to the play br br the <UNK> is around here <UNK> if you're sincere in finding it fire me a <UNK> and i'll see if i can get you the info <UNK> <UNK> com
<START> this show has been my escape from reality for the past ten years i will sadly miss it although atlantis has filled the hole a small bit br br the last ever episode of <UNK> on television anyway was beautifully done robert wrote something that felt close to reality as though he was trying to explain what it was like on the set of the show everyone working closely together for such a long time there are bound to <UNK> and downs but over the years they've turned into a family i thought this was a wonderful way to end despite anyone else's criticisms br br <UNK> was something special and time and time again it took me across <UNK> of disbelief and <UNK> the wonderful characters stories directors writers from episode one i was hooked the blend of action science drama and especially comedy worked so well that made me keep wanting more br br there are no real words in which to completely express what this show meant to me i can only thank those who kept the show so fresh and entertaining for so many years it has inspired me to do many things that i thought was impossible br br i look forward to the movies next year and i really hope there will be a number of them i never want the show to die br br stargate <UNK> 1997 2007
<START> this movie is not as horrible as most sci fi channel movies i am used to seeing the gray cgi <UNK> and the amateurish special effects such as close ups of fake blood that make it very obvious that the blood is <UNK> <UNK> or some other <UNK> variation however i had thought that i had seen all the possible <UNK> that the sci fi channel could hit then i saw this movie br br imagine a hand inside a <UNK> <UNK> that is <UNK> with <UNK> those are the main alien vampires in this movie you can clearly see the fingers inside the <UNK> <UNK> puppets a talking hand comes out of the guts of victims and the vampire who is on the vampire <UNK> team can talk to these rubber <UNK> puppets in <UNK> how did alien vampires learn <UNK> and isn't <UNK> in romania so shouldn't they be talking romanian why would some little town have their own language if you can suspend your gag <UNK> and get past the talking rubber <UNK> with the fingers clearly moving inside the <UNK> heads then you have to deal with the other alien vampires there are the <UNK> who like to wear the faces of their victims then there are the just plain ugly ones that all seem to have a lot of facial <UNK> then there are the annoying valley girls and their boyfriends who are human <UNK> and sneak into space <UNK> so that they can <UNK> the defense systems so that these space vampires can attack br br finally if you think all of the above is funny and worth a laugh you have to deal with the third rate cast of network tv rejects that make up this team of stereotypical angry heroes which are constantly fighting among themselves why does almost every sci fi channel movie have to use lead characters that are annoying <UNK> crude or just totally unsympathetic i found myself hoping the talking rubber <UNK> would win
<START> not to be confused with the madonna film the next best thing the last big thing is a silly campy off the wall comedy about a man who <UNK> to start a magazine called the next big thing which reviews a variety of up and coming artists this low budget indie makes chuck and buck look like a masterpiece <UNK> with lousy acting poor sets and <UNK> etc thing has earned some awful reviews and to date has only been nominated for one <UNK> award pass on this one
<START> this movie is a bad to alright rip off of friday the 13th the movie is about a killer named <UNK> who kills people around a camp <UNK> training camp he kills people because the camp <UNK> training camp is on land that was owned by his father and when the police came to <UNK> take his fathers land they accidentally killed his mother another <UNK> take off the intro is seeing <UNK> killing his first victims then we are introduced to a family going camping in the same woods soon after they arrive they are joined by a strange old man who likes talking about his son later we learn that his son is <UNK> and that he has him locked up in the back of his <UNK> after having broken him out of a mental <UNK> he sets <UNK> after the family so they can take their stuff and then the chase is on br br this movie is only recommended to those who enjoy b grade 80's slashers
<START> i know that some films i mean european films that are very bad films are being regarded as great cinema by certain critics only because they're non american i saw the 8 1 imdb score for this film and noticed the fact that this was being selected for certain big festivals don't let this fool you unless you're one of those people that likes mind numbing films like this and call it great art afterwards skip it the film contains one hilarious scene after another a similar italian film popped into my mind the terrible <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> del <UNK> i prefer the sound of the sea the problem with these films is that they're not only boring like some other strangely praised films but that they almost play like camp i mean let's face it the acting is horrible i mean soap opera level the story has not one surprise this has been done endless times before connecting several <UNK> short cuts <UNK> playing by heart only much better not one realistic character in it some true freak seeing along the way notice the hilarious zombie like daughter and so on and so on br br as if that's not enough the film is <UNK> min count it long and at the end the director opens his can of sentimentality after a film with such hilariously bad dialogue and scenes that made the public at the preview screening laugh at so much incompetence well this is an insult to cinema and only receives high ratings because it happens to be in another language in this case spanish strange world we live in 3 10
<START> old people show i'm 15 and have been watching the show since i was 12 <UNK> it onto my sky box everyday from hallmark and bbc 1 i really wish they hadn't cancelled it they didn't even get a proper farewell but what an adventure all those episodes i think i've seen them all and not one comes to mind that i didn't like and enjoy br br its a shame the bbc keep <UNK> between <UNK> murder and <UNK> she <UNK> never watched it and don't intend to anyways he characters in <UNK> murder are so in depth and the chemistry between the actors is amazing it really was a sad day when they cancelled this show
<START> this movie is among my favorite foreign films some of the others are <UNK> and my life as a dog the similarities with those movies as with so many great foreign films is that it takes a mundane slice of life and transforms it into a profound heartfelt lesson br br in japan a man who is bored with his mundane life and the <UNK> of his married life sees a beautiful japanese woman staring out the window of a dance studio in the instant that it takes his train to pass he is enthralled by her but is it only by her beauty by her <UNK> glance or a connection that they will both discover that they share br br shall we dance has memorable wonderful characters who have to deal with painful realities by <UNK> them through the world of dance breaking traditional <UNK> and <UNK> types of japanese society they risk all for happiness and find that joy is not too far away it is one of those movies that is so magical and meaningful and in itself <UNK> the mundane by showing the true magic and miracle that life can be
<START> if ever there were an inspiring story that could move anyone disabled or not to <UNK> despite the odds and make it even when make it as an expression proper can have a wide <UNK> which is an ultimately personal truth my left foot is it it's a hard film to watch at times seeing the less <UNK> aspects of christy <UNK> personality emerge in two key scenes one when his sister declares she is pregnant and about to get married while his father has a bad reaction and at a dinner table when the woman who's reached out to him made him able to communicate effectively now has announced at a key moment the <UNK> of <UNK> art she is about to marry another man is tough very very tough more so because this is a man who cannot react <UNK> to these events and can only express himself in the only way he knows how via screams <UNK> and <UNK> aimed at hurting himself however this is not a story of <UNK> and family <UNK> even when there is quite a bit of it <UNK> the <UNK> account but that of a man <UNK> his severe <UNK> becoming a <UNK> human being and a force of be <UNK> with in the art world daniel day lewis won an oscar for his powerful unforgettable performance as the flawed but <UNK> christy brown and brenda <UNK> did so as well for her supporting role as <UNK> solid mother
<START> this is simply the epitome of what a made for tv movie should be it was a lazy sunday afternoon when my wife and i were in <UNK> school that we stumbled upon this the cheesy acting the poorly written script the good ol' boys the ridiculous yet somehow obvious clich√© and banal premise the riding in pickup <UNK> with your <UNK> up wife corpse it has it all br br you will meet familiar characters gold digging <UNK> stupid rich boy who wants to make it on his own friends who know better daddy who knows better but drives son away and the wife corpse <UNK> up in a pick up br br wow and the title several things in our lives have been texas <UNK> since watching this beauty everyone involved in its creation deserves a <UNK>
<START> i knew about this as a similar programme as jackass and i saw one or two episodes on <UNK> and it is the same only more extreme basically three <UNK> guys and one mad british bloke were brought together by love of <UNK> and a complete disregard <UNK> pleasure to harm themselves and their health and safety they have had <UNK> eating <UNK> covered pizza jumping in <UNK> <UNK> naked paint <UNK> jokes on the smaller guy while heavily sleeping <UNK> stunts in a work place e g army <UNK> and many more insane stunts that cause <UNK> <UNK> blood and vomit maybe not just for themselves starring matthew <UNK> who does pretty much anything lee <UNK> also up for just about anything dan <UNK> the british one who hardly does much physical stuff and has a <UNK> laugh and <UNK> mike locke who does a lot but is more popular for being short fat and lazy it was number something on the 100 greatest funny moments very good
<START> <UNK> are not exactly renowned for their kind <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> what with stories of fights chaos murder and of course extreme male bonding but the prison in this film is a different beast altogether horror films set in cells are as you probably know nothing particularly new as they emphasis and <UNK> the fear of <UNK> and the inability of escape ¬ñ two of the greatest themes in horror cinema with such examples as the chair <UNK> <UNK> 1988 the green mile frank <UNK> 1999 alien 3 david <UNK> 1992 and of course the entire women in prison exploitation genre itself another entry into this <UNK> has to be something inventive and a lot of fun to boot in order to be <UNK> or at least that's what you'd have thought prison is certainly an incredibly fun and enjoyable ride and it's somewhat of a shame that it isn't as well known as it should be br br the film in short <UNK> on an old prison well duh which has been <UNK> however it's not just fellow inmates and guards the prisoners have to fear but also a mean ass demon ghost spirit with only one thing on its mind death and boy are we treated to some awesome death scenes i won't spoil anything here for you but there are plenty of innovative and enjoyable murders all done by invisible hands br br besides the special effects and the murders this film also has another thing going for it it's cast <UNK> we have lord of the rings peter jackson 2001 2003 star viggo <UNK> and for all those so inclined yes he does get naked whose performance is not only highly believable but is done with such skill that his eastwood esquire character is both bad to the bone and likable a very delicate mix add him to a cast of <UNK> wait a minute i know that <UNK> actors and you've got yourself one great set of stars the characters themselves however lack three <UNK> and more often than not come across as very stereotypical we've got a black <UNK> a hard as nails prison warden a human rights <UNK> woman and plenty of other stock characters but in all honesty this <UNK> actually aids the film instead of boring character development in an over long <UNK> we are <UNK> more or less straight into the action and once it gets going very early on there's not a single scene that's a filler ¬ñ it's balls to the wall plot unlike a certain <UNK> redemption frank <UNK> 1994 sharing conventions with the slasher genre this is somewhat of a convention itself and in good ol' slasher genre tradition prison <UNK> those who have been bad br br all in all this is an excellent little horror film and one which is sadly overlooked and <UNK> among the horror world with an excellent cast and great special effects and rather original death scenes this film is highly recommended to horror fans don't be fooled into thinking it'll be a cheesy little film either just because it was made in usa 1980s it's far from cheesy although the very end does ruin this and simultaneously far from gritty and realistic whilst it attempts to tackle issues such as prison rape these are rather subtly done br br i give it 3 5 out of 5 <UNK> a very entertaining horror film with some very nice touches indeed
<START> anyone familiar with my reviews on the internet movie <UNK> will know that i can be a grumpy bastard from time to time there are a lot of films i don't like which for some <UNK> reason i've felt the urge to review however if anyone out there is curious to know the name of the worst film i've ever seen look no further than <UNK> 6 <UNK> without question this takes the title of the all time no 1 awful film i can't believe that i actually made it from the start of this <UNK> to the finish br br it is clearly meant to capture the <UNK> of mel <UNK> young frankenstein but where that film was a funny take on horror movie traditions this one is a desperately strained and misguided attempt to <UNK> laughs from embarrassingly weak material jeff goldblum and ed <UNK> jr look ashamed to be here as a pair of <UNK> in modern day <UNK> perhaps they realised early on that they were doomed in this dud during their research they come up against all the chief monsters from past horror favourites such as vampires werewolves and <UNK> br br anyone who manages to brave this film right through to its end may pray that a stake be driven through their heart to <UNK> them from the agony of boredom it marks a career <UNK> for everyone involved and proves that when comedy fails in a big way it results in <UNK> dire entertainment
<START> there's perhaps a special reason why the fox and the child hit a special note in my heart having just said goodbye to my new fianc√©e of oh one day for an unknown period of time i was a bit overwhelmed with varying emotions and was suffering the <UNK> from putting on the brave face she needed to see br br i watched a few movies and tv shows but my interest <UNK> from what i was leaving behind to what is out there and what i haven't seen for that i have this movie to thank br br being a nature lover and having heard about the film beforehand i was sure i was going to like it anyway but i didn't just like it i loved it br br the technical <UNK> is astounding how did they do it how did they capture the animals in the way they did it's just wonderful br br the moral of the tale is a good one and while the ending is oh so french and ambiguous it's a happy sad one again it caught me a bit off guard as a man who usually keeps his emotions to himself the ending was tough going while on a plane full of people i would be seeing for the next 15 or so hours perhaps it's because the ending made me think back to what i left br br but for those few hours on the plane i was happy to see something new and original and that's life sure there are those things you love and feel comfortable around but the great <UNK> holds many a mystery so the next time i see something out of the ordinary while out in the open i'm going to explore it observe it and embrace it that's precisely what happens in this movie and that's precisely what you should do with this darn good movie nature doc too 8 10 br br p s it's two months on from the plane journey we still don't know when we'll see each other again but we will
<START> once again a film classic has been <UNK> remade with predictably disastrous results the title is false as is everything about this film the period is not <UNK> rendered and the leads seem way too young and too vapid to even be criminals arthur <UNK> film had style humor a point of view and was made by talented people even if the 1967 version didn't exist this would still be an unnecessary film the 1967 version <UNK> from the facts presented a <UNK> version of bonnie and clyde but it was exciting and innovative for 1967 and it had some outstanding performances that allowed you to care this 1992 remake seems <UNK> from the original film rather than the truth as known and the actors in this version are <UNK> unappealing and not the least bit interesting by all means skip this one and hope the <UNK> version will be better could it possibly be worse
<START> how can such good actors like jean <UNK> and carole <UNK> could have been involved in such a a well such a thing i can't get it it was awful very <UNK> played but some of the few leading roles the jokes are dumb and absolutely not funny i won't talk more about this movie except for one little piece of advice do not go see it it will be a waste of time and money
<START> this may or may not be the worst movie that steve martin has ever made but it certainly was far from his best obviously he did this crap for the pay check dreck like this certainly does nothing to enhance his reputation as a funny man what he doesn't seem to grasp is that when people go to see a steve martin movie they expect to be entertained not bored to tears it's sad that he dragged dan <UNK> and phil <UNK> down with him i don't understand why talented people can't get a grip on the fact that people don't want to see them in lousy movies if you're going to call a movie a comedy then it should be funny this wasn't shame on the us military for allowing itself to be associated with this <UNK> too full metal jacket had more laughs than this miserable excuse for a service comedy surely phil <UNK> is rolling over in his grave
<START> the 700 club gives a great perspective on world events some have described it as <UNK> or cheesy i find the program to be informative and inspirational it is only natural for many to throw mud on a program that has proved to be so successful there are very few shows that can point to a 40 year track record of success in the world of television media and the 700 club is one of them while mr robertson may have been wrong to say that someone should be <UNK> i find it curious that so many people will literally trip over themselves to hop on the <UNK> of criticism i have certainly said some foolish things in my life i would certainly be willing to forgive mr robertson since he puts out a great show
<START> with harry callahan getting up in years the inevitable old man with a chip on his <UNK> story had to come into play eventually callahan looking fragile sometimes and out of place his demeanor still was <UNK> thankfully this film took some time off to develop a different type of story one that might <UNK> the dirty harry and the whole genre while the film fell short in doing so it was still an excellent addition to the series even if it was getting a little out of place during a time of silly fashion <UNK> and new wave music
<START> what kind of sh t is this power rangers vs freddy it was watchable and as good as the first film in the beginning but from the part where the protagonists get super powers in theirs dreams it started to become childish this sh t should have been rated pg or pg 13 rather than r i expected to see some very mature stuff but it was only for the 1 3 of the film the rest are for little kids plus it's focused too much on christianity i know freddy's a demon but there are many <UNK> that have different ways to fight demons why does it always have to be christianity this is total <UNK> and filled with white men <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> watch this show it to little kids who loves power rangers
<START> having worked in downtown manhattan and often ate my lunch during the summer days in the park near city hall i would see the mayor come and go it was great being able to go beyond the doors of city hall and see what it looked like in the <UNK> and through out the entire building al pacino mayor john <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gave an outstanding performance through out the entire picture and especially when he gave a speech at an african american church for a little boy who was <UNK> john cusack deputy mayor kevin <UNK> runaway jury <UNK> was a devoted servant to the mayor and <UNK> him in everything he attempted to accomplish bridget fonda <UNK> <UNK> starts to fall in love with kevin <UNK> and gives a great supporting role last but not least danny aiello frank <UNK> off key <UNK> played a mob boss who had some very difficult choices to make towards the end of the picture great film with great acting and fantastic photography in nyc
<START> the last big thing is a wonderful satirical film that <UNK> <UNK> pop culture to the point of humorous self <UNK> the characters are so interesting and fun to laugh at sympathize with which brings me to an introduction to the characters i liked best br br simon <UNK> is a man in his late 30s early 40s who creates a pop culture driven <UNK> magazine called the next big thing thing is this magazine <UNK> really exist and it is only an excuse for simon to get close to actors by <UNK> them only to bitch slap them silly insulting their way of buying into pop culture his live in female friend <UNK> is also writing a magazine which is real which mainly has to do with her and simon as well as her and her father <UNK> is a genuinely <UNK> or <UNK> character depending on how you view her muted neurotic behavior <UNK> is a prostitute the character i liked the best brent is a flat character with not much to him as is <UNK> the music video queen for a bunch of b rated rock bands still these characters <UNK> a very interesting web together and this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it its a wonderful film and i suggest you see it if you're in the indie art house crowd mark my words br br
<START> the only redeeming part of this movie was the price i paid at least all i lost was 3 00 and the time <UNK> sitting through this bomb the crew member who was in charge of continuity missed the boat when the female lead and the fbi guy went to the alleged killers location mr fbi handed the female a revolver when the alleged killer came out the door the revolver has magically transformed into an automatic one is left to <UNK> would an <UNK> agent hand a weapon to a <UNK> i think not ms <UNK> appears to be a very attractive female it is too bad the r rating did not allow much of her to be seen it would seem that a film editor cut what might have been the best parts of the film out
<START> don't be <UNK> as i was by the <UNK> reviews <UNK> on the dvd box wildly entertaining a seriously scary <UNK> and the worst of all on par with jaws this movie is none of the above br br normally i don't bother with writing bad reviews for films but i can't believe this one is <UNK> at a comfortable 7 on imdb it doesn't deserve it br br after a so so opening daylight attack by a monster created by what else <UNK> dumped by lazy scientists this movie goes absolutely nowhere and it goes there <UNK> basically and <UNK> a girl is <UNK> by the monster i'll give them points for a good creature design but this ain't no <UNK> creation and her semi comical family spend an hour and a half tracking her down in the <UNK> surrounding the han river their search lacks any suspense again someone called this on par with jaws and by the time they find her you realize it was all pretty much pointless other than that a big bulk of the movie is committed to a government <UNK> that <UNK> in one funny scene involving a guy spitting in a <UNK> in front of a crowded bus stop br br <UNK> this was bad i'm not kidding you want to see a rotten monster movie rent deep rising at least you'll save 30 minutes of your life
<START> this like murder she wrote is one of those shows that after a <UNK> day at school i sit down in front of the tv and watch why because i genuinely enjoy it and it's a shame it's not on the air anymore dick van dyke is amazing as dr mark <UNK> a doctor turned detective who with his son <UNK> murders he is joined by a largely unknown but very competent supporting cast namely his real life son barry van dyke victoria <UNK> is also good but i noticed that every series her <UNK> changes i also liked scott <UNK> and charlie <UNK> but i particularly loved michael <UNK> as norman and was puzzled how he suddenly disappeared this show is so entertaining with great guest stars it's a bit obvious at times like <UNK> but in every episode there is always something to chuckle about in conclusion a great series with two thumbs up and a 10 10 <UNK> cox
<START> the ogre is a film made for tv in italy and wasn't intended to be a sequel to demons as <UNK> <UNK> even mentions it on the interview on the <UNK> show dvd but it was called demons iii to be part of the demons series the music in demons and demons 2 was 80's rock music while this is more creepy music and while the first two was gory horror demons iii the ogre is a <UNK> horror so that's how demons iii isn't a proper sequel to demons but i still like this film br br the music is creepy and that adds a tone to the castle that the film is set in the ogre is another thing why i like the film there are two other films that are <UNK> as demons iii and that is black demons <UNK> 3 and the church demons 3 demons iii the ogre is a good film as long as you don't compare it with demons and demons 2
<START> i gotta be straight up i haven't seen a film as solid as dog bite dog in quite a while i'm a big fan of the old school late 80s to mid 90s era <UNK> films and i had been hearing that that style of films is making a bit of a come back with films such as this and herman <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which as of this writing i have not yet seen so i was very interested to give some of these newer wave <UNK> films a shot did this film live up to my expectations absolutely but not quite in the fashion that i imagined br br the story follows a young <UNK> <UNK> and virtually <UNK> <UNK> hit man with a somewhat vague history who comes to hong kong to complete a mission due to some bad luck he is quickly identified by a <UNK> copy who exudes many of the same qualities as our hit man and is quickly <UNK> and captured this state of affairs doesn't last long though as the un named assassin escapes from his <UNK> and quickly shows the local police that he is not to be taken lightly the hunt is on and a cat and mouse game between the police and the mad dog as the police refer to him ensues along the way mad dog is inadvertently <UNK> by a slow witted young woman and a bond forms between the two when she helps him out of a <UNK> situation the <UNK> keeps getting <UNK> as mad <UNK> only objective is to get out of hong kong and back to thailand by any means necessary and the cops keep trying to reel him in alive br br i could probably write ten <UNK> about this complex and thoroughly layered film but i don't want to give too much away i watched dog bite dog knowing nothing about the premise and i think it's the type of film that is definitely better appreciated that way as to comparisons to the older style <UNK> films there are some similarities dog bite dog has some hyper violent moments reminiscent of the good ol' days but is never quite as sleazy or <UNK> as old school <UNK> like the <UNK> story or red to kill where many of the older <UNK> <UNK> main intention was to shock dog bite dog is a far more thought out and well rounded production though that's not to take anything away from those <UNK> films that i hold so dear this film is far more emotional than it is exploitative and as we learn more about the characters and their backgrounds the audience begins to bond and identify with both sides there really are no clear cut good and bad guys as mad dog shows moments of extreme compassion and the cops <UNK> to extremely <UNK> methods to try to flesh out the killer there's also no nudity sex in this film which is a typical characteristic of the older <UNK> films personally i would compare dog bite dog more to <UNK> sympathy for mr vengeance or perhaps the <UNK> brother's <UNK> dangerous as both of those films mixed extremely emotional overtones with strong and <UNK> action and violence again there's pretty much nothing that i didn't like about this film the acting is dead on the cinematography is sharp and well done and the whole film <UNK> <UNK> several different elements successfully in a way that isn't seen very often is this film and others like it the <UNK> of the <UNK> film not exactly but it is a very solid film that's absolutely worth checking out 9 10
<START> from very long we are seeing movies on gandhi and mostly the light is always on portrayal of gandhi as freedom fighter or man with principles but when i heard that a movie is being made which will highlight gandhi as father and stress on his relationship with his son it instantly hit my attention as this is one territory which is least being explored as it has his own dark side and less people shown courage to <UNK> into it <UNK> anil kapoor producer and <UNK> <UNK> khan director did br br the story start with gandhi working in south africa and his relationship with white people and his wife latter akshay harilal joined his father for becoming a <UNK> but his dream took <UNK> when his father gandhi pushed or <UNK> him to become freedom fighter it showcase that gandhi believes more on practical study rather then <UNK> education harilal too try to walk on his father <UNK> but soon failed as its <UNK> towards his wife children and his own dream of becoming big success altered his path and then start the <UNK> between son and father he finally defeated his father in terms of pursuing his dream and to left him on his own terms he written back to india but then start his <UNK> stories which become bigger and bigger with time i am leaving reader to see movie to catch further story br br performance first akshay he has given best performance of his <UNK> so far and is absolutely convincing in his portrayal as harilal gandhi the scene in which he reach the room where his wife dead body is placed is one where you can see a fine actor which is hidden developing in akshay <UNK> <UNK> is also good as <UNK> gandhi and able to live up such a larger then life character he performed well and with quite an ease <UNK> <UNK> now shah as <UNK> is brilliant actress and already proved her metal in tv serials <UNK> <UNK> too performed well but actress of her <UNK> is waste in these kinds of role other actor have also <UNK> their performances br br technique and make up is also good and cinematography especially that duo tone color <UNK> was too good costume looks and match with context br br overall a worth seeing movie which is <UNK> slow in progress and <UNK> people may find it boring but give you an insight of area which is not brought to silver screen till date also the way story progress and connection of scene may look worn to some people and to critics especially but for an average movie watcher like me it still enough to make me occupied on my seat till end
<START> okay so someone somewhere a few years ago thought it would be a good idea to make a 3d <UNK> movie about some flies <UNK> away aboard the apollo 11 and going to the moon so they did someone somewhere was an idiot br br i want to give the artists props for doing their <UNK> on the <UNK> as far as i can tell the rockets and the launch <UNK> were bang on the graphics in general were pretty good the rocket launch gave me chills like a good rocket launch always does my popular <UNK> flying car <UNK> blood still runs strong and the 3d was pretty effective the cg wasn't pixar quality but it was generally good the flies were kinda mediocre <UNK> with some half <UNK> late 60s characters thrown in for colour hippie flies african american flies with giant <UNK> and black shades etc and the <UNK> looked more like <UNK> with human baby heads although they made suitably gross <UNK> noises br br the <UNK> certainly did not do their <UNK> relying on offensive and outdated clich√©s 60s gender politics including mostly useless female characters racial stereotypes evil russians a fat fly who only wants to eat grade two level gross out humour in a movie aimed for <UNK> they blew a wonderful opportunity to sneak in some educational content about physics and space travel they didn't get their physics right zero g in the <UNK> <UNK> during landing burn please they couldn't even be bothered to read the original radio <UNK> between <UNK> and the <UNK> all of which is in the public <UNK> instead they wrote their own dialogue which sounds like crap br br but we liked the <UNK> br br so they get a point and a half for rockets and <UNK> uh <UNK> 1 5 5
<START> the third installment of the <UNK> trilogy features a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> quality military <UNK> trying to kill two <UNK> and a t rex i give it a 4 out of sheer sympathy and my <UNK> for dinosaurs the movie is definitely the worst of the trilogy it really can't be taken seriously more significantly however watching this movie i can't help but notice some interesting parallels between the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the first installment in both <UNK> is a dark disturbing film that has become a cult classic the second is an alien ripoff and the third is a tongue in cheek almost slapstick whether intentional or not movie that has you rolling on the floor laughing also like the <UNK> franchise all the <UNK> movies are completely unrelated to one another they they only carry the franchise name to drum up interest in the sequels i guess obviously <UNK> and <UNK> have two different production groups at work here but if you've seen all three movies of both <UNK> you find yourself referring back and forth between the two
<START> the writer director of this film obviously doesn't know anything about film i think the <UNK> on this project was tied up and replaced with a monkey because every seen was either too dark or had the <UNK> hot spots than the sun br br the story was awful the characters were very one dimensional for someone to have said that this film was made for poker fans and not film fans that someone is kidding their self it was probably the writer director no poker fan in this world likes this movie even your money man hates this project to go into a casino and play a few hands doesn't give you the experience to write about poker keep your day job and if it's playing poker then you must be <UNK>
<START> i recently watched caprica again and thought i might as well come and write up a review i first saw this right after i saw the series finale of battlestar galactica being a big <UNK> fan boy of the show left me <UNK> onto anything i could of the shows universe so i didn't know what to expect but i did come out with a smile though i must admit br br the story starts off dramatically on planet of caprica and we are introduced with a variety of interesting characters i won't give too much away but there is a dramatic event that <UNK> the course of the story but i suggest you watch this br br must say <UNK> <UNK> is one hell of an actor he pulled off a young joseph <UNK> father of the <UNK> in battlestar galactica i found his acting spot on and i could believe that he is the father of william <UNK> from bsg br br also eric <UNK> fits his role precisely special note it was good to see polly walker outside of rome don't sit down and watch caprica with the expectation of it being like battlestar galactica because the story line is pretty straight forward and anyone can watch it without having to have see bsg br br this show is a well written drama for those who like there drama with a bit of a sci fi kick
<START> another pokemon movie has hit the theaters and again i'm hearing the same old pokemon is dead blah blah blah the <UNK> <UNK> couldn't be more wrong kids are still playing the <UNK> card game they're still watching the tv series they're waiting for the game boy advance games and they want to see pokemon the 4th movie br br that said pokemon the 4th movie introduces us to two more legendary pokemon <UNK> the north wind of <UNK> and <UNK> guardian of the forest and star of the show <UNK> <UNK> itself and a boy named sam 40 years into the future to the present day where pokemon <UNK> ash his faithful <UNK> and his friends <UNK> and misty are traveling through <UNK> sam and ash become fast friends once they discover the other's mutual love for pokemon <UNK> vintage <UNK> with screw on top is a great moment together they decide to protect <UNK> from the villain of the story the team rocket agent <UNK> named vicious who is hell bent on capturing <UNK> for his own ends will ash and sam be able to protect <UNK> from <UNK> dark balls where does <UNK> fit into the picture will jessie james and <UNK> have bigger parts in this movie than before and just who is sam really br br like with the first 3 movies if you go into the movie deciding that you're automatically going to hate it no matter what simply because it's pokemon or just because your child niece nephew younger sibling et <UNK> dragged you into it then you're going to hate it because you've decided that you want to hate it that may be but to <UNK> trash pokemon the 4th movie simply because it is a pokemon movie and especially without having seen it is just plain stupid even non fans can enjoy this movie without having to know every last detail of the world of pokemon i'm not saying that you will become a pokemon fan because of this movie but you can indeed enjoy it if you'll let yourself br br unlike the first 3 pokemon movies pokemon the 4th movie is being distributed by <UNK> who i've heard is also working on <UNK> the rights to the <UNK> pokemon movie which was released this past summer in japan <UNK> claims to have some <UNK> aggressive marketing <UNK> for pokemon the 4th movie but all i've seen so far is a feeble limited release which doesn't include the usual <UNK> short in the beginning which i was really looking forward to this time i hope that <UNK> will see fit to put the <UNK> short called <UNK> exciting hide and seek onto at least the dvd vhs release if not with a future wider release of pokemon the 4th movie i hope that the current release is just the tip of the iceberg for this very entertaining film
<START> this is not only one of the greatest jackie chan films but also one of the greatest kung fu movies of all time br br we've come to expect crazy stunts and fast creative action in chan's movies and this one set the <UNK> for others to follow it's two hours of pure entertainment that <UNK> all the way through br br as well as the superb action we have a <UNK> storyline and believable characters with chan taking what appears to be a more western approach to the writing mixing eastern resolution methods ie kicking ass br br overall it's funny serious entertaining and groundbreaking a must for any kung fu fan whilst at the same time remaining accessible to the wider reaches of the film community
<START> michelle rodriguez is a well built high school senior who discovers that she has a powerful punch and begins amateur training at a brooklyn gym <UNK> douglas is a a handsome young man barely older than she who also trains there they meet after class so to speak and feel attracted to each other no sex <UNK> has been <UNK> to save it for his next bout br br both are participants in a gender blind athletic program that makes no <UNK> between males and females a misguided attempt to level the athletic playing field br br a conservative radio <UNK> recently announced and i swear i'm not making this up let's face it the president is black i'm here to make an equally <UNK> observation men and women are different now in 99 cases out of 100 this <UNK> make any difference in physical performance but in the top one percent trained <UNK> whose skills have been <UNK> to a fine edge men generally have the advantage with their narrow <UNK> they can run faster and they have greater muscle mass and upper <UNK> strength these differences in body build make it possible for women to give birth and raise children and for men to catch and kill food for them this sexual <UNK> is the result of the perfectly normal process of natural selection without it there might not be any humans at all and that boys and girls is why they have men's events and women's events at the <UNK> i speak to you as your <UNK> that will be ten cents <UNK> preferred br br that's why i called this gender blind program misguided as talented a boxer as <UNK> is as she approaches the <UNK> of the game she will eventually lose to a male br br that's where the <UNK> <UNK> in this movie <UNK> is finally matched against her boy friend douglas neither wants to loose any anger on the other not to mention <UNK> rights but the pride of both is at stake and the pride is both personal and gender related douglas refuses to fight a woman in the ring and rodriguez is offended by what she sees as his <UNK> attitude it ends happily br br i wasn't really expecting much from the film i thought it would be a rip off of clint eastwood's million dollar baby until i discovered that this was released years earlier and i'd never heard of the director or of any of the performers that sort of obscurity generally <UNK> ill made for television <UNK> and so forth br br but i was surprised at how neatly this is put together the total absence of <UNK> left me open mouthed so did the minimal use of boxing clich√©s the <UNK> <UNK> the blood the cutting of the <UNK> eye the <UNK> post bout faces the fat and <UNK> <UNK> shouting kill him the slow motion landing of <UNK> on nose the <UNK> of sweat from the <UNK> head the heroic music <UNK> the long <UNK> <UNK> of the victor none of that here well almost none the whole plot could be considered formulaic tough kid finds <UNK> in the ring etc br br the feeling you're left with is that this is probably pretty much what these amateur <UNK> are like different from those we see on tv and in ordinary movies no <UNK> ring for instance instead a dancing and <UNK> <UNK> yells stop and box the contestants wear head gear the gym is populated not by a crowd of cheering <UNK> but only by a handful of people who have some particular interest in the goings on it's a clean movie despite the rather grim setting and the unhappy family dynamics br br michelle rodriguez can look pretty mean what with her muscular bulk and her eyes glowing under her <UNK> brow but once you get used to the idea that this is a girl who can beat you to a pulp anytime she wants and once you hear the feminine <UNK> of her <UNK> she ain't bad a scene in which she battles her father to the floor is <UNK> it it was a little hard to understand <UNK> restraint when rodriguez <UNK> all over him in bed the director <UNK> <UNK> has chosen her talent carefully br br shows what you can do with some talent imagination and a <UNK> of money there ought to be more films like it take one of those multi billion dollar blockbusters full of dinosaurs or space ships and spread the <UNK> around a little
<START> not very interesting teen <UNK> saved from being a turkey from some decent performances the main cast <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and surprisingly meredith monroe are all good but the story is not very original
<START> what is this a low budget sex comedy anyway it describes perfectly the people in spain they could come up with a better idea i mean they do this kind of movies since the 60s and people like them this is neither a teen comedy nor a family one you can't let your 12 year old watch 2 guys in bed kissing he'll never want to go to spain this should be rated r because only people 35 seem to laugh watching s i'm truly disappointed maybe i don't like gays which is quite an important part of the movie br br foreign humor is awful in films except kusturica stick with doing dramas if you want a new comedy try <UNK> nights
<START> with the exception of about 10 sublime minutes with <UNK> warner on the <UNK> train this was <UNK> minutes of jaw dropping <UNK> the acting was atrocious but the story is what i really found appalling the acting was wooden and stilted even by early <UNK> standards the exceptions being lee tracy and <UNK> warner neither of whom can do wrong rose <UNK> was absolutely horrid and lifeless as julie as she likewise was in <UNK> dr <UNK> and mr hyde an otherwise excellent flick and the rest of the cast was worse there being no words to describe their awfulness br br worse than the acting however was the story for some unknown reason julie loves <UNK> a <UNK> and user of women with no redeeming qualities whatsoever he marries julie but doesn't support her instead lying in bed all day or hanging out with his low life criminal pal lee tracy and oh yeah he never has a kind word to say to julie and he regularly beats her julie loves him nonetheless and continually makes excuses for him which only seems to make him more abusive what's even <UNK> is that this movie presents this story to us as a love story somehow we are supposed to see julie as a noble character whose pure love <UNK> <UNK> wtf br br the last 1 3 of this movie takes place after <UNK> has killed himself a robbery plot goes awry and <UNK> <UNK> a knife into himself rather than being taken in by the police as he lay dying he tells julie i beat you all the time but i'm not sorry for it when he at last dies she finally tells him she loves him neither character ever said i love you to the other while they were alive after his death god's chief <UNK> gives <UNK> one more day on earth so that he can do something good for his unborn daughter the price for this is 10 years in hell after 10 years <UNK> is allowed one day on earth to see his now 10 <UNK> old daughter he approaches her in the front yard of her home and tries to <UNK> her into letting him do something good for her he tries to get her to play cards he tries to give her <UNK> horn but she's not interested and <UNK> him so he <UNK> her he <UNK> her and then he disappears back to the <UNK> looking on we see his daughter tell julie about this the girl says the slap didn't hurt that it felt like a kiss this is supposed to be the movie's magical moment the girl asks her mother if such a thing is possible and julie replies that someone can be beat you and beat you and beat you and not hurt you at all then the music <UNK> and <UNK> rides up to heaven in the <UNK> train <UNK> br br there was one saving grace to this film and that is the interview between the chief <UNK> <UNK> warner was truly magnificent here and <UNK> on the <UNK> train the <UNK> had some very profound things to say to <UNK> about life and second chances and death this scene alone made me <UNK> this rating from 1 to 2 stars regarding <UNK> suicide as a means for escaping his problems the <UNK> says people suppose that when they die their difficulties are ended for them you thought that by killing yourself that you would <UNK> all your <UNK> it is not as simple as that on earth your name is still spoken your face is still remembered as long as one is left who remembers you so long is the matter <UNK> until you have been completely forgotten you will not be finished with the earth even though you are dead some great sublime <UNK> stuff amongst some of the most horrible trash i've ever seen br br by the way this story has apparently been filmed many times both as <UNK> and as the musical <UNK>
<START> this is truly truly one of the best movies about love that i've ever seen closely followed by none other than before sunset which technically isn't another movie at all since it's about the same two people and the same romance br br this is love in the real world ok that's only if most people are as intelligent and <UNK> as the leads in the movie reading the other reviews it <UNK> me to know how so many other folks are crazy over dialog based movies as well and this is what makes before sunrise so good the dialog is perfect it's so real so engaging and funny it's hardly a surprise that jesse and celine fall in love <UNK> you fall in love with them at the very same time br br my favorite scene is the one in the coffee shop where they pretend to phone their best friends with the other pretending to be said best friend it's perfect brings you back to the very moment when you fell in love for the very first time in your life br br i must say that if you have a choice do watch before sunrise before watching before sunset if like me you watched sunset first it's hard to shake off the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lovers throughout the entire show br br once again the greatest romantic movie in my books wonderful acting excellent script and beautiful locations young love at it's best
<START> yes in 35 years of film going i have finally viewed the stinker that surpasses all other ghastly movies i have seen beating <UNK> will <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> for sheer awfulness this is pretentious <UNK> of the first order not even entertaining pretentious <UNK> the effects are cheap and worse pointless br br the script seems to have been written by a first year film student who doesn't get out much but wants to appear full of <UNK> the acting is simply <UNK> bad <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a career filled with vacuous <UNK> with a performance which <UNK> <UNK> between <UNK> and laughable <UNK> apparently some fool out there has allowed the director of this film to make another one be warned
<START> i gather from reading the previous comments that this film went straight to cable well i paid to see it in a theatre and i'm glad i did because visually it was a striking film most of the settings seem like they were made in the early 60s except for the <UNK> office which was dated in a different way and if you leave the <UNK> campbell sequences out the whole film has a washed out early 60s <UNK> and the use of <UNK> in the film was fascinating for a first time director whose background i believe is in writing he has a great eye within the first ten minutes i felt the plot lacked <UNK> so i just willingly suspended my disbelief and went along for the ride in terms of acting and the depiction of father son mother son husband wife parent child relationships the film was spot on william h macy a pleasure to watch seems to be filling the void left by the late tony <UNK> if this and <UNK> are any indication <UNK> <UNK> as the neglected wife was quite moving to me it was a three dimensional depiction of a character too often viewed by society as two dimensional of course donald sutherland can add this to his collection of unforgettable portrayals the depiction of the parents <UNK> sutherland reminded me in an <UNK> way of vincent <UNK> buffalo <UNK> although toned down quite a bit i would definitely pay money to see a second film from this director he has the self discipline of a 50s b <UNK> director something p t anderson will never have yet he has a visual style and a way with actors that <UNK> attention
<START> jim carrey and morgan freeman along with jennifer aniston combine to make one of the funniest movies so far this 2003 season late may and a good improvement on <UNK> past crazy and personally <UNK> roles in past comedies with a slightly toned down carrey antics yet with just the <UNK> and <UNK> of his old self carrey <UNK> carries this movie to the height of laughter and also some dramatic <UNK> somber moments elements of <UNK> real acting abilities continue to show up in this movie this delightful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons including dramatic elements along with the goofy moments that fit perfectly with this script while still lacking in the superbly polished ensemble of comedy drama bruce <UNK> deserves credit for being a great date movie along with a solid message and soft spiritual cynicism and parody that maintains its good natured taste eight out of ten stars
<START> sarah silverman is really the flavor of the month comic right now is she really worth all the hype yes and no she is funny at times sometimes hilariously so her <UNK> routine is actually quite interesting though not always funny other times you're feeling cheated by the media for <UNK> yet another performer she is one of those really cute comedians that men especially flock to saying that they dig her intelligence and wit but if you corner them most men will admit that they just want to sleep with her and that's why they watch her she reminds me of why many men <UNK> to margaret <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> even though neither of them are really hot now in terms of popularity sarah doesn't drink or smoke at least <UNK> so she should be hot when she's 60 so her fans especially the male ones can <UNK> br br as for this show it's very much like her comedy when it works it's hilarious when it doesn't it's full blown tedium and very very boring the aids episode here is the best one it's consistently funny and has some really good satire in it brian <UNK> character has an <UNK> obsession with <UNK> in one episode and it's hilarious seeing him in a <UNK> t shirt but they never really go anywhere with it and it eventually wears out its welcome <UNK> character in the series is rather annoying the gay couple brian <UNK> and some other guy seems tacked on and never really does anything for the show as a whole and the supporting players including <UNK> real life sister laura who doesn't look a thing like her are ok when the jokes hit they're brilliant when they don't they're awful and i mean really awful there's also an obsession with <UNK> here aka <UNK> jokes which seems to have replaced actual wit and intelligence in comedy today so should you watch this show if you have a crush on sarah go for it you can <UNK> at her and pretend she's yours as for her show it's <UNK> from good to absolute zero
<START> the only kung fu epic worth watching the best training ever the main character spending a hundred day's on his knees outside the shaolin temple show how desperate he is to learn kung fu to fight the <UNK> dogs who have taken over china
<START> on the surface this movie would appear to deal with the psychological process called <UNK> that is how to become a true self by <UNK> the so called <UNK> side of human nature thus we have the <UNK> a classic shadowy <UNK> creature desperately seeking the company that is recognition of men and the story revolves around the various ways in which this need is handled more or less successfully br br however if we dig a little deeper we find that what this movie is actually about is how you should relate to your car like you would to any other person in the opening scene the main character male car mechanic fallen from grace is collecting bits and pieces from car <UNK> with his daughter when a car wreck nearly <UNK> the little girl lesson 1 cars are persons <UNK> with immortal souls and stealing from car <UNK> is identical with grave robbery the wicked have disturbed the dead and must be <UNK> just after that another character <UNK> buys a car wreck <UNK> to <UNK> it and sell it as a once lost now found famous race car and is warned by the salesman lesson 2 just like any other person a car has a unique identity that cannot be altered nor replaced in addition there is the twist that <UNK> actually sees a hidden quality in what most people would just think of as junk but eventually that quality turns out to be a projection of <UNK> own personal greed for more profit lesson 3 <UNK> <UNK> never treat <UNK> car as a means only but always as an end in itself then we have the scene where the main character is introduced to <UNK> and more importantly <UNK> car the main character's <UNK> of the <UNK> qualities is not just based on its outer appearance but also by a <UNK> look inside the engine room lesson 4 a car is not just to be judged by its looks it is what is inside that really counts there is punishment in store for those who do not keep this lesson in mind as we see in the scene where another man tries to sell <UNK> a fake <UNK> car this scene by the way also <UNK> the importance of lesson 3 br br there are numerous other examples in the movie of the <UNK> <UNK> theme and i am too tired now to bother <UNK> all of them but the point remains and i guess this is what i'm really trying to say that this movie is fun to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do or if you're a car <UNK>
<START> there is something about pet sematary that i never felt anywhere else maybe the fact i was a kid when i first watched it made this experience so memorable but as i keep watching it over and over again it never gets old and i never get bored from the opening credits with that creepy opening song to the very chaotic ending there is something insane sad and scary at the same time and it keeps <UNK> in your head sometimes dead is better br br i don't think it would be useful to relate the whole story again all you need to know is it starts from point a the most perfect situation for a happy american family and step by step <UNK> to point b which is believe me the very end of all joy the music is perfect the story makes sense the special effects are cool and the pet sematary is the last place on earth i would be like i said sometimes dead is better
<START> i have yet to read a negative professional review of this movie i guess i must have missed something the beginning is intriguing the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and entertain each other with invented stories that's the best part after the three go their separate ways the film <UNK> into three threads that's when boredom sets in certainly the thread with the <UNK> <UNK> who make dolls out of <UNK> bread is at first an eye opening curiosity unfortunately the director beat this one to death even <UNK> a wild plot line that leads nowhere in particular bottom line a two hour plot thin <UNK> if you suffer from insomnia view it in bed and you will have a good night sleep
<START> being a fan of movies like fire sale where's <UNK> airplane i saw this because it was mentioned <UNK> in the context of real comedies and <UNK> like the aforementioned well wrong conclusion br br not only is this not funny it makes you angry because it isn't bad in a <UNK> likable way but in a really bad way it's bad bad the script does not contain a single funny line which is rather in the way when you're trying to entertain your audience with humour br br adam <UNK> speech <UNK> is probably the single most annoying thing in this movie still this cruelty of nature doesn't prevent him from being smug throughout the movie and he has a hard time not looking into the camera this amateur without charisma fits in nicely with the constant continuity errors and bumbling along of the story if you can find one br br ed <UNK> i had to think of jay leno another late night talk show person who always refuses to call himself an actor well i've seen a few leno movies and he's laurence olivier compared to <UNK> br br kenneth mars is good though in the few lines that he's given i'm not easily frightened by bad comedies so i kept watching and looking for all the quasi jokes every 5 minutes or so br br the movie actually becomes sort of a comedy as soon as alan arkin takes over he literally does starting 75 minutes into the movie he's in every scene but it's too little too late br br when movies try to fool you into believing their lack of <UNK> is the reason you're supposed to like them because they have the right intentions they remind me of <UNK> that haven't prepared for an <UNK> in those cases you have to remain strict and the grade has to be an <UNK> but please don't assume i'm a teacher that is a profession with a <UNK> somewhere between politician and child <UNK> br br if you actually look for a likable <UNK> horror scifi movie that is fun to watch and does contain jokes try man with the screaming brain by bruce campbell or watch sunshine core if you prefer modern loud shallow scifi schlock those are equally funny albeit <UNK>
<START> i love <UNK> of a geisha so i read the book twice it is one of the best book i've read last year i was looking forward to the movie and was afraid that reading the book would ruin the viewing pleasure of the movie i wasn't expecting the movie to be that bad some of the best part of the book was <UNK> from the movie and the characters were weak with <UNK> li <UNK> been the worst if i haven't read the book this movie would be a little confusing and inexplicable the plot outline of the movie states <UNK> <UNK> reveals how she <UNK> her fishing did anyone see how or when <UNK> became <UNK> <UNK> forget the movie and read the book
<START> <UNK> through the sci fi <UNK> section of the local video <UNK> store i was losing hope of finding any good movies i hadn't yet seen renting cypher was like a <UNK> on a possibly very lame horse my son is so jaded with current b science fiction that he hasn't bothered seeing this yet br br it must be noted i didn't see anything about cypher when it was released in australia it must have been very quiet or i just missed it br br well this was a really pleasant surprise this is also no b movie it's not a blockbuster of the epic variety and doesn't try to be more a quiet movie that needs to be seen several times for it's plot to be fully <UNK> br br the special effects are <UNK> presented when they are used my only complaint is the super <UNK> is a <UNK> obviously cgi at first view but they get it right at it's 2nd appearance that aside everything else is top notch in any case the affects are secondary br br i won't give anything away about the plot the plot structure has a russian doll aspect a little reminiscent of basic instinct though with very different content br br just i will say that choosing jeremy northam for the lead was a master stroke the actor was born in <UNK> england and his accent for this film hits the ear as a sort of extremely forced new england <UNK> it's a tad off key see the final twist of the plot and you'll see why that is such a brilliant choice and lucy liu is also just right with her will she kiss me will she shoot me edge br br i rarely watch movies several times within days this is one of them
<START> how can't you rate this movie with 10 10 i admit to say that this movie is not very entertaining but the goal is not to tell you a story but history this is the first <UNK> movie of cinema history le prince de <UNK> was first but it was not technically perfect <UNK> and it has an undoubtedly huge international value these people that you can see finishing their working day in the movie had the chance to participate to a historic moment becoming the first persons to be able to see themselves moving and above all the shot is a beautiful shot and it's very moving when you think about the first persons to have seen that what a moment historic for science first because the <UNK> brothers first invented the <UNK> for scientific reasons and for art later a movie to <UNK>
<START> definitely one of the most witty and twisted who <UNK> i ever seen christopher reeve and micheal caine were brilliant and kept me going through the whole affair br br very classy set pieces and the props really lend a sense of atmosphere to the proceedings the <UNK> feel works for the whole picture br br my only complain isn't with the film itself but the lack of a decent widescreen edition of the movie on dvd i own the <UNK> version which proves i love the film enough to endure <UNK> presentation but a awesome <UNK> or <UNK> edition would most surely get my cash
<START> and shot in <UNK> with the <UNK> of the low country of south <UNK> visible in the background for <UNK> sake they should have <UNK> the location there are no <UNK> mountains in south <UNK> period br br lame visuals they should have been beautiful and the story <UNK> along br br i really don't understand why it was such a hit as a book although i have to admit it's one i haven't read as yet usually i read the book and give the film a miss there was nothing in this movie that made me want to buy the book or even borrow it from the library br br verdict the mermaid chair seemed pretty shallow to <UNK>
<START> michael keaton is johnny dangerously in this take off on gangster movies done in 1984 maureen <UNK> plays his <UNK> mother <UNK> dunne is his da brother peter boyle is his boss and <UNK> <UNK> is his girlfriend other stars include danny <UNK> and joe <UNK> keaton plays a pet store owner in the 1930s who catches a kid stealing a puppy and then tells him in flashback how he came to own the pet store he turned to <UNK> at a young age to get his mother a <UNK> operation <UNK> 95 special this week and began working for a mob boss boyle johnny uses the last name dangerously in the mobster world br br there are some hilarious scenes in this film and <UNK> is a riot as <UNK> foul mouthed mother who needs ever <UNK> in her body replaced peter boyle as <UNK> boss gives a very funny performance as does <UNK> dunne a straight arrow da who won't play ball with crooked <UNK> danny de <UNK> as <UNK> nemesis joe <UNK> is great richard <UNK> is a standout as <UNK> who <UNK> the english language but you have to hear him do it rather than read about it what makes it funny is that he does it all with an angry face br br the movie gets a little tired toward the end but it's well worth seeing and keaton is terrific as good boy bad boy johnny for some reason this film was underrated when it was released and like keaton's other gem night shift you don't hear much about it today with some performances and scenes that are real gems you'll find johnny dangerously immensely enjoyable
<START> unusual yes br br unusual setting for an american wartime movie new zealand br br unusual subject matter four sisters and their relationships with american soldiers from one bearing the <UNK> child of the dead son of a senator to another living with seven marines one at a time before being murdered by her returning <UNK> new <UNK> husband br br unusual to see paul newman deliver such a poor performance so soon after his unforgettable role as rocky <UNK> in the brilliant somebody up there loves me br br unusual for two fine stars joan fontaine and jean simmons to leave so little of themselves on a movie br br unusual that i could be bothered to write a review of such a poor film give it a miss
<START> unlike many other films which are disturbing either by <UNK> of their naked <UNK> man bites dog or their sheer violence most <UNK> films deliverance shocks by its <UNK> certainly the <UNK> scene is pretty straightforward in its <UNK> but the film's effect <UNK> far more from its slow build up and the <UNK> sense of isolation surrounding the four leads both before and after everything starts to go wrong the moment when the <UNK> pass under the child on the bridge who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier played music with let alone show any sign of human affection towards them is among the most sinister in modern film the tension <UNK> <UNK> throughout the <UNK> trip and <UNK> even after the final credits the ending makes the significance of the characters' <UNK> <UNK> real the movie's <UNK> is greatly aided by the playing of the leads particularly ned beatty and jon voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively burt reynolds too has never been better the film's cultural influence is <UNK> by the number of people who will understand a reference to <UNK> <UNK> perhaps only get carter has done such an effective <UNK> job on a <UNK> tourist industry i can think of only a handful of movies which put me into such a serious depression after they had finished the oppressive atmosphere of <UNK> is the best comparison i can think of although so much of it is excellent of itself deliverance is a classic above all because there are no adequate points of comparison with it it is unique
<START> paul verhoeven's predecessor to his <UNK> hit <UNK> <UNK> is a stylish and shocking neo noir thriller verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films both in his native holland and in america and this film is one of the reasons why the fourth man follows the strange story of gerard <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> a gay alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to <UNK> to give a talk on the stories he writes while there he meets the seductive christine <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who takes him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lovers and <UNK> that he will meet him even if it kills him br br paul verhoeven twists the truth many times in this film and that <UNK> that you never quite know where you are with it many of the <UNK> in the fourth man could be what they appear to be but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for the duration and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it <UNK> on paul verhoeven is not a filmmaker that feels he has to <UNK> himself and that is one of things i like best about him this film features a very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards and that doesn't happen very often i wont spoil it because it needs the surprise element to work but you'll see what i mean when you see the film make sure you get the uncut version there is also a number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than the one i've mentioned but are lovely nonetheless a man gets eaten by lions another one has a <UNK> sent through his skull a boat is <UNK> in half lovely br br the acting in the fourth man isn't anything to write home about but it's solid throughout <UNK> <UNK> holds the audience's attention and looks the part as the drunken writer it is <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> the most though as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale her performance is what sharon stone would imitate nine years later with basic instinct but the original fatale did it best paul verhoeven's direction is solid throughout as he directs our attention through numerous points of view all of which help to create the mystery of the story verhoeven has gone on to make some rubbish but he obviously has talent and it's a shame that he doesn't put it to better use of all the verhoeven films i've seen this is the best and although it might be difficult to come across trust me it's worth the effort
<START> i would just like to say that no matter how low budget the film is it needs to be shown throughout this world the point to these movies we don't read that much anymore instead people want to see movies having this series out on dvd has made me want to read the whole series and want more please make all 8 movies please don't change any of the characters either it ruins the effect because i have grown to love the actors who have played the characters please make all 8 movies i want to see the message and watch the message that these books and now movies are here to portray we don't get that enough anymore awesome job
<START> this is one of the <UNK> films of the <UNK> series due to its very unusual pacing and the role that <UNK> plays in the film interestingly enough this was the first <UNK> film made by <UNK> <UNK> new production company now instead of just playing the blind <UNK> <UNK> is in charge of making the films this could easily explain why this film seems so different in style to the previous 15 films as far as <UNK> role the film is very different because he isn't in the film as much as usual he's also easy to fool and actually for a while does a lot to harm people instead of helping br br <UNK> <UNK> begins with <UNK> talking with an old lady who tries to take advantage of his <UNK> oddly in this scene <UNK> says that he's been blind since a <UNK> though in an earlier film he says his <UNK> set in when he was 8 this is a minor mistake and only a crazed fan like myself would have noticed br br this film takes place over a period of at least six months and is more likely to have taken a year so you can see what i said about odd pacing most films in the series take place over a few days or weeks <UNK> comes to a town where there is a boss <UNK> who tries very hard to be nice to <UNK> because he knows of the blind man's reputation the boss is quite charming and surprisingly <UNK> is totally taken in by the evil man at the same time he meets another boss <UNK> a sort of guru to the poor <UNK> <UNK> the people to <UNK> all violence and even <UNK> falls under his teaching giving up his blade for many months <UNK> <UNK> are very similar to <UNK> <UNK> from china non violence and acceptance of life as it is for good or for bad br br months after leaving this town and thinking all was well <UNK> learns that as soon as he left <UNK> showed his true colors <UNK> women <UNK> the poor and being an all around jerk in a way <UNK> is responsible for this as he helped <UNK> and counted him as a friend now <UNK> has captured <UNK> and several innocent people have killed themselves due to the evil <UNK> actions br br when <UNK> returns he doesn't accept automatically that <UNK> is good or evil but <UNK> him cleverly this bit with a scarecrow is inspired and leads to a finale where what else <UNK> kills the baddies and <UNK> <UNK> this finale was very good and occurred in the rain then final scene with <UNK> and the rocks is great though the <UNK> is a tad cheesy by today's special effects standards br br <UNK> for the film are that although poorly paced it is different and cannot be mistaken for the previous 15 which often seem very similar additionally it does end very well <UNK> aside from pacing are that some might dislike seeing <UNK> so <UNK> and the scenes with <UNK> and the other blind men that are included for comic relief fall flat very very very flat they are tacky and unfunny that's the sort of flat that it is
<START> while rome goes mad celebrating hitler's visit uniforms bands <UNK> two <UNK> stay home in a large building and wind up meeting she is <UNK> loren who is the wife of <UNK> public servant and mother of six children he is mastroianni a radio <UNK> who's been fired because of his homosexuality both of them need company and understanding both f them find it in each other br br the movie covers a span of a few hours the color are faded and everything takes place with a sound track of military <UNK> and hysterical radio <UNK> strangely enough the nazi <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ends up becoming a romantic musical theme br br beautiful movie excellent recreation of a special era in italian history and a touching sad story mastroianni is as good as we have come to expect and <UNK> loren does a superb job very far away from her usual truck <UNK> pin up <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> don't miss it
<START> this is a great movie it shows what our government will to to other countries if we don't like their government this isn't as bad as what reagan and bush number one did to south america but the us still has no business messing around with other countries like this this movies also proves that american media <UNK> government propaganda this is exactly what they did to <UNK> in <UNK> the reason this coup against chavez didn't succeed is chavez was elected with over 90 of the vote br br this movie isn't just a political documentary it would still be a great movie if it were a drama it's amazing that this is real br br the other reviewer is lying when he says chavez <UNK> the <UNK> the private media is running anti chavez propaganda all the time
<START> i can <UNK> remember bo <UNK> <UNK> and the uk press attention the <UNK> sun news of the world papers especially all following her small role in 10 with dudley moore understandably much fuss was made of her <UNK> face crystal clear blue eyes and her perfectly formed <UNK> breasts br br unfortunately acting is and never was her <UNK> i think they should make one of the triple disc <UNK> you always find in the bargain dvd <UNK> <UNK> tarzan the ape man and <UNK> all these films could be nominated for the so bad they are great br br it would be a guilty must buy of mine should you ever read your press or this comment ms derek please do not be offended always had a soft spot for you and there are more important things going on in the world to worry about than your acting ability much love x
<START> i've read comments that you shouldn't watch this film if you're looking for stirring <UNK> dialogue this is true unfortunately because all the stirring dialogue this wonderful play contains has been cut and replaced with songs i've read this play and recently was lucky enough to see it performed at it remains one of my favourite <UNK> comedies but this movie seems to take all that i like about it away the princess though no doubt doing what she was directed to do had no regal bearing and all the girls seemed to lose the <UNK> of their characters also affected by <UNK> cuts which not only took away the female characters already sparse dialogue but took comments out of context it was a little unnerving to hear the princess <UNK> we are wise girls to mock our lovers so when mocking had not taken place at all the news <UNK> throughout the film also <UNK> the flow and took away many excellent scenes as they showed the information in the scenes after them and were in modern <UNK> in conclusion an excellent play ruined by an odd concept and <UNK> cuts kenneth i usually love what you do what were you thinking
<START> why hollywood feels the need to remake movies that were so brilliant their prime the texas chainsaw massacre the hills have eyes but is it considerably worse why hollywood feels the need to remake those horror films that weren't brilliant to start with prom night the <UNK> horror much like their originals these remakes fail in creating atmosphere character or any genuine scares at all prom night is so flat and uninteresting its hard to watch but for all the wrong reasons br br it's a poorly acted <UNK> uninteresting and ultimately dull <UNK> that fails at everything its designed to do it's clear hollywood horror is dead even the likes of the hills have eyes and the texas chainsaw massacre managed to ruin their <UNK> in style with <UNK> of blood and a decent plot prom night is virtually <UNK> and i'm not even going to mention how bad the plot is its inability to seal the killers identify makes this the least suspenseful horror movie since <UNK> the original br br one of the most notorious slasher films of the 1980s returns to <UNK> <UNK> with this remake that proves just how horrifying high school dances can truly be donna <UNK> <UNK> snow has survived a terrible tragedy but now the time has come to leave the past behind and celebrate her senior prom in style br br when the big night finally arrives donna and her best friends prepare to enjoy their last big high school <UNK> by living it up and <UNK> till dawn but while donna is willing to look past her nightmares and into a <UNK> future the man she thought she had escaped forever has returned for one last dance an obsessed killer is on the loose and he'll <UNK> anyone who attempts to prevent him from reaching his one and only donna br br who will survive to see <UNK> day and what will donna do when she's forced to confront her greatest fear scott porter jessica <UNK> and dana davis co star in the slasher remake that will have <UNK> clad teens everywhere <UNK> looking over their shoulders as they file out onto the dance floor a plot that will probably put you off going to see this witch if you ask me is a good thing br br without much to work with <UNK> <UNK> tries to milk tension out of the most banal of situations at one point a girl backs into a floor <UNK> a <UNK> and <UNK> tries to <UNK> it up into a jump scare moment desperate times really do call for desperate <UNK> there haven't been this many shots of <UNK> since the last <UNK> <UNK> br br in the era of the hills my super sweet 16 and to catch a predator there probably is a freaky scary movie to be <UNK> from the <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> creepy obsession with youthful beauty this is not that movie br br my final verdict avoid at all cost nobody will like prom night it's even a disappointment to <UNK> who usually enjoy hack job remakes considering its absolute lack of blood or <UNK> a night you'll be in a hurry to forget
<START> as someone who likes chase scenes and was really intrigued by this fascinating true life tale i was optimistic heading into this film but too many obstacles got into the way of the good story it should have been br br the bad i'm a fan of robert duvall and many of the characters he has played but his role here is a dull one as an insurance investigator br br the dialog is insipid and the pretty kathryn <UNK> is real garbage mouth from what i read there were several directors replacing each other on this film and that's too bad you can tell things aren't right with the story i couldn't get involved with treat <UNK> portrayal of cooper either he should have been fascinating but he wasn't in this movie it's also kind of a sad comment that a guy committing a crime is some sort of folk hero but i admit i wound up rooting for the guy too br br not everything was disappointing i can't complain about the scenery from the lush green <UNK> of <UNK> to the desert in arizona br br i'd like to see this movie re made and done better because it is a one of a kind story
<START> times are tough for angel town gangs rule with an iron fist and for reasons mostly unknown mainly due to embarrassing writing the gangs want a street kid <UNK> to join the gangs so they beat him up everyday however due to the presence of an olympic kick boxer olivier world's <UNK> actor <UNK> named jacques hope is on the way angel town is seriously one of the most inept message movies ever made and i've seen my share it seems to consist of the idea that all gang <UNK> <UNK> need are french kick <UNK> who can't act worst of all there are so many awkward moments it's just truly hilarious best of all comes from the exchange between <UNK> and <UNK> which basically sums up how ridiculous this thing is to wit you like the fighting olivier grabs his asian best friend in a <UNK> i could kill him right when i want him dead he dies the reason why i don't want him dead is because i'm afraid of him and i know that if i kill him his son and wife will kill me that's why he doesn't die br br of course the fact that it's wrong to kill someone let alone your best friend is of course left out of the <UNK> odd br br however don't let me make this sound that i hated this movie far from it it's so terrible it's priceless the biggest laughs come at the end in the disastrous finale which sees <UNK> going one on one with gang members who the film's biggest logic gap decline the use of <UNK> also a handicapped vietnam vet helps out by shooting his machine gun at the gangs while <UNK> kick boxes the rest all of this set to the sound of horrible mexican accents and surreal energy that make this one memorable for fans of cinematic trash such as this br br the other treat about this movie is that for some reason olivier <UNK> never <UNK> college despite that's the main reason he's here in the states and not in france getting it on with his girlfriend in a graveyard in the film's awkward beginning angel town is without a doubt a failure on all <UNK> levels but if you laugh at moronic martial arts movies with insane levels of action that make no sense on any level this is the perfect movie for you on the other hand make sure to down <UNK> like the laughable opening song details ain't no mercy in angel town br br out of 4 bad
<START> originally a response to a movie reviewer who said a bug's life was too much too fast he was <UNK> and exhausted by the visuals and seemed to ignore the story completely br br okay first off i'm 26 years old have a job go to school and have a <UNK> so maybe i'm nuts and just really good at hiding it but not only did i not come away from a bug's life exhausted or <UNK> it wasn't until i saw it the second time that i could even begin to truly appreciate the artistry and humour of the spectacular visuals because the first time i went to see this movie i got so wrapped up in the story and the characters that i forgot that i was supposed to be sitting there being <UNK> by each frame visually how can you not empathize with <UNK> and his road to heck <UNK> with good intentions life heck indeed i found myself <UNK> with that little <UNK> not to mention some of the other bugs in a lot more ways than one and that in itself says more to me about what an incredible movie this is than a whole book on its beautiful eye candy of course it's beautiful every blade of grass the tree the rain of course what they can do with technology is amazing you can read their lips try it but this movie is not just a masterpiece of art and tech not just an dazzling explosion of movement and color no a bug's life would be static if it were all that and no story but i'm glad to say it's not a bug's life has real heart yes there's a lot going on storyline wise as well as visually but that's because the story and characters actually have some depth to them just because it's a kids' movie doesn't mean you should have to turn off your brain at the theatre door kids are smarter than you think besides that i think that the pixar crew made this for themselves even before their kids and it shows in the amount of heart in has this movie is moving touching funny intriguing and generally engrossing the character development in such an ensemble cast is amazing there's a major amount of character growth and not just of the main character so rare in animation and often in movies in general it doesn't hit you over the head with its points once it's made them every scene every frame has a reason in the storyline for being there and there are no gratuitous shots not always stating <UNK> in words exactly what is going on means subtlety to me folks it means not <UNK> down your movie and assuming the audience is stupid which it mostly is not all i can think is if you can see a bug's life and not feel anything at all then you must have never made a big mistake hurt your friends had a crush fallen in love been frustrated that no one would listen to you <UNK> to someone you care about felt like a social <UNK> gotten excited over a new idea come up with a great idea had what you thought was a great idea <UNK> been awkward one moment and confident the next felt the pressure of responsibility stood up for yourself and your loved ones stood alone against the crowd felt like a failure felt like a big success felt the need to make a difference with your life in the lives of others well you get the point final words a rating from me please if you're going to see it try to see it in the theatre pan and <UNK> video is not going to work for this movie if you loved toy story you'll most likely love this pixar knows how to make movies with heart if you do love it see it multiple times or you still won't know what you're missing the amount of detail and subtlety here is considerable and whenever you're feeling really low just pretend it's a seed okay
<START> actress ruth <UNK> real life <UNK> gesture to help entertain troops arriving from and leaving for the korean war at an air base near san francisco jump started this all star warner bros <UNK> to <UNK> and song many celebrities make guest appearances while a love hate romance develops between a budding <UNK> and a painfully green and skinny air force <UNK> ron <UNK> who looks like he should be delivering <UNK> from his <UNK> seems the <UNK> has fooled the actress into thinking he's off to battle when actually he's part of a airplane <UNK> crew flying to and from <UNK> you'd think she'd be happy he was staying out of <UNK> way but instead she acts just like most childish females in 1950s movies doris day is around for the first thirty minutes or so and her distinct laugh and <UNK> song numbers are most pleasant roman is also here looking glamorous while james cagney <UNK> fun at his screen persona and gordon <UNK> sings in his handsome <UNK> jane <UNK> sings too in a hospital <UNK> <UNK> following doris day's lead causing one to wonder did they run out of sets for <UNK> viewers an interesting flashback to another time and place still the low rent production and just adequate technical aspects render <UNK> strictly a second <UNK> 1 2 from
<START> somebody could probably make a great documentary about the jerry springer show but this <UNK> version merely succeeds in <UNK> anything authentic and interesting out of the trash tv phenomenon there are dozens of <UNK> bad movies e g <UNK> the hands of fate that show more creativity and spirit than this dreary witless waste of film br br seriously why not a documentary about the jerry springer show that would begin to answer some of the real questions like who are these people what happens to their lives after they appear on this show how did the mayor of <UNK> find himself here br br one good line during an <UNK> session for guests people i can't emphasize this enough no weapons
<START> this film deals with the atrocity in <UNK> 30 years ago which is <UNK> known as bloody sunday br br the film is well <UNK> acted and directed it is as close to the truth as we will get until the outcome of the <UNK> <UNK> the film puts the atrocity into context of the time it also shows the <UNK> of the soldiers on the day of the atrocity the <UNK> white wash that was the <UNK> <UNK> is also dealt with br br overall this is an excellent drama which is moving and shocking when the <UNK> report comes out watch this film again to see how close to the truth it is
<START> one of several musicals about sailors on leave it is the usual sailor meets girl complications ensue <UNK> out happily kind of plot it proceeds along smoothly enough but it does drag in places too the dialogue is not as <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> for example and randolph scott seems out of place br br there are <UNK> it has some of irving <UNK> <UNK> songs including <UNK> yourself <UNK> <UNK> putting all my eggs in one <UNK> and <UNK> face the music and <UNK> it has fred and ginger who when they are dancing take any film into heavenly heights and they don't disappoint here they do a snappy tap dance a <UNK> comic dance and a <UNK> <UNK> dance all in the same film great <UNK> and artistry br br it also has harriet <UNK> who is rather good in her role she had a varied career becoming the more famous harriet nelson with <UNK> here she is touching without being sentimental her two songs are simply and effectively delivered she makes a good contrast with ginger but you can believe they are sisters in the film br br more <UNK> up have made the film even better pretty good though
<START> if this movie were any worse it would have been directed by uwe boll this nonsensical mess makes ed wood look like hitchcock it has been a while since i have seen this steaming pile but i do remember that i wanted to do <UNK> <UNK> harm to all those involved how anyone can give this movie any more than 1 star <UNK> me to the <UNK> of all those that viewed this tripe i give it one star because there is not a rating lower all copies of this movie should be burned the ground <UNK> with salt and reserved as a <UNK> for the most toxic of waste no one copy should be kept under ultra hi security and shown only to film makers as an example of how not to do it
<START> this movie is extremely boring it tells a story of a female gas station owner and her life nothing exciting ever happens the director has really kept it real and it feels just like a camera following a woman around as she lives her life i had to watch other films by this director for a class the others were not as boring this film was also watched for an assignment it better be worth the <UNK> with a good grade overall unless it's required don't watch the film but don't <UNK> other films by this director because they're not as bad and don't <UNK> other films about africa they're usually good especially when done by a western director
<START> i just viewed the film two days ago and i was filled with anticipation being that paris is my second favorite city in europe and i spent a very romantic 18 months there in the <UNK> i was somewhat disappointed that most of this group of vignettes while original and artistically done did not capture the light and beauty of the city very well nor enough of the romance we saw none of the tree <UNK> <UNK> there was too much darkness not only literally but <UNK> some of the plots manipulated the viewer it seemed and let him her down flat the <UNK> sequence the <UNK> salesman sequence to give two examples the uplifting good ones the <UNK> sequence the cemetery the <UNK> though it left too much to the viewer to comprehend the cowboy <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> seemed few and far between and i would have liked to have seen such a wonderful actor as orlando bloom be in something that would have <UNK> his originality more
<START> the only reason i watched this film was because i had recently read robert <UNK> less than perfect but interesting <UNK> account of the life of big cat <UNK> mabel stark <UNK> appears as a character in the book in a less than <UNK> light br br i hadn't realised until checking the movie out later on the imdb that it was originally a serial whoever edited the original running time of <UNK> minutes down to the <UNK> <UNK> version available on dvd has done a hell of a good job the <UNK> version plays just as well as any b movie of the period despite the many <UNK> what ' moments for instance are we really expected to believe our hero <UNK> that twenty foot deep tiger trap in a morning without even getting his <UNK> dirty looking over the chapter titles i see that number five is titled gorilla <UNK> and number eleven is called the gorilla there were no <UNK> at all in the movie i guess that's where some of the cuts were made br br <UNK> interesting
<START> the dream child of 1989 is the fifth film in the generally overrated nightmare series and at the latest from this point on the series became total garbage the only good films in the series were wes craven's 1984 original and the third part the dream warriors of 1987 the second part was disappointing and boring and it was the fourth part in which the <UNK> scary madman freddy krueger began to annoy with constant idiotic jokes this fifth entry to the series has hardly anything to recommend except for admittedly great visuals and one creepy scene a flashback sequence to how freddy krueger came into existence the rest of the film consists mainly of our razor <UNK> maniac turned <UNK> yelling stupid one liners and the old formula of a bunch of teenage <UNK> who desperately try to avoid falling asleep because good old freddy <UNK> them in their dreams lisa <UNK> is back in the role of alice johnson and a bunch of uninteresting crap such as a super dumb <UNK> children's rhyme is added for no other reason than to have some sort of justification for making this superfluous and boring sequel in short no originality just a decline of the old formula and an over load of painfully annoying jokes my generous rating of 3 10 is due to the great visuals and especially to emphasize the difference to the terrible next sequel freddy's dead which is awful beyond belief in case you're not a hardcore freddy krueger <UNK> the dream child should be avoided and even if you are this is more than likely to disappoint
<START> well what can i say about this movie i'm speechless i could go on about how stupid this movie is forever though the one thing that really <UNK> <UNK> me off was the music and to top it all off someone commented on how much they liked it to them all i have to say is that it was ripped off from one of the best martial arts movies of all time <UNK> fury starring bruce lee if he was still alive and ever came across this movie he'd be horrified the rest of the movie is absolutely ridiculous and a waste of tape i say tape because a movie like that couldn't possibly have been shot on film i now feel more stupid for wasting 30 minutes of my life watching it the only reason why i even saw it was because my roommate <UNK> it out of morbid curiosity what is this world coming to
<START> true the setting in paris is great the actors are fine the story is a twisted morality play is it supposed to say that if you want someone badly enough it's ok to hurt everyone else along the way in a real romance you sort of want less clich√© than the man who has become bored with his wife and is willing to dump his family and the woman who is ok with <UNK> him to do this so what if they are decent looking and if karen allen shows off her body the characters are still self absorbed and <UNK> maybe the moral of the story is you get what you deserve i give it a 4 only for the fast <UNK> potential through the male interest bits
<START> <UNK> <UNK> directs this film that is supposed to expose the lifestyle of the rich and famous while also providing a commentary on the integrity of <UNK> today br br celebrities party endlessly they like to be seen at these parties and to get due exposure in the media in fact the film would have us believe that this exposure makes celebrities out of <UNK> and the <UNK> have a huge hand in this imo there is much more <UNK> between the celebrities and media and it is a i need you you need me kind of relationship however the media needs celebrities more and not vice versa anyhow in this <UNK> of constant <UNK> is thrown the social <UNK> page 3 of the newspaper reporter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> she is shown as this celebrity maker very popular at the social <UNK> she has a good friend in the gay <UNK> and in the struggling model <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> she rooms with an air <UNK> ¬ñ the sassy pearl <UNK> <UNK> and a struggling actress <UNK> tara <UNK> the editor of the newspaper is <UNK> <UNK> and a <UNK> crime beat reporter is played by <UNK> <UNK> the movie has almost too many plot <UNK> and characters but does work at a certain level the rich are shown to be rotten to the core for the most part the movie <UNK> shown to be sleazy to the max with casting couch scenarios exploitation of power <UNK> for media exposure into all this is layered in homosexuality a homosexual encounter that seems to not have much to do with the story or plot rampant drug use <UNK> police encounter deaths in light of all this <UNK> desire to have a super rich husband a <UNK> daughter <UNK> in a sexual encounter in a car the <UNK> women all seem <UNK> <UNK> br br the film has absolutely excellent acting by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has almost no role ¬ñ a pity in my opinion but the supporting cast is more than competent <UNK> <UNK> is very good this is what saves the film for me mr <UNK> bites off way more than he can chew or process onto celluloid and turns the film into a free for all bash i wish he had focused on one or two aspects of societal <UNK> and explored them more effectively he <UNK> societal exploitation yet himself exploits all the <UNK> ingredients needed for a film to be successful we have an item number in the <UNK> of a bollywood theme party the drugged out kids dance a perfectly choreographed dance to a western beat i hope the next one from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> even more of the hindi film stereotyped ingredients the film is a brave albeit flawed effort certainly worth a watch
<START> this movie promised bat people it didn't deliver there was a guy who got bit by a bat but what was with the <UNK> and the stupid transformation where was the plot where was the acting who came up with the idea to make this why was it allowed to be made why why i guess we'll never know
<START> this is one of the very few movies out there which are very erotic without being pornographic despite there being only a very <UNK> plot there's not much live sound or dialogue instead the actors do voice overs describing their experience why they <UNK> etc br br it's a document br br it's mind blowing br br i can totally understand why nobody else ever tried to do something like this there already is something like this this br br <UNK> the producer doesn't have the rights to <UNK> a dvd version i've also never seen it being sold anywhere one may email mr <UNK> and order a copy on vhs
<START> a thief in the night is an excellent fictional account of the weeks leading up to the rapture and the weeks following that pivotal event br br i thoroughly enjoyed both the production values and the content values of this independent christian movie br br the production values hey it's an independent movie with a shoe string budget so ya it's going to look a bit cheesy if your standard is a list hollywood fare but properly compared with other independent movies this film is perfectly acceptable more important than acting style costumes and music is the narrative itself is the story compelling do the dramatic moments work does the story <UNK> build to a satisfying climax the answer to all these questions is an <UNK> yes as a side note the truly important technical stuff continuity sound lighting are fine the viewer is able to watch the show without being distracted by sloppy <UNK> br br content value the message of the movie is superb when you consider how many ideas the movie maker developed within the brief span of <UNK> minutes you begin to appreciate his artistry he presents the message of salvation the consequence of <UNK> the danger of <UNK> the truth of the rapture and the threat of a world <UNK> satanic government with <UNK> imagination and most importantly for an <UNK> movie with biblical accuracy br br the movie maker is a good <UNK> for example he develops the message of salvation in two important ways 1 he shows us through action the reality of jesus <UNK> sacrifice for our sake this is achieved in a subplot where the <UNK> keeper is bit by a <UNK> snake and nearly dies the only cure is blood from someone who is <UNK> to the snake poison the poison is like sin the cure is like <UNK> blood shed on the cross 2 the filmmaker also develops the message of salvation through dialog he has various characters explain the truth about human sin and the need for salvation through faith in christ so the movie maker uses both action and dialog to tell his story br br as a side note the fact that a movie produced by <UNK> christians actually contains dialog and scenes that convey a clearly <UNK> message of salvation <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> christian language imagery and <UNK> is also perfectly acceptable to criticize this film for being <UNK> christian is absurd it's akin to <UNK> a <UNK> commercial for promoting sport wear what else would <UNK> christian movie makers make if not a film that states their case also the fact that the movie maker employs the idea that the <UNK> will be left behind in a <UNK> world is again perfectly acceptable the movie maker uses the dramatic potential of that idea admirably how do i know i heard about a thief in the night from a woman who saw the show way back in 1974 it still lived in her memory thirty years later how many movies can you say that about all around a very enjoyable thought provoking show i plan on showing it to my teen group at church
<START> if you are the sort of person who can get a kick out of a very bad movie then i highly recommend this one if you aren't stay away this is an astonishingly cheap looking movie and at times you may find yourself wondering if it isn't just a prank someone is pulling on you the most positive comment i can make about it is that the people responsible seemed to realize that it was super low budget nonsense so there is at least a sense of fun here br br but this is as amateurish as it gets their idea of giant killer <UNK> are simply guys covered with <UNK> colored sheets with what looks like trash can covers on their heads it's obviously not meant to be taken seriously to say the least but even with that <UNK> you'll find yourself shaking your head at the awesome cheesiness of it all or laughing out loud frequently as i did
<START> joe buck jon voight decides he's going to leave his small life in texas and make it big in the big city the women are there for the asking and the men are mainly <UNK> <UNK> wide eyed he comes to new york city not prepared for the series of <UNK> <UNK> he experiences one worse than the other in the middle of that chaos he meets and befriends rico ratso rizzo dustin <UNK> a homeless looking man who lives in an apparently condemned building br br there isn't much of a story as midnight cowboy is a series of vignettes destined to bring forth not only joe <UNK> <UNK> in the city but also inter cut to his past and show us in shock cuts and semi psychedelic dream sequences snippets of his past his failed relationship with his girlfriend annie jennifer salt who was gang raped his <UNK> by his mother and his apparent abuse by his grandmother who also had a habit of <UNK> men for money an air of <UNK> <UNK> the film almost from the <UNK> beginning as <UNK> plays throughout the opening credits his <UNK> <UNK> everybody's <UNK> we feel that even while we want joe to eventually make his mark in the city the odds are high he won't and will end up working for <UNK> in a dead end job shown in a masterful shot from his outside point of view later in the film as he watches a man work as a <UNK> in a soup kitchen through a window and sees himself we know from the look in his eyes he does not want to end like this br br a dark story of <UNK> hopes john <UNK> creates haunting images of lost souls at the end of the 60s and at the center the <UNK> friendship between two men as they struggle to make some sort of meaning to their lives amidst the <UNK> comfort of a <UNK> life there is the implied notion that they may have been lovers <UNK> reaching out to hug joe in the party scene and their the final embrace at the end certainly points at this but this is essentially a buddy film one that manages to survive literally to the death and bring some form of hope to joe who at the end in florida seems much changed older <UNK>
<START> if your idea of a thriller is car chases explosions and dozens of people being <UNK> down by <UNK> then house of games is definitely not the movie for you if you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense then by all means see it br br house of games tells the story of an <UNK> psychologist and writer dr margaret ford lindsay <UNK> who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the shadowy world of con men led by the charismatic mike joe <UNK> to say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense frankly i find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming just like a clever con artist this movie draws you into its web and <UNK> your <UNK> br br the story is taut and well crafted the dialogue smart and <UNK> the acting uniformly good <UNK> is superbly charismatic some have complained that dr ford is not a very sympathetic character and wondered why mamet would make lindsay <UNK> look so physically unattractive but dr ford is supposed to be cold and <UNK> moreover her <UNK> is in a way essential to the plot at one point i believe that an injury to her sexual self <UNK> is a key part of her motivation i'll say no more br br house of games is a dark look at the <UNK> of human nature that concludes on a note of <UNK> ambiguity it will hold your attention every second while you are watching and stay with you for a long time afterwards
<START> the first ten minutes of this movie about making an international movie in <UNK> are fine you see real chaos on the set a producer on the edge of a nervous breakdown the cool has been director mickey rourke the bad <UNK> star etc you have seen everything before but it's well done but then the rest of the time the film just repeats itself the same ten minutes over and over again no climax no dramatic development no good acting not even bad acting it just goes on and on and on mickey rourke has two good minutes when his character talks about his f <UNK> up career in a scene where reality and fiction meet altogether that makes 12 good minutes br br
<START> when setting out this film director mary harron seemingly had the goal of clearly <UNK> the progress of bettie <UNK> career from early <UNK> days to leaving <UNK> to go back home after the <UNK> <UNK> on juvenile <UNK> and her religious <UNK> in the 50s and so intent is she to get all of these facts on screen in the time allowed she seems to have missed out on taking any time to explain anything in depth br br when you think of someone who had <UNK> career you'd think that there would be plenty to discuss her reasons decisions life event personal <UNK> but harron avoids any kind of personal exploration of the character in the first fifteen minutes or so of the film there are brief hints of child abuse domestic violence and a gang rape but these are all rushed past and then never referred to again you get the impression that harron and <UNK> turner co writer wanted to <UNK> over anything that wasn't glamorous and <UNK> you go into this film expecting to gain an insight into who the person behind the posters was but all you are given is a list of things that she did and <UNK> of some of her most famous photo shoots br br all in all the film really <UNK> you as you watch desperately waiting for some extra <UNK> to reveal itself how did she balance her religion with her job what made this young <UNK> girl move from <UNK> into bondage photography the film simply shows her going to another <UNK> agency and putting on whatever she's told but surely it would have involved some shock and <UNK> this was after all the 50s br br it seems to me that harron is trying to make a point about how tame all this is by today's standards page never took any photos of explicit sexual actions and how the reaction some gave this kind of thing was really <UNK> and although this is true she never actually makes it seem <UNK> in the eyes of others today we look at a young girl posing topless and think nothing off it but we should have got some sort of feeling about how shocking it would have been to a contemporary audience this woman was a central part of a <UNK> hearing on juvenile <UNK> but no one is ever really shown as shocked br br basically i left this film just thinking how tame it was harron and turner have managed to avoid anything that might be unpleasant to a viewer they come across as two <UNK> fans of miss page and are desperate to make sure that nothing absolutely nothing could possibly put a bad light on their heroine and have therefore avoided any in depth <UNK> into who she really was before and after her career there are reports of her violent nature and mental problems and all that's left is the string of events that made up her career without any substance whatsoever behind it
<START> ok i will admit it started out very pleasing and good but then it just dropped downhill i cannot believe sarah michelle <UNK> could have even finished reading the script after about 5 minutes into the movie the only reason i actually sat through the whole movie was i wanted to see the twist at the ned and to my surprise well folks i cannot even tell you if there <UNK> was one because the end just leaves you confused and then the credit role i was like what the hell this did not deserve a theater run i am sorry but it didn't i mean it was horrible the only <UNK> i gave it a 4 is because it had a few <UNK> parts thats it you can watch it im not telling you not to hey you might even like it or even love it but if you hate it don't say i didn't warn you
<START> hitchcock was of the opinion that audiences aren't really interested in what puts protagonists into danger only that they are in danger and need to escape br br this film proves hitchcock was not 100 correct police believe jean simmons is guilty of a crime when she <UNK> isn't <UNK> howard decides their best course of action is to run for it and so the body of the movie has our charismatic pair <UNK> on and off trains <UNK> and <UNK> jumping across rocks at the top of a <UNK> <UNK> across <UNK> <UNK> br br all good exciting stuff but i couldn't get out of my mind that it was all unnecessary they should have stayed put br br in other words the <UNK> wasn't strong enough
<START> ok let me say that i didn't expect a film starring jerry springer to be cinematic gold all i asked for was it to be cinematic and it wasn't even that it looked like someone's bad home movies poorly acted scripted and filled to the <UNK> with nudity of the most <UNK> people i've ever seen br br the film's plot focuses on a low class family who decide to go on the jerry <UNK> show to discuss multiple affairs between a mother daughter <UNK> and the daughter's <UNK> from there the movie <UNK> and develops into a unique experience white trash pornography there's redneck sex <UNK> sex even sex between jerry and his wife <UNK> this film encouraged me to want to run out of the theater and get a second <UNK> at least it was mercifully short disgusting and <UNK> african americans and working class america should be offended howard stern should be pleased however he didn't <UNK> his attempt for film stardom his was smart funny and entertaining br br my grade f the daughter was hot
<START> i love this movie very much i watched it over and over i don't see why anyone would think this movie wasn't good maybe you have seen better or whatever it is i personally love it it is one of my favorite movies and i am not hindi at all but i do love it it might be a little like pretty woman but i haven't seen that and i don't think it's any better than this i don't know why you are all <UNK> about it but maybe you have a good reason but i think i have said it enough but i absolutely love this movie and to those who say it's not good at all well then i wonder why you watched it and what movies you consider good as for everyone else that i watched it with they enjoyed it too so it surprises me that this many people don't like it as for <UNK> <UNK> i think thats how you spell her last name she is very beautiful and my favorite actress ever
<START> i'm italian and when i've recently looked again this film i <UNK> for its beauty the first time i was 10 years old and i liked it but today i can appreciate it with adult mind and feelings now i can understand it was a masterpiece of a special season of the italian cinema <UNK> etc by that time gone br br the hollywood epic films are good for fun perhaps this <UNK> had no english version because is not enough funny not suitable for pop corn and coke audience however suitable for homer pathos and <UNK> <UNK> br br in italy was recently released a very good dvd version integral with excellent colors you can find it in some file sharing but it's italian only and without subtitles too bad also the dialogs and the voices of this film are remarkable
<START> wow i'm a huge henry <UNK> <UNK> era fan and well this was interesting the only one i watched was the catherine of <UNK> one and wow just wow i've seen bad acting before but this reached new heights when the actress who played catherine was <UNK> crying she <UNK> and screams and i have to admit i <UNK> many times many many times funny funny stuff the only person who even showed any slight <UNK> of talent was the actress playing anne <UNK> i might be <UNK> though i do have a slight obsession with anne <UNK> she was a really <UNK> woman read up on her it's worth it also i have read a lot about the <UNK> time period and i think that the characters weren't very <UNK> displayed they were all very stereotypical only see this movie if you are prepared to see a very important time period and the important lives of those involved turned into a laughing stock
<START> this is kind of a weird movie given that santa claus lives on a cloud in outer space and fights against satan and his <UNK> but it's still kinda fun br br it has some genuine laughs whether all of them were intentional is certainly <UNK> though this movie is not good but i can say i really enjoyed watching it br br i would recommend this movie over santa claus <UNK> the martians santa claus with dudley moore and john <UNK> or the santa <UNK> with tim allen
<START> watching this movie was the biggest waste of time and 2 bucks for rental in my life if nothing <UNK> happens before i die this will be the biggest regret of my life who ever even thought about this movie or <UNK> deserves a kick between the legs because that's where they were thinking when they made this movie it's about an overweight guy who is a hopeless romantic and writes pretentious drivel that tries to pass off as poetry he joins his <UNK> friend in a trip to the coast where they meet girls and such only the fat guy doesn't get a girl skin flicks don't annoy me i take 'em for face value but this movie tries to be more than a skin flick it's about fat guy looking for love in some girl but then meets another bikini <UNK> girl that enjoys his poetry he finds his talent for <UNK> which gets money for his family and <UNK> the ladies only he has his lady anyways the dialogue is super horrible for even a c movie it supports a ton of black stereotypes no character development it's a <UNK> porno movie without any porn in it never ever watch this movie
<START> i originally watched 8 simple rules on the disney channel uk for the first series and got completely hooked when they didn't show it any more was annoyed but then abc 1 <UNK> showing the 2nd series i didn't think another series would start after i read john ritter had died however the 2nd series wasn't amazing the latest series is back to it's old excellent standard i hope they go on to produce more shows soon even though i could watch each show a thousand times <UNK> <UNK> is my favourite character as <UNK> bridget and also performs amazing in <UNK> <UNK> is also good he shares my name and <UNK> as well i'll keep on watching it until it ends until then i hope it carries on as funny as ever
<START> i've had a morbid fascination with <UNK> for more than 40 years since my <UNK> grade teacher a native <UNK> told stories of ones he saw in his youth fortunately i've lived my whole life in the middle atlantic states where <UNK> are rare and usually not as violent as the ones in the <UNK> but i have had two close encounters one in <UNK> and the other in <UNK> in the past decade br br i enjoyed the family scenes particularly the conflicts between jack and dan <UNK> when the <UNK> was close dan knew most of what he had to do and he probably learned this in school since i know that <UNK> safety is an important subject in parts of the u s where these <UNK> are more frequent however characters in the movie did two things that some people think are supposed to be done or are safe to do in <UNK> but are actually not supposed to be done or are <UNK> br br when the <UNK> first sounded dan and arthur went through the house and opened the windows for years this is what people were told to do but <UNK> safety web sites now advise against doing this also people were shown hiding in a highway <UNK> this method was made popular by an early 1990s video made by a t v crew during a relatively weak <UNK> in kansas however in the most serious <UNK> people can be sucked out from these <UNK> this happened during a may 1999 <UNK> in <UNK> br br the <UNK> in this movie hit in the fall which is not a common time for them to happen then again one of my close encounters took place in late september also they traveled from <UNK> to <UNK> while most such <UNK> in the northern <UNK> go from <UNK> to <UNK> however this is not all that unusual a famous <UNK> that struck <UNK> <UNK> in the early 1990s traveled in that direction as did the one involved in my other close encounter br br i think that the movie should have been set in the spring this movie was based on a book that in turn was based on an actual event that happened on june 3 1980 but it was still a compelling story
<START> i read james <UNK> book it was pretty neat not great but entertaining enough without having read the book i wouldn't have had the slightest idea what was going on and it was still a stretch with that knowledge br br literally every element of this film is abysmal in ways i do not have the capacity to describe half <UNK> fish could have made a better film with <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br never before or since as a film made me feel so angry the <UNK> sequels came closest but even they never reached such depths of utterly <UNK> nauseating <UNK> that this <UNK> did br br since wasting 90 minutes of my life witnessing this plague on human kind i am now unable to even look at any book by james <UNK> without feeling angry that is the depth of hatred i have for this piece of sh t no that's unfair let me <UNK> to all <UNK> matter for comparing you to the <UNK> evil that is <UNK> <UNK> br br plain and simply a cancer on the world of cinema
<START> i don't know what the oscar voters saw in this movie but they must of seen some pretty hard stuff to see in it to be able to award it with the best picture oscar all i know is that fortunately there was gene kelly to play in it or this would have been twice as bad as i believe it is first of all i don't think leslie caron was really fit to play such a role she isn't that talented she isn't a great dancer and she's not good looking at all it's a shame that one actor or actress may ruin a movie just like by playing in it because if leslie caron hadn't been in this it might have made a terrific movie the story was intelligent the directing wasn't bad and as i said gene kelly was pretty good now i'm not saying all this stuff about leslie caron just to criticize her i'm just saying it because i think that's what the worse part of the movie is she's probably a good actress but i can't tell because i haven't seen her in anything else but i think she was pretty bad in an american in paris so if you want to see it go ahead but i'm telling you you're way better off watching <UNK> in the rain
<START> father is still away on business was <UNK> of an review after promise me this premiere in cannes i do understand why many thinks the same but unique expression of kusturica is still present in his new movie and is something why critics can't touch him i had two hours of pure energy without rest even when kusturica is suffering of lack of concentration or fear of empty space he is still unique and <UNK> surprisingly good performance of <UNK> kusturica much more close ups and less landscapes then in life is a miracle <UNK> <UNK> has femme fatal world class potential please don't spoil it surely i recommend to everyone to see this film
<START> written by stephen king but this treatment is not as solid as most of his stories on film a mother and son move into a small indiana town with a secret they are <UNK> <UNK> type creatures that feed on young <UNK> this little story has its share of gore and special effects plus hints of incest br br alice <UNK> is outstanding as the mother others appearing are <UNK> <UNK> brian <UNK> and cindy <UNK> look for very small roles for john <UNK> and clive barker stephen king cameos as the caretaker of the cemetery
<START> i knew it wasn't <UNK> work out between me and d wars from the moment we met first its title was lazy d war like writing out dragon was too much for them also you really can't be that blatant with your title unless your blue monkey blue monkey can do whatever the hell it wants br br the second sign of a rocky relationship between us was the story's insane progression here's the film dreamy reporter guy reports on big snake tracks flashes back to a time he and dad <UNK> into what must have been the competition for the store in <UNK> and dreamy kid reporter finds a box that <UNK> old shop keep reveals several terrible truths that <UNK> a supposedly evil snake was cheated out of his chance to be a god tells the kid that he's a <UNK> warrior and that somewhere in la is his <UNK> lover and gives him a junk piece of jewelry shop keep also reveals that despite his obvious <UNK> he's a 500 year old asian br br fifteen years later dreamy reporter remembers this perfectly and starts acting half crazy trying to find this random girl cgi <UNK> follow and in the last ten minutes my brain <UNK> out of my nose why continue on dear reader if you have the balls br br so sarah the <UNK> lover has her own flashbacks i have the benefit of having an asian best friend and in the scene where she starts to freak out and make a bunch of posters with asian characters on them he tells me that whoever made this movie has no idea what their doing its a korean legend and she's <UNK> from a korean princess but everything is in chinese later that night her dragon <UNK> starts to hurt she calls the police cause it looks like she's having a heart attack see in this mixed up crazy world they apparently handle heart attacks differently because the next time we see her she's locked in her room with a guard outside and a nurse claims she's crazy i have a new <UNK> now and its that if i'm ever in trouble the first <UNK> will just assume i'm crazy br br i have another point of <UNK> with my harsh mistress <UNK> there is a scene when patrick <UNK> jr dreamy reporter is in a <UNK> with sassy black friend in the scenes prior <UNK> near <UNK> <UNK> has killed an elephant <UNK> through a <UNK> and killed one of <UNK> friends see people were afraid to come out after 9 11 happened but we must have all <UNK> up after that deciding coffee and <UNK> were worth <UNK> our lives for business as usual no way a giant snake will stop me from getting my <UNK> on if i stay inside and fear for my life the terrorists and <UNK> <UNK> win br br after being given a satisfying dragon on helicopter battle my cruel lover <UNK> treats me to a <UNK> and <UNK> filled scene to end it all with <UNK> has a <UNK> of his own and its right under la i guess they don't really say but dreamy reporter and sarah get knocked out in a car crash that would kill lesser men and when they wake up yep dragon palace some retarded dialog later a good dragon snake god pops out of nowhere and the snakes <UNK> make love whatever and i'm not kidding good snake out of nowhere maybe you think i'm blowing it out of <UNK> i'm not there is no mention of this thing in the movie then suddenly there few seconds later and good dragon becomes dragon god sets <UNK> on fire sarah turns into a ghost and goes with dragon god dreamy reporter left in the middle of nowhere roll credits thank god br br now our relationship as rocky as it was had its good times there was a guy that look like <UNK> from <UNK> and talked exactly like a <UNK> <UNK> from star wars i'll call him <UNK> <UNK> he could do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted to it just could never be useful he could walk through a wall in a scene where that wasn't helpful he could go in your dreams when that wouldn't do any good and he could light ten random soldier guys on fire but not when it <UNK> he was also <UNK> to touching that junk jewelry i like him cause he was hit by a car twice in the same scene and made fantastic <UNK> <UNK> noises br br the actors for the most part were great if great somehow meant terrible jason <UNK> whom i thought was awesome in <UNK> i slowly find out can only act one way and that's pretentious spacey and patrick <UNK> ish br br the one thing i love about this filthy prostitute <UNK> is its lead actor <UNK> that giant snake acted his heart out i'd dare to say that he was better at playing a cgi <UNK> <UNK> god of evil then john barrymore was at playing richard the iii or hamlet there was emotion in every scene stealing the thunder from his lesser mortal supporting cast when he ate an elephant i felt like no one past present or future would ever eat an elephant with as much feeling he was more then an actor he was a force of nature and he put his heart and soul into every second of this cursed project yes damn it my favorite actor in this film was a cgi snake i've got the balls to admit that do you br br here's to hoping <UNK> <UNK> more work and isn't type cast that jason <UNK> finds a range of emotion other then dreamy stare and that i never have to watch blue monkey again br br so d war its over i want my <UNK> back and let's just be friends
<START> before i'd seen this i had seen some pretty bad christmas films but once i saw this <UNK> all the way looked better than the godfather santa claus is a jolly film about santa helping out some kids but it almost feels demonic watching it <UNK> jolly ho ho ho is <UNK> by an evil <UNK> laugh that i'm sure has turned many kids off of christmas the plot of this massacre is very strange which fits along with all of the performances and dialog santa lives high above earth in the north pole where he and kids from all around the world get ready for christmas but santa has an enemy named pitch or satan pitch tries to ruin <UNK> christmas by making three boys naughty and by creating <UNK> like moving the <UNK> and making the <UNK> hot when pitch causes santa to be attacked by a dog it's up to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the wizard to get santa out of this <UNK> br br everything about this film along with being downright bad is so bizarre satan dances a lot and he actually seems much more merry than santa santa talks about delivering presents to all the boys and girls yet he seems to only deliver to 5 houses of kids in mexico the <UNK> are wind up toys and when the <UNK> laughs i'm amazed it doesn't bring tears to kid's eyes it's frightening everything is terrible the first 10 minutes are simply santa playing the <UNK> while kids sing to it probably one of the strangest scenes is santa shooting pitch in the butt with a mini cannon and <UNK> laughing about it while pitch dances around in pain i think parents are better off telling their little kids about where babies come from than showing them this the only positive is it will have you laughing hysterically if you can appreciate bad cinema br br my rating bomb 85 mins
<START> i ran across this several years ago while channel surfing on a sunday afternoon though it was obviously a cheesy tv movie from the 70s the direction and score were well done enough that it grabbed my attention and indeed i was hooked and had to watch it through to the end i recently got the opportunity to buy a foreign dvd of this film <UNK> didn't notice a domestic one had finally come out a couple months prior and was very pleased to be able to watch it again and in its entirety br br i don't wholly understand the phenomenon but somehow the 70s seem to have a lock on horror movies that are actually scary the decades prior to the 70s produced some beautifully shot films and the bulk of our enduring horror icons but are they actually scary no not very likewise in the years since the 70s we've gotten horror movies that are <UNK> more exciting have much better production values and sophisticated special effects are more fun funnier have effective jump moments and some very creative uses of gore but again they aren't really scary there's just something about the atmosphere of the 70s horror films the grainy film quality the <UNK> dark scenes <UNK> by vast high tech lighting <UNK> the edge of <UNK> muted quality of the dialogue and the weird and <UNK> <UNK> scores the odd sense of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> everything everything that works to <UNK> most movies of the 70s in the case of horror works in its favor br br specifically in this film the quiet intense shots of the devil dog staring people down is fairly unnerving so much more effective than if they had gone the more obvious route of having the dog be <UNK> <UNK> and overtly hostile <UNK> the filmmakers wisely save that for when the dog appears in its full on supernatural form the effects when that occurs while <UNK> by today's standards literally gave me chills the bizarre vaguely defined i'm not quite sure what i'm looking at look <UNK> strikes me as more like how a real supernatural vision would be rather than the hyper real crystal clear <UNK> <UNK> digital <UNK> <UNK> of latter day horror films br br while the human characters in this film are not as <UNK> rendered as their nemesis or the world they inhabit the actors all do a decent job the pairing of the brother and sister from the witch mountain movies as yes brother and sister is a rather cheesy bit of stunt casting but they do fine <UNK> <UNK> always manages to be entertaining if <UNK> richard crenna earns more and more empathy from the audience as the film progresses his self doubt as he wonders whether his family's <UNK> is truly due to a supernatural plot or whether he's merely <UNK> to paranoid <UNK> is pretty well handled though his thought that getting a routine physical may provide an explanation for what he's been experiencing is absurd in its <UNK> br br the movie's the end question mark type ending is one of the only ones i've seen that doesn't feel like a cheap gimmick and actually made me think about the choices these characters would be faced with next and what they'd be likely to do and how they'd feel about it br br <UNK> of this film may say it's merely a feature length vehicle for some <UNK> glowing <UNK> shots but hey you could say the same thing about blade runner
<START> <UNK> if you really want some action check out the babes and bombs on this non stop thriller veteran star martin sheen leads a trio of <UNK> on a mission to stop nuclear terrorism but director dean hamilton doesn't let this heavy <UNK> get in the way of massive doses of <UNK> <UNK> scenes <UNK> beach <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hot <UNK> and the like want action you'll get more of it here than in pearl harbor want babes you'll get an <UNK> every two minutes want more go out and buy this video <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that's some mighty <UNK> <UNK>
<START> not the most successful television project john <UNK> ever did strange case has the feel of a first draft that was rushed into production before any <UNK> could be made there are some silly ideas throughout and even a few clever ones but the story as a whole unfortunately doesn't add up to much br br arthur lowe is a hoot though as dr watson <UNK> bits and all good lord
<START> robert taylor definitely showed himself to be a fine dramatic actor in his role as a gun <UNK> buffalo hunter in this 1956 western it was one of the few times that taylor would play a heavy in a film nonetheless this picture was far from great as shortly after this taylor <UNK> to television with the successful series the detectives br br stuart granger <UNK> his british accent and turned in a <UNK> performance as <UNK> partner br br taylor is a <UNK> here and his hatred for the indians really shows br br another very good performance here was by veteran actor lloyd nolan as an aged drinking old <UNK> who joined in the hunt for buffalo as well in his early scenes nolan was really doing an excellent take off of walter huston in his oscar winning role in the treasure of the <UNK> <UNK> in 1948 note the appearance of russ <UNK> in the film the following year <UNK> and nolan would join in the phenomenal <UNK> place br br the writing in the film is stiff at best by the film's end it's the elements of nature that did taylor in how about the elements of the writing here
<START> this movie sucked the acting sucked the script sucked and the movie overall sucked there were two threads in the movie that were not developed and the viewer had to do a bit of work to figure out what was happening br br i'm not saying that it needs to be spelled out but you suddenly find things happening and being said as if you have the slightest clue as to what they are examples br br the <UNK> negative comments about the hero the audience is never shown how she even knows anything about the guy and how he is tied into her <UNK> death the viewer has minimal exposure to the guy's death as well br br also all of a sudden there is a scene with a bunch of guys <UNK> up and <UNK> machine guns and that is all you see before cutting back to the other scenes no explanation what so ever about the guns and the folks with them br br we gave it a 3 because we didn't feel like we wanted our time back it was fun to bad mouth the movie while watching it so it at least gave us a bit of entertainment
<START> not wishing to give anything away here i would just say this technically excellent <UNK> acted and uplifting little <UNK> will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a <UNK> entertainment it will <UNK> surprise possibly embarrass occasionally and almost certainly <UNK> at the <UNK> from time to time as it approaches the inevitable but not obvious ending without becoming clich√©d or predictable in any way most definitely recommended br br a previous <UNK> comment gives 8 out of 10 for the film and 10 out of 10 for both branagh and bonham <UNK> outstanding performances i agree entirely
<START> despite its low key release in this country and its apparent disregard in other countries the <UNK> rating in the states can't have helped honestly just because <UNK> uses the c word this is actually a fine piece of work the sentimentality does occasionally <UNK> to choke it but it's overcome by the playing of the two leads br br it's easy to win <UNK> just because you're playing a physical or mental <UNK> daniel day lewis geoffrey rush dustin hoffman etc and helena bonham carter may not quite capture the physical <UNK> of <UNK> but her vocal <UNK> and ruthless emotional drive compensate entirely in fact almost all her performance is <UNK> through her eyes and what eyes this is an intelligent turn from an actress who is rapidly <UNK> her english rose reputation and <UNK> as a figure of some stature awards must surely follow though not alas for this fine performance br br branagh one feels has never quite given his best on film except possibly <UNK> and there his playing was <UNK> by the large cast here though he tops his other appearances playing to the <UNK> a self loathing unstable ultimately lovable guy with a subtlety he hasn't always displayed and <UNK> both intelligence and depth in short we believe him just as much as we could not believe him as frankenstein as the priest in 'the <UNK> as the lawyer in 'the <UNK> man' even as andrew in <UNK> <UNK> this is surely his finest performance yet so why could he not produce the goods much earlier br br as a film it looks more like a television offering and without its stars it probably wouldn't amount to very much but it's been a pleasure to see this pair perform their <UNK> off like this and i eagerly <UNK> more from them though not <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 8 out of 10 but branagh and <UNK> get 10 out of 10
<START> i absolutely adore the book written by robin <UNK> so i was very excited when i heard that a movie based on the book was in the making br br but i was severely disappointed with the movie when i did see it because it didn't capture what i loved about the book the absolutely ridiculously funny <UNK> and the interesting way in which she views the world br br from the start of the movie i realised that things weren't the same as i had imagined in the book so i just went along for the ride it wasn't all that bad i guess miss <UNK> was totally different to what i had imagined her to be i didn't think she would be one to smoke and drink jean <UNK> who plays her is hilarious br br on it's own i thought the movie and it's actors actresses in it did a good job but alas i'm such a fan of the book one of my all time favourite books that i couldn't help but feel disappointed p
<START> i have to say this is an awful movie for the mere fact that when you see this movie on the guide it is listed as a documentary as i watched it i started laughing thinking to myself does this guy actually expect me to believe this is real so i had to look it up and now see that it is a movie but now since it isn't a documentary it is now a movie with bad acting so either way it is pretty bad i actually didn't make it to the end i had to shut it off i am a nyc police officer and felt that someone was trying to <UNK> people into thinking this is a documentary with the intentions of making money off of a terrible day for me and my <UNK> so i took it a little personal maybe i was <UNK> by that and it isn't as bad as i personally think it is everyone has their own opinion
<START> after becoming completely addicted to six feet under i didn't think there would ever be another show that would come close to being as good as this show well i was wrong lost is <UNK> i absolutely love this show and cannot turn it off the <UNK> of the characters the <UNK> of the plot the beautiful setting are all amazing i am totally and completely hooked i don't know how the creators do it but each character touches me very deeply i feel their joy their pain everything right down to my core i don't have cable so i've been renting the series on netflix when i put it on i watch all the episodes at once and feel sad when it is over i can't wait for the next disc to arrive at my house this is probably the best tv show i have ever seen
<START> i first watched the walking tall movies when i was about 8 years old and i thought both joe don baker and bo <UNK> did a great job they must have anyway because since watching the movies i have tried to learn as much about the real sheriff <UNK> <UNK> as i can all 3 parts of the movie gave me chills and <UNK> <UNK> was a true hero i only wish he were alive today and that there were more people like him i would love to thank him for getting rid of all the crime and being so brave i am very sorry that his family had to go through such horror and pain my heart goes out to them so from a 30 year old fan of sheriff <UNK> and of the 3 part walking tall movies and the actors that portrayed him please do not be negative about these movies and actors they were only trying to let us know what a wonderful man the real <UNK> <UNK> was and what a great family he had and to all the young people who may have not heard much about <UNK> i suggest you watch the walking tall movies and learn more about him
<START> i remember seeing this film years ago on i think <UNK> i would very much like to view it again does anyone know how i can obtain a copy as i remember it was an especially powerful movie in particular the scene that stands out is of the horses wearing gas masks apart from that i really can't recall too much about the story which is why i want to view it again i have <UNK> the web but am unable to find a copy which is unusual in my experience perhaps there is no dvd or vhs of this film on the market would appreciate any help anyone can give me on this thanks very much in advance for your assistance best regards <UNK> <UNK> com
<START> i appreciate a think positive feel good about yourself film but this is too much in the end they look like a bunch of <UNK> this film is one of those finding yourself 70's plots i know the film is made in 1980 a lot more of clint and girl friend movie this movie is a 3 10
<START> for all the homicide <UNK> out there this movie was great every single character that ever was on the show made an appearance in the movie it helped to resolve some but not all issues from the series unfortunately unless you actually did watch the series most of the enjoyment would be lost as the movie made heavy references to every season of the show's existence this probably would have been appropriate as a series finale as opposed to being a separate movie but we gotta take what we can get i hope they make more movies and continue to feature homicide characters on law and order
<START> what ever possessed martin <UNK> to remake this film and not only did he remake it completely ruin it the nonsensical decision to make the character played by robert deniro in his most overdone performance and that's saying a lot into a religious fanatic is ridiculous and <UNK> of attitudes <UNK> by hollywood and mr <UNK> especially attitudes that <UNK> writers to think that the best way to make a character insane is to <UNK> a <UNK> on his back in any case this movie is awful br br
<START> i just wondering what is the purpose of making movies like this the profit and to whom they are referring what intelligence must use your brain to watch something like this crap this movie is watchable by under 3 years old children if you are adults don't try to watch it thats the reason i think hollywood started to use cartoons in movies with actors like this you must forget the art of cinema be sure that you ll have tons of pop corn to <UNK> for time to pass till this movie ends also get many <UNK> <UNK> your <UNK> your <UNK> this movie can be used easily in a restaurant but for sure not in a theater my dog who is always next to my family when watching a movie left the building the sure thing is that this movie is referring to people with no demands from the cinema art the only thing that this movie can be used is for watching it when making the supermarket shopping list i am giving 2 stars for supporting the <UNK> cinema efforts but for nothing more or less
<START> if you want to laugh like crazy rent cage cage is about two war heroes billy and scott who are best friends when billy is shot in vietnam he is unable to <UNK> for himself so scott takes him in br br i have never seen a movie with more gay references to the two main characters billy and scott love to <UNK> and scott tells billy that he is still sore from last night among other things br br wonderful catch phrases like shut the sh t up and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cut the sh t will keep you laughing for hours the native american guys that are supposed to be playing mexican gang members are also top notch as they say it's party time right now <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i could go on forever but just watch this movie and laugh your a off it was so funny i went out and bought the dvd for 5 99
<START> its one of those stereotypical mtv generation dance movies and i do not see where all this <UNK> not that <UNK> rubbish is coming from the acting is terrible it follows exactly the same storyline as all the other <UNK> movies out there its terrible the name should scream don't watch <UNK> she move ' since when can movie titles ignore <UNK> at least some dance movies had half decent dance scenes these ones don't even deserve a watch i give it a 1 out of 10 just because there is no zero i seriously <UNK> anyone with an iq of over 60 not to watch this and not to waste your money the 1 6 10 should tell it all this movie should not have even be made
<START> i wasn't really going to comment but then i figured i had something to say i saw this film two days ago and although i think it's not a complete waste of time it might have been of money though for the producers it's obvious it has serious problems it's got really good cinematography and little but nice music a lot has been said about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but let's be honest over what she is not really an actress an she <UNK> <UNK> between over acting and preposterous under acting her performance passes for good because there has never been anyone like <UNK> in any other film crazy sad <UNK> an <UNK> no one knows <UNK> so she's kinda sorta <UNK> the rules here br br i thought this film was also a good example of the problem most portuguese films suffer from soundtrack there is a permanent no to dubbing and the result is this usual mass of noise that comes out of the blue people in other countries may think <UNK> is the <UNK> of places what thrilled me though was that some of the dialog was dubbed but it didn't necessarily solve the syndrome bad dubbing too i must say it's strange to watch a film in which the first thing that strikes my mind on the first scene when the first character speaks is it's dubbed and all this to say that the film has technical problems br br it also has script problems it tries to be classical from the first to the last scene there was a desperate fear of leaving things suspended and that shows the writer was obviously trying to get everything straight and he does but it shows all dialog is too <UNK> and there isn't one single piece of talk that sounds like a line from a film it's all a little raw and slightly unpleasant br br not that the film is a total mess i must stress i just think the good parts are so obvious that i prefer to concentrate on the bad ones br br direction brings little to the weak screenplay all shots are classical and un innovative but their beautiful great work from <UNK> <UNK> by the way br br now what i think was the problem the one that keeps people from believing this story and laugh throughout the film instead of taking it seriously the guy who plays the guy who dies is obviously not an actor actually it's a rather important role and i can't see why non actors are cast for such parts this guy is neither an actor nor a good looking man which means the whole film rolls down the mountain since we never believe for one second that this gorgeous woman is obsessed with him even though he's gone and that his hunky lover who survives is actually having a bad time getting over the loss when all we see of this character is <UNK> too bad the world is full of beautiful people who even happen to be nice seductive lovers the world is full of good actors who are also cute boys and capable of causing <UNK> on people after <UNK> gone the world is full of great films and also of not that great films <UNK> la <UNK>
<START> well maybe i'm just having a bad run with hindi movies lately i asked the video store guy for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but being a new release wasn't available yet so i had to settle for this one it turned out to be the stupidest hindi movie i've seen and i've seen quite a few no wonder bollywood is the laughing stock of the whole world if imdb had negative ratings i would give <UNK> <UNK> a 10 br br i remember seeing a tv show about the <UNK> premiere they had for its release in <UNK> all the usual <UNK> and their <UNK> showed up for some strange reason people expect good stuff from <UNK> i did not like <UNK> <UNK> or his other films <UNK> probably dubbed from <UNK> or <UNK> came across as very loud in your face fare that again didn't make much sense except in a bollywood flick this latest piece of utter <UNK> proved that this guy has no brains who made him a director even a bollywood director at that br br anyhow to the film now what starts off as a romantic <UNK> turns into a non <UNK> woman hunt two fashion <UNK> working for a magazine share an apartment isn't it similar to no entry where the 2 <UNK> work for a <UNK> magazine and share an office <UNK> christ now they're <UNK> their own stories well anyways there's some cook or chef that tries to help one of the <UNK> in his quest for multi <UNK> love aka multi <UNK> multi timing what happened in the end i've no idea i switched off mid way what ridiculous junk i can't believe they even released it and how sadistic to <UNK> in their own filth for which audience did they make it the poor illiterate indian masses 700 <UNK> at last count or the well <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> staying in <UNK> either ways it doesn't matter neither group has any clue what makes a good movie and probably deserves such god awful stuff br br its a short review because there's nothing to write about but the usual bag of f grade garbage bollywood should change its name to <UNK> and yes this review is much better than the movie itself
<START> cool idea <UNK> writing <UNK> directing <UNK> editing <UNK> acting sorta makes me wish i could play god and strike everyone involved in making this film with several <UNK> of lightning
<START> i read <UNK> novel with interest and became quite enchanted with its characters and heartbreaking tale based on historical truths br br however i was simply appalled at this disastrous adaptation the casting was based merely on physical appearance and not acting talent with the obvious exception of peter <UNK> who was neither blond haired or able to act his way out of a wet paper bag the <UNK> embarrassingly clumsy and inconsistent attempts at affecting a french accent was hilarious but not in an entertaining way i found myself <UNK> through this muddled and melodramatic tripe and was surprised i made it to the end br br a warning to fans of the novel stay away from this one

<START> possible spoilers ahead br br <UNK> <UNK> a busy b movie actor during the forties and fifties leads an expedition to mars before we get to the red planet we're entertained by romantic <UNK> between <UNK> and scientist nora hayden resident <UNK> jack <UNK> and the sight of les <UNK> as another scientist sporting a billy goat beard the martian <UNK> feature fake backdrops and <UNK> ranging from red to <UNK> the <UNK> process <UNK> in the ads real cool monsters include a giant <UNK> a three eyed <UNK> creature an <UNK> <UNK> fly trap and the unforgettable rat bat spider the whole bizarre adventure is <UNK> by survivor hayden under the influence of hypnotic drugs the angry red planet reportedly has quite a cult following and it probably picked up most of its <UNK> during the psychedelic sixties
<START> this movie is a bad memory from my childhood this is one of those movies that they show kids on a rainy day at school when you can't go out for <UNK> and you'd rather be watching anything anything else at least that's what it was like when i was in <UNK> school i just remember hating this movie granted i haven't seen it in 15 years or so and they probably don't use it on rainy days anymore but i just want to warn everyone you'd be better off using this to put your kids to sleep than entertaining them trust me pick anything else even though the topic is kind of controversial the plot is so tame and slow that i can't remember anything about it except that i disliked it so strongly that here 15 years later i felt the need to warn all of you against it
<START> in april of 1965 cbs broadcast the first of barbra <UNK> monumental television <UNK> the show was not only a runaway ratings success but garnered 5 emmy awards as well this is one of the most memorable moments of 1960's television and unfortunately the kind of television special they don't produce anymore filled with wonderful songs and a spectacular performance by barbra this special is a must view for any streisand fan and anyone interested in early television
<START> i saw this film in my cinema class i am glad that i did not pay to see it i came into it with an open mind and was even a little excited i really enjoy ed norton and <UNK> rachel wood and the rest of the cast was interesting i just never connected with this movie the acting was great the cinematography was interesting but the storyline or rather lack thereof was a problem there was no central connecting theme to the movie was it a romance between norton and wood well no not really was it a western kind of but no i'm all for twists in movies i recently saw brick and loved it but the place that this movie went was just too out there it was so weird and if i weren't required to have sat through the whole film i would have walked out the writing wasn't terrible but it was just all over the place by the time this movie ended i was just left terribly confused and wishing that it had ended sooner there was just something about this film that didn't <UNK> i understand more offbeat films like fight club but i just did not care about the characters at all
<START> i saw this movie at the <UNK> international film festival with the great dr uwe boll in <UNK> br br the film is simply put very very bad and no not in the usual uwe boll so bad it's actually entertaining way but just plain bad the plot concerns a man who leads a terrible life because of a past criminal record apparently can't get a job and with an awful <UNK> pound cheating wife this man turns to his cult leader uncle in a plan to steal a truck load of toys that contain the bird <UNK> virus al <UNK> also has designs on stealing the toys and what follows is just under two hours of completely incomprehensible sex and violence br br the acting is awful except for dave <UNK> who really tries despite it all the jokes never rise above children being shot in the chest in slow motion and people taking a poo it's supposed to be satire but i'm not sure of what br br think airplane but done by the creators of south park and without any jokes
<START> i sat through almost one episode of this series and just couldn't take anymore it felt as though i'd watched dozens of episodes already and then it hit me there's nothing new here i've heard that joke on seinfeld i saw someone fall like that on friends an episode of happy days had almost the same storyline <UNK> none of the actors are interesting here either some were good on other shows not here and others are new to a profession they should have never entered avoid this stinker
<START> perhaps the last film you would expect to come from <UNK> de <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> who wrote the novel on which this film is based it's a <UNK> fantasy kind of an <UNK> really an old woman finds a baby in her <UNK> <UNK> and raises him as her own son after a few years the baby is a young boy named <UNK> and the <UNK> mother is dying he goes to an <UNK> and when he finally turns 18 he leaves immediately he finds that he has no home <UNK> is optimistic though and won't let anything get him down a man steals his <UNK> and instead of getting angry over it <UNK> becomes his friend and goes and stays with him in a small <UNK> <UNK> takes some <UNK> and <UNK> the many homeless living in the area and they build a better <UNK> soon the <UNK> is trying to sell this plot of land and the citizens of the <UNK> have to protect themselves after many attempts the owner <UNK> a force of police to get rid of the homeless at this point the film becomes full <UNK> fantasy before this it was more comedic fantastic melodrama in the style of charlie chaplin this stuff is so weird and shocking that it's probably best for others to see it for themselves it's quite amazing and very funny there are <UNK> you could raise about the plot of miracle in <UNK> most certainly fellini and visconti were greatly criticized when they started to stray from <UNK> i think i read this was widely criticized at the time of its release at this point though it's so enjoyable i loved it very much it might be my favorite of <UNK> de <UNK> films although <UNK> d and the <UNK> thieves come very very close 10 10
<START> i watch this movie all the time i've watched it with family ages 3 to <UNK> and everyone in between they all loved it it really shows the true scenes a dog has and the love and loyalty you get from a pet just beautiful br br it's great for <UNK> who love comedy movies the tear <UNK> movies or even just pets br br the music is wonderful the animals spectacular the scenes truly thought out and the characters perfect what i liked about the characters is the true and nicely mixed personalities shadow the oldest a golden <UNK> he's the wise one filled with the wisdom and mindset of any dog chance the american <UNK> puppy is basically a puppy with a witty side the comical character and sassy the <UNK> cat she's the real cat who shows what a real cat will do for their owner the real <UNK> one
<START> made one year before <UNK> she wolf of the ss <UNK> could have easily been called susan she wolf of the plantation and it probably inspired the producers behind the nazi <UNK> epics to go ahead with their more infamous films because the stories are identical a gorgeous horny head strong but stupid blonde woman <UNK> and kills many people under her control whom all hate her and want her dead sounds familiar director russ meyer and david <UNK> the producer behind the <UNK> flicks are good friends and they started their careers together so obviously there's a connection there looking at <UNK> i can't help but think that russ meyer wanted to move on and do something else than his typical <UNK> women epics because <UNK> movies were all the rage during the mid 1970s and russ meyer films though filled with nudity and <UNK> and violence were never even close to real porn his films started to look positively quaint next to deep throat and other hard core porno blockbusters meyer knew he couldn't compete with such films and <UNK> is sorta the end result of such a <UNK> in his career he obviously wanted to branch out into different <UNK> territory but <UNK> bombed at the b o and meyer quickly returned to making <UNK> type of films that even if they still weren't pornographic they were most definitely more over the top than any of his previous films br br it's no wonder <UNK> was a b o failure it's just terrible trash o <UNK> jaw <UNK> bad it's a quasi campy take on slavery if you can imagine that the end result is jarring one minute we're in typical meyer territory <UNK> playful and silly and then the next minute super serious <UNK> on slavery and violence huh it just doesn't work the slavery racism aspect is woefully <UNK> and <UNK> this movie in the true exploitation category but <UNK> is not as sleazy as <UNK> she wolf of the ss and those kind of films so i imagine fans of the latter were disappointed by it which would explain the almost lack of interest in this movie from either exploitation fans or russ meyer fans meyer blames the failure of <UNK> because and i quote it didn't have enough breasts in it well i'm sorry russ but the film is just bad breast or no breasts but he's right though about the low breast <UNK> except for <UNK> and the maid the film's cast is male meyer <UNK> his usual <UNK> of <UNK> babes with <UNK> of <UNK> with massive <UNK> in the form of anonymous black actors playing the slaves and the big david darth vader <UNK> and with <UNK> right hand man around who is portrayed as a ruthless but clever gay man who enjoys the power he has over the men one can only wonder what meyer was really trying to create here br br <UNK> stars david <UNK> who is <UNK> after by <UNK> and her right hand man poor david he looks totally <UNK> by the whole experience he did seem to have fun making the movie but you can clearly see that at times he has no idea what's going on and then there's <UNK> <UNK> she's a beautiful woman for the 1970s not the <UNK> with her makeup and hair she looks like a typical 1970s brit pin up babe than a turn of the century <UNK> and her wardrobe is hilarious at one time she actually <UNK> her leather boots i didn't know they had <UNK> in those days but the character she plays is in itself really <UNK> no pun intended she's nothing but a <UNK> to the object of lust and <UNK> of every men and that woman on the island for example one night when david and <UNK> are getting it on her annoying slave driver walks in the room knocks david unconscious and tries to rape her <UNK> her <UNK> the next day the slave driver is still working for <UNK> and the two act as if nothing had happened it's totally ludicrous under any <UNK> had her character been a real person <UNK> would have whipped the slave driver senseless and kicked his butt off the island or even killed him but the fact that the woman keeps him on her plantation after he tried to rape her is <UNK> the flimsy story and characters' <UNK> to the max br br ridiculous details like this and the thoroughly startling <UNK> angle makes <UNK> a strangely unpleasant but watchable movie watchable in the train wreck variety i just couldn't help but watch the film for the utter <UNK> aspects of it all the excellent cinematography sorta makes it easier to watch so this being an exploitation film i guess it succeeded in doing what it was supposed to do but <UNK> is mainly for russ meyer <UNK>
<START> i've read some terrible things about this film so i was prepared for the worst confusing muddled horribly structured while there may be merit to some of these <UNK> this film was nowhere near as horrific as your average dvd <UNK> in fact it actually had aspirations it attempted something beyond the typical monster slasher nonsense and by god there are some interesting things going on br br ms <UNK> is a miracle to behold she carries the film <UNK> on her shoulders br br this is not to say that it's a masterpiece <UNK> ultimately <UNK> under the weight of its own ambition there are just too many unexplained subplots trying to <UNK> and the plot <UNK> created by time travel are never really addressed for example if hope knows that her mother is evil and that she will ultimately kill her brother then why doesn't she just kill ma in the film's very first sequence seems like it would have beat the hell out of traveling into the future to do it br br still i give <UNK> points for trying a little ambition is not a bad thing
<START> made me wish my own happy birds could talk <UNK> <UNK> on the reviewer who <UNK> the movie a sweet story that people of all ages will enjoy paulie is a lovable little treasure he has quite a few clever lines that truly made me laugh i especially loved the dance sequences during his <UNK> <UNK> you can forgive the obvious clich√©s as you cheer him on in his quest to be reunited with marie a charming movie featuring two strong characters who genuinely <UNK> the little parrot separated from his young owner would have liked to have seen more of the woman who becomes blind and must abandon their mutual journey i liked her artistic and poetic <UNK> a shame she could not share <UNK> reunion bless paulie in his new home at last with marie perhaps joined by the nice young man who helped him defeat the <UNK> to complete his journey
<START> this is the most boring worthless piece of crap i've ever wasted an hour of my life on all i can say is thank god it was only an hour over half of this <UNK> is footage from the original criminally insane at the very least i was able to see the highlights from that rare exploitation classic since for some reality <UNK> reason my video store only has criminally insane ii as it had it crazy fat <UNK> ii but the rest of this movie is some of the absolute worst home video acting and backyard filmmaking you'll ever see why is it my video store has this and not the original why does stuff like this actually end up in video stores why do people rent it and not immediately burn the copy once they've seen its sheer horror why <UNK> why god why br br unless you enjoy seeing annoying <UNK> eating an entire candy bar in an excruciatingly slow scene or said fruit getting hung from the <UNK> <UNK> in an even slower scene or a character getting stabbed <UNK> don't ask multiple times in the back or brain cell murdering monologues about giving <UNK> tea to one's wife and then complaining that all the talk has made one's own tea go cold or the mentally retarded eating fly soup or just simply want to see crazy fat <UNK> dancing with a bloody knife in a garden don't watch this movie repeat do not watch this movie do not rent this movie if at all possible do not walk past a shelf in a video store that has a copy of this movie setting on it you can still be saved but it is too late for me now
<START> when it first came out this work by the <UNK> brothers was much criticized and even judged to be exploitation luckily it is now <UNK> as a masterpiece of documentary cinema especially now that society has been exposed to real exploitation in what is reality television and the bad evolution of most direct cinema br br really at first we must say that this isn't really direct cinema it is more cinema <UNK> the difference between the two is very slight but it mainly is the fact that in this documentary we are made to feel the presence of the <UNK> brothers and they do interact with the characters filmed this as well makes it clear that it is not exploitation the <UNK> have been allowed in the house and they are included in what is a very eccentric situation of a very eccentric household and both edith and edie just love the idea of being filmed br br it would have been very disappointing had very been shown only a voice of god narration and shallow interviews here we are given a full portrait of the madness of the house a madness that does seem to go down well with both edie and her mother edith their house is a mess <UNK> and animals everywhere faded colors and furniture all over the house and the constant fights that are constant interactions of reality these two people have lived with each other their whole life and are not fighting in front of the camera because they want the attention but rather because they can't help talking to each other this way they know each other too well to hide their inner feelings there is no need in the end though even as they blame each other for their lives they really love each other deeply edie says she doesn't want her mother to die because she loves her very much and edith says that she doesn't want edie to leave her because she doesn't want to be alone br br but the most interesting aspect of the film is that regardless of their old age the two women can't help be girls they cannot help being one the singer the other the dancer exhibit all their artistic skills in front of their camera when edie asks david <UNK> <UNK> where have you been all my life she is really very happy that she finally gets to show the whole world herself and her wonderful <UNK> skills a beautiful portrait of <UNK> importance and a charm that is highly unlikely to be ever seen again the way only the <UNK> and few others could do
<START> i caught a bit of this concert on public television and knew i had to have it the boys give everyone at the royal albert an excellent often thrilling performance complete in every way pure too no <UNK> no smoke <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> no <UNK> entrance and an <UNK> serious and <UNK> audience all of whom left their bottle rockets at home br br if you're a cream fan or if you've only heard of them if you're a blues fan if you're a rock <UNK> roll fan you will not be disappointed when you view and listen to this dvd you also will never lose this dvd because you'll never lend it to anyone this dvd <UNK> <UNK> tell them to get their own it's too good and too <UNK> you'll want to keep it within easy reach
<START> karen sarah michelle <UNK> an exchange student in japan who is just beginning to do some social work is sent to aid an elderly semi <UNK> woman emma grace zabriskie after her previous caretaker <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> disappears karen soon learns that something is not right in <UNK> home and she attempts to see how deep the rabbit hole goes br br maybe it's a <UNK> influence from the success of m night <UNK> films but slower paced understated horror films are a recent trend in some cases such as hide and seek 2005 the approach works remarkably well and in others such as white noise 2005 the pacing tends to kill the film i didn't like the grudge quite as much as hide and seek but this is still a very good film it earns a 9 out of 10 from me br br the grudge has a couple significant differences from other recent examples of that trend however one it is well known that this is a remake based on the japanese film series that began with <UNK> on 2000 in particular it's extremely close to the first half of <UNK> on the grudge aka <UNK> on 3 from 2003 two as with many japanese horror films the slower pacing here isn't so much in the realm of <UNK> drama as with <UNK> as is also the case with a large <UNK> of european horror the grudge should be looked at more as a filmed nightmare br br director takashi <UNK> also the director of the five japanese entries in the <UNK> on series to date the fifth is currently in production and writer stephen <UNK> have largely <UNK> with <UNK> and are not overly concerned with logic or plot holes when it comes to the horror behind the story the idea instead is to present a <UNK> sequence of scenes with dream logic where the focus is atmosphere creepiness the uncanny and for many viewers scares how well the film works for you will largely depend on how well you can adapt yourself to or are used to this different approach to film making although admittedly some of the seeming gaps are filled in by previous entries in the <UNK> on series <UNK> american audiences consider as flaws leaving plot threads hanging and <UNK> rules for the monster a more poetic <UNK> surreal approach to film isn't yet accepted by the mainstream in the u s br br however even if you're not used to it it's worth trying to suspend your normal <UNK> about films and give the grudge a shot this is a well written well directed well acted film filled with unusual <UNK> such as the story <UNK> a large number of main characters which is done better here than the more episodic <UNK> on 3 good cinematography subtle production design touches check out <UNK> clothes which match the color and <UNK> of the exterior of <UNK> house when <UNK> first approaches and beautifully effective horror material br br even though it is more slowly paced that your average horror film of the past the pacing usually enhances the <UNK> and there is no <UNK> of bizarre events to keep horror fans entertained the supernatural premise of the film is absorbing and based on interviews on the dvd with <UNK> have <UNK> me to pay more attention to japanese beliefs and <UNK> although the most interesting <UNK> would probably <UNK> with a more intimate knowledge of japanese culture it's interesting to <UNK> why so many japanese horror films feature scary children and adults who look like scary children br br i <UNK> one point for the film slightly <UNK> into clich√©d mystery thriller territory with a here's what really happened flashback but even that was fairly well done and otherwise this would have been a 10 out of 10 br br now that i've said all of the above let me finish with a mini rant it's not that i'm anti remake but it is ridiculous that u s <UNK> and studios feel that we need remakes of foreign films to make them appropriate for <UNK> the original versions of these films should just be playing in u s theaters in wide release there is no need to present an almost identical film but just <UNK> white american actors for non white or foreign actors yes the grudge is a fine film but ultimately i'd rather see something original using this talent and be treated to the latest foreign horror films not just japanese but also indian spanish chinese etc at my <UNK> in the hope that someone with some pull at the studios reads this it is also more cost effective to do this as 1 you can completely avoid production costs and simply make domestic distribution deals from which you receive profit and 2 you can make money off of fans like myself who otherwise pick up the foreign film dvds in foreign <UNK> or even <UNK> versions
<START> while a pleasant enough musical what stuck with me about this movie was the unexpected comedic chemistry between basil <UNK> as the has been composer and oscar <UNK> as his assistant playing a high strung distracted artistic type a far cry from his more familiar roles as either menacing villains or the <UNK> logical sherlock holmes <UNK> character looks like he couldn't find his way out of bed without help and that help is <UNK> played with his usual <UNK> humor by oscar <UNK> upon hiring <UNK> character as his ghost song writer <UNK> introduces him to <UNK> by saying he does all my thinking for me to which <UNK> responds ah it's only a part time job of course this goes right past or over <UNK> who's too busy <UNK> about where his next hit song will come from as another reviewer said who knew <UNK> could be so funny too bad he didn't have more opportunities to display his comedic talent
<START> i was bored around <UNK> so i watched this movie and i could not stop laughing everything was so ridiculous the way the kids were acting like they were older than 11 just <UNK> me up one of the kids had a ring that supposedly killed people after 3 or so years it gave me the impression that he wanted to be a gangster br br it's pretty hard to take little kids seriously especially when it has to do with eating worms they act like everything is such a big deal like if billy the main character doesn't eat the worms then the world will end br br this is a good movie for little kids <UNK> the fact that a 5 year old says <UNK> but not for teens or adults who don't want to waste their time
<START> peaceful <UNK> robert sterling is on the losing side of a range war with his ruthless neighbors that is until notorious outlaw robert preston shows up out of the blue to level the playing field soon he begins to go too far feeding a growing sense of <UNK> in sterling especially when his son begins to <UNK> the <UNK> criminal br br the <UNK> is a tightly paced gritty and surprisingly tough little picture with a great performance by preston here he comes across as an evil version of <UNK> that is until the real nature of the <UNK> and the <UNK> relationship is revealed most movie <UNK> and video boxes spoil the surprise br br <UNK> out the cast is chill <UNK> jack <UNK> and the debut of john drew barrymore who became more famous for his <UNK> than his acting
<START> a somewhat typical bit of filmmaking from this era obviously it was first conceived into this world for the stage but nonetheless a very good film from beginning to end peter o'toole and <UNK> york get to do their stage performance act for the silver screen and both do it effectively there is very little in the way of story and anyone not familiar with this type of off beat character study may be a little put off by it all in all though a good film in which peter o'toole and <UNK> york get to <UNK>
<START> what a terrible film it sucked it was terrible i don't know what to say about this film but <UNK> which i stole from some reviewer with a nail up his ass <UNK> sigh it's not roger corman that i hate it's this god awful movie well really but what can you expect from a movie with <UNK> computer graphics which is another thing the cgi sucked out loud i hate this movie dreadfully this is without a doubt the worst roger corman b movie and probably the <UNK> b movie too it's it's <UNK> i'm sorry i must have offended some <UNK> in these moments it's just an awful movie 0 1 000
<START> i watched this movie recently together with my sister who likes the performances of sophia loren i'm a person who they call a cultural barbarian i hate art in any kind of shape or form rambo is more my kind of movie action kills blood horror if you recognize yourself in this avoid this movie like the plague no one dies no action no nudity nothing of the kind let me give you a <UNK> in a few sentences it starts out with 5 minutes in black and white nazi propaganda every italian in a <UNK> block <UNK> a parade in honor of hitler except for a housewife an anti fascist and a caretaker the housewife who is cheated by her husband meets the anti fascist she falls in love with him wants to make love to him but the anti fascist is gay despite of this they make love with each other at the end of the day the housewife reads a book from her gay lover and the guy himself is <UNK> by agents the end you want an even shorter <UNK> boring that short enough the guy should have used his gun in the beginning of this movie and shoot himself to save the audience from this atrocity on a side note my sister loved this movie like i said i'm a cultural barbarian
<START> this movie is one of the <UNK> of all time i gave it a 10 rating the story is of the famed <UNK> out of <UNK> that fought on the side of the south during the war between the states the clothing they wore were authentic the history and why they fought is very accurate and well <UNK> there was actually one of the battles that did not take place as they depicted but not bad for hollywood the actors were well cast and were either the most brilliant of actors or the director really know how to get the best from them i suspect it was a combination of great directing super casting to find the right people and excellent performing by the actors not just one or two this movie really <UNK> it has action romance suspense good guys and bad guys sometimes depending on your individual perspective and history all rolled into one movie even has the future <UNK> and jewel and she's good
<START> this movie is a little ray of sunshine in a dark season it <UNK> a quality best described as plain old <UNK> morgan freeman plays a character very like freeman himself a successful actor pushing 70 he has traveled to a small rather <UNK> <UNK> store <UNK> to research a part he might play as a manager of such a place he soon <UNK> the staff and the customers especially the lovely if <UNK> young woman paz vega who <UNK> over the 10 items or less <UNK> lane br br 10 items or less doesn't have a big statement to make and doesn't pretend that it does it follows freeman and vega as they become friendly and as the older man offers his <UNK> in exchange for a ride home the movie company <UNK> who is supposed to pick him up never shows and freeman has forgotten his own phone number so he can't call for help i had a little case of the blues on a gray sunday afternoon in new york city and this flick <UNK> what <UNK> me
<START> at the time i am writing this i see out of over 15 000 votes it has a 5 8 rating something is wrong with that picture personally i give it a 10 i can see a 7 at the lowest or a possible 8 if it was rated by people that see this movie for what it truly is it is a movie based on a comic book hero this movie won more than it's share of awards won 3 oscars another 5 wins 26 nominations right there tells me it's better than a 5 8 some great acting from some very good actors some great special effects and in my opinion will be if not already a classic for years to come if you're looking for pure entertainment be sure to check out dick tracy definitely a movie you can watch more than a few times al pacino is great as big boy <UNK>
<START> <UNK> hopkins is the lady with red hair in this 1940 biopic of mrs leslie carter which also stars claude <UNK> as david <UNK> richard <UNK> as lou payne and a fine cast of supporting players including laura hope <UNK> and victor <UNK> br br <UNK> hopkins and claude <UNK> give wonderful performances hopkins was a beautiful actress who really makes us feel for mrs carter <UNK> is great as the flamboyant <UNK> producer writer actor <UNK> david <UNK> one of the great names in theater br br though mrs <UNK> second husband lou payne served as <UNK> on this film it's a poor representation of the real events of mrs <UNK> life true there was a much <UNK> and bitter divorce and she was undoubtedly viewed as a <UNK> character for that and for becoming an actress however she had custody of her son dudley so there was no custody battle once she broke with <UNK> she did not go back to him and in fact started working in vaudeville and actually made some films toward the end of her life she did indeed marry lou and he became her leading man in many productions br br the driving force for mrs carter in the beginning of this film is <UNK> custody of her son but she finally realizes that in her time away from him he is thoroughly <UNK> with his father in the film also and i'm not sure if it was true in real life she traveled with her mother and lived in a theatrical <UNK> house which gives the film some added interesting atmosphere br br not a bad movie probably not a depiction of the greatness of either carter or <UNK> one of mrs <UNK> most famous moments was in the heart of <UNK> where she wore a wig with six foot <UNK> off stage fans blew her hair as she hung 35 feet above the stage <UNK> the center of a bell to keep it from <UNK> quite a visual
<START> it's been a long time since i last saw a movie this bad the acting is very average the story is horribly boring and i'm at a loss for words as to the execution it was completely unoriginal o and this is as much a comedy as clint eastwood's a pregnant <UNK> br br one of the first scenes the one with the television show where the hell are you got it right the cast was 80 of let's face it forgotten actors if they were hoping for a career <UNK> then i think it might never happen with this on their <UNK> the script had the potential but neither 80 of the actors nor the director who's an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor pulled it off fred <UNK> was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest br br i'm sorry but if you ever consider watching this i highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic because not only it's a total loss of time but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like
<START> this period melodrama is one of <UNK> earliest claustrophobic films characters trapped within a room are prevalent throughout his work and as time went by he would become increasingly <UNK> at portraying their <UNK> and involving the audience in their terror in the <UNK> titled sealed room there is one major difference to the normal plot line in that there truly is no escape br br griffith achieves the claustrophobic effect here in two ways first is his use of space while the typical <UNK> short might <UNK> a dozen or more sets the sealed room features only two <UNK> rooms ¬ñ the king's court and the <UNK> <UNK> that becomes the eponymous tomb the set design in these shorts is rarely <UNK> but here it is crucial the court is a large interior with a backdrop <UNK> at greater depth and showing us a window and a <UNK> actors enter and leave from various directions suggesting the room is not only <UNK> but also free and open by contrast the <UNK> <UNK> back wall is very close to the camera and the angles in it suggesting a <UNK> or <UNK> shape make it seem even more confined br br the second technique on display here is the cross cutting anyone with an interest in <UNK> work will probably know about his heavy use and development of cross cutting to build excitement or tension many will also know that strictly speaking it wasn't his invention however what makes <UNK> cross cuts so effective is the way he <UNK> the <UNK> images so they <UNK> each other the sealed room contains a good example of what i mean the shots of the <UNK> shifting the heavy <UNK> have a slow step by step pace to them with tension building as the wall gets higher this movement is matched by the shots of the <UNK> unaware lovers in which marion leonard tears off flower <UNK> one by one as the couple realise their <UNK> their rising panic is <UNK> by the <UNK> shot of the king <UNK> <UNK> his sword against the wall br br at this point griffith was yet to realise that the action could be <UNK> further by introducing a third <UNK> to the cross cut the dramatic ride to the rescue here absent was later to become a standard climax to <UNK> pictures
<START> shower keeps within itself in so many ways almost all of the movie takes place in an old time <UNK> with the <UNK> <UNK> the humor pathos and emotional touches the love and friendship between the <UNK> and his retarded son is deep and moving the way the older brother is drawn into this tiny world seems <UNK> and <UNK> the plot is meandering full of surprises and <UNK> and touched overall by a sense of what i'd have to call <UNK> in the relations and conflicts of the performers this is a film i pull out when i want to believe in the world again
<START> look i know this may suck right now but pain is temporary film is forever whatever you do right now is burned into celluloid for all time and for thousands of years to come ¬ñ robert de niro br br this was initially a film for steven spielberg the director hiring several screenwriters to <UNK> the screenplay so that it more suited his themes and so we have a dysfunctional family that is threatened by a deranged monster in the form of a recently released from prison robert de niro like jurassic park <UNK> and war of the worlds the dysfunctional family bands together to defeat the beast the beast being the creation of the father a lawyer who failed to defend de niro during his trial br br in typical spielberg fashion the father kills the monster that <UNK> the family and is then promptly <UNK> of his sins like oscar <UNK> robin williams sam <UNK> tom cruise and virtually every daddy figure in spielberg land the father <UNK> his <UNK> duty in the kind of bittersweet <UNK> that spielberg so enjoys br br but spielberg eventually abandoned the picture and the project was instead turned over to martin scorsese who at the time was seeking to try his hand at more commercial fare the result is arguably the worst film in <UNK> filmography and ironically his most <UNK> br br an <UNK> failures or <UNK> are often very revealing exposing the inner <UNK> of their art when the story doesn't work the characters don't connect or the images don't <UNK> we find ourselves left with a kind of inner core this ¬ñ the remaining <UNK> is what the director's cinema is about br br now cape fear is an <UNK> film so we won't find any <UNK> connections to the rest of <UNK> filmography you already sacrificed me de niro yells but the films themes of catholic redemption are cookie cutter what the film does though is expose the kind of language that his filmography <UNK> on watch how <UNK> camera desperately <UNK> back and forth how he <UNK> <UNK> onto <UNK> and windows in an attempt to force tension and how his characters are all loud and screaming for attention but more importantly watch how the film makes no <UNK> sense a showdown on a boat at the end of the film takes place on an obvious sound stage a street parade is claustrophobic and takes place within no larger context and the family's house doesn't seem to exist anywhere in particular there is simply no <UNK> sense to anything in the picture scorsese unable to film space or create any kind of <UNK> environment br br the reason for this is that <UNK> camera always has to be bound or <UNK> <UNK> to his central character for the world around the character to make sense his camera has to be focused on the character <UNK> can take you around a french hotel welles and hitchcock can dance you down a street and up a building cameron can give you a tour of the titanic scott can recreate an entire future <UNK> lucas can give you an alien desert planet and most other directors can create a sense of space by <UNK> close up mid shot wide shot <UNK> but scorsese can't do this there's no poetry no sense of <UNK> space in his films he's all about the character you break that <UNK> you leave that boxing ring that taxi cab you look away from de niro and everything <UNK> he simply cannot break away from this very <UNK> style of shooting which in a way is a <UNK> for action film making br br scorsese tried to <UNK> this problem with gangs of new york where the space and the sets become the central character but even this self <UNK> <UNK> experiment gets <UNK> by the <UNK> of daniel day lewis the actor drawing <UNK> camera <UNK> toward him like a <UNK> to a <UNK> br br 5 10 ¬ñ even as a generic b movie this is an ugly vulgar looking film look at the <UNK> paintings the inept attempts at tension the silly <UNK> special effects and hokey <UNK> showdown still we have robert de niro to pick up the slack de niro who gives his body over to scorsese like a <UNK> christ gives the film its only great scene in an improvised romantic sequence with young a juliette lewis he sticks his thumb into her mouth and kisses her a kind of symbolic rape the girl runs away both <UNK> and <UNK> by this man's interest br br but de <UNK> performance so deliciously over the top simply can't be <UNK> by scorsese you'd need the operatic tone and the <UNK> visuals of someone like de palma to make this work but scorsese nope br br worth one viewing
<START> if you are a fan of zorro indiana jones or action in general this is a must see directed by <UNK> ace team of william <UNK> and john english and starring reed hadley as don diego zorro this serial delivers i won't bore you with the plot who cares less talking more fighting what really matters here is <UNK> superb interpretation of the character s and the stunt work of <UNK> van <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br stunt spoilers follow br br you can see the influence this film had on lucas and spielberg zorro gets caught in the original version of the star wars trash <UNK> in one chapter trapped on a rope bridge <UNK> temple of doom in another does a <UNK> horse to coach transfer and even <UNK> through a tunnel while the baddies knock over a huge water tank and <UNK> the tunnel behind him exactly as <UNK> ram does to <UNK> in temple of doom in addition to all this the whip action is great as zorro <UNK> villains <UNK> to safety etc with his <UNK> <UNK> most of the sword work is fair to lame except for chapter one which features a terrific sword <UNK> in a <UNK> choreographed by sword stunt legend ralph <UNK> who makes a rare screen appearance as the evil rodriguez this was the first serial i ever saw on <UNK> at the <UNK> when i was a kid and i have been hooked on them ever since br br <UNK> fighting legion delivers z goods
<START> another fun witty <UNK> rko musical with astaire and rogers follow the fleet is a charming film while it lacks the stand out great tunes of <UNK> time although the final number face the music and dance is one of the <UNK> best and rightfully so it is hugely enjoyable as these two could virtually do no wrong together in the 1930's once again the plot is lightweight and forgettable but watching fred and ginger dance together is sheer heaven these two conveyed more romance and magic in dance than many couples in films do in a huge love scene while there are better fred and ginger musicals this is certainly a must see
<START> cinderella in my opinion greatest love story ever told i loved it as a kid and i love it now a wonderful disney masterpiece this is 1 of my favorite movies i love disney i could rave on and on about cinderella and disney all day but i wont i ll give you a brief outline of the story when a young girl's father dies she has to live with her evil step mother and her equally ugly and nasty step sisters <UNK> and <UNK> made to do <UNK> house <UNK> all day poor cinderella has only the little mice who <UNK> around the house and her dog bruno as friends when one day a letter is sent to her house telling all available women to attend a royal ball <UNK> evil step mother and step sisters try to prevent her <UNK> cinderella finally gets her dream and wish and is able to attend her captive beauty <UNK> and beautiful nature help her win her prince
<START> first week of may every year brings back the memories of the holocaust through movies on <UNK> among many movies they showed this was the one i had not seen br br the story is about <UNK> life and how he came to power it starts with his childhood and ends with his holding the top most position of power in germany br br the movie was earlier presented as a tv series and later converted into a movie format scottish actor robert <UNK> plays <UNK> hitler with great guts conviction and <UNK> to give a real portrayal of this man br br it is a good screenplay and narrative that <UNK> the audiences on the main events that lead hitler into power and also tries to show the <UNK> psychological make up of hitler the movie is a biased viewpoint of the director christian <UNK> ¬ñ who shows hitler as a one track menacing angry and shouting person ¬ñ who had such a strong hold on the germans and people around him hitler is not shown as someone having <UNK> and attraction and there the movie fails to convince hitler's portrayal br br even though the venture was for tv all the ingredients of production are first class and at par with any main stream movie the production value sets costumes etc were perfect br br there is a lot of criticism of this movie in the authenticity about the historic events that is presented but still the movie is gripping every engaging and entertaining robert <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the screen as no one else does he is amazingly good ¬ñ brilliant i would have liked a more balanced view of hitler's life because i think hitler was able to bring out the <UNK> feelings of million of germans and it is not only him who should be blamed for the holocaust as i have told several times that ¬ñ very sadly our society loves to garland or <UNK> one person as a representative of the <UNK> good or evil respectively
<START> this remake of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the book has some very good parts to <UNK> it and some fine performances by some fine actors however scorsese <UNK> toward the end for the most formulaic of plot twists and an embarrassingly <UNK> shakespearean demise that had me looking at my watch br br deniro is a superb actor dedicated to giving his all in the work he does however he needs direction to focus his talent and this is sorely lacking in the last five minutes of the film br br gregory <UNK> cameo is <UNK> but nothing more whilst robert <UNK> is always fun to watch even with as few lines as this br br nick nolte turns in a better performance than <UNK> oil but is not on the same form as <UNK> joe don baker has some great lines while juliette lewis proves yet again that talent sometimes <UNK> a generation br br some good points the start credits the first view of <UNK> back when doing <UNK> in the prison the scene where cody is attacked with baseball bats sam <UNK> decent into full <UNK> panic <UNK> <UNK> calm but unnerving <UNK> br br the worst the cleaning woman but not really part <UNK> bare handed to the <UNK> of a car for a hundred miles at high speed are there no speed <UNK> in the us the he's dead but not really parts and the aforementioned rambling ending br br i may watch the original again but i've yet to be tempted to watch the remake in four years since seeing it
<START> if you have any kind of heart and compassion for people this is a tough movie to watch at least in the second half of it br br it's in that segment where we see nice little kid get beaten up and then a retarded mentally challenged man go off the deep end after he witnesses this brutal act against the child it's not pleasant material br br however it's a good movie and the acting is good too the story will sit with you awhile br br dominick is the mentally disabled guy and is played by tom <UNK> i think this might be <UNK> best role ever he's looked after by a <UNK> student eugene played by ray liotta who became a star the following year with kevin <UNK> field of dreams br br dominick is a <UNK> garbage man who reads hulk comic books and loves wrestling he's the type of slow guy that you can't help but love and root for to live a happy life when he freaks out it's for several good reasons and well see the film for the whole story it's worth your time but be prepared to go on real emotional roller coaster and possibly be very upset at some things you see
<START> slow slow slow there is no mystery or excitement in this film if you don't figure out who the mole is in the first ten minutes you must be brain dead the secret service must have been too because it took them the whole film to put it together there are no compelling characters in the movie not film the pace of the movie is slow there is no tension the hired killer is an excellent shot unless he is aiming at michael douglas than all he seems to be able to hit is large <UNK> of glass the funniest scene in the movie is when the <UNK> wife says the code word at the <UNK> ending it is laugh out loud ridiculous at least six people got up and left the movie early i would have joined them if i were not sitting in the middle of the row i would not recommend this film to anyone
<START> this film has to be viewed in the right frame of mind first the central father son relationship makes it pretty clear that the film was intended as a prequel to his wong <UNK> hung film drunken master ideas from this film <UNK> in drunken master ii and not young master that chan backed away from this plan and <UNK> the characters <UNK> that he himself was not convinced the material was coming together properly and indeed the film conveys a sense of being <UNK> for instance the romantic relationship around which half the plot turns is left utterly hanging at the end of the film young master from the same period also feels <UNK> but at least all its central threads are tied together at the end this film feels as though chan <UNK> with the plot and characters trying to find his central theme only to abandon the effort possibly due to time and budget br br or perhaps the film is simply over ambitious this is an important turning point film in chan's career because he commits himself to development of the central character above all other concerns which is why there's such a lack of kung fu throughout the film chan wants to make an historical romantic comedy that just happens to have kung fu in it but both the historical element and the romantic element come across as little more than plot twists br br that leaves us with the comedy since chan's concern is character development the comedy is largely character driven as in the conflict between chan's character and his best friend an argument over a girl but there's plenty of slapstick as well frankly i find the comedy amusing enough to forgive the <UNK> of the plot br br this film represents an effort on chan's part to find a <UNK> formula that he can use and develop over time it doesn't quite work and chan would only find that formula after <UNK> the historical elements of his earlier films with the making of the contemporary action comedy police story but going back to view this film is still very informative as to how chan worked his way through the historical genre and perhaps why he abandoned it
<START> like most other reviewers i have first seen this movie on tv never on the big screen when i was a teenager my dad has always regarded this film highly and recommended it to me then and i must say he was not only right but this movie has stayed with me forever in the more than 2 decades since i saw it first time i have seen it two or three more times since then just a few days ago i gave it another watch and it has not lost anything of its impact with time it still a great and well worth to be seen movie <UNK> regard <UNK> ride the high country as one of the first and best later western which had a realistic look at life in the old west but the hardly known last hunt is definitely the better movie and was even half a dozen years earlier actually it was probably 3 decades ahead of its time or maybe it still is br br although thinking hard and having certainly seen <UNK> of western i like this genre i can not remember any western as bleak and <UNK> as this one two men bound together partly by hate partly by not seeming to have other choices surrounded by beautiful ms <UNK> a crippled old man and a young <UNK> leading the life of buffalo killers until fate reaches out for one of them br br nobody who has ever seen this movie will be able to forget its ending and the last frames of this gem when the camera moves on and away from mr taylor a white buffalo skin comes into sight on a tree and <UNK> from the past when all the hatred began are present again mr taylor has got his buffalo but in the end the buffalo got him br br aside from the top performances of everybody involved the intelligent script and the great dialogue it should also be mentioned that the last hunt is superbly <UNK> i have <UNK> seen a western that well shot aside from the ones directed by anthony mann which are also all superbly photographed that all the locations are cleverly chosen and that even the soundtrack fits the picture very well br br and director brooks is really a superb <UNK> master <UNK> he has made quite a couple of really great movies and was successful in nearly every imaginable genre but even in an as prolific career as this one the last hunt still shines as one of his best if not his best br br definitely would deserve a higher rating compared to the 7 something ride the high country enjoys
<START> eddie murphy's delirious is completely and totally rude crude crass and <UNK> this is indeed the only way to describe this appalling trashy piece of stand up eddie murphy goes for shock value rather than laughs to try and win his following over he does manage to be funny occasionally but mostly loses the plot with obscene language and <UNK> sex jokes br br forget it unless you happen to enjoy <UNK> foul style i don't think i will bother with eddie murphy raw i much prefer eddie in the confines of a movie script br br saturday january 17 1998 video
<START> <UNK> is a wonderful ride from start to finish thanks in large part to the magic that is generated by the stars alan arkin is fantastic in one of his best roles in decades like any really fine film it's a journey in which the theme is redemption and the results of dreaming i can't believe this film is so difficult to find i'd buy it on dvd in a <UNK> but have yet to find an <UNK>
<START> ok i have read about this film somewhere in the internet and many criticized on how bad and sucks this film was and i couldn't have been more agree about it then after that i saw this film on dvd i was thinking twice about this and then came commercial of this film on tv luckily i <UNK> my money for this pieces of crap i was sacrificed my sleeps for this film and soon it turned out that this film couldn't make me satisfy so i can't be judging on how the film was made but anyway it still sucks as for those who liked this film i would apologize for <UNK> this film and telling on how sucks this film is i don't know what do you think about this film
<START> <UNK> was an excellent presentation of drama suspense and thriller that is so rare to american tv sheriff lucas gave many a viewer the <UNK> we <UNK> for <UNK> as he <UNK> to resist the <UNK> of sheriff lucas we became <UNK> and <UNK> upon learning of the <UNK> connection between these two characters the <UNK> which weekly gave cause to fear what lucas would do next were truly surprising this show lived up to the gothic <UNK> in ways american entertainment has so seldom attempted much less <UNK> the suits definitely made a big mistake in not supporting this show this show puts shame to the current <UNK> of reality shows which are so less than satisfying viewing the call for a dvd box set is well based this show is quality viewing for a <UNK> market hungry for quality viewing a public that is <UNK> of over <UNK> of mind numbing reality fare will welcome this gem of real storytelling bring on the dvd box set
<START> i was enjoying this movie most of the time but i kept getting the feeling that i was watching a children's movie i honestly think that somebody wrote a pg script and then while filming decided to add in some blood nudity and language it was a big let down there's that believe the children magic that exists in movies like babe the pig or angels in the <UNK> that <UNK> the evil tooth fairy the parents end up believing their daughter about her ability to see the ghost and <UNK> this skill to <UNK> defeat the tooth fairy when i bought this movie i thought it would be a b film response to the dreadful darkness falls somehow manage to make a better film with 1 4 of the money but they don't they made a worse film and will probably lose the same <UNK> of money lost on darkness falls
<START> when it came out this was pretty much state of the art musical film entertainment to this day it's more entertaining than most in great part because it has james cagney in the lead role as a musical prologue producer under a succession of <UNK> and <UNK> from all <UNK> by his <UNK> girl friday played by joan blondell also the musical numbers towards the end which were put together by busby berkeley are pretty much a knock out as far as that type of thing goes br br but this is a pretty strange movie i mean in one of those numbers you've got billy <UNK> running around pretending to be a lovable <UNK> doing all kinds of weird stuff ruby keeler seems to have a sickening smile <UNK> on her face at all times but at least she's not required to act like in some of her later unfortunate films you'd never guess that dick powell was any kind of tough guy from seeing him in this movie apparently all the tough guy energy was <UNK> to the star cagney as for cagney his high speed <UNK> about musical shows and so forth are endearing and annoying at the same time after a while it gets a bit too much you expect him to walk out and say hey i've got a great idea for a prologue the women are <UNK> and they come out of a pack of <UNK> oh no we did that one last month it's funny but it gets a bit repetitive in the moments where he has to get tough with the bad girl ruth <UNK> some of the established cagney gangster character comes out in fact frequent b gangster director william <UNK> is credited here with dialogue <UNK> and it seems at times that cagney and blondell are <UNK> something very street even though the characters aren't criminal br br the musical numbers what can you say they stand alone as entertainment the way that berkeley uses the human body and <UNK> is really startling but none of them really mean anything it means honeymoon hotel nothing really more or less and the whole <UNK> of the <UNK> falls apart immediately since the characters in the show are doing things that couldn't possibly be appreciated by a theater audience like the movie portrays for example at one point they show the fine print on a newspaper things like that the whole thing could only exist on film so the idea that the <UNK> are actually live shows is ridiculous i can only suppose that audiences of the time were somewhat less critical about things like this than they would be ten years later or so because this is a very polished production br br it's great to see cagney himself show off his superb dancing skills and he can actually share the stage with a dancer like keeler cagney and blondell have excellent chemistry and their scenes go off really well the music i would say is only mediocre but mostly pleasing if repetitive <UNK> direction in general is very suitable but never interesting the film's entertainment value is <UNK> and it has also picked up some nostalgic value along the way it's a cut above most let's put on a show films of the 30s
<START> anna christie 1931 br br on its own terms this version of <UNK> anna christie shot a year later in german with a whole new cast is just toned down and <UNK> enough to work better than the english version both are american mgm productions garbo is if anything more commanding or more beautiful as a screen presence and her acting is more restrained and she seems frankly more at ease probably for a lot of reasons but we can <UNK> that she was no longer making her first talking picture so had <UNK> quickly br br without comparing always one film to the other this anna christie is still the same o'neill play with too many words his themes of a woman wanting love without losing her independence are here but it comes off as oddly old fashioned anyway there are some scenes missing the <UNK> island section is <UNK> and isn't as good but overall it's a direct echo of the first film the director jacques <UNK> <UNK> french is simply <UNK> what was done already which i assume must be a frustrating experience br br it's interesting to see both films in succession because they are <UNK> out exactly the same way not only the sets but the shots are all the same there is an occasional scene lifted from the earlier film some of the storm understandably but also a brief scene where marie <UNK> from the english language version is walking with her friend on a <UNK> over a <UNK> drunk as can be but they are just <UNK> and when the next scene shows their faces we see the german actors taking their parts there is no replacing <UNK> for sure but for me the german father is more believable and honest in his performance br br clearly the themes <UNK> <UNK> fathers daughters turning to prostitution and the troubles of finding true love have strong <UNK> back then especially with european threads garbo appropriately plays a swedish young woman
<START> ok i just have 3 words cheesy cheesy and cheesy the only redeeming feature of this movie is dean cain other than that it's <UNK> supreme br br the movie does have some promise in the concept an underground lab creates a real live fire breathing dragon basically giving us more of jurassic park meets reign of fire there are some great possibilities but they just don't follow through the special effects are decent even though you know the dragon is cgi it doesn't horribly look like cgi br br i wouldn't lay the blame on dean cain although he is one of the producers i'd lay more of the blame on phillip roth the director and writer it's his job to make this film and unfortunately he failed
<START> reed hadley makes a better <UNK> don diego than he does a dashing and daring zorro but that's almost beside the point because this serial features the bar none best theme song of any serial ever and the best version of <UNK> <UNK> famous <UNK> stunt there are other good stunts and lots of action and plenty of hair raising cliff <UNK> chapter endings but if for no other reason you must see this film to watch the <UNK> stunt then re watch it in slow motion it is incredible and despite the lower budget for this chapter play <UNK> turns in a better take on the stunt here than he did in the far more celebrated film <UNK> indiana jones eat your heart out this is the real deal
<START> <UNK> for what happened to his movie in terms of <UNK> and secondary directors <UNK> and <UNK> doing script <UNK> aside let's just take this movie as it's offered without <UNK> explanations br br this movie is god awful straight up <UNK> rather than rehash what may serve as a plot i'll run a highlight reel of some curious points that made me scratch my head br br a class of 5 take a field trip for a history class to the middle of <UNK> nowhere ireland these students may be canadian or american it's difficult to tell that it was filmed in a canadian forest rather than ireland is rather obvious as well one student seems to know nothing about history and is basically the dumb jock character from a number of kick ass 80's movie except when he channels randy from scream one character may be chris <UNK> stunt double he has a girlfriend who probably gets killed but it's never really established if that is true one character is <UNK> and removed from her peers just <UNK> and then there's a blonde girl <UNK> blonde girl br br ireland has a population of 2 they're cousins gary who is clearly the same age or younger than the rest of the cast is called sir more than once he's very ominous and wears a <UNK> cap his cousin is a <UNK> up porn star with the worst irish accent to <UNK> film in my lifetime and most likely beyond br br <UNK> ireland features many canadian <UNK> and <UNK> areas and 2 <UNK> which appear more than once in cut scenes br br the producers got a <UNK> on volume fake <UNK> good for them br br <UNK> to me horribly <UNK> freaks have access to brand <UNK> new hunting knives perhaps there's some kind of <UNK> <UNK> nearby with a blind and deaf clerk working the register br br also <UNK> to me if you <UNK> for roughly <UNK> years as the story leads us to believe happened you end up being somewhat <UNK> yet amazingly <UNK> and fairly strong <UNK> are a wonderful game of <UNK> br br there may or may not be more than one freak in this film reference is made to them and we see shadows yet only one odd looking dude is seen ever and when one odd looking dude is finally killed apparently all danger is passed i'm running with my initial <UNK> that no one thought to outfit a second man in full make up thus they just used the one that's what it looks like on screen anyway br br richard <UNK> should be ashamed br br also of note aside from those shiny new knives the <UNK> freaks have access to some posh leather gear as once richard <UNK> cuts his bonds there are fresh ones ready for the next sucker who gets tied up who also then escapes because the chains give you enough slack to just <UNK> them making one wonder why they even bother <UNK> anyone up br br a dead body in a shack will be <UNK> ridden after what i would guess is about 2 hours has passed said dead body will also have glasses on when no characters wore them curious br br jenna jameson appears for no reason from stage left <UNK> for 2 minutes <UNK> stage left in the middle of a giant forest that's not unusual as gary can also pop out of nowhere which is also known as whatever exists in tv land off the screen br br ms jameson dies sadly and somehow her clothes <UNK> like my hopes that this movie wouldn't suck wind br br i offer a special nod to the <UNK> character the poor girl who has been used by the freaks for months or maybe years for <UNK> purposes the poor girl who still has eye shadow on and <UNK> on camera with all the passion and conviction of a stuffed <UNK> br br the ending of this movie was clearly tacked on by a drunk or someone with a fierce mental <UNK> that has been <UNK> and encouraged with excessive <UNK> drinking over the years br br apparently this wasn't just random crap i found on the movie network late at night apparently people have heard of and even followed this movie through it's production how sad for you all i have nothing more to say may god have mercy on us all
<START> what i think i'll probably like best about the new star wars film phantom menace is that it will likely blow titanic out of the water if you'll <UNK> the pun when it comes to sheer devastating box office <UNK> and thereby knock it out of the number one spot every time i hear someone <UNK> titanic is the greatest film they've ever seen i think to myself you don't see a lot of movies do you what a travesty you could make 50 good films that are a lot better than titanic and for the same price tag br br well it won lots of academy awards lots of people really loved it as someone might say in its <UNK> well lots of people like the spice girls and <UNK> and <UNK> of people eat at <UNK> but that doesn't mean it's high quality yes millions of elvis fans can be wrong br br i'll be the first to admit that part of the problem for me was the mega hype over the film i waited a month or so to see it and ultimately it didn't live up to the expectations set upon it which simply called more attention to the <UNK> stupid love story it's true phantom menace will likely suffer a similar fate but br br james <UNK> titanic is a a cheesy action flick <UNK> disguised as a serious period piece b a three hour epic that has it's finest moments given away in the trailer c a sappy love story beyond belief or entertainment d something left better to <UNK> which i would've enjoyed much more e a film with arrogance that lives up to the level demonstrated with the real ship f a robbery of 3 hours that i will never get back therefore the greatest motivation for a time machine i can think of when i meet someone who hasn't seen it yet i say i wish i could trade places with you g a slap in the face to any genuine victim of <UNK> how long are we supposed to believe that people can be immersed in <UNK> cold water and still form <UNK> sentences h thankfully a film that wasn't recognized for any acting achievements at the oscars i a technological achievement in filmmaking and little else br br the only reason i post this as a anonymous comment is i do not welcome the <UNK> of 10 000 thirteen year old <UNK> <UNK> fans <UNK> no doubt come to his defense and i am not really interested in hearing a defense of <UNK> story acting or length
<START> perhaps the best <UNK> <UNK> book house of the spirits describes an alternative <UNK> history this one full of magic a <UNK> <UNK> plus some kind of <UNK> sadness this movie <UNK> a great cast plus a great art direction with a script that cannot contain all this <UNK> quality it's unusual for a nearly unknown country like <UNK> to get so well represented as it is by this movie whose perhaps only sin is to aim too high and because of that left the illiterate public a little upset mostly because they understood very little
<START> i love this movie like no other another time i will try to explain its virtues to the <UNK> but for the moment let me quote a few of pieces the remarkable dialogue which please remember is all tongue in cheek <UNK> and <UNK> will understand everyone else well br br title song <UNK> he can sink a beer he can pick a <UNK> in his latest double <UNK> <UNK> gear br br another song <UNK> all <UNK> are <UNK> <UNK> or worse and england is the a e hole of the universe br br during a television interview on an arty program mr <UNK> what artists have impressed you most since you've been in england <UNK> response <UNK> bull artists br br while <UNK> up a naive young <UNK> girl mr <UNK> i suppose you have <UNK> of <UNK> servants back in australia <UNK> response <UNK> i've never seen an <UNK> in me life mum does most of the solid <UNK> ie hard work round our place br br this is just a taste of the hilarious farce of this <UNK> aussie flick if you can get a copy of it watch and enjoy
<START> titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill <UNK> voyage on the <UNK> ship writer director james cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on april 15 <UNK> claiming thousands of lives who <UNK> in the icy <UNK> waters of the north atlantic the two leads in the film are great in their roles including <UNK> <UNK> and kate <UNK> they make for a good on screen couple <UNK> and <UNK> also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually <UNK> between them that much more believable they both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well the rest of the supporting cast including billy zane kathy bates frances fisher jonathan hyde and bill paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film the love story the action suspense and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time the horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation the pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it's few flaws titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it the fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the titanic sunk into the atlantic after hitting an iceberg overall titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill <UNK> ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially <UNK> and <UNK> who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch
<START> this is a very funny movie easy to watch that entertains you almost all the time the work of the director is recognizable and the type of humor is his trademark the movie is a typical police partners history like lethal weapon but the jokes and comedy are of <UNK> sort the twist is that one of them is a psychologist played by <UNK> and has to go with detective diaz played by <UNK> on his <UNK> while he also assist him diaz is troubled because his wife cheated on him some of the dialogs are hilarious worldwide understandable and laughable anywhere is very good overall it would deserved an 8 but i rated 7 because it gets a little down at the end on a personal remark i must add that is a bravo for <UNK> filmmakers considering the little good is coming lately
<START> this is a great film classic from the 40's and well produced there are very dramatic scenes in this film with john garfield al <UNK> force of evil <UNK> and <UNK> clark lee diamond last <UNK> <UNK> fighting the <UNK> during wwii being completely surrounded and with only one machine gun when al <UNK> was able to go home after being wounded with a horrible injury his problems just started to begin with his family and engaged girl friend <UNK> clark gave an outstanding supporting role as lee diamond who did everything to help his buddy al get his life together again there is never a complete victory to war and lets not forget all the brave wounded military <UNK> in veterans <UNK> from all the wars and our present iraq vets
<START> as you may have gathered from the title i <UNK> believe this movie to be the worst zombie movie of all time the acting camera work writing special effects and anything else remotely related to this movie sucked people have <UNK> that while this movie is terribly acted and terribly produced but it comes through with a witty intelligent script wow the plot has more holes than i or anyone else could possibly count for starters why would the government tell everyone to go back to work when it's not safe i know the <UNK> supposed to be evil but they don't gain anything by killing the entire population of the country there wouldn't be anyone to <UNK> another thing that i was wondering about even if the government told everyone to go to work why would people go if the streets were <UNK> with zombies were the zombies going to hide in the <UNK> and <UNK> the unsuspecting people in order to aid the government in their plot to kill everyone on the planet and how about the ending that stupid torch guy sacrifices his life in order to get a few close up shots of the zombies he probably forgot that every camera made in the last 35 years has a zoom feature and another thing why does he say <UNK> before he dies the <UNK> was a rare event seen by a very few people the zombie menace will been seen by everyone in the country possibly the world he doesn't think anyone else will get a few <UNK> they also managed to ruin the only semi interesting scene in the film when the soldier is watching the exotic dancer why did the zombie hide behind a curtain for five minutes before attacking the girl especially when the zombie could have come through the door it's probably just something an <UNK> zombie movie fan such as myself wouldn't understand every day i pray that god with increase my brain capacity long enough for me to figure out all the subtle nuances in feeding the masses br br <UNK> i think it's interesting that this is the first movie that gave me the desire to physically hurt the people involved in the production hey <UNK> <UNK> i'm calling you out
<START> this will be best known for the <UNK> that was crashed when eddie <UNK> was doing promotion br br tale of racing and <UNK> is a poorly made by the numbers that appears to have a director who couldn't see the numbers largely a point and shoot affair with a group of actors in it for a paycheck this is not a good movie but its not bad enough to be watchable and end up as a some what nothing film isn't worth bothering with no matter how you look at it br br misogynistic despite the fact one of the leads is a woman this is a film that was clearly made just to get the producer and director close to pretty girls want evidence there are long lingering shots of women in next to nothing that serve no purpose other than perhaps to get a rise out of people too afraid to rent a porno or the sports illustrated <UNK> dvd br br avoid this movie at all costs
<START> after the success of part 4 another sequel was a natural move however they should have stopped it before it began alice having survived part 4 finds herself pregnant and it seems freddy is using her unborn child to get at his victims which of course are <UNK> friends strange nightmare movie very heavy on religious imagery and bad acting the special effects are good but the movie itself is not
<START> my daughter her friends and i have watched this movie literally dozens of times i bought it twice and some little girlfriends <UNK> with it subsequently i rented it so very many times it just never gets old blockbuster doesn't even have it in their <UNK> anymore and i have tried to buy find rent it for over 5 years without a doubt this was and is my most favourite movie of my daughter's childhood it has it all we laughed we cried we discussed real life and how hard some children have it in the world there was nothing pretend about this movie we related to every second and every line bill thanks a million for <UNK> our faith in human nature sincerely <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> craven <UNK> canada eh br br august <UNK> update br br who are we to judge if a rich woman falls in love with a poor man or a man who has love chooses to raise a child who is not his own it may not be my or your life it is not only believable it happens every day thank god keeps my faith in human nature alive celebrate
<START> although i was born in the year that this movie came out and had never heard of it until my junior year of high school 1996 when i saw it i became totally <UNK> laughing and crying and feeling along with the characters because me and my friends were them br br their hair clothes and speech were outdated but the emotions and the desperation of each situation were so familiar i remember thinking how real it was and how i wished that they would make movies like that still br br in fact i saw this movie the night after i had been at a crazy party not so unlike the one in <UNK> house which had been crashed by what we considered the loser <UNK> who hung out on the <UNK> of our crowd a world class <UNK> and responsible mother figure type i identified immediately with <UNK> i was also the one with a car although i had a little bit of <UNK> <UNK> floating around in there too my best friend was a <UNK> and her good friend from childhood was our annie br br watching the scene when <UNK> is in school or the one where her and her boyfriend break up and then she is telling <UNK> how much she loved him felt like conversations and situations i had personally had br br now at the age of 27 i recently saw the movie again and felt a <UNK> of emotions because it was like watching back a piece of my own youth though none of my friends died i think this is a must see for all girls 13 and up
<START> red eye is not the kind of movie that's going to win the <UNK> <UNK> but wes craven has never been that kind of director anyway and his <UNK> is a good indication of what a film goer can expect br br the fact that red eye is a tight little <UNK> package at <UNK> minutes is part of its charm and an indication of craven's craft in producing lightweight but generally enjoyable box office fare in fact it's the perfect kind of movie to show as <UNK> entertainment attention holding without putting any intellectual or emotional challenges on the viewer br br overall there is a cheesy feeling to the plot vague terrorist subplot motivation and the supporting characters and the main section has a tv movie feel however there are definite elements of <UNK> suspense and echoes of <UNK> phone booth which ultimately is a more sophisticated and pretentious play on the same idea of emotional crisis being played out <UNK> in public br br for a film that focuses mainly on two people sitting in <UNK> seats it lives or dies on the characters and script <UNK> icy but <UNK> jackson <UNK> and rachel <UNK> <UNK> lisa are the main reasons the film gets carried off not only making the dialogue <UNK> but also giving some sort of <UNK> <UNK> type dimension to their battle of <UNK> <UNK> against feminine <UNK> br br in the final portion of the film craven <UNK> himself a little scream style as man chases girl with knife the most surprising revelation here is what brian cox looks like after the <UNK> for <UNK> treatment his <UNK> appearance in films as diverse as super troopers the ring and this making him the <UNK> version of jude law br br short <UNK> fun
<START> what can i say an action and <UNK> tale which has just about everything basically a coming of age tale about a young boy who is thrust into a position of having to save the world and more he meets a dazzling array of heroes and villains and has quite a time telling them apart a definite must see
<START> i am a christian and i say this movie had terrible acting unreal situations and a completely <UNK> front for christianity you might as well watch remember the <UNK> and at least not mix christ in a football film like a formulaic <UNK> for losers let me make some really <UNK> comments of what bothered me in this film br br 1 the school was in georgia and was a white academy school i did not notice a single black student or player in the school i deal with the white christian <UNK> in the south and they were built for no other reason than to <UNK> <UNK> this is <UNK> when the movie is about christianity and christ changing lives how about changing the hearts of <UNK> note i loved the token black coach like it made up for the entirely white team and all the black <UNK> players br br 2 the <UNK> acclaim by everyone christian about this movie can i get a couple people to say that it was bad acting bad filming bad writing and in short poor compared to other movies if we were to compare this to another football movie would it have the same charisma and energy br br 3 the half baked christianity which was shown made even less sense to me than the unrealistic ending if christianity is about simply reading a little <UNK> and praying to begin a complete life change then don't wonder when no one will listen to what christians have to say we want to sell christ as a cure all he doesn't need sold and he doesn't need to be attached to such whimsical <UNK> no wonder everyone considers christianity to be anti intellectual with this unreal presentation br br i recognize this film may be inspirational to a few people to most it will not be it will not give a real picture of struggle and heartfelt tension most importantly to me it is not christian by any means or stretch it has values but it falls short as a <UNK> yourself up by the <UNK> message as shallow as positive thinking if you live alongside people who struggle and or those in third world living conditions this movie will be hollow as most <UNK> are today in their religion
<START> nowhere near the original it's quite accurate copy bringing nothing new to the story but the directing is very poor basinger is weak without good directing baldwin is simply just a second league compared to mcqueen i watched it just out of curiosity being a huge fan of <UNK> masterpiece and i got what i thought almost a b movie with second rate acting and directing i wasn't even disappointed i just don't know what they were trying to do this remake doesn't try to play with the original material it's not a tribute and indeed it lacks some really good actor of its era br br it reminds me of a bad <UNK> copy of wonderful photograph br br this is a complete waste of your time save yourself 2 hours or watch the original again
<START> i saw this for free thankfully and wish it was better than it was but it's really the same old stuff that movie studios seem to <UNK> on us in the last ten years br br ben stiller and jennifer <UNK> play a couple who are <UNK> and yet they are attracted to each other br br if that plot line doesn't take you by surprise and thrill you the movie won't either br br lots of sight gags and fart jokes halfway through the movie i began to realize that ben stiller really isn't that funny but he tries very hard and jennifer <UNK> really isn't that pretty but her hair looks great and hank <UNK> and phillip <UNK> hoffman must have got paid a great deal of money to be in this kind of average ho hum movie i've come to expect more from them br br what was interesting was that i saw this after i saw american <UNK> which is a truly funny and original movie and i compared the two in my head and found myself wishing that the movie executives would be forced to sit through those two movies back to back perhaps that would knock some sense into them and br br they'd start making better movies with <UNK> rather than this formulaic stuff that plays best on <UNK>
<START> ten out of ten stars is no exaggeration this documentary provides the viewers with unique footage about the 2003 coup in <UNK> this great film is now the minimum knowledge <UNK> if you want to express a competent opinion about <UNK> or hugo chavez br br the dramatic <UNK> atmosphere the unique footage will allow you to experience a true historic moment you'll feel like you're in the middle of the situation br br the film will help you gain unique insight in the happenings of 2003 and will help you hear a side you will rarely hear on tv it's something you shouldn't miss
<START> i remember that i was a child when i first saw this movie it was my first horror movie maybe that's the reason why i can still remember some parts of it i don't remember much about acting nude scenes or other things but i do remember a male has head blown up with a <UNK> a male <UNK> over a tree and a male run down by truck and shot in head todd <UNK> kenny johnson and kevin <UNK> i also remember the last scene when jennifer <UNK> <UNK> of the killer stomach to get the keys of the truck it's a movie that gives you the creep and it's worth a look but where do i find it how can i <UNK> it
<START> lifetime did it again can we say stupid i couldn't wait for it to end the plot was senseless the acting was terrible especially by the teenagers the story has been played a thousand times are we just desperate to give actors a job the previews were attractive and i was really looking for a good thriller once in awhile lifetime comes up with a good movie this isn't one of them unless one has nothing else to do i would avoid this one at all cost this was a waste of two hours of my life can i get them back i would have rather <UNK> my face against a brick wall for two hours then <UNK> it in <UNK> that would have been more entertaining
<START> few movies can be viewed almost 60 years later yet remain as engrossing as this one technological advances have not dated this classic love story special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 movie the acting is superb david niven kim hunter and especially roger <UNK> do an outstanding job the use of black and white color adds to the creative nature of the movie it hasn't been seen on television for 20 years so few people are even aware of its existence it is my favorite movie of all time waiting and hoping for the dvd release of this movie for so many years is in itself a matter of life and death
<START> this movie is so bad it hurts the car doing 30 <UNK> when it's supposed to go 100 the shift <UNK> that's stuck in park the nurse that drives for almost 2 hours with the cell phone on the shoulder can't any of the 2 morons take this damn phone there's nothing credible in this crap i would be ashamed to be seen in a movie like this
<START> it is quite simple friends is a comedy of very basic humour aimed at teenagers and young adults with <UNK> sense of humour br br it is also painfully obvious that towards the end they were desperately trying to make it last 10 seasons most likely so they could say they beat <UNK> 9 season run the trouble with this is seinfeld had 9 amazing seasons with great writing friends had and i'm being very generous here at most 5 or 6 ok seasons and then 4 abysmal seasons br br it became a soap opera with recycled humour and recycled character traits that weren't that good so start with then got worse at the <UNK> time you saw them i find it so hard to understand why people rate this so highly it is truly awful
<START> the show had great episodes this is not one of them it's not a terrible episode it's just hard to follow up the man that was death all through the house and dig that cat he's real gone br br this episode is about a couple that has just been married peggy <UNK> plummer and charles stephen <UNK> in the first five minutes you find out that charles only married peggy for her money the two go on their honeymoon and their car breaks down on a dirt road and they have to seek <UNK> in an old abandon mansion charles soon finds out a secret of <UNK> family br br in my opinion you should watch this episode but just don't expect the same feeling as the rest of the episodes in the first season
<START> well i was a teenager when i saw the movie the songs were a huge hit but the elite class <UNK> govinda movies back then <UNK> watching govinda and <UNK> aka <UNK> movies were not the in thing for that <UNK> but anyways a lot of people liked it as the series of these movies <UNK> the 90's through out and most of them were successful today i was watching it again after a long time and i remembered there was a long <UNK> of people and the riot they created when the a <UNK> e <UNK> <UNK> o song came on screen the dresses of govinda and <UNK> were <UNK> to each other the worst dressing duo of that time well <UNK> in the late 90's transformed but govinda has still been very faithful to his designer as his dress sense remains the same but back then it all <UNK> it was all good everything worked and slowly the elite class realized what fun it was missing and then there was no looking back for this <UNK> as it went on n on making those indian carry on series hated by a few but loved by the masses br br if you are looking for a good time with nothing to do rent it or watch it on tv i don't think you will regret it but remember its the worst at its best br br still i watch those movies when i get time <UNK> i cant stop laughing so i say go ahead and have a good time as there are times when we all love stupidity and specially when its done by the kings of their times it surely is watchable i recommend it to all movie lovers
<START> when i first read hamlet i couldn't help but think of the ending of outrageous fortune where bette midler puts down the play because of how <UNK> he is and says give me romeo any day five acts of a man trying to decide whether or not to kill his uncle or not seemed like <UNK> to me but upon further reading i grew to really appreciate the play i've seen the olivier and gibson movie versions and part of the <UNK> <UNK> version and all of them take their model from olivier the melancholy <UNK> olivier at least did it without being self indulgent about it but gibson and from what i saw <UNK> looked like they went to the look ma i'm acting i'm acting school br br now here comes kenneth branagh's version which is breathtaking from start to finish it finished 2 on my top ten of 1996 behind the english patient and ahead of lone star jerry maguire <UNK> secrets lies everyone says i love you <UNK> with disaster big night and looking for richard and it's the best hamlet and maybe the best shakespeare put to film obviously branagh's talents as a filmmaker for making the full length version in <UNK> print and not losing our interest for four hours is great but what seems to get overlooked in discussions about this film is his performance in the title role this was my favorite performance of the year by far branagh avoids the melodrama which actors seem to get trapped in by playing hamlet as a normal regular human being and makes us understand his actions and feelings each step of the way and unlike olivier who <UNK> mostly on his voice branagh uses his entire body to demonstrate the range of emotions that hamlet goes through but since he plays him as normal none of it seems like scenery chewing br br the rest of the cast is top notch as well i didn't even mind jack lemmon though i agree he was the weakest member of the cast the most surprising turn came from charlton heston i've always found him stiff as a board but he's quite commanding as the player king the other big surprise was billy crystal i thought i'd find him all wrong as the 1st <UNK> but he was his usual funny self while being in character all in all a glorious film
<START> <UNK> <UNK> wrote and directed this look at modern day las vegas and the gap between generations his first directorial effort since the 1940s david <UNK> is somewhat miscast as a big shot casino owner who <UNK> with his son robert <UNK> who looks <UNK> like an older jason <UNK> <UNK> approaches every scene the same way <UNK> with a chip on his shoulder playing this role cool and laid back is asking too much from <UNK> who <UNK> at everyone like a <UNK> put upon husband he even <UNK> out don <UNK> and makes him cry his son a <UNK> do well in search of his own identity makes hip comments about how young people look down on vegas give them another ten years and his <UNK> of <UNK> lifestyle causes <UNK> brenda <UNK> is cute as a self conscious secretary and <UNK> <UNK> has a fun bit as a <UNK> at an audition unfortunately where it's at doesn't have much else going for it other than the now dated <UNK> on <UNK> between adults and their kids some quick t a shots and <UNK> jaded satirical bits on the high stakes world of gambling most of which has been covered by now ad <UNK> from
<START> presenting lily mars is a real pleasant little film which showcases the comedy skills of actress judy garland along with her standard singing moments the plot consists of lily mars <UNK> along after producer john <UNK> for her big break i think the comedy is light and nothing too heavy here i really recommend this film for everyone judy is breathtaking in this role
<START> i was taken to this film by a friend and was <UNK> about a swedish film with subtitles however i thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this beautiful film the unnecessary cruelty that man is capable of was portrayed <UNK> without overwhelming images although animal lovers may have to shield their eyes for a brief couple of seconds somewhere during the first 10 minutes a traditional story of <UNK> versus brutality and hope versus tragedy was illustrated from a <UNK> fresh angle using a spectrum of characters with very natural flaws and features i particularly liked how the film managed to address multiple aspects of <UNK> human behaviour that concern bias <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> an absolute gem of a film that i will promote to all who will listen
<START> quite unimpressive the <UNK> are all pretty predictable if you've seen any movies within the last ten years and the few somewhat interesting parts <UNK> someone <UNK> context clues to make a decision are few and lack much punch since the <UNK> has already been shown before these clues are explained br br spoilers sorta br br the acting is decent enough the story simply isn't very interesting the whole <UNK> <UNK> premise becomes <UNK> by the <UNK> projection stuff not kidding br br the surgery scene is initially tense a bit <UNK> but then becomes utterly banal br br not horrible but not memorable <UNK> <UNK> least interesting role to date so far as i've seen br br kind of boring overall
<START> it makes sense to me that this film is getting <UNK> from hollywood because <UNK> in hollywood it's all just a popularity contest it also makes sense when you think that people who are liking the film may just be <UNK> to the countless songs being spit out at you rather than story content yet this film is overrated and overblown eddie murphy looks just ridiculous no way do <UNK> hudson and <UNK> <UNK> give the oscar rated performance so many have <UNK> over before the film was even out i can't even believe that <UNK> is being set up to be nominated for a directing oscar when all he did was put together an album <UNK> does not replace a nothing storyline a bunch of songs does not a movie make
<START> the wonderful z channel in los angeles showed this pia <UNK> film about six months or so after <UNK> i had such high hopes for the actress and then she goes from bad to obviously worse in this film br br again it was the 80's and i gotta tell you harold <UNK> work had been <UNK> by smarter writers <UNK> <UNK> ripped into him she hated his way of writing women irwin <UNK> work caught on with many women and of course sidney <UNK> had his kingdom in the late 70's early 80's and then came jackie collins who made women stronger and as equal to men in every way in her books even more so which is why this work <UNK> harold <UNK> work in the 80's just didn't catch on with audiences pia <UNK> acting in one of <UNK> work was like throwing <UNK> on a fire the supporting cast was not a help either br br <UNK> this was awful to look at then and even 20 more years later it looks even worse i had a hope for pia as an actress and it all got shot to heck when this was done it would be tough for pia to redeem herself as an actress although john waters casting her in <UNK> was a spark although she has a nice singing voice br br hey pia wherever you are <UNK> may go on tour join the show you may be the biggest comeback story yet br br i just hope they burn this film for ya if you do
<START> freddy krueger the dream stalker from elm street returns the great character actor robert englund is back in this sequel of nightmare 5 dream child i hope i got the number correctly there's been so many and this one is one of the best especially for the cameos by <UNK> <UNK> then arnold tom arnold johnny <UNK> who did the very first nightmare in <UNK> alice cooper singer you will see freddy as a tormented child a teenager who loves pain and as a family guy creepy the effects are very funny and creative the cast also includes lisa zane <UNK> sister <UNK> meyer road trip <UNK> <UNK> alien live and let die and amanda <UNK> father knows best i was one of the people <UNK> saw this in 3d well the ending i love 3d movies i missed the first 3d wave in 1953 i wasn't even born yet the second wave was in 1983 i like all the freddy movies this one stands out as one of the better ones not counting the first which was absolutely brilliant freddy became the new monster of the 80s and 90s along with jason <UNK> <UNK> micheal myers and leather face can you imagine a film with all of them i recommend this to all freddy fans and horror fans alike that freddy is such a cut up 8 out of 10
<START> from the first time i saw the box cover of the movie and the stretched out photography i thought this guy this friend of the <UNK> must be like 6 foot or <UNK> <UNK> br br not 5 feet tall not that it's his fault br br at any rating i turned on the movie one cool night in <UNK> out on the second story deck with a good <UNK> and let it roll at that time my wife was having an affair and things were going down hill for me so i needed a good <UNK> but as bad as the movie was i totally enjoyed it with a bottle of <UNK> too i might admit br br truly i have watched this movie many times it always makes me feel good it's not that it <UNK> too <UNK> to be cool or that <UNK> so <UNK> to hitting the mark for an action film it's frantic and then truly clueless then frantic again it's the best of the best when it comes to a slow speed chase scene wow i never felt <UNK> in my life warm and happy too i was thankful that they <UNK> on the <UNK> during the chase due to less production in the summer months <UNK> br br the direction was <UNK> the action and fight sequences needed to be choreographed or re choreographed and <UNK> up the sound was off the delivery didn't hit you it just kept on going the other way the <UNK> of that village that they were in the town rather were <UNK> <UNK> they also did not seem to follow what was happening very well the would look and even <UNK> into the camera lens like a deer in the head lights kind of thing only some of them with a smile a smiling deer br br i feel bad because <UNK> i just bet has a good heart and a caring spirit for people in america as well as for his own <UNK> br br however <UNK> island is very <UNK> and unbelievable even still i like it a lot my now x wife hates it but i love it br br the funny thing is i am pretty <UNK> when it comes to movies i like or even <UNK> all in all i like franco so there it is br br as a movie adding <UNK> to this if you like killing a few hours with truly fun to watch straight to video b movies or <UNK> movies for your little library collection then if you can find it check out 'the big <UNK> 1991 with robert <UNK> <UNK> you know the big guy from <UNK> <UNK> 'the big <UNK> a bomb of a cop story with no real plot discovery and acting that is so lame it might as well be <UNK> <UNK> and at the end of 'the big <UNK> i think they ran out of money because they had a picture of the cast and just set it on fire and let it burn during the credits good fun br br but all in all not as good as <UNK> <UNK> i gave it a <UNK> and an overall rating of <UNK> for awful good <UNK> movie i'm waiting for the sequel maybe like <UNK> revenge on <UNK> franco takes a mexican vacation and gets sick on the water then declares war on the water co or <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> where as he would stake out a large drug lord in his country and <UNK> gene <UNK> and create a hybrid super bug <UNK> that would be <UNK> and dropped into the cocaine fields and eat the coke and upon passing it through the bug it forms a chemical reaction that turns the coke to pure <UNK> sugar then another sequel he would have to get the young people rescued from excessive sugar addiction and so on he could get a major tooth <UNK> company to <UNK> and partially <UNK> the project with careful product placement in the feature right
<START> pathetic is the word bad acting pathetic script <UNK> dialog and hip hop music fashion what the hell was up with that the <UNK> of this movie acts as bad as the movie he made if someone would have taken some time and effort to <UNK> the whole thing it may of had a chance bet the studios are still trying figure out how they could screw up up so badly br br the absolute best thing about this movie was <UNK> dash the asian chick wasn't too bad neither these too <UNK> carried the whole movie if it weren't for them i would have destroyed my copy of this movie br br if any of those who have not seen this yet and had a notion to don't waste your time you'll only regret it later
<START> the central theme in this movie seems to be confusion as the relationships setting acting and social context all lead to the same place confusion even harvey keitel appears to be out of his element and lacks his usual impeccable clarity direction and intensity to make matters worse his character's name is <UNK> and we are only told directly by the narrator well into the film that he is not <UNK> che just a guy named che the family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film and once defined the family is divided the younger generation off to america so clich√© other reviews discuss how the movie depicts the impact of the revolution on a boy's family however the political stance of the director is murky at best and we are never quite sure who is responsible for what bloodshed so they lost their property acquired by gambling <UNK> so what <UNK> to take a political stand when making a movie about the cuban revolution is an odd and cowardly choice not to mention the movie was in english why are all these <UNK> speaking english no wonder they did not get <UNK> to film in cuba and if family life is most important to look at here it would be great if we could figure out who is who we are <UNK> to them all in the beginning a cheap way out of making the relationships clear throughout the film the acting was mostly shallow wooden and unbelievable timing was off all around the <UNK> visual effects were confusing and distracting references to american films and the black character as greek chorus strictly gratuitous intellectually <UNK> and consistently out of place i only watched the whole movie because i was waiting for clarity or some point to it all it never happened
<START> the fox and the child is the latest film from march of the <UNK> filmmaker frenchman luc <UNK> the movie which boasts just one human being in its cast young actress <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> tells the story of the rather rare though seemingly believable relationship between a child and a wild fox br br part nature documentary and part fairy tale the film focuses on <UNK> the child who on her way to school one day comes across the path of a wild fox in a <UNK> setting possibly france though the exact location is never mentioned over the coming weeks the child <UNK> the place where she found her fox hopeful that one of said days she will see said fox who she begins to call lily once again and so it goes on days turn to weeks and then the summer disappears turning to fall and then winter <UNK> some superb cinematography of the sweeping white winter landscape eventually spring comes around again and the young child finds her fox and indeed does strike up a friendship with the animal and so on br br i had little to no expectation for the fox and the child i had seen march of the <UNK> and was simply in awe at the film making contained in that movie luc <UNK> is a hugely talented and indeed rare film maker and i was expecting some superb breathtaking cinematography sweeping <UNK> and brilliant footage of the <UNK> this was delivered in <UNK> but here <UNK> has a screen writing credit and not knowing anything about the movie prior to the screening i expected something a little different than what had previously been seen in <UNK> a fictional story br br the child and the fox and the story is simple a young seemingly lonely child lives in a house in the middle of nowhere and walks to school seemingly on her own every day seemingly without a care in the a seemingly perfect world without the hint of an adult in sight brilliant so she strikes up a friendship with a fox br br with a film like this you have to dismiss your own opinion of the movie and put yourselves in the shoes of the target audience this is a film which is aimed directly at children from the age of i'd say six and up or to families who fancy a trip to the cinema with their breed one wet sunday afternoon not a <UNK> year old male who gets his kicks from films like the recent brilliant wanted and the like but me being the <UNK> london critic i put myself in the shoes of an excited eight year old girl for the 95 or so minutes of the fox and the child now i have a few problems with this film as a <UNK> year old <UNK> and loyal lover of all things cinematic i loved the <UNK> and landscape photography it's visually stunning the direction of the animal characters is brilliantly executed as good as you will find on any of <UNK> efforts as an <UNK> short attention <UNK> eight year old i loved about the first half hour then i lost interest it's a little repetitive and in places quite harrowing and bloody scary for a younger child particularly the rather dark ending as a <UNK> year old male i was a little frightened in places <UNK> br br so it's not a child's film it's not really an adult film and i felt a little let down is it a good family film depends it's educational maybe and the film carries a message it's definitely not a film i would pay the hard earned green to go see and i'm <UNK> my brains to try and recommend it to a certain type of film goer it's hard but i know some will go see and fall in love this film it's very european in feel and certainly if you are a fan of <UNK> themed flicks give it a try unsure well i'd wait for the dvd for a wet sunday afternoon in then paul heath http www <UNK> com july 2008
<START> the ancient <UNK> is a truly classic piece of work as the original poem was is the context setting with the old <UNK> himself is fine clear and without <UNK> the artistic work that <UNK> the reading of the poem fits perfectly the time period of the setting and of the work itself carrying the audience into the period with a still yet moving <UNK> using excellent still movement <UNK> only well <UNK> by the pre mtv era producers and much less apparent in more current works mtv brought to television and video a static movement that races through often irrelevant cuts from theme to theme without forward movement and without clear relationships to theme or storyline the voice <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> reading brings this touching poem to life with all its fear <UNK> and pain in addition the smooth movement of the video <UNK> the <UNK> and occasional <UNK> in this case a positive mood under the theme of the story itself of the author's rendition of the ancient <UNK> sad and spooky tale this is a must for any love of classic poetry the sea a tall tale that almost rings true and a story that has left a lasting impact on our world and culture who does not understand the meaning of an <UNK> or the concept of water water everywhere and not a drop to drink a truly fine experience thank you mr <UNK> for bringing this to life for us never to be forgotten
<START> i like films that don't provide the typical happy ending and that's my main reason for my liking of this movie alice <UNK> danes and her best friend <UNK> beckinsale are arrested in thailand for <UNK> <UNK> after a tip <UNK> <UNK> in to the <UNK> authorities the film does a solid job of keeping viewers guessing as to whether or which of the girls was involved and bill <UNK> is perfect as their sleazy lawyer <UNK> kim turns in a terrific performance as his more kind <UNK> wife <UNK> who is also an attorney i wish the girls had been abused more in the prison as another <UNK> has suggested as i've heard that <UNK> <UNK> can be quite brutal where this film grabs me however is its ending alice subjects herself to a sentence of <UNK> years in total so that <UNK> can be <UNK> and we the viewers realize that they are both innocent any film that defies my expectation of the ending wins extra points with me and this well acted drama is certainly deserving
<START> i couldn't help but think of behind the mask the rise of leslie <UNK> a <UNK> more amazing film when watching this because of the realistic feel to it as well as the great innovative idea this could have been a great film the acting is from some of the actors alright from others it's downright horrible br br that aside the idea is great and the format is great the story is pretty good as well though suffering often from big blows to the logical mind br br <UNK> that though right it is a horror movie after all br br i really want to see this remade i really want it to be the fantastic film that it wants to be br br however and you can't really fault the minds behind the movie for this this is obviously built upon a shoe string budget and the fx really hurt the film overall br br great movie if you were to <UNK> out for some better acting and slightly better fx br br whoever wrote it should keep going though great idea here
<START> no need to <UNK> the plot since others have done so already br br it's understandable that many viewers find fault with the film raised as we are with the slam bang <UNK> of today's <UNK> experience against that background a movie like ecstasy appears to have <UNK> in from another planet i think there are several worthwhile reasons why br br most importantly the film unfolds <UNK> as the camera pans slowly over surrounding hills trees clouds etc providing a <UNK> and lyrical sense of a natural world that <UNK> the man and woman into its <UNK> together these reveal a style and dimension almost totally missing from today's technology driven cinema where rapid fire editing works to <UNK> audience attention and not to concentrate it additionally the story is conveyed by eye and not by ear with almost no dialogue to explain what's happening this amounts to another extreme departure from today's very literal fare where visuals only seem to count when they <UNK> the audience but perhaps most unsettling the movie is sometimes <UNK> quiet not in the sense that silent films are quiet since we expect them to be but in the sense that the characters seldom speak when we expect them to thus the burden of the story is shared between the film maker and the viewer the former must choose his visuals <UNK> so as to convey the narrative while the latter must think about those visuals since they're not going to be explained br br none of this is intended to <UNK> today's film making it's simply to point out that a movie like <UNK> comes out of a very different aesthetic from the one we have today i don't claim either to be any better or worse however i do claim that ecstasy represents a perspective sorely missing from today's movie going experience where such <UNK> values are <UNK> <UNK> as slow and boring br br the film itself is no masterpiece though at times it reaches artistic heights as in the beautifully composed beer garden scene with its final <UNK> shot rising to reveal the exquisite <UNK> below the slow pans of the countryside with its <UNK> celebration of life nature and <UNK> are also wonderfully expressed these are the kind of scenes that don't <UNK> you but instead given half a chance <UNK> quietly into an experience as memorable in its own way as the spine <UNK> variety of a jaws br br on the other hand the film is sometimes heavy handed as when <UNK> <UNK> on the imagery particularly in the final <UNK> to labor sequence it's hard to know what to make of this rather <UNK> presence perhaps the symbolism has to do with the heroic dimension that hard work holds for the love <UNK> hero and people in general a theme then being promoted by the influential soviet cinema still its presence here is rather <UNK> over done br br anyhow i've got to admit that i tuned in initially to see the gorgeous hedy <UNK> in the buff but now i have to admit that in the process i also got a lot more than just a <UNK> a boo romp in the woods
<START> a bit slow somehow like a <UNK> coppola movie but still a very captivating film about the discovery of sexuality by three teenage girls the magic of the movie lies in its capacity to bring back many memories to how it felt like to be their age the confusion and the <UNK> are portrayed in a very simple way but so true to life the music is perfect and the acting is amazing the camera works beautifully also i highly recommend it for those who are not afraid to look back at this particular period of life when we discover our sexual <UNK> and our desires i would also say that it is a fine film for young people going through that period so many movies have been made about <UNK> but this really captures the true essence of discovering the adult world of romance and its <UNK>
<START> an american in paris is a wonderful musical about an american painter living in paris for inspiration he meets a rich woman who <UNK> his paintings on the street and she believes she can get his work to be even more popular to the public e g in a museum golden globe nominated gene kelly as the artist jerry <UNK> is just perfect at both singing and especially dancing he also meets the main girl <UNK> <UNK> leslie caron who is engaged to his best friend he can't help his feelings for this girl even after he finds out who she is engaged to filled with nice romance and wonderful song and dance this is a very good musical film it may drag slightly with his dancing dream sequence i e the american in paris ballet but there is a good happy ending it won the oscars for best art direction set decoration best cinematography best costume design best music <UNK> of a musical picture best writing story and screenplay and best picture and it was nominated for best director for <UNK> minnelli and best film editing it was nominated the <UNK> for best film from any source and it won the golden globe for best motion picture musical comedy and it was nominated for best director for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> father gene kelly was number <UNK> on the 100 movie stars and he was number 15 on 100 years 100 stars men i got rhythm was number <UNK> on 100 years 100 songs the film was number 9 on 100 years of musicals it was number <UNK> on 100 years 100 passions it was number <UNK> on 100 years 100 movies and it was number <UNK> on the 100 greatest musicals very good
<START> found this flick in a <UNK> it cost 2 to buy the whole movie stinks really bad the so called colonel who would the hero here if the cover could have been trusted must be in his eighties and is barely able to walk he nevertheless manages to shoot some of the dumbest ninjas in the world then the story leaves the colonel which makes sense given the old man's inability to do anything worth mentioning a now two <UNK> eighties looking guys take over in what must have been some sort of story i got lost a hundred times but didn't mind because the movie is so bad it's real fun to watch zero budget trash with actors not deserving that name go check it out
<START> slashers well if you like horrors its definitely one to see otherwise don't even bother it is completely obvious that this film has an extremely low budget for instance it looks as if the entire film has been shot in a warehouse somewhere and on numerous occasions you will see the mike boom shadow and the camera mans shadow trust me you wont need to look for them also try to ignore the cheesy actors if thats what you call them the basic outline is a few people decide to go on a game show where they have to survive a night in a big <UNK> due to their being 3 killers on the loose and whoever <UNK> at the end gets rich now there is something about this film that keeps you watching and rarely do you find that with a cheap budget horror these days for example when i watched it i thought to my self i <UNK> mind having a go at this game especially for 12 000 000 so anyway i would recommend you watch it and make up your own mind
<START> first off anyone who thinks this sequel to william <UNK> the french connection is superior is most definitely completely insane or moronic or both the problem with reviewing this film is that a it's a sequel to a brilliant movie which always makes watching it <UNK> difficult and b it's directed by john <UNK> one of the best american directors ever so i wanted to like it william <UNK> was the perfect person to direct a film about drug traffic in <UNK> new york city because of his documentary like approach to the action and story <UNK> on the other hand is one of the most stylish directors ever i e the <UNK> candidate and seconds and with his french connection 2 it feels like someone trying to be gritty and not having the true understanding to pull it off that fact that <UNK> was chosen to direct the sequel by gene hackman himself really tells a lot about <UNK> understanding about the original film too it's well known hackman hated <UNK> on the set and <UNK> to never work with him again it's also known he <UNK> the character to be more one dimensional <UNK> weight and trying to play him like a straight character it shows you hackman despite being a great actor had no idea who to make the movie and the story great the plot point of doyle becoming an addict is interesting but doesn't warrant the rest of the film an unfortunate low point in <UNK> filmography
<START> has al pacino ever been in a bad movie his name seems to be an <UNK> for top notch cinema this is as good a performance as he's ever given pacino is an american olivier and this is a political thriller as good as they get there are no good guys and no bad guys but the system has its <UNK> effect on the people who think they're running it not only is <UNK> performance compelling the <UNK> at the dead child's funeral is <UNK> powerful the film has a fast paced gritty realism to it that enhances the fine performances without <UNK> to gimmicks this outstanding portrait of big city politics also manages to provide two hours of superb movie watching without <UNK> violence <UNK> sex or <UNK> language there is murder there are bad people but they come across effectively without crossing the line a film like this <UNK> my jaded faith in hollywood i don't award many <UNK> this one richly deserves it
<START> citizen x tells the real life drama of the search for a serial killer dubbed the <UNK> <UNK> this great film shows the long journey it took to try to <UNK> a killer the film shows how politics may <UNK> helped the killer to continue his rampage for over 12 years possibly over 50 victims mostly women and children the performances of stephen rea as the lead detective and donald sutherland as the overall investigation lead was superb jeffrey <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this is the type of film which will <UNK> you and immediately have you on the internet <UNK> the real case this a film not to be missed it <UNK> i believe on hbo and never did get a theatrical release to my understanding great film
<START> considering all the teen films like the breakfast club and pretty in pink that are <UNK> it is surprising that this one is so ignored br br there is no sex in it but sex is thought of including the idea that it may matter what others think about it the kids do not always get along with their parents but neither the parents or the kids are seen as always right or wrong and the parents are not seen as monsters br br it deals with hero worship how one girl does a dangerous thing which could have lead to real <UNK> before realizing that she was wrong br br the movie is kind of ahead of its' time one kid asks another kid what birth control she uses she says she is doing nothing to need birth control she replies wrongly <UNK> sex
<START> a young <UNK> from london arthur <UNK> is sent to a small <UNK> town of <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> the estate of a recently passed away widow mrs <UNK> while attending her funeral a mysterious lady dressed in black catches his attention supposedly <UNK> lived a <UNK> life and locals kept pretty quiet about her after this he heads to mrs <UNK> mansion that can only be reached on a <UNK> through the swamp during low tide there he encounters the woman in black again in cemetery out back of the house and things begin to get creepy as terrifying noises start coming from the <UNK> now can mrs <UNK> <UNK> and listening to her recorded <UNK> entries help <UNK> figure out this gloomy mystery that the locals fear to talk about br br often highly regarded amongst horror fans as being one of the most chilling ghost stories ever and i can see their point but only in doses does it draw upon tag yes from what you can gather i was left a <UNK> under <UNK> despite really liking it i was expecting <UNK> <UNK> throughout the whole feature but that's probably <UNK> expecting mainly i had a similar reaction with the 1980 haunted house thriller 'the <UNK> when you hear so many good things it's sometimes hard not get caught up with it br br anyhow what the british tv presentation of the woman in black effectively does is bring out a truly old fashion slow burn spine <UNK> premise driven by its moody locations <UNK> atmosphere and first rate performances subtly <UNK> the psychologically gripping story adapted off susan <UNK> novel of the same name as the simple mystery <UNK> opens up with a <UNK> tragic tone and successfully <UNK> its protagonist little seems to happen and can feel drawn out but the fragile <UNK> of it catch you off guard whenever the camera focuses on the lady in black who mostly appears as a background figure it's ultimately creepy she might not appear all that much but when she <UNK> talk about unnerving that also goes for that downbeat conclusion pauline <UNK> who plays the woman in black competently gets us nervous by just her <UNK> appearance and sudden <UNK> a pale look and those minor mannerisms just seem to haunt you she's a spirit you don't want to cross paths with yet alone let her see you an accomplished performance by a <UNK> moody adrian <UNK> as the <UNK> arthur <UNK> does hold it all together in support are solid turns by bernard <UNK> david <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and david <UNK> br br drawing heavy on its <UNK> <UNK> rural town and <UNK> <UNK> locations adds more to the realistically eerie plight and the centre piece were everything unfolds in the <UNK> time worn victorian house that <UNK> <UNK> the air with constant fear director herbert wise carefully <UNK> <UNK> imagery that slowly covers one <UNK> piece at a time in a smoothly <UNK> out rhythm of well judged <UNK> instead of going out to shock us some scenes contain a <UNK> intensity that won't let go the sound effects are masterfully used by surrounding and <UNK> the air rachel <UNK> harrowing musical score knows how to get under your skin during those eerie moments and then stay with you br br this <UNK> made for television feat is a stimulating rich and unsettling supernatural <UNK> fest it might not share much new to the sub genre but it competently sticks to it strengths to deliver what counts in this curse
<START> it was 1 a m in the morning and i had nothing else to do don't judge me please br br we're back in time during the spanish <UNK> a group have made their way onto an island it doesn't take too long before they encounter a large <UNK> which <UNK> up their horse soon they're captured by the natives and in order to gain freedom they must kill the <UNK> gods the cg sucks it reminds me of the cg of early <UNK> video games the encounters were lame the only positive thing i have to say about this was the <UNK> native running around in a skimpy outfit otherwise it's just a <UNK> effort
<START> fay the sister of the notorious <UNK> prize winning <UNK> poet simon grim still loves henry fool their son receives an ingenious orgy in a box from an <UNK> <UNK> and a chase across three <UNK> ensues involving a <UNK> sad sack collection of government agents terrorists flight <UNK> and <UNK> br br parker posey delivers a perfectly timed comic performance including some brilliant physical work with strong <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> fay grim proves in the best billy wilder tradition that nothing is funnier than a beautiful woman in trouble br br another good score by hartley and thanks in the credits to the american academy in berlin where hartley served as a fellow in fall 2004
<START> <UNK> seems to have been under the influence of <UNK> the american friend innocent nick cage gets <UNK> for a hit dennis hopper plays a real hit man lara flynn boyle is dangerous the hero gets more <UNK> the more he tries to <UNK> <UNK> and small town america does not seem all that <UNK> than the big city like it's predecessor mentioned above this movie has lots of plot twists and turns that seem improbable but all lead to the <UNK> self discovery
<START> i saw this movie two weeks ago at the festival des <UNK> images du <UNK> in paris though i wasn't expecting much from it i have to say i've been disappointed just like many people in the audience if i wanted to sum up how i felt i'd say i've been comparing it to princess <UNK> and <UNK> from the beginning to the end of course it's silly but i couldn't help it the stories are quite different but the worlds <UNK> are very much alike and from this point of view a tree of <UNK> definitely can't stand the comparison with miyazaki's <UNK> even if it's quite good technically boredom remains in the end its complete lack of originality makes me advise you not to care to watch it i rated it 2 out of 10 a bit harsh i guess it deserves 3 or 4
<START> i can't figure out who <UNK> this thing it has no redeeming qualities none <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br the acting was bad the directing was bad the writing was bad the plot was bad the music was bad the editing was bad well at least the filmmakers were consistent
<START> the most satisfying element about dan in real life is that the relationship between dan steve carell and marie juliette <UNK> makes sense and is beautifully realistic the casting of oscar winner juliette <UNK> as <UNK> love interest was a superb decision she is exceptionally talented intelligent naturally attractive and thank goodness appropriately aged for the part had this movie been made with jessica alba or scarlett johansson it would have been a disaster br br another wonderful aspect about dan in real life is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three <UNK> of the frat pack formula dumb chicks <UNK> guys and sleazy jokes dan in real life is witty and has fun intelligent laughs throughout whereas other comedies <UNK> or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing the jokes from dan in real life are more natural and clever and involve some thinking on the part of the audience br br my only problem with dan in real life is that the rebellious middle daughter is played too outrageously by actress <UNK> robertson it's difficult to say if this was a personal choice on her part or a choice by the director either way her character is unrealistic and annoying but this is only a minor flaw in the film and does not take away from the story as a whole br br all in all dan in real life is a great film a fantastic escape from the <UNK> of offensive and <UNK> down comedies the quality of the writing directing acting and especially cinematography is excellent it is simply a beautiful light hearted comedy
<START> everyone my name may sound weird but there was nothing else br br any way i haven't seen anything like this before so it was crazy of course that's a good thing it is a <UNK> interesting movie and my absolute all time favourite thing is how they <UNK> other things into one like chicken little the fish pretending to be king kong and <UNK> the pig saying <UNK> beauty who killed the beast war of the worlds scene and more walt disney company has not lost his touch maybe not for this one also how they made it like they were watching a movie and it was like a home cinema br br however some parts don't fit like in the original lion king weren't timon and pumbaa with <UNK> when he beat <UNK> in this movie they are not they were fighting the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> more the reason being why pumbaa isn't so confident is because he was pushed away by the other animals and also it's just timon timon timon anybody realise that only <UNK> story was told whereas pumbaa only had flashbacks br br but apart from that it s great
<START> with no fault to the actors they all put on great performances the overall story was not very well executed the movie opens with a great <UNK> a crazy old guy forces a young <UNK> girl's car off the road but then we're forced to endure 40 minutes of character development with an entirely new group of characters and we don't know why until the 40 minutes are up it turns out that they are the ones who eventually discover the girl's body and the story progresses from there br br while the story does pick up at that point it really goes nowhere after 2 hours i asked myself was there a point to this or was it just to see the characters struggle with <UNK> of racism and stupidity of how they handled the discovery the story was ultimately unsatisfying and felt unfinished while it is well acted there's not a strong enough <UNK> in the film to warrant <UNK> it
<START> this isn't cinema it isn't talent it isn't informative it isn't scary it isn't entertaining it isn't anything at all br br i got this because my cousin says <UNK> cool yeah right the only thing cool about this experience was the lone fact that i didn't buy it but rented it instead br br it's shot like a bad soap opera no wait soap operas at least look professional sorta this this looks like it was shot with someone's camcorder it's horrid wretched it <UNK> br br the cinematography is <UNK> who is this director anyway i don't even care enough to look him up he stinks the performances by these poor unsuspecting actors were far better than this crap fest deserved br br 2 6 10 on the b scale br br that <UNK> about a 0 3 10 on the a scale from br br the fiend
<START> i feel it is my duty as a lover of horror films to warm other people about this horrible and very very bad horror film don't waste your time or money on this film the acting is bad the story is just one of the worst i have come across and the script was just awful nothing about it was good you end up thinking to yourself why am i watching this crap the plot had so many holes in it and they never got <UNK> up in the end it was just so bad i don't know how a film so terrible could be made as i said before i love horror films and i was so let down it was an 18 but you see little blood and no scares or jumps at all also what annoyed me was how stupid things happened in the film that had no point to the plot at all like the brother and sister kissing why is all i can say just don't bother there are far more great horror films out there just don't waste your time life is too short
<START> working at a video store i get to see quite a few movies and on occasion i try to watch some of the not so big movies proud happened to be one of them the initial idea of telling of the story of a primarily black <UNK> ship during wwii had some merit however in less than 10 minutes of watching the movie you find out that the primary point of the movie was to tell about racial tension in wwii the underlying story is about the ship the crew and their exploits in the war this primary point is <UNK> at you to the point of <UNK> all throughout the movie i <UNK> the men that served on the <UNK> mason for their triumph in the face of <UNK> and for the <UNK> that they endured a movie should have been made focusing on the <UNK> these men did for themselves the navy and for their country and not making a movie whose focus is racism during wwii
<START> this would have been so much fun to see in a theater back in 1996 there is a guilty pleasure corner of my movie taste which really <UNK> really well done shocker movies br br the dentist is <UNK> sometimes probably because people usually have strong feelings over dental matters maybe the <UNK> launched a campaign against it since <UNK> report they have to apologize for this movie and for the marathon man which only has one scene comparable to the many in the dentist br br it's amazing to note that according to the trivia page the movie was shot in 21 days of course post production can take longer than movie shooting sometimes and the editing for the dentist is picture perfect the quick cuts <UNK> the tension so much that in the scene where the dentist takes care of his wife there's only two quick cuts showing what is happening the rest is left to our very <UNK> <UNK> corbin bernsen was a good choice for the role since he has lots of experience playing psychologically off characters and he completely sold the obsessive <UNK> aspects of the dentist br br for me the pacing of the movie was just right the film makers reveal the wife's <UNK> in just the right way all of the characters in the dental office look like they are actual people working in a real office there's lots of tension while they are dealing with <UNK> people awaiting the <UNK> arrival meanwhile the dentist is off on the <UNK> of a huge psychotic breakdown unlike so many movies of this genre the script is very very tight all the victims fall into the <UNK> trap in very <UNK> ways two law <UNK> types even get involved in a little subplot that ends up creating a shocker of a showdown near the end br br definitely not for the faint of heart or the dental <UNK> but a real roller coaster ride and heavily recommended for fans of intelligent <UNK>
<START> i'm surprised that anyone involved with the production of this series would actually admit responsibility the script is so unfunny it must have been written by someone who failed the entrance <UNK> for the canadian comedy <UNK> union and that's saying something get out your <UNK> if you want but there's nothing resembling a joke in sight <UNK> corbett must have been flat broke to <UNK> himself with this rubbish the rest of the cast are so lacking in any kind of acting or comedic ability i'm amazed it lasted past the first episode <UNK> past the <UNK> all i can say to those who are amused by it is that they must be very easily entertained and it's obvious that the production costs must have been all of <UNK> per episode and just in case anyone thinks i'm commenting as a <UNK> who is unfamiliar with english humour i must add that i am indeed english
<START> unreal movie what were these people on a mix of french upstairs <UNK> <UNK> horses porn not suggested its pretty full on for a film <UNK> with a bit of benny hill music chase scenes thrown in its sounds crazy its even more so to watch spoiler it <UNK> along in a tedious fashion for quite a while then a <UNK> does a runner <UNK> woman in period dress to run off after it she goes into the woods where she is set upon by an <UNK> penis attached to a man in a bear rat <UNK> suit i put it like that as its obvious the penis is in charge gets way too much screen time <UNK> for the most of it anyway in a nutshell it turns out she liked a bit of bear rat <UNK> thats about it the rest is just padding end spoiler a film made to shock offend thus getting talked about any publicity is good publicity i suppose a waste of time really but the main event has to be seen to be believed its hard to imagine that anyone thought it was a good idea as they filmed it
<START> i tend to like character driven films i also think hope davis turns in consistently good work so i had high hopes for this movie those hopes were soon <UNK> br br the main flaw with this movie is the direction there are a lot of scenes that are <UNK> sequences the movie makes frequent use of the denis <UNK> character as the alter ego of the campbell scott character it doesn't work for me at all this would have worked better as a play than a movie br br there are problems with the plot as well it is important that the characters in a movie take a journey and end up in a place different from where they started i didn't feel that the characters grew in the experiences portrayed in the movie br br finally the editing wasn't well done either there was a very big <UNK> in the middle of the movie that was exceptionally boring br br except for acting which i felt was consistently strong this movie failed in almost every aspect of cinema
<START> when i saw this movie i heard all the hype and i heard how people said that denzel deserved the oscar alongside his golden globe and i believed he must have done an outstanding job considering kevin spacey was excellent i was wrong i realize that people say this not to anger the african american community if they are not african americans themselves i always hear complaints on how african americans are never nominated and how they should have won sometimes this is true not as much nowadays because <UNK> goldberg should have won best actress for the color purple and the movie should have won best picture the only reason this movie was so blown up the way it was is because people see a movie about the semi spoiler <UNK> of an african american during a very racist time period and they automatically label it as a masterpiece br br denzel washington is an outstanding actor but his role in this movie did not affect me whatsoever i was bored with him in the movie and his acting here was quite similar to his role in malcolm x but not as good the audience is supposed to leave believing this man <UNK> carter is a saint people left the movies <UNK> this man this hero and they went out and bought his book making this hero of a man rich br br spoilers this movie tells the tale of a man who spent the majority of his life in prison mainly for crimes he did not commit of course the crimes he did commit stealing mostly was only to survive nothing more people felt sorry for him even though the drug dealers and thieves probably <UNK> to as much for the same reasons but are looked down upon in society everything in this movie tries to portray this man as a saint except for the obvious infidelity he had towards his wife and the <UNK> he showed the other man when he met his wife but why wouldn't it after all it is his point of view i do not like movies especially hollywood interpretations that are based on true stories because they usually <UNK> the true parts into something else something not so true this was his point of view and a hollywood construction yet everyone believed it was the truth <UNK> well i <UNK> his past a bit before making any <UNK> and he was a very violent man not only that there is still a possibility that he did murder those people if you do not believe me search for him on the internet and read the <UNK> some people have of him the boxing match he claimed to have won so easily was actually won by his <UNK> joey <UNK> and there are tapes to prove it besides that there are many twisted and <UNK> left out facts in this movie the supporting cast were the <UNK> people i have ever seen on the face of the earth and their nice and perfect persona looked difficult to keep up br br this movie was a hollywood version of yet another unfortunate true story that is still left to be told <UNK> <UNK> acting is stale and the supporting <UNK> mickey mouse attitudes are annoying the movie also begins very slow paced and is boring
<START> mario van <UNK> pops up for less than a five second cameo glenn plummer shows up a little longer but its a ladies show all the way <UNK> dash and lisa <UNK> have been in better projects bobby brown <UNK> and <UNK> through his little time on screen this is how it was pitched five tough women <UNK> and <UNK> in the wild wild west four black and one asian oh and <UNK> kim is a tough <UNK> <UNK> and marie <UNK> can bring in the pacific <UNK> market we can shoot it for less than 15 million straight to video and we'll double but more likely triple our dollars br br <UNK> that puppy br br you got it boss
<START> i rented this movie yesterday and can hardly express my disappointment in little laura <UNK> for getting involved in something so poorly produced i am not sure if it was horrible writing or bad directing or both but it leaves a viewer very disappointed in having wasted the time to watch this <UNK> it consisted of a weak naive story line very poor lines and relied solely on pretty scenery and pretty people to sell it unfortunately this was not enough you would be better off to rent a tape full of static than to waste your time on this crap lindsey wagner also played a pretty pathetic part as a ranch owner who apparently works very hard doing nothing anybody who has ever been near a ranch knows that this was obviously written by a young person from los angeles and not someone with much knowledge of the world
<START> a wonderful surprise of the spanish cinema i never thought <UNK> <UNK> could be such a great director after all i really don't care much for his choice in movies however this film was absolutely fantastic and not predictable at all something i always enjoy it hasn't enjoyed much good press and i really don't think it'll ever be released in the us market we'll have to content ourselves with the dvd or vhs if even that i don't want to say much about the story because i don't want to spoil it for you but basically the movie is about a homeless drunk who becomes the new <UNK> just for kicks and to get some money out of it like <UNK> many before he knows it he is <UNK> in a life he was not counting on
<START> rko had a reputation for making <UNK> <UNK> pieces of <UNK> br br anne shirley as dawn <UNK> had been in films since she was a <UNK> by 1933 she was in <UNK> having played ann <UNK> as a child in three on a match 1932 and a flower girl in both this side of heaven and the key both in 1934 george <UNK> <UNK> remembered <UNK> work from a previous film and that's how she got this part she also adopted anne shirley as her stage name the memorable stories are there lady of <UNK> in a <UNK> boat the stolen <UNK> the red hair incident anne was so right for the role of the <UNK> heartwarming orphan she was heartbreaking in her intensity her <UNK> to please and also her fiery temper o p <UNK> was wonderful as the understanding matthew <UNK> and helen <UNK> was fine as the firm <UNK> tom brown was an excellent gilbert <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who had also been in films as a small child was fine as diana barry sara <UNK> proved she could play someone other than aunt <UNK> in the andy hardy series was mrs barry
<START> why is this film so bad well if being so <UNK> annoying and unfunny is a reason then this film is it the character of corky <UNK> is unlikable at best and downright <UNK> at worst the gags are predictable but that isn't what makes it bad they are the lame sort of predictable jokes that your unfunny friend would say br br corky <UNK> is about a mild mannered vet that tries to do right but is so clumsy his quiet life is thrown for a loop when the family that once <UNK> him now needs him to <UNK> the fbi to destroy any trace of the family's crime history however it isn't that easy for corky because the fbi believes him to be a super agent and <UNK> him with the duty of <UNK> on his very own family <UNK> and mayhem ensue but it really doesn't feel like any comic <UNK> are there corky ends up in love with his beautiful fbi partner and has to set the record straight with both the fbi and his family if he is to settle down to the quiet life again br br i think what makes this film irritating is both the lead actor and the supposed jokes chris <UNK> reveals his <UNK> limitations as and actor here as his one note slapstick routine falls flat about 10 minutes into the film it is okay to have a full movie based solely off of dumb slap stick humor will <UNK> <UNK> snl partner seems to have made a full career out of it the only difference between <UNK> and <UNK> is that <UNK> knows when to tone it down and rely on other ways of telling a joke there is absolutely no diversity in <UNK> routine it's hard to hear the same joke twice but for a whole movie that is just pure torture br br the other problem with the movie was the lack of truly original and funny jokes the gay mafia brother the awkward guy <UNK> <UNK> and plenty of other forgettable jokes appear none as funny as the first time you barely laughed at it it seems as if the screenwriters had more of a fun time writing this than any one had watching it even with a cast that has some comedic talent chris penn peter falk the jokes that <UNK> are tired there is no chemistry too this film was obviously one for the <UNK> for the actors no body seemed to care about it or even try sad thing is no body told chris <UNK> that
<START> i just saw this delightful japanese feature film at the <UNK> <UNK> roger ebert overlooked film festival in the historic virginia theatre in <UNK> <UNK> br br although this film subtitled in english has ballroom dancing as its heart the film actually shows the world outside of japan how the rigid <UNK> of family <UNK> <UNK> and recreation still exist in modern day japan br br writer director <UNK> <UNK> i follow japanese <UNK> of presenting the family name last name first and the given name last uses the not so very popular theme of ballroom dancing to show the societal structure of japan br br also i shall not use the movie character names when world readers may not be familiar with japanese <UNK> names which may confuse i will refer to the br br actors by their professional acting name as listed in the internet data movie base br br he <UNK> the aid of his real life wife professional ballet dancer <UNK> <UNK> in her first and so far only motion picture she is a dance teacher at her father's dance studio yet her real ambition is to compete once more in an international dance competition which she was <UNK> from in the past no i won't say why see the movie br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is the main star of the film a veteran of about 25 films since 1979 he gives a sterling performance of a 40's something <UNK> br br who has a lovely wife teenage daughter and just purchased the house of his br br longing br br and yet something is missing from his own inner happiness see this film to learn how he becomes involved with ballroom dancing and secretly goes to br br lessons most of the dancing characters are <UNK> from the traditional br br japanese <UNK> of social structure they are friendly and warm and <UNK> of course this is in sharp contrast to how japanese society is structured with it's place for everyone and everyone in its place philosophy br br the movie has so many funny moments the almost 1 500 theater goers broke br br into spontaneous laughter during many of the comedic moments this proves br br that comedy has no foreign language br br veteran actor <UNK> <UNK> is funny and brilliant as well as <UNK> <UNK> they are two funny character actors br br one could purchase and read a college text book regarding the structure of life in japan or you could watch this fine film and begin to understand how the br br people of japan grow up in a fairly rigid societal structure watching the movie shall we <UNK> is a quick <UNK> into further study and viewing other br br japanese films br br i recommend this film to all it's funny it's charming it will make you cry a little and it will warm your heart br br
<START> i think the <UNK> average for this film is too low i give it a 7 very entertaining although over the top in a few places my wife says it passes the <UNK> steele test superb performances throughout particularly by <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this is a copy of the 1948 doris day classic romance on the high <UNK> br br the story line is more or less same but is contemporary govinda plays a sharp witted fellow who <UNK> the husband on the trip while <UNK> plays the college friend of the wife who does her the same favour they ostensibly try to catch each other out while the actual husband and wife tries to trip each other in <UNK> br br on the trip govinda mistakes another girl for <UNK> wife and spies on her while falling in love with the ravishing <UNK> br br <UNK> plays a <UNK> role of father and son both lawyers <UNK> in divorce proceedings they are <UNK> against each other for the <UNK> couple br br it is a poor attempt at <UNK> the original classics and the songs are quite appalling the comedy is slap stick and will not make one laugh too much
<START> yet again <UNK> <UNK> takes you on a ride to the wild side and a remarkable one it is literally and <UNK> br br <UNK> hi society stars and <UNK> <UNK> dolls and witch doctors business <UNK> and <UNK> types yep the whole <UNK> lot are in sharp focus here in typical <UNK> fashion their worlds unfold with every colorful story a clever sub plot in itself br br a struggling <UNK> dumped by the producer after getting her pregnant the <UNK> and her high profile husband the <UNK> businessman and his neurotic wife the <UNK> and the police captain all shades on display and countless <UNK> in between br br <UNK> does a <UNK> job of digging up the dirt on the drama kings the dancing queens and the living dead <UNK> <UNK> packs a punch as does <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is effective as the ex crime beat reporter but she could have been <UNK> up a little in keeping with the job change and the party circuit br br highly focused running time <UNK> min and <UNK> different film well worth the money
<START> watching the fox and the child was an <UNK> experience the lush visuals integrity of point of view and utter beauty of the setting and characters left me in a <UNK> of pleasure br br the plot is <UNK> <UNK> simple within the <UNK> of that simplicity a world unfolds that draws you in and leaves you breathless br br i laughed i <UNK> i learned br br this is a movie you can trust yourself to give yourself over to dare i say it is an act of love intended for any innocent heart it reaches to the heart of the viewer of any age and reveals the world through new eyes as if seen from the heart br br <UNK> da <UNK> once said that true art draws the viewer beyond point of view into <UNK> participation in reality i feel i have been <UNK> to watch no to participate in this film a work of true art
<START> this film is just plain horrible john ritter doing <UNK> falls 75 of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards poor editing horrible sound mixing dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise and a plot that really goes nowhere i didn't think i'd ever say this but dorothy <UNK> is not the worst actress in this film there are at least 3 others that suck more <UNK> <UNK> delivers her lines with the passion of ben <UNK> i started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside even <UNK> kids are awful the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card this movie is seriously horrible there's a reason bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later please don't watch it if you see it in your television <UNK> <UNK> your cable if a friend suggests it to you <UNK> your friendship if your <UNK> wants to watch it you're better off finding another <UNK> i'd rather <UNK> my eyes out with lawn <UNK> than sit through this piece of garbage again if i could sum this film up in one word that word would be <UNK>
<START> example of how a world war 2 documentary should be made using first hand accounts from actual troops and civilians whom <UNK> in this awful conflict and <UNK> footage gathered from around the time i caught this on a re run on the history channel about a year and a half back with no knowledge really of the second world war at the time but it <UNK> me and now i consider myself a world war 2 buff watching and reading any and all that i can find about it but nothing comes close to this landmark documentary definitely worth buying the <UNK> set of br br this is quite simply documentary making of the very highest standard
<START> i rented this movie because it falls under the genres of romance and western with some grand canyon scenery thrown in but if you're expecting a typical wholesome romantic western forget it this movie is pure trash the romance is between a young girl who has not even gone through <UNK> and a middle aged man the child is also <UNK> after by other <UNK> men it's sickening br br peter fonda is portrayed as being <UNK> by trying to resist his attraction to brooke <UNK> and her character is mostly the one that <UNK> the relationship he tries to <UNK> her off at first but eventually he gives in and they drive off as a happy loving couple it's revolting br br i don't see how this movie could appeal to anyone except <UNK>
<START> i'm not sure i understand where all these <UNK> anti grudge people are talking about here perhaps it's just that some people like to rant about things br br the movie was certainly <UNK> uneven acting some may have had difficulties with the time changes actors all too willing to go places i'd really rather not go etc but imho there were some things that more than made up for the <UNK> br br first and foremost i loved the <UNK> of the <UNK> bit normally when you leave the haunted house the baddies leave you alone giving you time to <UNK> get friends and find the token mysterious <UNK> type normally semi spoiler alert when you're hiding under the covers they can only get you through that little opening you <UNK> through normally at the end the ghosts somehow have become less creepy because you've found out they're just misunderstood or they've been freed or whatever br br secondly the production was exceptional while the movie was hardly special effects laden the supernatural bits while brief were extremely well done br br probably not the best sort of movie for those who think freddy and jason are the ultimate sort of horror nothing against 'em they've got their place but great for those who've begun to take the conventions for granted and who don't have trouble with the time <UNK>
<START> a yawn inducing <UNK> paced disappointment inside man tells the story of a detective denzel washington who is under investigation due to his possible involvement in a case of missing money when a bank is robbed and <UNK> are held against their will by a mastermind thief clive owen and his team the detective is assigned to <UNK> the thief to surrender ¬ñ his one shot at proving he is innocent and worthy of his position enter a powerful woman jodie foster with secrets and <UNK> of her own sent to recover an item from the bank <UNK> safety <UNK> box that is <UNK> within the bank and you have quite the three way dilemma unfortunately all you get it set up in the film and nothing pays off in the end denzel washington is at his most uninteresting in an <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> performance the only saving grace for the film is its competent co stars jodie foster and clive owen who are much better than the film itself in fact jodie foster delivers the most surprising and high caliber performance playing against type as a ruthless <UNK> villain of sorts clive owen isn't given much to do besides <UNK> and pose but the depth of his presence and his achieved acting ability more than make up for his underdeveloped role it's strange that so much talent is wasted on this film of little impact or interest you have to wonder what director spike lee was thinking while he was creating this film the most <UNK> aspect of inside man however is how much <UNK> praise it has received for a film that seemed to have all the <UNK> of a pre summer blockbuster this one falls horribly flat
<START> like the first touch of pleasure and guilt like a spontaneous youthful <UNK> of fascination and fear like a climax of contrary emotions said one of the movie buffs after viewing love at the top the <UNK> title version of stylish director michel <UNK> le <UNK> <UNK> br br vincent <UNK> in new york times however just after the 1974 premiere of the movie stated love at the top which opened yesterday at the <UNK> street <UNK> is a 1973 french comedy that <UNK> recalls a number of <UNK> fifties english comedies about the rise and rise of cynical young men <UNK> possessed <UNK> yet the significant difference that he mentioned was the fact that love at the top is not concerned with the english class system january 27 1975 br br having left the <UNK> up to single individuals of course the test of time has done its just job what may be said with <UNK> after more than 30 years is that we can hardly find such movies like le <UNK> <UNK> where <UNK> appears innocent where <UNK> appear <UNK> enthusiastic where feelings occur so manipulative br br for <UNK> <UNK> fans it seems useless to point out that this film is a must see not only because she gives a unique performance as she did in all of her roles at the <UNK> of her career 9 years before her sudden death but because she is particularly attractive here it is not trio <UNK> where the so to say <UNK> <UNK> from and the mockery of <UNK> sweet image haunted for years by <UNK> <UNK> meets its most <UNK> <UNK> but a film where the brilliant actress is given a fair role she plays <UNK> a woman who becomes the object of lust for the story's lead playboy nicolas <UNK> jean louis <UNK> it is him who takes financial <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> this movie can <UNK> truly memorable and unique shots of <UNK> and she is given some of her very best scenes <UNK> sex appeal is unforgettable here br br another strong point of the film is its execution of the content with a development of individual perception <UNK> as it may seem the director makes a perfect use of contrast conventions vs pleasures innocence vs <UNK> genuine lust vs <UNK> affair <UNK> owns most of the features that viewers may like or <UNK> may find attractive or disgusting yet his are the features the viewers must treat seriously more to say they are the ones we all must accept that is why one is led to a peculiar gently wild <UNK> unique world of the main character although he sleeps with lots of women there are two women that represent a sort of contrary worlds for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> schneider and marie paul jane <UNK> he <UNK> them makes love to them cannot <UNK> from both desire for their bodies and desire for money yet he <UNK> them differently yet despite all of this <UNK> maturity ' he is emotionally like a little boy who plays with a toy car on the table a sort of <UNK> insight into male mind ' in a comedy like way of course br br finally there are very good performances which makes le <UNK> <UNK> slightly underrated not only the aforementioned <UNK> schneider does a brilliant job <UNK> the viewers with an extraordinary insight into her role but young jane <UNK> appears to be convincing in the role of young inexperienced <UNK> marie paul jean louis <UNK> makes it possible to see <UNK> in the right way this artistic merit lying in performances goes with terrific music by <UNK> saint <UNK> the tune that will ring in your ears for long therefore apart from some flaws of the movie like dated colors slow action sometimes possible clich√©s noticed by some viewers the merits should be found significant br br le <UNK> <UNK> in sum is a clear <UNK> of contrary manipulative tools in life it is worth seeing as a moment in <UNK> career a <UNK> to strong <UNK> a chain of contrary emotions of love and hatred appreciation and disgust compared to the first <UNK> and the first <UNK> but aren't we humans <UNK> ' movie buffs built upon such <UNK>
<START> i had the distinct <UNK> of seeing this movie at the 2006 <UNK> international film festival i have been attending this festival for over 5 years and i have certainly seen some poor movies on occasion however <UNK> <UNK> has reached a brand new low in film in spite of being shot in beautiful locations with the occasional exquisite close up of fabulous food the movie <UNK> an excessive number of plot twists and stilted characters until i was practically begging for it to end br br the lead actor david la <UNK> completely failed to show any character development throughout the movie portraying a pompous chef from beginning to end additional sub plots such as eating <UNK> were developed so poorly and completely did not fit within any context that the movie had shown up to that point br br a theme of <UNK> was used as a poor attempt to <UNK> a movie that achieves nothing goes nowhere and completely disappoints
<START> it's difficult to put into words the almost <UNK> hatred i have of this film but i'll try br br every other word was an <UNK> the sex scenes were uncomfortable drugs were rampant and stereotyping was beyond the norm if not offensive to italian americans br br i'm not saying the acting was terrible because <UNK> sorvino <UNK> <UNK> et al performed well but almost every character in the film i <UNK> not since the <UNK> of the <UNK> have i disliked every character on screen
<START> this film is quite boring there are snippets of naked flesh tossed around in a lame attempt to keep the viewer awake but they don't succeed br br the best thing about the movie is lena <UNK> she does a masterful job handling her character but day lewis <UNK> most of his lines br br kaufman clearly had no idea how to film this the <UNK> in <UNK> between domestic household marriage issues and political <UNK> are badly matched character attitudes change without explanation throughout badly disjointed
<START> <UNK> and <UNK> br br this tremendously entertaining film grabs you from the opening scene and never stops delivering laughs surprises and unexpectedly touching moments i had more fun watching the <UNK> than almost any other film from 2005 it is a wacky film with an unforgettable character played to perfection by pierce brosnan br br julian noble brosnan is a <UNK> hit man who <UNK> in high end corporate <UNK> <UNK> rich <UNK> he is also experiencing something akin to a mid life crisis after coming to realization that he has no real friends no permanent home and no planned future he stumbles into a mexican hotel bar one night and runs into danny wright kinnear br br danny is a down on his luck family man who is on the verge of losing the big business deal that just might turn things around for him he loves his wife <UNK> especially so since they lost their young son a few years earlier br br the two men are <UNK> and cheese hardly any common ground other than that they are in the same desolate bar one night and somehow a conversation is struck that sets in to motion a chain of events that will change their lives forever br br the friendship they form reminded me a lot of laurel and hardy one is the straight man and the other is the <UNK> fool who gets them into trouble the interplay is superbly timed and finely tuned due in no small part to the wonderful performances from brosnan and kinnear br br but make no mistake this is <UNK> film he <UNK> one of the most memorable and <UNK> likable characters of the decade he could shoot your mother and apologize immediately thereafter and you'd probably forgive him brosnan may be <UNK> ultimate <UNK> but this is his most endearing and complete performance to date i wouldn't be <UNK> to seeing an oscar nod for this role br br consider one scene where he overtly <UNK> a high school girl with the <UNK> of thoughts and <UNK> the line all <UNK> <UNK> no <UNK> <UNK> he does it with the familiar bond <UNK> and manages to get away with it he manages to tell a young boy tell your mother to lose <UNK> and 20 years then get back to me without coming across as unlikable in fact it makes us like him even more br br and yet the film manages to surprise us with some truly touching scenes most of which come toward the end when the film takes some unpredictable turns however when julian thumbs through his little black book to find someone to call on his birthday or when danny and his wife davis <UNK> each other in their bedroom one night the film reaches an unexpected depth of emotion br br the <UNK> is stylish and energetic it is constantly entertaining and it contains a career defining role for brosnan as the lonely hit man looking for <UNK> friendship and a means to do at least one good thing in his life this is an overlooked gem in 2005 and you should make an effort to see this film as soon as possible br br <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> com
<START> i was excited to view a <UNK> film in the <UNK> competition but after the presentation i was total disappointed and furious too much blood too much time too much themes for nothing the spanish civil war like every war was horrible the revenge a very human behavior not pretty at all is shown in <UNK> films and plays as well as the relations between <UNK> and the <UNK> in spain about <UNK> but what mr <UNK> try is a pseudo tragedy that can belongs to the worst of the <UNK> history it is really a pity to see angela <UNK> in this movie i advise nobody under no circumstances to go to see this film
<START> i must agree with the very first comment this movie sucks very very hard despite having a very big b list cast the cover of this film for those who aren't watching it on comedy central during a <UNK> which is probably the only exposure this film will ever get tries to put the blame on <UNK> but in reality is just a paycheck for every has been comedian from the '80s randy quaid check ed <UNK> jr check the voice of lisa simpson she can now say that maximum <UNK> wasn't her only horrible flick double check and so many many others br br the saddest thing about this flick is that it was so <UNK> written with already told jokes nothing about this movie outside of its existence is funny you're better off watching paint dry this is definitely direct to video <UNK> the bottom of the barrel stuff that still believes in the old video <UNK> throw an old time star on the cover and you'll get some money back off of the rental considering the days of video rental are changing consider this one of the last examples of putting out garbage br br the only use this movie has if you're having trouble falling asleep it'll get you there
<START> probably the finest fantasy film ever made <UNK> colour spectacular sets incredible spot on <UNK> <UNK> musical score that is perfect for each scene and mood acting is superb as well in what could have been stiff and pretentious in lesser hands but here the poetic dialog is <UNK> <UNK> spoken the humour is subtle and delightful as well br br <UNK> spielberg and lucas were enthralled by this one along with the four <UNK> 1939 one of the two finest motion pictures released by alexander <UNK> and london films and one of the finest motion pictures ever made br br a true compelling classic
<START> yeah right sammo hung already acted in the main role in <UNK> zu <UNK> from the magic mountain now 2001 he does it again with zu warriors but this time he finally does it right you seldom see him in <UNK> more often in classic eastern or crime slapstick but this role simply does fit him the ancient chinese legend about zu mountain is not often represented in movies as far as i know about movies translated for the west although the legend contains a vast of interesting stories and possibilities straight said you haven't seen a story alike yet in a modern movie and that makes it so great and wow all the colors plus the enormously deep right into the heart going story makes you fall for this movie in an instant the first time i watched it i had to watch it again instantly and i did ok true i didn't understand all of it the first time but that makes it only better you know you didn't understand all of it because there is so much spice in it <UNK> it is a pleasure for one self to watch it over and over again and yeah it grows deeper in your heart the more often you watch it br br summary a story to love characters you cry with and truly a movie you never forget <UNK> note well i think i must watch it right now again d
<START> moonstruck is a lovely little film directed by superb story <UNK> norman <UNK> in the heat of the night <UNK> on the roof the <UNK> the film is great on many levels it shows a good slice of italian culture has a touching romance and best of all is a hilarious comedy br br one thing i liked most about the film was the relative unconventional looks of the actors nicolas cage looks positively odd for most of the film and cher well cher always looks a little odd br br overall it's a fun film and easy to recommend br br 7 4 out of 10
<START> it's hard for me to criticize anything that <UNK> <UNK> does she just <UNK> beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress that notwithstanding yes the plot was predictable i think perhaps if jill had slept with richard then it may have made him a little <UNK> than he already was which would have added more to the suspense it would have also been nice to see jill and her husband find out about <UNK> little problem with his ex wife maybe a bit more back story i was a little disappointed with the ending of the movie i would have liked to have seen more closure with <UNK> death and possibly closure with her husband i do have to say though i will never be able to look at a <UNK> gun and not picture her standing there it was a very fitting end for richard of course <UNK> <UNK> i am so looking forward to her future projects
<START> from the beginning this movie did have a few flaws the main character played by hayden christensen is a the rich young <UNK> who has inherited his father's considerable wealth and power and he is struggling to both fill his father's shoes and cut the <UNK> strings mother and co executive keeps too tight he also has the problem of having a heart condition and waiting in the <UNK> that is the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> there are also minor back stories which your first instinct is to mostly ignore that become important later such as his friendship with his surgeon <UNK> howard and his romance with a middle class girl jessica alba <UNK> story lines but not bad enough to ruin the movie the only real <UNK> <UNK> moment was the name of lena <UNK> character overbearing woman named <UNK> subtle br br the <UNK> scenes are not at all <UNK> i appreciated that people who find surgery scenes scary might not the horror of being awake during <UNK> was done well at first you watch in emotional agony as christensen screams <UNK> through the chest <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> the moment of irony from the trailers then comes where while he is one of the unlucky few to be awake during <UNK> he is also luck in that it helps him learn that his <UNK> team is planning to murder him br br the big twist however is very predictable and sends the film <UNK> into the conspiracy and his memories of the little signs which were there but he like us initially missed br br there are two more twists at the end involving his relationship with his mother one is an impressive gesture by <UNK> which comes of as unimpressive due to poor writing the other is a secret about the family's past which seemed very tacked on and pointless br br the initially well done <UNK> awareness drama gets lost in the poorly written conspiracy drama there is a one final attempt to bring it back which falls flat taking the entire movie with it
<START> in the film <UNK> palace directed by jonathan <UNK> two best friends alice claire danes and <UNK> kate beckinsale decide to celebrate high school <UNK> by taking a trip to hawaii but hear that <UNK> thailand is much more fun they switched plans and decided to go to thailand without telling their parents the change of plans while they were in thailand alice and <UNK> met a really handsome guy named nick parks daniel <UNK> he tells them that he would trade in his first class ticket to hong kong for three economy tickets so that they could spend the weekend in hong kong they accepted his offer and upon entering the airport the two were arrested for <UNK> drugs they were convicted and sentenced to thirty three years in prison br br i think <UNK> was trying to show the audience that it is wise to make good decisions because in one instance one bad decision can change the direction of a life forever also a friendly face may not be as friendly as we think once we find out the real intentions of that friendly face those girls made a decision not to tell their parents that they had switched their plans and it changed their lives forever things have a funny way of happening showing us what decision we have made <UNK> the decision that we should have made sometimes life is not fair that is why it is important to think long and hard about the choices that we make because we can never go back and change the choices that we have made br br this movie has a great setting it was filmed mostly in <UNK> thailand this film also has great music a few of my favorite songs are <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by sarah <UNK> and <UNK> just <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> i went out and bought the soundtrack after watching this film these girls where young and naive and failed to think their plans out thoroughly a mistake that anyone could make therefore this film is good for any audience it makes no difference young or old we all are human and subject to mistakes even though i did not like the way this film ended leaving me in question of who really <UNK> the drugs i would definitely give this film two thumbs up
<START> good story good script good casting good acting good directing good art direction good photography good sound good editing good everything put it all together and you end up with good entertainment br br the shame of it is that there aren't nearly enough films of this caliber being made these days we may count ourselves lucky that writers directors like john hughes are occasionally able to make their creative voices heard br br whenever i notice that i'm watching a film for the third or fourth time and still find it thoroughly satisfying i have to conclude that something about that film is right
<START> the original movie the odd couple has some wonderful comic one liners the entire world it seems knows the story of neurotic neat freak felix <UNK> and funny obnoxious <UNK> oscar madison this <UNK> of <UNK> roommates created one of the most successful tv series of all time as well as countless not anywhere near as good <UNK> br br the odd couple movie has some wonderful jokes about <UNK> apartment and his sloppy <UNK> he says who wants food one of his poker player buddies asks what do ya got oscar says i got brown <UNK> and green <UNK> what's the brown it's either very new cheese or very old meat i also love the line about <UNK> <UNK> it's been out of order for two weeks i saw milk standing in there that wasn't even in a bottle there is no question that walter <UNK> oscar madison is a joy to watch on screen he's almost as good as jack <UNK> version in the tv series br br the problem with the movie is jack <UNK> felix <UNK> jack makes a very very honest effort at the role the problem is that he makes felix so depressing and down <UNK> that he becomes more annoying than comical tony <UNK> performance in the series brought the kind of humor warmth and sensitivity to <UNK> character which <UNK> portrayal lacks tony's felix <UNK> obviously could be annoying some of the time however in the tv series it related to specific situations where the annoyance was needed in the storyline jack's felix <UNK> note the different spelling in the movie seems to never be happy fun or interesting the movie felix <UNK> is a roommate that drives you up the wall all the time br br the movie still has great moments that <UNK> the test of time the famous <UNK> fight is one of the greatest scenes ever one of the other great examples of <UNK> little notes on <UNK> <UNK> will be remembered forever however there are some darker sides where oscar goes over the top his crying near the end after <UNK> out felix and a scene involving <UNK> <UNK> dinner although <UNK> by a funny line seem more depressing than comical br br perhaps there wasn't enough time to see the lighter side of these characters that made the series so memorable in the movie the beginning 20 minutes are very boring the same issue occurs with <UNK> conversation with the <UNK> sisters the movie's ending is predictable and too pat there's very little care or compassion for each of them by the other the result is that the darker side of the film leads to a lot of depression and anger rather than comedy unless you are watching the great scenes described above it appears that jack <UNK> <UNK> persona of felix brings the film down rather than enhances or <UNK> the comedy between the characters br br it really took the 1970's tv series to make the odd couple the best that it could be the original film is still very good however the tv series is much better
<START> you got to go and dig those holes holes only leaves <UNK> which makes a movie so good disney has done it again <UNK> <UNK> should be nominated for best actor for his performance as stanley <UNK> he has <UNK> won the daytime emmy for best actor in a comedy series even stevens holes is one of the best movies in 2003
<START> i'll just be vague about my potential spoiling comments there are enough <UNK> plot elements in this movie that it's essentially pre spoiled br br this movie <UNK> a few ideas from a southern classic to kill a <UNK> i suppose maybe <UNK> got its ideas from some source at any rate after you watch this you'll say oh yeah that is a ripoff br br i think the truly entertaining thing about these <UNK> is once you've identified a plot element is to figure out whether they'll stick with the original or try to twist it around not a lot of twists in this one
<START> <UNK> sets off for <UNK> looking for a legendary treasure his only clue is an interesting jewel that an old man gave him it's a nice different location for <UNK> with the desert and that hot exotic feel br br one interesting thing about this movie is that <UNK> has a much smaller role than usual generally being in a different place than <UNK> on one hand their classic dynamic together is missed but it is a change of pace plus this way <UNK> can focus on the ladies br br <UNK> rules in this throughout the entire feature she is <UNK> <UNK> and us viewers then there's lara the damsel of this particular tale and she's quite likable this one has more nudity than any other <UNK> anime which is a fun distinction to have br br there's a very entertaining <UNK> ninja guy who's the best villain in this and naturally he has some great fighting with <UNK> as well as some fun scenes with <UNK> inspector <UNK> of course is also on a <UNK> here in fine form br br pretty much this is a smooth ride with <UNK> the plot is average and there are some slow spots but all in all this movie is a real pleasure enjoy
<START> this is a masterpiece footage in b w <UNK> film the film makes you see a strange way to begin the day at 7 35 am in a bar and how much things can happen there in 8 minutes br br the short amazingly gets you in a complex story using very little elements and step to step makes you realize that something isn't totally right it expresses a lot makes your <UNK> go high with subtle details and is incredibly understandable by anyone not just the cinema critics experts br br but i know how it sounds european short black and white and low budgeted don't let that scare you is really worth to see by anyone not just experts in the genre br br isn't really much more to tell since the film just lasts 8 minutes exactly and i don't want to spoil it but i just watched it online and i couldn't understand why no one spent a few minutes to post a comment about it br br really worth watching it 10 10
<START> i cannot believe how unknown this movie is it was absolutely incredible the ending alone has stuck with me for almost thirty years the road sign through the <UNK> mirror blew me away if you liked race with the devil you will love this movie
<START> i saw this at an arty cinema that was also showing last days and some charlie chaplin films based on the quality of the other features i decided to give <UNK> a chance i nearly walked out of this movie and i like science fiction the story is set in a futuristic new york city filled with blade runner style sky <UNK> and some similar <UNK> about <UNK> <UNK> humans unfortunately the screenplay was not <UNK> enough for an hour and forty five minute movie three groups exist in this world humans artificial humans and egyptian gods the artificial humans seem to have the upper hand and control the politics of the city the humans are slaves and are used for <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the egyptian gods have a floating <UNK> <UNK> on the great <UNK> of <UNK> and complete with a <UNK> exterior leaving a smooth cap on the <UNK> wouldn't a floating futuristic <UNK> be in perfect condition the <UNK> rests above the city and nobody on the ground understands what it is or why it's there i won't bore you with the so called plot but there is lots of unnecessary gore and many gross out scenes the film as i said looks to have been influenced by blade runner and perhaps also by the fifth element and the matrix at the end of the film credits were listed thank <UNK> to the united kingdom france and italy the film is french but uses british actors who don't speak french hence it is obvious that their french dialog has been dubbed this is a distraction and i also thought that switching back and forth between real humans and animations quite distracting it doesn't help that the animations are poor no better than a video game skip this one
<START> this movie is such a bad work nothing seems to even try and be realistic plot is weak acting miserable actors wondering around like in a 1st year production trying very hard to act with no chance at all from the beginning what a flop what a waste of time money and effort to all concerned including the audience well as in any thriller here too are murders corpses and blood just imagine someone who 5 minutes ago committed a murder with a knife and came out calm and smiling not to mention clean as a <UNK> as if <UNK> one's throat is done by a virtual agent also this murder was supposed to be done by a tiny fragile woman on a high strong male and she cut his throat did she ask him <UNK> to bend down for her much more stupidity of that same kind is going on and on leaving the audience wondering if this meant to be a joke which just turned out to be a bad one continuity is another huge problem as for instance the eager hungry <UNK> is lying in bed waiting for his virgin bride to get out of the bathroom and after a long while falls asleep next scene opens with the young couple entering the reception area asking for <UNK> to scenery spots not a word about last night such a waste of time even to try and write about this low low supposed to be movie
<START> jason alexander is a wonderful actor but it's ridiculous to cast him as a <UNK> romantic lead the fact that he dances so well <UNK> so effectively and throws himself into the part so completely somehow just made him seem all the more creepy in his more <UNK> moments with the girl in the train station in the final number with <UNK> i couldn't take my eyes off him he was so <UNK> you keep expecting him to drop the nice guy act and start <UNK> vanessa williams was the real star the only performance that was better than the 1963 movie by the way if you see a production of the stage musical the 1963 movie and this 1995 movie you'll see three versions that have more <UNK> different songs same songs assigned to different characters and in different situations than any other musical i've ever seen
<START> now that che 2008 has finished its relatively short australian cinema run extremely limited release 1 screen in sydney after <UNK> i can <UNK> join both <UNK> of at the movies in taking steven soderbergh to task br br it's usually satisfying to watch a film director change his style subject but <UNK> most recent stinker the girlfriend experience 2009 was also missing a story so narrative and editing seem to suddenly be <UNK> main challenge strange after 20 odd years in the business he was probably never much good at narrative just <UNK> it well inside edgy projects br br none of this excuses him this present almost diabolical failure as david <UNK> warns two parts of che don't even make a whole br br epic biopic in name only che 2008 barely qualifies as a feature film it certainly has no legs <UNK> as except for its <UNK> ultimate resolution forced upon it by history <UNK> 4 <UNK> long <UNK> just goes nowhere br br even margaret <UNK> the more <UNK> of <UNK> at the movies duo noted about <UNK> <UNK> waste of <UNK> digital <UNK> you're in the woods you're in the woods you're in the woods i too am surprised soderbergh didn't give us another 2 <UNK> of that somewhere between his existing two parts because he still left out massive <UNK> of che's revolutionary life br br for a biopic of an important but infamous historical figure soderbergh <UNK> <UNK> if not deliberately insults his audiences by br br 1 never providing most of che's story br br 2 <UNK> <UNK> film <UNK> with mere <UNK> <UNK> br br 3 ignoring both true <UNK> and a narrative of events br br 4 barely developing an idea or a character br br 5 remaining <UNK> episodic br br 6 ignoring proper context for scenes whatever we do get is <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> br br 7 <UNK> <UNK> all audiences even spanish <UNK> will be confused by the <UNK> <UNK> in english and br br 8 <UNK> <UNK> his main subject into one dimension why at this late stage the t shirt franchise has been a success br br our sense of <UNK> is surely due to peter <UNK> and benjamin <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> their screenplay solely on <UNK> <UNK> so like a poor student who has read only one of his <UNK> <UNK> for his assignment <UNK> product is exceedingly limited in perspective br br the audience is held captive within the same <UNK> knowledge scenery and circumstances of the <UNK> but that doesn't <UNK> our sympathy instead it <UNK> on us that ah <UNK> trying to <UNK> his audiences the same as the latino <UNK> were at the time but these are the same illiterate latino <UNK> who sold out the good doctor to his enemies why does soderbergh feel the need to <UNK> us with them and keep us equally mentally captive such audience <UNK> must have a purpose br br <UNK> is more <UNK> than <UNK> but it's literally mind numbing with its repetitive bush bashing misery of <UNK> and lack of variety or character <UNK> <UNK> che has no opportunity to grow as a person while he struggles to <UNK> his own ill <UNK> troops the only <UNK> is the humour as che deals with his sometimes deeply ignorant <UNK> some of whom violently lack self control around local <UNK> or food we certainly get no insight into what caused the conditions nor any <UNK> <UNK> of their <UNK> <UNK> such as it was br br <UNK> excruciating <UNK> remains <UNK> episodic again nothing is <UNK> or <UNK> thus even the scenes with <UNK> castro <UNK> <UNK> are unexpected and <UNK> any selected events are portrayed <UNK> and latino <UNK> with <UNK> interviews replaced by time shifting <UNK> between the corrupt <UNK> president <UNK> de <UNK> and us government officials promising cia <UNK> br br the rest of <UNK> woods and day for night blue <UNK> just <UNK> the audience until they're <UNK> the <UNK> br br perhaps <UNK> felt too <UNK> the frustration of many non american <UNK> about never getting a truthful <UNK> history of che's exploits within their own countries when foreign <UNK> still won't deliver a free press to their people for whatever reason then one can see how a popular american indie producer might set out to <UNK> the not so well read i may not be able to read or write but i'm not illiterate <UNK> the inspector general 1949 out to their own local cinemas the film's obvious <UNK> and gross over <UNK> hint very strongly that it's aiming only at the <UNK> of the less informed who still speak little english if they did they'd have read <UNK> on the subject already and <UNK> the relevant social issues amongst themselves learning the lessons of history as they should br br such insights are precisely what societies still need and not just the remaining illiterate <UNK> of central and south america yet it's what che 2008 <UNK> fails to deliver soderbergh <UNK> his lead because he's weak on narrative i am <UNK> why <UNK> <UNK> deliberately chose soderbergh for this project if he knew this it's been <UNK> <UNK> about guevara was sorely wanted it's what i went to see this film for but the director <UNK> <UNK> us of that br br david <UNK> writing in the australian <UNK> <UNK> 2009 observed that while <UNK> was uneven <UNK> actually goes rapidly downhill from there <UNK> che's final campaign in bolivia in excruciating detail which feels almost <UNK> slow and turgid br br che the <UNK> aka <UNK> is certainly no <UNK> for bolivia painting it a picture of misery and <UNK> the entire second half is only redeemed by the aforementioned humour and the dramatic yet tragic capture and execution of the film's subject br br the rest of this interminable cinema <UNK> is just confusing irritating misery shockingly for a soderbergh film to be avoided at all costs it is bound to break the hearts of all who know even just a <UNK> about the subject 2 10
<START> not so many people like the movies of <UNK> <UNK> simply because they don't understand them simply because they are different kinds of people br br if you have not been living under a deep desperation <UNK> with great personal hope it may be hard for you to enjoy the humor <UNK> shown here br br and also the film of <UNK> cannot be classified easily as black comedy or cult etc like those of pulp fiction etc because there is this <UNK> which the audience of north america frequently fail to appreciate br br when i looked at these two <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> restaurant i felt they were more <UNK> than any gentleman can have been br br the urge to make love wildly like these is the normal reaction we feel under the unbearable pressure of meaningless being <UNK> by the <UNK> suddenly emerges at the <UNK> br br so les <UNK> is much better a name than going places to dance a <UNK> you need to be elegant but going places you don't
<START> a fantastic <UNK> adventure a former king ahmad and his best friend the thief abu played by <UNK> of black <UNK> search for <UNK> love interest who has been stolen by the new king <UNK> conrad <UNK> there's hardly a down moment here it's always <UNK> new adventures for the heroes personally i found ahmad and his princess a little boring there's no need to ask why john justin who plays ahmad is listed fourth in the credits conrad <UNK> always a fun actor makes a great villain and <UNK> is a lot of fun as the prince of thieves who at one point finds a genie in a bottle i also really loved miles <UNK> as the <UNK> of <UNK> the father of the princess he <UNK> amazing toys from around the world <UNK> <UNK> him for his daughter's hand with a mechanical flying horse this probably would count as one of the great children's films of all time but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays kids will certainly <UNK> the <UNK> images when abu and the genie are on screen together and the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful although most of the younger generation probably thinks that king kong looks bad at this point in time willis <UNK> stop motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that doesn't even look remotely like a spider 8 10
<START> after watching <UNK> i felt i'll get to watch another good film but sadly the film is a joke and actually trying hard to introduce <UNK> <UNK> his father <UNK> is the producer br br <UNK> spoke so highly about the film during <UNK> saying the film has meat unlike films released that time i wonder which films was he talking about br br the film is actually a typical <UNK> film with loads of comedy romance action everything <UNK> br br the ease at which the kids kidnap the family is one of the funniest parts ever imagine kids kidnapping <UNK> family br br the end is a complete <UNK> <UNK> with sudden change of characterization br br <UNK> gives his weakest film till date except some bachchan scenes the film is a bore br br music is boring br br amitabh tries to give the role his all he does his part well though not his best though he <UNK> his face too much when pulling a trigger and does a weird look while smoking the <UNK> his dubbing too isn't matched properly at times br br akshay is there for some minutes and just repeats his act and <UNK> br br <UNK> seems <UNK> tries too hard but <UNK> it in some scenes br br <UNK> emerges the best of the lot br br the rest are okay
<START> hot millions is a well written well acted tale about an <UNK> who steals <UNK> too low class a word for an <UNK> according to peter <UNK> lead character a hot million from the london branch of a u s corporation by creating shell <UNK> on the continent and using the <UNK> ostensibly secure computer to transfer <UNK> to them remember spoiler police this is a comedy not a mystery br br from 1968 this movie's depiction of computers may seem naive to today's more computer <UNK> <UNK> but as one who has worked with computers since before this film was released i would <UNK> that even then this <UNK> of having been written by and for computer <UNK> probably on purpose to <UNK> the <UNK> comedic aspects of this british flick br br if one has little taste for this type of entertainment the movie may seem to drag in spots fortunately it has a nicely wrapped up ending unfortunately the end credits give no indication of the classical music used <UNK> the <UNK> piece at the end and the piano <UNK> <UNK> in the middle just the song sung by <UNK> which i totally don't remember

<START> a slick <UNK> of the sexual exploitation of <UNK> black women by white men of power and <UNK> <UNK> does that <UNK> your <UNK> well then belly up to a vhs or dvd and <UNK> on this gratuitous <UNK> through a <UNK> segment of history for good measure it's adapted from the book by celebrated hack anne rice the directing is as <UNK> and melodramatic as the cheesy dialog most of acting is amateurish the <UNK> sole worthwhile note is that it employed practically a dozen black actors all of whom have <UNK> been in employed in today's market <UNK> guy ben <UNK> pam <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> including some faces that have barely been seen at all <UNK> <UNK> rachel <UNK> it also is despite itself a sterling showcase for nicole <UNK> the pompous and <UNK> james earl jones is on hand as well so is the late <UNK> davis a minimal talent who owes his success to having been <UNK> with the legendary <UNK> ensemble company this film should be rated t for tripe
<START> this movie is not based on the bible it completely leaves christ out of the movie they do not show the rapture or the second coming of christ let alone talk about it it does not quote from <UNK> the end times are called the great <UNK> the movie does not even show bad times the seven <UNK> seven <UNK> and seven <UNK> of <UNK> are boiled down to a 15 second news cast of the sea changing it's structure the anti christ was killed 3 1 2 years into the <UNK> and that is how the movie ended the only part they got correct was there was two <UNK> the did not use there names of course because that would be too close to the truth of <UNK> the worst part of it was i really wanted it to be a good movie i wanted to take <UNK> people to it i feel that the movie is evil it is a <UNK> just like everything the devil does i just hope it does not take away from the upcoming movie based on the left behind books br br the second problem with the movie is it was just bad bad acting bad special effects bad plot and poor character development i have seen better episodes of miami vice
<START> val kilmer solid performance dylan mcdermott solid performance josh lucas solid performance three very engaging actors giving decent performances the problem is who cares about the plot john holmes infamous for his well <UNK> a drug addict and a guy who despite <UNK> aids continued to make adult films just does not make an intriguing character br br the story <UNK> the events leading up to and the aftermath of a vicious mass murder that occurred in the late 80's in los <UNK> to which holmes was linked arrested and charged with murder and who ultimately was <UNK> just like in the case of o j the guilt factor regardless of the outcome <UNK> quite high in the he did it zone br br there is no one to sympathize with in this film as everyone is a self serving criminal there is just nothing remotely interesting here
<START> this film could have been a silent movie it certainly has the feel of one i was extremely extremely lucky to see this very rare version of this film <UNK> is a <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> all language versions french which is the ultimate romantic language seems quite suitable for this very sensual and lyrical version a young hedy <UNK> lights up the screen in this film which in a way is almost like a sex fantasy but definitely far from being pornographic tech qualities may have been a little crude but that does not detract from the magical spell this film exudes many lovers of early cinema would absolutely adore this film
<START> 'the <UNK> is that extraordinary piece of film making it gets you thinking it pulls no punches and ultimately it leaves you thinking very much open ended as to the lead character's fate anne reid which i only knew briefly from her appearances in some victoria wood led projects and thought a fine <UNK> is truly superb here not the stereotypical widowed housewife that was perfect in marriage and <UNK> at all and not all that free spirited and adventurous at first she plays her character just with the right note that rings true well it did to me powerful cast great script renaissance of european cinema indeed
<START> a realistic depiction of young love for the college set but also appealing to an older viewer like me it has ups and downs and twists and turns and made me shed a tear or two we rarely see movies with black urban characters that could appeal to older non black audiences and show a more real life depiction of young black adults br br this movie takes place on a college campus and town where two people meet and fall in love in the background are various friends <UNK> and situations that impact them for better or worse typical plot some may say but this really was unexpected br br i found myself rooting for the survival of the <UNK> relationship seeing my own past in their story moments of deep thought and revelation came <UNK> out of the actors performances br br it's a bright film that i would <UNK> for those young at heart and in love or have ever been in love great movie i'll be looking for a copy to add to my movie collection
<START> well it's not often that we in the uk have a film made about inner city life from the perspective of the <UNK> <UNK> community the last example that i can remember was the underrated <UNK> way back in 1980 so i had high expectations when i heard about bullet boy a film that has been <UNK> as the british version of la <UNK> well la <UNK> it is not i agree that the use of dialogue and environment gives this film an authenticity that has been missed in other british films of late but my concern is that this film predictably ends sadly br br the film intelligently deals with the <UNK> problem of black on black violence that is sadly all to common in london but i'm concerned that film makers now use type casting in plot as opposed to characters which is equally as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> had a great opportunity to make a film that could be both entertaining and inspirational to us all but sadly missed and created a film that only <UNK> the idea that to be a young black male in london the only future is violence tragedy
<START> i almost saw this at an actual movie theatre an art house theatre no less but couldn't make it there in the one whole week it played but yesterday i finally saw it on cable and well i wasn't disappointed that's for sure madonna has done it again yet another bomb when will this woman learn when will the studios learn or perhaps they already have since this film was largely dumped with little <UNK> and deadly word of mouth one would hope that being directed by her talented husband who's created some interesting and or terribly entertaining work would bring out the same quality madonna showed in desperately seeking susan alas it just isn't meant to be for here she is at her very worst <UNK> convinced of her own greatness the <UNK> <UNK> every frame she's in made all the more unbearable by her <UNK> faux british accent an accent that only <UNK> the fact that her speaking voice is immature in quality and not especially pleasant this may sound unnecessarily cruel but listen to the woman and look at her films of say the past decade like a latter day bette davis there is an <UNK> <UNK> to not only her <UNK> but to her very face and body which here despite the warm photography displayed throughout the film perhaps its only saving grace are done no <UNK> to her credit the entire affair is so <UNK> that one wonders if the world's greatest actress on her best day could do anything with this mess no one involved escapes <UNK> bruce <UNK> actually seems <UNK> to be on screen though poor <UNK> <UNK> seems to carry herself as if she's actually in something good which had me thinking all the while denial ain't just a river in egypt <UNK> <UNK> son of <UNK> <UNK> star of the italian original swept away is like his father before him immensely attractive and isn't altogether bad despite winning a <UNK> nomination for worst actor but like almost everything else about this production it all comes back to madonna on whose shoulders rest the blame why her why not her husband director guy ritchie just who do you think was behind this remake what actress wouldn't want nearly every shot of a movie to be centered on her with only a relative nobody sharing the screen oh sure ritchie deserves some blame surely he or someone anyone should have and could have taken his lead aside and insisted on something <UNK> on actual feeling in her line <UNK> for her performance is so wooden it's a surprise the rest of the cast didn't get <UNK> or at least display a semblance of warmth but she seems <UNK> to be anything but a cinematic black hole above and beyond anything else this is strictly a vanity project for its star so she is ultimately <UNK> for it a film like this an odd couple ish war of the classes should be light and fun with leads who can <UNK> off one another with witty even romantic dialogue for what else can a film whose plot involves two <UNK> people stranded really be honestly i don't think anyone involved knew exactly the tone they were trying for it succeeds neither as comedy i defy you to laugh even once or romance <UNK> ice princess routine <UNK> any chemistry it's not even bad enough for us bad movie lovers to enjoy a real shame
<START> the annoying mouse and <UNK> really got to me and really had nothing to do with the story it's something i would have done my 1st year in film school very sad additionally the story just seemed to drag on for no apparent reason there were too many things just thrown in there that had nothing to do with the story which makes me feel that the creative team didn't really know what they were doing or just that it should have been shorter which would have been a <UNK> not a crime as i have just watched all of the episodes up to this point over the past week i'd have to say that this was by far the worst and i just wanted to warn others not to start with this one
<START> the first five minutes of this movie showed potential after that it went straight from something possibly decent to some sort of <UNK> comedy the best part is that i couldn't stop thinking of <UNK> thanks to joey <UNK> i would recommend watching this movie for the sheer fact of learning how not to make a movie there are so many scenes in this movie that makes one just stop and wonder if the entire cast and crew just stopped caring at some point the thing that <UNK> me most about this movie is that it <UNK> 22 million in the box office and only cost about 1 5 million to make <UNK> to <UNK> gate for being able to pull that one off
<START> one of the best parts of sundance is seeing movies that you would otherwise almost certainly miss unless you're a real art house <UNK> you probably don't catch many documentaries only a handful get any recognizable distribution fortunately sundance has <UNK> its commitment to documentaries in recent years br br shakespeare behind bars is a powerful documentary about a dramatic production group at the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> complex in <UNK> kentucky every year a group of inmates present a shakespearean play director hank <UNK> and his crew follow the <UNK> as roles are self selected interpreted <UNK> and ultimately performed br br the movie is filled with fascinating revelations for those of us that have not been exposed to prison <UNK> despite the <UNK> we know them by convict <UNK> murderer etc we soon began to appreciate and respect these men as thinking feeling human beings <UNK> the play chosen for the year of filming was the <UNK> with its <UNK> focus on forgiveness and redemption the actors all <UNK> with the relevance of the play to their lives finding <UNK> and parallels with their characters and the meaning of the drama br br for a documentary film like a book the best that can be hoped for is that we experience something that changes our lives shakespeare behind bars was a personal revelation for me o brave new world that has such creatures in it
<START> i think the biggest disappointment in this film was that right until the end i expected the acting <UNK> of the cast to break in and apologize for how poor the acting was when you consider the powerful subject the brilliant scenery and the effort made in creating a wonderful set and spectacular images it is a shame that little attention was given to acting br br
<START> i saw this movie with a bunch of friends and although only two of us walked out of the cinema thinking how cool it was the others just laughed and commented on how stupid it was well that was because it isn't supposed to be taken so seriously basically it is a a movie that <UNK> horror flicks and does a damn good job there seems to be another movie coming out like that too <UNK> scary movie well this is aussie and original jessica <UNK> does a <UNK> performance and sarah <UNK> has a <UNK> bright future in acting i hope to see more of them molly <UNK> was a good move and <UNK> was an even better move the impossible princess was queen of the screen i recommend seeing this flick as you'll be guessing until the very end the connection with <UNK> <UNK> and the movie that never got finished 20 years ago
<START> <UNK> <UNK> was rated x with the original release back in 1969 there are some scenes where you can understand that just a little the movie about joe buck jon voight coming from texas to new york city to become a hustler is sometimes a little disturbing dressed up as a cowboy he tries to live as a hustler making money by the act of love it does not work out as he planned after a guy named rico <UNK> rizzo dustin hoffman first pulled a trick on him and stole some money they become friends they live in an empty and very filthy apartment then ratso gets sick and joe has to try to make some money br br the movie was probably rated x for the main subject but on the way we see some strange things the editing in this movie is great we see dream sequences from joe and ratso interrupted by the real world in a nice and sometimes funny way dustin hoffman jon voight and the supporting actors give great performances especially hoffman delivers some fine famous lines the score is done by john barry and sounds great all this makes this a great movie that won the best picture oscar for a good reason
<START> excellent film from <UNK> <UNK> featuring strong performances from a host of british and irish actors the film deals well with a <UNK> subject matter and effectively captures the <UNK> and grim atmosphere of 1970s <UNK> surprisingly realistic it does nothing to <UNK> either side in this conflict on one hand it shows a young catholic father trying to raise his family without getting drawn into the troubles on the other it deals with a <UNK> gang who are intent on <UNK> violence very interesting and thankfully entertaining don't be expecting any laughs though 7 out of 10
<START> this movie has richard <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and others it's a curious ww2 movie and serves as a statement about racism it is worth watching to understand the fact that movies reflect how we feel about the issues when they are produced and not about the period of time they portray meaning this is a 70's movie not a 40's movie ww2 still there is some good action scenes of 7 seven black men led by a white captain trying to capture a <UNK> the story centers on the captain learning that these men are soldiers and not just a service company there is a scene that could be from a civil war movie and not a ww2 movie that reflects what the movie is all about the black lt gives a german women a innocent peck on the cheek and the white capt becomes upset i enjoyed the movie from a curiosity stand point since the stars and the genre were interesting to me
<START> there are some excellent comments and observations on this film i was pleased to note the comparisons to fritz <UNK> m forget the 50's <UNK> remake with lightweight david wayne the real villain is not the tortured murderer extraordinarily fine performance by <UNK> <UNK> taking out his sexually frustrated anger on his victims mostly children he is the objective the real villain is the <UNK> <UNK> soviet system drowning in its own <UNK> incompetence the frustration of an <UNK> dedicated man rea in his best role since the crying game a <UNK> <UNK> who's willing to use the system to his advantage sutherland always successful in this kind of role a <UNK> frightened but determined psychiatrist the <UNK> max <UNK> the bumbling <UNK> <UNK> of a <UNK> brilliant brit actor john wood and the quiet supporting wife of the driven investigator delightful <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this is one damn fine film its darkness and <UNK> are supported by the portrayal of a corrupt incompetent system which works against success the is no need to <UNK> into gore laden slice <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that has <UNK> so many recent films gore is present it's a ghastly story but it adds to the depicting of a <UNK> twisted human being the success of the story is precisely that these were acts <UNK> by a person a human like you or i where you and i choose to <UNK> our frustration by reasonable means <UNK> took his anger out on the most innocent and vulnerable of us our children the superb premise of this story is made <UNK> by an equally superb cast of excellent actors sadly i note that our australian friend didn't like the speech and no doubt would have preferred to hear them speaking in aussie <UNK> well too bad this fine film sure worked for me and everyone else i've talked with who has seen it
<START> with the badly injured tony in an induced coma two things happen tony <UNK> himself leading the life of a salesman attending a business convention while his family and friends go through hell trying to cope with the possible loss of the big man the dream sequences are right out of an old twilight zone episode as tony finds himself transformed into an average joe trying to deal with a missing <UNK> and mixed up identities while on a cross country business trip his <UNK> as a <UNK> and <UNK> wearing <UNK> is more mid american and less that of an italian thug from <UNK> <UNK> a nice touch the shockingly long haired <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> whom paulie calls van <UNK> at one point has a nice scene with his <UNK> old man the best moment has the big boys trying to talk about life without tony which immediately breaks down into a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gets off a line about the new dead gene possibly having been a closet case which is interesting in light of what we are about to learn about <UNK>
<START> a great suspense movie with terrific slow camera work adding to the <UNK> makes this a treat to watch and enjoy director writer brian de palma does a super hitchcock imitation many called it a ripoff with this film and the 2 35 1 widescreen dvd is a must to fully appreciate the camera work and several scenes with people hiding on each side which are lost on <UNK> for tv tapes br br the downside of the movie at least to anyone that has some kind of moral standard is the general <UNK> of all the characters including the policeman played by a pre <UNK> dennis <UNK> who has hair here br br the opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long shower scene of angie dickinson that is quite explicit even 25 years after its release the film has several erotic scenes in it as dickinson if that is really her on the closeups and nancy allen are not shy about showing their bodies br br there is not much dialog in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until <UNK> enters the picture after the murder the first <UNK> minutes are riveting and even though it's apparent who the killer is it's still very good suspense and fun to watch all the way through particularly for males <UNK> the naked women
<START> i was very <UNK> with cinderella 2 and jungle book 2 but this is possibly worse than both titles first of all i didn't like the animation very saturday morning cartoon only worse in some scenes i liked some of the characters namely <UNK> and <UNK> but the other characters like cruella were mediocre cruella was truly villainous in the original but she lost her quality in the sequel what she said was nothing at all to write home about and her animation was kind of ugly also her artist companion lars was a joke to be honest with you and roger seemed to have quit smoking overnight the voice talents were very good though especially barry <UNK> as <UNK> with the exception of <UNK> benson the accent ruined it for me there were some good moments but the whole plot seemed <UNK> for me and highly suggestive of an extended tv episode all in all a hugely disappointing sequel to the most memorable of the 60s disney movies along with jungle book sorry i can only give this a 3 10 it just wasn't my cup of tea <UNK> cox
<START> i am black american and i loved this soap opera i watched it dubbed in spanish on <UNK> almost 5 7 years ago the story was a true story about a black slave who's love affair with a white commander led to her <UNK> and <UNK> whimsical way of living br br a lot of us could learn a lot from <UNK> she took what she had nothing and saw her possibilities many would argue that she sold herself out but she was trying to secure her future and that of her future children br br it was such an excellent soap opera that i thought it would be released on dvd but it's not being released this soap opera was the best soap opera ever we need for it to be released on dvd or broadcast on tv again it's playing on <UNK> america right now which is only available in mexico or in the us by paid cable we need it released again to <UNK>
<START> jim belushi is terrific as the average joe who gets his 15 minutes in the twilight zone michael <UNK> is the mysterious bar tender who not only <UNK> to <UNK> story but has a cure for all of <UNK> middle class problems a magic <UNK> to bring about an <UNK> of changes in <UNK> life br br flashbacks show a 15 year old horribly ashamed of causing his high school baseball <UNK> championship defeat belushi goes on with his pitiful life seemingly happy but always wondering what if for what seems to be several days belushi experiences a different life one of enormous success admired and hated by others in equal measure br br this is not quite it's a wonderful life but some elements are similar and very endearing the ending is predictable but still satisfying watch for a very young <UNK> cox in a bit part as fatal attraction like other woman a very pleasant film
<START> first time i saw this movie was in the eighties but reviewed now this thriller is still actual some newer movies focus on similar topics but they do not match this french <UNK> br br a president obviously <UNK> kennedy gets shot in an open car during a public appearance the resulting huge investigation finds the lee harvey <UNK> figure of this movie guilty but one member of the jury insists in further <UNK> he reveals some surprising evidence br br unlike oliver <UNK> <UNK> a movie with the same plot this one does not play with emotions but concentrates in a exciting description of a conspiracy and how everything fits together drawing a new picture of the assassination even a real psychological experiment is used for this explanation of the crime scene compared to <UNK> this movie is more reasonable intelligent and thrilling parts of the plot can be found in a lot of newer movies i had a kind of <UNK> <UNK> sometimes sitting in the cinema br br i <UNK> <UNK> is a must see its unique and brilliant and the music by <UNK> <UNK> is wonderful this movie deserves a very good <UNK> if it was a hollywood production it would be famous for sure br br
<START> the performances of <UNK> who appears strangely funny somehow and short featured ed harris are remarkable unlike <UNK> who doesn't appear to find sense in his role and ends up in the <UNK> behaviour of a <UNK> old man in fact the screenplay doesn't make sense imagine a 60 min happy ending plot plus a sudden turn <UNK> without any <UNK> structure in respect to the characters it's more an accident than a screenplay and may be good for examination purposes at screen <UNK> schools the more you remind the details the stronger this impression gets the capital punishment is not an issue here although it is a subject from the beginning it sort of fades away without further comment the subject matter and environment could have been good
<START> this review contains spoilers for those who are not aware of the details of the true story on which this movie is based br br the right to be presumed innocent until <UNK> guilty is a basic <UNK> of anyone in a <UNK> society but according to fred <UNK> <UNK> but sadly convincing story of a famous australian murder trial it was not granted to lindy chamberlain accused of killing her baby the story suggesting her innocence was unlikely a <UNK> was alleged to have taken it but those <UNK> her guilt even more so and there was no solid evidence against her but the australian public was <UNK> by the possibility of her guilt and the deeply religious <UNK> appeared creepy when appearing in the media and the media themselves of course were anything but innocent in this process so although <UNK> by an initial <UNK> they were later <UNK> and convicted although chamberlain was eventually released this <UNK> only followed the discovery of new evidence proving their innocence something no <UNK> should have to produce br br 'a cry in the <UNK> is well acted throughout especially by meryl streep who puts on a convincing australian accent at least to this <UNK> ears and manages keep lindy sympathetic to us while still conveying how she managed to become a national hate figure the scenes where she actually gets imprisoned are simple but heartbreaking because we believe in the characters as real br br regardless of the accuracy of its portrayal of this story something i can't comment on the wider theme of this film will ring horribly true to anyone with a passing knowledge of the british popular press and its ruthless habit of appealing directly to their <UNK> least <UNK> instincts no legal system will ever be perfect but the current cry against asylum <UNK> in contemporary british <UNK> comes from exactly the same pit of evil as the voices that put lindy chamberlain away i'm not a religious man but the bible still contains some killer lines if you'll excuse the pun judge not <UNK> <UNK> be judged is one of them
<START> i bought this adaptation because i really liked anne <UNK> novel when i read it some time ago and usually particularly enjoy bbc dramas but i'm very disappointed i never thought it would be as bad as that the whole series made me laugh much more than moved me as the novel had br br first of all the music and songs seems totally out of place in a period drama sounds as if it's been written for a contemporary horror film and like another <UNK> i was particularly annoyed by the way the cameras <UNK> and <UNK> round the actors i've seen some scenes filmed that way in north and south and it seemed all right there but in the tenant it's definitely overdone and simply annoying camera movements cannot make wooden acting lively br br most of the second roles were difficult to <UNK> at first and the script lacked clarity none of the characters were properly introduced at first the little boy gave a very good performance he's very cute and the best feature of the film br br spoilers tara <UNK> characterisation of helen graham made her appear cold and harsh letting no emotion pass through she doesn't seem to be able to cry at all in a realistic way i just couldn't believe <UNK> could have fell for her and i'm not mentioning the awful <UNK> she was given i could not help feeling some sympathy with her husband fancy being married to such a <UNK> besides he was the only main actor that sounded right to me toby <UNK> i found just ok helen <UNK> brother not very good br br maybe it's difficult to adapt a novel that deals with such bleak subjects as alcoholism and cruelty besides what is only hinted at and left to the <UNK> imagination in the book is <UNK> upon with <UNK> in the tv adaptation making some scenes both gross and comic like when <UNK> eye starts bleeding and others far too <UNK> up for a period drama i mean don't we get enough of those bed scenes in contemporary dramas
<START> it seems to be a perfect day for swimming a normal family wants to gain advantage from it and takes a trip to the beach unfortunately it happens that the father is trapped under a <UNK> and neither his wife nor the small son is able to help him out of this whereas the tide is rising the woman barbara stanwyck takes the car and <UNK> for help br br john <UNK> short movie <UNK> minutes is powerful because of unanswered questions stanwyck finds a guy who could help but there is a price she has to pay for this there is a double question the movie poses how far would you go to help the man that you love and on the other hand <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> towards the stranger does she really love her husband like a good short story this movie leaves the viewer to himself with questions he can only answer himself
<START> thank god i watched this at a friend's place and did not pay for it the plot is horribly transparent and the whole movie felt like an episode of a tv show if you have any knowledge of computers or <UNK> watch out you will feel feel like the movie is an insult to your intelligence br br also actress turned much music <UNK> amanda walsh displays the worst acting i have ever seen <UNK> porn she's lucky that matt <UNK> is actually decent he's the one that carries the movie br br i hate that i wasted nearly two hours of my life watching this movie it's a shame that they got to call it a sequel because i was a fan of the original which was actually pretty good
<START> i chose this movie by the cover which was a bad move it wasn't funny at all and the main characters were obnoxious the girl was beautiful but the story and the acting were terrible it had absolutely nothing to do with surfing terrible movie with a surf theme that had nothing to do with surfing and no real surfers catherine zeta jones was beautiful and the movie will probably see a <UNK> just <UNK> she is in the <UNK> now being married with gordon <UNK> and all but if you haven't seen it don't waste your time a bad movie with great surfing real surfers and amazing beautiful cinematography was in god's hands
<START> this film describes the experiences of a couple of hit men one of them burt reynolds a prostitute and two drag queens over the <UNK> of a few hours on one night in miami the <UNK> <UNK> eventually bring all the people together at one place and time the movie was mildly entertaining but the big problem was that everything happens at night and many scenes were literally under exposed to the point that it was impossible to see what was happening in a few scenes you can actually see where they tried to stretch the developing process to save the images somebody didn't know how to operate a movie camera amazing that this film was even released
<START> domestic <UNK> was a great movie i laughed the whole time it was funny on so many levels from the crazy outfits to the hilarious situations the acting was great <UNK> <UNK> larry <UNK> howard <UNK> and all the others did an awesome job because it is an independent film written by a first time writer it doesn't have the clich√©s that are expected of other comedies which was such a relief it was a unique and interesting and you fall in love with the characters and the heart warming story i heard it was based on a true story if so then that is hilarious and amazing i highly recommend this movie
<START> it is so rare that i get to rate a movie without having some <UNK> as to whether i should have gone up one or down one but this one did the explosion rate a notch higher or one down because my brain hurt trying to create a plot no this one yeah a solid no <UNK> one ten
<START> <UNK> of <UNK> is a shockingly dire but worst of all boring action film i don't expect a lot from a seagal film all i expect is to be moderately entertained for 90 or so minutes with some mindless action unfortunately this doesn't even achieve that low expectation the action scenes are few and far between the plot which is totally irrelevant in these films is needlessly complicated and confusing with huge plot holes throughout the acting is truly abysmal <UNK> on embarrassing with seagal and his <UNK> one expression performance being the best among the sorry lot of 3rd <UNK> i find it hard to believe that anything close to <UNK> was spent on this dire mess unless <UNK> of that 12 was <UNK> <UNK> i somehow doubt it the one moment of any interest to straight guys or gay girls is that out of seemingly nowhere two hot chicks end up in a lesbian sex scene of sorts complete with huge <UNK> on display other than that it's mediocre stuff which is no different to many of the michael <UNK> b movies i've endured br br 1 10
<START> i am an avid b rate horror film buff and have viewed my fair share of slasher pictures so i have a substantial <UNK> to judge this film by it easily ranks in the upper <UNK> of the worst horror films the 1980's has to offer it isn't as scary as night of the demons it isn't as gory as re animator and lacks the camp value of there's nothing out there that being said this film has no value keep in mind the movie artwork is for a completely different film the stills shots on the back of the dvd box aren't taken from this film br br violence there is plenty of violence but we've seen it all before a murderer kills <UNK> students and the occasional facility member by <UNK> throats and all the other tired methods of murder that horror films <UNK> br br nudity none br br story the story focuses on <UNK> forbes who wisely changed her name to forbes <UNK> after this film was made who accepts a job teaching at a university people start to die and forbes believes the killer is <UNK> her is it her new <UNK> with a <UNK> past or the <UNK> crazed student to be honest it is impossible to care because the script doesn't flesh out any character outside forbes br br acting terrible on all levels this slasher has the feel of a school production high school that is because college students could make a better flick than this forbes showcases a <UNK> of talent as does <UNK> as one of the students but everyone else is of the extras caliber of acting
<START> alice claire danes and <UNK> kate beckinsale have been best friends since forever and after they graduate they decide to take a trip to thailand due to a incident they meet a young attractive mysterious stranger who invites them to go with him hong kong for the weekend but at the airport alice and <UNK> are mistaken for drug <UNK> heroine and they are sent to prison now it's time for ultimate survival and true friendship this was a pretty good movie i've seen it a couple of times and after a while you notice that they are a few holes in the plot but the movie still keeps you entertained claire danes did a great job as usual she is a great actress i would give <UNK> palace 8 10
<START> by no means a masterpiece and far from errol <UNK> best <UNK> still has much going for it the locations and beautiful <UNK> cinematography bring us back to a time long since past errol flynn does show moments of his past glory and is ok as jim brennan a pilot who's past comes back to haunt him the picture is actually a remake of <UNK> <UNK> and the story seems awfully contrived and <UNK> by today's standards also many of the supporting cast seem to be simply going through the motions in this picture many people have also compared it to one of the all time <UNK> casablanca while watching the film i could see many of the similarities but hey casablanca has inspired countless <UNK> so take that for what it's worth in closing if you are a fan of flynn or old fashioned love stories you might want to give this film a look otherwise i'd recommend casablanca or the <UNK> <UNK> as a good introduction to some of hollywood's classics
<START> refreshing <UNK> gem featuring effective dialog combined with excellent acting to establish the characters and involve you enough to care what happens to them the douglas and widmark characters are realistic heroes palance is his usual evil presence widmark win the <UNK> fight scene a car chase of less than 60 seconds with a <UNK> end and a lengthy chase on foot that <UNK> the overdone chase sequences of contemporary hollywood you know how it will likely end but the suspense and interest are <UNK> throughout the end of the chase is one of the most realistic you will ever see the film seems to slow a little past the middle but stay with it for the rewarding conclusion
<START> i watched the canadian <UNK> of this movie as the <UNK> which somehow made its way to new york state audio was quite bad i had to raise it to about 7 8 just to hear it and the soundtrack often was overwhelming the dialog orson welles was a <UNK> worse than usual and some of his dialog and of others was run through an echo chamber a ghostly figure who keeps <UNK> had her voice distorted some closed <UNK> would really have helped br br a group of witches or <UNK> the end credits say the group was not meant to represent any real group have a ritual in which they get naked and cause a <UNK> by stabbing a doll the woman who had the <UNK> and her husband move to a town named <UNK> where he's been offered a job at a toy factory despite one of the <UNK> of this movie apparently being the toy factory we never see it and it's only occasionally referred to at all br br on the way to <UNK> her husband gets <UNK> with some of her questions about what his new boss mr <UNK> wanted to know about their religious <UNK> he drives <UNK> and causes another car to go off the road and blow up after the police arrive she takes a doll that fell out of the car the second of many <UNK> dolls in the movie br br it turns out mr <UNK> and all the <UNK> are witches and that they are the ones who caused her <UNK> though she doesn't realize it they want her because she has an <UNK> talent for <UNK> of which she was not really aware br br some images in the movie have some impact but on the whole the movie is not very involving the movie does seem a bit of a mess and this is no doubt largely due to its re editing and the addition of new footage the original version according to the end credits was called <UNK> a life for a life the magic of dvd could let us see both versions on one disc but re releasing this movie probably isn't a <UNK>
<START> in my humble opinion this movie did not receive the recognition it deserved robert redford lives near me here in <UNK> <UNK> at sundance i enjoy most of his work and this was my favorite i'm sorry that more people didn't appreciate it my grandmother was an avid reader and read the book years before it came out on the big screen she gave it to me to read after we had seen the movie together the movie and book hit an emotional spot within my heart and i was <UNK> for several days after seeing the movie sometimes love isn't enough to keep our loved ones from hurting themselves we see this in our own family relationships yet our love and our families and their stories endure throughout generations of time the cinematography was perfect and breathtaking i was <UNK> by its beauty and how well it brought to life the words of the author of the book norman <UNK> but when i am alone in the half light of the canyon all existence seems to fade to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the big black foot river and a four count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise eventually all things <UNK> into one and a river runs through it the river was cut by the world's great <UNK> and runs over rocks from the basement of time on some of the rocks are timeless <UNK> under the rocks are the words and some of the words are theirs i am haunted by waters these words taken from the book and spoken at the end of the movie by robert redford who is <UNK> as norman <UNK> are basically <UNK> in my opinion any possible flaws the movie may have are overshadowed by the beauty and grace of the story and the cinematography it was beautiful
<START> you know those films that have you trapped in the cinema you're stuck there in the best seat in the house centre of the row in your own special sweet spot that you <UNK> three times before you got just the right seat and after about what feels like 13 hours you are still trapped there uncomfortable and itchy thinking when the f is this film ever going to end you know the feeling think of a i and the village br br well visitor q delivers a weird <UNK> of that feeling i sat there for the first 30 minutes wondering when the thing was going to f ing start it is interminable so arty it hurts this is the first miike takashi film i have watched apparently he makes films by the dozen and if they are all pretentious w <UNK> like this i suspect it will be the last br br i'm not against pretentious w <UNK> david lynch is up there amongst the top 10 directors for me but visitor q is cut rate cheap and nasty pretentious w <UNK> br br as you may have worked out by now i hated it
<START> this film as low budget as it may be is one of the best psychological thrillers i've ever seen if you accept that it's low budget from the start you can appreciate just how good of a story it is how very well written the script is and how great the filmmaker was to produce something so wonderful with so little money br br all the elements of a great film are here the visuals though shot on digital were gorgeous in places the bizarre dreamy feel of the film is captured particularly well in the scene with the talking dog that scene was just amazing it's such a <UNK> piece of work but not done in a pretentious way and because of that i have a whole lot of respect for this film it comes highly recommended to anyone looking for something unique and captivating and different from much of the repetitive films that are out there
<START> it doesn't even merit a review other than as a warning to potential viewers it's a somewhat generic ghost story about an actress haunting a studio during the filming of a wwii period drama there's no fear involved no suspense whatsoever nor any surprises one shocking moment that looks a bit too silly to be shocking the visual style is very flat and dull although there is some really nice editing once in a while the story never comes together and the films is really just a total bust 4 10
<START> this movie is incredibly realistic and i feel does a great justice to the crime that many people do not understand because of a lack of experience the many people who think they could <UNK> what goes through a <UNK> mind are arrogant as a victim i feel that dawson did a fantastic job in her role of <UNK> i agree that this is an incredibly brave film this looks at rape from a different more realistic standpoint than any other movie i've ever seen on the subject the end did drag on a bit long but i know that many victims imagine this kind of justice since the chances of an <UNK> being sent to jail for their crime is around 1 it's good to see a movie that sticks closer to reality than most would dare to
<START> i watched this film in a very strange way i had put it on my netflix list and couldn't remember why other than that i knew philip seymour hoffman was in it since the film has no opening credits i couldn't even remember who had directed it br br as my wife and i watched it i turned to her about 45 minutes in and said you know i keep wanting to decide that i hate this film but something about it just won't let me stop watching it then there's a stretch of about half a dozen scenes in the middle of the movie that are truly <UNK> in the actors' performances br br it was only as the end credits rolled that i realized it was a sidney lumet film and i thought wow i'm surprised that lumet took on what was really a dirty petty little story about really mean broken people but it's a testament to his talent that i was so taken in when i didn't even realize it was him br br philip seymour hoffman is really really good in this movie like scary good put this up against capote and i would argue the oscar should have been for this film instead br br i also highly recommend the narrative special feature with lumet hawke and hoffman talking about making the movie it's entertaining and educational with hawke playing the student eager to learn at the <UNK> feet lumet definitely teaches you the first rule of working with actors kiss their <UNK> constantly br br there are a lot of violent melodramatic movies out there that are empty <UNK> when all is said and done and there is an element of that in this film that the actors fill the air with <UNK> <UNK> of emotion and when the smoke <UNK> there's nothing left nothing <UNK> on a deeper level br br but lumet has given us network and twelve angry men films that each in their own ways have been <UNK> into the highest <UNK> of cinema br br this movie isn't at that level but there's something about it that <UNK> and maybe that's enough br br my final comment is about the comments if you look at the number of comments about this little movie here on imdb and the depth and intelligence of the comments pro and con it's a pretty good indication that something special is going on with this film
<START> those of you who know the group <UNK> know the lead singer tom <UNK> he directed this movie a bit like he creates music it's a mix of everything this is a comedy though mostly absurd and cynical a drama none of the main characters have a happy life to say the least and it does not really have a goal br br the movie starts on a friday morning in <UNK> <UNK> with scenes of several persons some of them have nothing in common but they will come in contact with each other during the day and night there are several main characters a teacher who writes books nobody reads a young <UNK> with a morbid taste of death and his sister a gallery owner two young men constantly in touch with the law a man who works in a movie theater and two young women throughout the movie there walks a man who has something to do with wind all characters have their troubles with their family or friends or just with life itself br br the movie is set in <UNK> and shows several beautiful shots of the city and the <UNK> the events of the day are not easily explained i advise to simply watch the movie there is simply too much to tell but i can say this <UNK> has an excellent use of the camera and uses a lot of music mostly dance music not really rock to set a mood especially the party is filled with excellent music br br this movie is an experience on itself it will not leave you any <UNK> about life perhaps only that you have to live it and not waste it or have any false moral truths br br in short see it it is definitely worth it
<START> i didn't expect much when i rented this movie and it blew me away if you like good drama good character development that draws you into a character and makes you care about them you'll love this movie br br engrossing
<START> i could not agree less with the rating that was given to this movie and i believe this is a <UNK> of how short minded most of <UNK> are all over the world really are you forgetting that cinema used to be a kind of art before some <UNK> tried to make it only entertainment this movie is not entertainment at least not that easy entertainment you get on movies like titanic or gladiator it has style it is different it is shocking that's why most of you have hated it so much because it does not try to be pleasing to you it's just a story a very weird one i admit but after all only a weird story it is not a great story not even a great cinema work but i believe it is worth a 7 stars rating only for the courage of both author and director to shot a story that is not made to please the audience thus selling <UNK> of copies and making the big studios even <UNK> this movie is for me european artistic like movie made in the us and everyone involved in the making of it deserves respect be it for the courage or be it for the unique sense of humor
<START> as a poker <UNK> i was looking forward to seeing this movie especially as it had <UNK> <UNK> in it br br basically <UNK> <UNK> short spots in this film are all it has going for it br br the characters are unlikeable and annoying the soundtrack is awful and the plot well there isn't one br br i honestly got a headache and found myself reading the <UNK> number on the dvd box after twenty minutes i was that bored its actually <UNK> that <UNK> was in this movie as otherwise i wouldn't have wasted 16 buying it off ebay br br take it from me avoid like 7 2 <UNK> dire
<START> the film looks super on paper a romantic comedy in which a frantic lover gets dragged into a <UNK> thriller should be generic cross <UNK> gold especially with this excellent <UNK> cast br br i'm afraid lawrence <UNK> simply gives his two stars too much rope though and they <UNK> go and hang themselves adam <UNK> script may well be to blame but you'd expect better from the kevin kline of a fish called <UNK> instead the two <UNK> <UNK> off one another and the unlikely <UNK> romance is never <UNK> <UNK> with the reason either of them are in and dashing around france br br jean reno co stars <UNK> as the cop with a heart and i guess wishes he was a star with a part mind you he went on to do those pink <UNK> remake s so perhaps he was ok with this 3 10
<START> this is a very exciting and romantic film i have seen it several times and never get bored with it everything is realistic and it is a good plot the actors are excellent liam neeson jessica lange tim roth and brian cox br br i actually prefer this film to braveheart as braveheart contain so many historical <UNK> there is many exciting scenes watch out for the bridge <UNK> and the last <UNK> scene this is really good and surprising scenes br br the music are lovely it really suits to the movie the setting is amazing
<START> i had quite high hopes for this film even though it got a bad review in the paper i was extremely <UNK> and sat through the entire film i felt quite sick by the end br br although i am not in the least <UNK> or particularly sensitive to tasteless cinema i <UNK> enjoyed both woody allen's <UNK> you ever wanted to know about sex ' and michael <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i found the <UNK> obsession with this ten year old wanting to drink women's milk totally sickening and when the film <UNK> in an orgy where the boy drinks both his mother's milk as well as that of the woman he has been <UNK> after for the whole film i almost <UNK> with disgust for the total <UNK> and sentimental <UNK> that it is br br don't get me wrong i enjoy the vast majority of european cinema as well as <UNK> made films so this flick should have pleased me enormously avoid this film at all costs it should be <UNK> to the <UNK> of history as a lesson in bad cinema
<START> cruel intentions 2 is bloody awful i mean uber bad words can not explain how bad it is but i'll give it a go anyway br br the plot of cruel intentions 2 is very similar to the first film sebastian robin dunne is kicked out of a private school and is forced to move to new york there he decides to make a fresh start and just a life a normal life and settle down unfortunately he has to deal with his step sister kathryn amy adams wants to drag him down <UNK> starts to fall in love <UNK> sarah thompson the innocent daughter of the <UNK> of the school kathryn wants <UNK> to just sleep around with the whole school which had been describe as a <UNK> <UNK> kathryn also wants to get revenge with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> her during the school <UNK> kathryn wanted to make the <UNK> into the biggest slut in the school a similar sub plot to the first film br br cruel intentions 2 is basically a cancelled tv show which was turned into a prequel there are so many problems with the film it is poorly written unfunny and badly acted luckily for amy adams that the show never took off because now she is a fairly big actress whilst cruel intentions had a sense of realism and can been seen to be set in the real world cruel intentions 2 is set in sitcom land and as described on amazon co uk 'a randy version of saved by the <UNK> there were some dark themes involving sex and drug use in the first film but in cruel intentions 2 tried to make it funny and some of the ideas in the film shouldn't be such as kathryn having an affair with a teacher other ideas also don't work such as the secret society where all the popular kids meet to discuss the downfall of other students the film also had a major problem of <UNK> 15 16 years old i know that teenagers do have sex sometimes a lot but when done on film or television is treated very seriously one famous sense was when <UNK> encourages <UNK> who is around 14 15 in the film to <UNK> sex on the back of a horse to the point where she has a <UNK> the idea of turning a girl around 14 15 into a slut is just very wrong with me and shouldn't be made into a subject of comedy the jokes in the film fall flat whether if it's a verbal gag like <UNK> goes all <UNK> when she sees <UNK> to a visual gag where sebastian pushes kathryn face first into mud br br there is a lot wrong with this film which i don't have time to go into but i say it should be avoid just watch cruel intentions whilst not a classic still is a decent film and treats the subject matter well br br this film is just a <UNK> wet dream having school kids having lots of sex with each other
<START> what happens to washed up rock n roll stars in the late 1990's they launch a comeback reunion tour at least that's what the members of strange fruit a fictional 70's stadium rock group do br br tony stephen rea has the <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> machines when he runs into the son of the <UNK> of a famous music festival it was at that festival in the 70's that strange fruit broke up the 70's are retro and the time is right to wide that wave he sets off in search of the other members of the band br br part of what broke up the band was the death and replacement of keith the lead singer and brilliant song writer the band was known for its excessive lifestyle and now they are all back amongst the working class from which they came <UNK> the drummer played by timothy <UNK> who was brilliant in secrets and lies is a <UNK> the bass player is a <UNK> and their lead singer is still a rocker while he owns a huge mansion he has been forced to sell it as his fortune has not lasted brian the lead <UNK> is dead so a young <UNK> is hired to replace him br br somewhat reluctantly the band agree to give the reunion a try <UNK> their day jobs they begin to <UNK> and their manager approaches their label about <UNK> their albums but he wants them to start <UNK> again first and so they hit the club circuit around europe the club scene is not kind to these overweight dated old <UNK> br br it is on tour that the film really starts to develop all of the old conflicts <UNK> with the figures of keith and brian <UNK> throughout they all hang together because they are all in search of a second chance for the greatness that <UNK> them earlier and they <UNK> some of the <UNK> chemistry that made playing together so enjoyable br br still crazy starts as spinal tap ii but gradually becomes a more dramatically focused film following the relationships of the band members while it is still a very funny movie it is the <UNK> characters struggling to deal with the deaths of brian and keith and with their own personal demons that make the film work
<START> i will begin by saying i am very pleased with this climax of the bourne trilogy please oh please don't ruin it by doing a sequel years from now or a prequel just leave it alone right moving on as talented and versatile as matt damon is it seems as though he was just meant to play jason bourne br br if you are a fan of the first two bourne movies you will not be disappointed by the third installment it sticks to what works and adds a little more i was very pleased to see how well all the information we obtain in <UNK> and <UNK> all <UNK> in <UNK> to finally paint the full picture of jason <UNK> troubled past the action sequences are fast paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat the fights between bourne and the <UNK> are always fun to watch i have always been a fan of movies surrounding cia agents and how the cia gather their <UNK> and this movie is right up that street making it even more exciting for me br br if you choose to watch the bourne ultimatum without watching the previous 2 <UNK> you will still thoroughly enjoy the movie but i would still recommend you watch them first this would allow you to fully understand the character jason bourne and become attached and be a part of his world this allows you to appreciate and enjoy the movie even more i'm not sure which is the better of the first 2 but i personally think <UNK> might just might have the edge when comparing the trilogy
<START> spoilers spoilers well seeing as i am a major h lots fan maybe i liked the movie more than normal people would however this movie is still excellent it had tons of surprises and it gave some more closure to the series while i was sad that <UNK> turned into a murderer the overall feeling i felt was satisfied
<START> i bought the dvd of before sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago having saw it twice i couldn't help but missing before sunrise not because the sequel was not as great but i felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did every time i finished watching one of them i feel the need and yearning to see the other so i ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly i will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly the most remarkable thing about before sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other it sounds so simple the growing of the chemistry i think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development but to me who doesn't believe in nora <UNK> before sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it when i saw it for the first time about 8 year ago when i was 20 i already liked it but i didn't rate it as a great film it still seemed to me like another thinking <UNK> feel good movie <UNK> was too smart to make it more realistic it was 10 minutes too long the characters was too well <UNK> i thought i liked it because it was like a dream and because i enjoyed their conversations etc etc but now thanks to before sunset i feel that's more to before sunrise than what i felt for it before i saw the elements more clearly jesse celine vienna their conversations everything how each of them are separated element by itself and they have a chance to mix the story is just a frame of time i am no longer feel manipulated and the freedom that every scene has as well as its <UNK> to be overly efficient how blind i was that those qualities didn't strike me as exceptional when i first saw it now 8 year have passed the more movies i've seen the more i realize that many movies are just <UNK> of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending even movies like pulp fiction or <UNK> own <UNK> included the jesse and celine tale avoid that maybe before sunset is a better example in this case but before sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time not a destination every single scene has its own life i don't know whether <UNK> or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made before sunrise but to me one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other before sunrise which i think employs more static angels and <UNK> color schemes seems to try to capture the smallest <UNK> of <UNK> surrounding jesse and celine the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it meanwhile i enter the vision of boredom as jesse stuck talking to the <UNK> in before sunset and <UNK> first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile i've seen in a beginning of a film and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place i don't know with a sadness in me no matter how beautiful paris is and no matter how happy i am that they meet again i'm sorry that i go on this long with my limited english before sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me <UNK> my scattered thoughts and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it
<START> to my surprise i quite enjoyed <UNK> i remember seeing it about 13 years ago and recently i hired it again i was quite impressed obviously the special effects in todays space films such as <UNK> and deep impact are far superior to those in <UNK> however this film had a story a very stereotypical eighties story where you could almost <UNK> the next line of dialogue before hearing it but thats what i liked about it they don't make films like this anymore so it was a refreshing change it was interesting to see kelly preston <UNK> phoenix and <UNK> <UNK> in early roles with tom <UNK> and kate <UNK> to add substance to the light <UNK> plot absolutely loved the robot named <UNK> it was very cute but it unfortunately had more emotion than some of the main characters the film was almost inspirational in its own way and it was interesting to note that it was filmed at the <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> i think
<START> fairly good movie but not a true story br br <UNK> <UNK> carter was a <UNK> liar a murder and was never found not guilty new jersey state just didn't go for it a third time as 20 years had gone carter got an offer in 1976 pass a lie test and go free he didn't take it this film should never have been made but money talks a lot of people have <UNK> spend their lives in prison and undoubtedly more blacks than white why choose a fake story br br <UNK>
<START> i had the opportunity to preview this film as a member of a test audience and the only thing which kept me in my seat was the chance to fill out the post screening <UNK> i felt the film's biggest problem was its lack of a main plot instead it was composed of too many sub plots competing for screen time as a result there is not a single character who is developed enough for the audience to form any sort of <UNK> what the director and producer failed to do was show us why we should care what happens to the characters in fact any one sub plot and the characters associated with it could have been removed altogether without serious <UNK> to the film the time gained would have allowed for the much needed development of the remaining sub plots and characters simply put the hungry <UNK> <UNK> plate is <UNK> with side <UNK> and <UNK> when an <UNK> is desired
<START> it's amazing that from a good though not wonderful film made back in the early nineties a whole franchise can grow <UNK> <UNK> is without a doubt a worthy addition to the science fiction genre and has the right to stand shoulder to shoulder with <UNK> <UNK> as the kings of sci fi br br following on from the 1994 feature film <UNK> this series sees stargate command a military science <UNK> <UNK> out that the stargate system can be used to travel to various planets across the galaxy and beyond and the military sets up a number of teams to explore <UNK> is one such team headed by military veteran colonel jack o'neill and includes <UNK> doctor daniel jackson military scientist captain samantha carter and alien <UNK> who has betrayed his <UNK> leaders in the hopes of one day <UNK> his people earth quickly makes an enemy of the <UNK> a <UNK> race who use humans as <UNK> and think themselves equal to gods br br the top notch cast have much to be <UNK> for in bringing this show to life richard dean anderson is perfect as the cynical and sarcastic o'neill who can shift from <UNK> to deadly in the blink of an eye michael <UNK> as daniel brings heart and an will of steel to the character who has grown from wide eyed innocence to darker and more hard bitten as the show has progressed amanda <UNK> as carter has <UNK> the balance between depicting her character's <UNK> without <UNK> the fact she is a strong intelligent military scientist christopher judge is excellent as the <UNK> <UNK> who is able to depict the character's emotions with subtlety and don s davis is perfect as the <UNK> general <UNK> who leads with a good balance of fairness and <UNK> br br almost all the episodes are are involving and portrayed with intelligence <UNK> on moral <UNK> as well as the <UNK> between military interests and <UNK> beliefs often shown through arguments between o'neill and jackson guest characters are <UNK> depicted and story <UNK> are handled in a manner that doesn't bore viewers <UNK> also excels in humour from <UNK> <UNK> to episodes that are just wacky and odd <UNK> has everything from action to drama to romance to suspense to the heartbreaking scenes of death it isn't just an excellent sci fi show but is an excellent show overall
<START> i saw this film at the <UNK> island international film festival and was completely blown away the structure and execution of the film was fantastic i know it won't but it really deserves an oscar nod cal and andre were phenomenal as the two disturbed classmates yes the film is very controversial and i can see a lot of people having a lot of problems with it as it deals with school shooting and especially makes you identify with the killers however despite its harsh and blunt subject matter zero day is so worth watching i'm looking forward to it coming out on video so i can buy it it's very very good very powerful and intense the end shooting sequence leaves you speechless because it's almost too realistic their <UNK> the <UNK> the footage and panic of the students totally <UNK> i really hope it gets the attention it deserves it's done in the same format as the blair witch project <UNK> camera made to appear as a true home video documentary kind of film but god is it infinitely better very impressive hats off to everyone involved if you've got the chance you really should see it
<START> some spoilers br br i was pleasantly surprised to find the harsh criticisms acting dated dialogue unclear storyline <UNK> <UNK> is great as a <UNK> menacing swearing spirit who must earn his wings but is realistically ill <UNK> from his past life to do so he learns too late how empty his <UNK> <UNK> life was without love mostel is likewise great as an <UNK> man with his dying wife <UNK> in spite of his <UNK> for a miracle his <UNK> <UNK> him from accepting or believing in one the two social worlds the characters represent alternately <UNK> and <UNK> the other the result being hilarious and <UNK> sad br br the <UNK> ending is actually quite consistent with the rest of the film after looking everywhere for <UNK> mostel looks up to see a falling <UNK> and he <UNK> reaches for it as if he's finally willing to believe in angels and <UNK> but <UNK> wasn't allowed to finish his miracle either to <UNK> <UNK> health or <UNK> faith so he never got his wings the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> out of <UNK> grasp a metaphor for both men's live it's too late and you don't get a second chance like it's a wonderful life this movie is magical wonderful funny but terribly tragic
<START> i hated this show when i was a kid that was back in the day when kids show characters actually had accents not just the bland generic general american <UNK> we're used to jack wild had a british accent and <UNK> was southern like one of the others mentioned though i never quite understood what the deal was with the witch wanting the <UNK> that always seemed odd to me probably because the <UNK> just annoyed me and i wouldn't have gone to any trouble to take it away br br just a comment on the similarity of <UNK> to early 70s <UNK> commercials that others have mentioned <UNK> ripped off <UNK> at the height of <UNK> popularity the tv show or rather their creators sought to license <UNK> characters for their show but when <UNK> <UNK> the tv show changed the characters slightly and passed it as their own they even hired former employees of <UNK> ad agency and the voice actors to make the tv shows <UNK> <UNK> and won search for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and you'll find plenty of <UNK> about it
<START> gypo nolan victor mclaglen is as poor as anyone on earth living in 1920s ireland gypo and his fellow <UNK> are part of an underground rebellion against the oppressive brits one particular rebel wanted for murder by the english arrives back into town secretly he thinks he can trust his friend gypo but the <UNK> reward proves too <UNK> gypo gets his friend killed and sinks into a pit of despair and <UNK> meanwhile the other irish rebels are searching for the informer right away gypo with money burning a hole in his pocket is their main suspect but they who are his friends don't want to believe it the story of the informer is simple in its plot but complex in its moral and emotional issues it's easily one of john ford's most emotionally involving films what gypo did was wrong but we can certainly understand his motives we also understand his sorry character and there's a lot of sympathy that <UNK> for him the script is very suspenseful as well it's the kind of suspense where we are pretty sure we know how everything will end up so we have to <UNK> our teeth and bear along with it the acting is remarkable victor mclaglen who acted in many of ford's films probably gave his best performance here and won an oscar for it every other performer in the film deserves his or her kudos in addition to an amazing script and acting the informer is one of john ford's most <UNK> films i love the darker side of ford in its mood as well as in its themes the informer reminds me of two of my other favorite ford films the long voyage home 1940 and the fugitive 1948 it's also a bit similar to the <UNK> of wrath 1940 in these respects 10 10
<START> horrible film about an old <UNK> painter who hangs around with a young girl boring <UNK> o neil goes through the motions in her part and has some of the <UNK> lines in film history richard burton looks close to death in this film and we're supposed to believe he looks good for sixty the acting is bad as is the plot the characters are awful as is the story it's really hard to feel for anyone in this film except larry <UNK> who plays a guy in a porno theater who hits on <UNK> he's kind of funny this movie is really a waste of time if you are a <UNK> fan like me which is why i rented it in the first place please don't see this movie she is really bad in it and you'll wonder if maybe paper moon was a <UNK> it wasn't because of bad news bears and little <UNK> it's known she can act well but still don't rent this movie and if you're a fan of burton rent something when he was good looking and not a <UNK>
<START> although i am generally a <UNK> of the well made film i do not limit myself to films which escape those boundaries and more often than not i do enjoy and admire films that successfully break the rules and it is quite true that director <UNK> breaks the rules of established cinema but it is also my opinion that he does not break them successfully or to any actual point br br <UNK> work is visually jarring but this is less a matter of what is actually on the screen than how it is filmed and the <UNK> of his films seem less a matter of artistic choice than the result of amateur cinematography this is true of <UNK> <UNK> often preferred to use non actors and while many directors have done so with remarkable result under <UNK> direction his non actors tend to remain non actors this is also true of <UNK> <UNK> quite often includes images designed to shock offend or otherwise <UNK> the audience such elements can often be used with startling effect but in <UNK> hands such elements seldom seem to actually contribute anything to the film this is also true of <UNK> br br i have been given to understand there are many people who like even admire <UNK> films even so i have never actually met any of them and i have never been able to read anything about <UNK> or his works that made the reason for such liking or admiration <UNK> to me judging him from his works alone i am of the opinion that he was essentially an amateurish director who did not break the rules so much by choice as by lack of skill and who was initially <UNK> by the <UNK> of his day for existential <UNK> thereby simply <UNK> him in bad <UNK> as a film maker i find his work tedious unimpressive and pretentious and this too is true of <UNK> it is also sadly true of virtually every <UNK> film it has been my misfortune to endure
<START> the <UNK> <UNK> not the best film that anybody of us have seen but really it¬¥s so funny i <UNK> <UNK> how <UNK> i laughed when i first saw it the director really wanted to do a serious adventure movie but <UNK> <UNK> bad so bad that it¬¥s one of the funniest movies <UNK> ever seen so my advise is that you should see it and if you <UNK> did se it again
<START> this is a very sad movie really nothing happens in this movie the script is bad i guess they've just copy <UNK> the first 15 pages to 90 pages the producers must have thought let's create a hollywood movie here in <UNK> they didn't succeed now in the third week it is only running in <UNK> and <UNK> at <UNK> or something in the past we have had really good movies in <UNK> like <UNK> shades is a waste of your time maybe you could sneak in the theater after you've seen a real movie if you've seen 10 minutes of shades you've seen it all it was advertised to death on local radio and tv i hope it will disappear in the shades soon
<START> after watching awake i led to a conclusion director and screenwriter <UNK> harold made awake with the intention of laughing at the <UNK> for the simple fact the movie is full of ridiculous elements awake has a lot of plot holes and it is full of absurd and ridiculous elements for example the hospital uniform the spirit of the main character uses did the ghost of a doctor leave it in the floor the concept behind this movie is slightly ingenious but all the plot holes and the absurd things make of this a stupid and crappy film with the exception of the great lena <UNK> all the actors bring bad performances hayden christensen has zero expressions and the same applies for jessica alba the extraordinary actor <UNK> howard is enormously wasted on his role awake makes a laugh of the <UNK> it's so ridiculous and full of absurd things that it's impossible to take it seriously my recommendation is skip this crappy movie
<START> having just seen the a perfect spy mini series in one go one can do nothing but <UNK> one's hat a pure masterpiece which compared to the other le <UNK> <UNK> about <UNK> has quite different qualities br br in the <UNK> about <UNK> it is alex <UNK> as <UNK> who steals the show the rest of the actors just support him one can say br br here it is ensemble and story that's important as the lead actor played excellently by peter <UNK> in the final episodes isn't charismatic at all br br <UNK> just plays a guy called <UNK> <UNK> who by lying being <UNK> and telling people what they like to hear is very well liked by everyone big and small the only one who seems to understand his inner self is alex his czech <UNK> br br never have the <UNK> behind a spy and or <UNK> been told better after having followed his life from a very young age we fully understand what it is that makes it possible to turn him into a <UNK> his ability to lie and fake everything is what makes him into 'a perfect <UNK> as his czech <UNK> calls him br br and by following his life we fully understand how difficult it is to get back to the straight and narrow path once you've <UNK> off it he <UNK> on even if he never get anything economic out of it except promotion by his <UNK> spy masters everyone's happy as long as the flow of <UNK> information continues br br <UNK> father played wonderfully by ray <UNK> is a no good con man who always dreams up schemes to con people out of their money in later years it is his son who has to <UNK> him out again and again but by the example set by his dad and uncle who takes over as guardian when his father goes to prison and his mom is sent off to an asylum <UNK> quickly learns early that lying is the way of surviving not telling the truth at first he <UNK> it a bit but quickly learn to tell the right lies and to be constant not changing the stories from time to time that he tell those who want to listen about himself and his dad br br his czech <UNK> alex expertly played by <UNK> <UNK> creates with the help of <UNK> a network of non existing <UNK> which supplies the british <UNK> with fake information for years and years just as the british did with the german spies that were active in the uk before and during the war they kept on sending fake information to <UNK> <UNK> long after the agents themselves had been turned <UNK> or simply been replaced by <UNK> men br br the young <UNK> who play <UNK> in younger years does it wonderfully and most of them are more charismatic than the older little more <UNK> and tired <UNK> played by <UNK> but you buy the difference easily as that is often the way we change through life from enthusiasm to sorrow or indifference br br indeed well worth the money
<START> i saw fever pitch sort of by accident it was playing on the airplane going over to europe it actually wasn't half bad ben jimmy fallon is the world's 1 red sox fan but his relationship with lindsay <UNK> drew barrymore may strain that the movie is a fairly interesting look at how world events can affect <UNK> relationships it's especially eye opening now that the red sox have ended their 80 odd year losing streak i guess that these sorts of things happen all the time and we just don't tend to notice them not too bad br br another movie portraying an unusual relation to baseball is <UNK> <UNK> check them both out
<START> <UNK> <UNK> or how the film was wrongly translated into english love me if you dare is a film made by stupid people and about stupid people i just don't know how i could expect something worth a look from a film with such plot two stupid ignorant kids make a bet that each of them will do something certainly extremely idiotic to prove to each other wtf that they are cool <UNK> i know that i exaggerated some aspects but that is what the entire film is about they grow older and instead of realizing that they are just a couple of <UNK> <UNK> continue to perform their crazy things thinking that they are great people br br one could expect such a film from hollywood but france it is even more offensive to watch the film from the country which created <UNK> a couple of years ago which btw the film tries to look like but is far extremely far away from br br avoid avoid avoid
<START> deeply humorous yet honest comedy about a bunch of <UNK> bill paxton julie warner kevin <UNK> elizabeth <UNK> vincent <UNK> matt craven and diane lane who are invited back to spend a week to <UNK> a camp in <UNK> canada by their former <UNK> alan arkin writer director mike <UNK> drew upon his experience at the same camp as the main source of creating a gentle and understanding yarn that makes sense also the movie has plenty of funny moments some of which are completely bizarre like my favorite the one involves using <UNK> tape <UNK> thomas <UNK> the usual suspects three kings provides the film with some impressive shots of the canadian wilderness among the cast sam <UNK> director of the evil dead films and the gift appears here as <UNK> bumbling right hand man one more thing this film <UNK> me that a camp doesn't have to be a site of bloody murders
<START> star rating <UNK> very good okay you could go out for a meal instead avoid at all costs br br stuck up career bitch kate <UNK> <UNK> heads to the london underground to catch a train to take her to meet george clooney however after a <UNK> working day she <UNK> off and <UNK> to find herself alone in a deserted platform as she races off on a situation taking her from one <UNK> encounter to the next however she learns of something far more <UNK> and evil waiting for her out there br br in a lot of ways the british film industry is really becoming one on it's own especially in the horror thriller department with films such as creep and the successful 28 days later which this has strong echoes of in parts in terms of <UNK> in what it set out to do creep does cleverly create especially at the beginning a scary sense of isolation and tense fear at it's clever running time it also though inadvertently i suspect manages to pay homage to some of those <UNK> high concept horror films from the 70s that rely on shocks and fear through out without really focusing too much on character development and such br br of it's weaknesses some scenes are a little predictable but these don't really succeed in making it less scary or effective in any way i'm not sure if the ending was meant to make it come off as some sort of morality play and it's not exactly perfect but it's certainly very effective and serves it's basic function very well
<START> this is a brilliant sci fi movie that is very strange in how men and women both view the same film i have talked to many people about the film and almost every guy loved it and said it was brilliant while most women thought it was just disgusting and stupid this is the only movie i know of that has such <UNK> views based on gender perhaps many women just have a lower tolerance for disgusting or depressing plots but whatever the cause i have always found this difference fascinating br br the film begins with a murder and a subsequent investigation headed by charlton heston this is set in the near future and the head of the huge international soylent corporation has been <UNK> as the film unfolds you quickly realize this is a terrible and highly <UNK> future american society the rich live in gorgeous apartments with security and all the pleasures money can buy including furniture a <UNK> for paid <UNK> that come along with the apartment at the same time the masses are dirt poor unemployed and in many cases living in abandoned cars or apartment <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> have taken a severe <UNK> and the future looks awful indeed br br why the rich man died and the awful truth he could not live with i really should not discuss it could ruin the film for you however the film has a great plot and acting and is super exciting to watch plus it features edward g robinson in his final screen performance as the <UNK> sidekick to heston though not for the easily depressed or <UNK> this is a great sci fi film that is <UNK> and profound
<START> rock <UNK> roll high school was one of the best movies ever made i think the only reason it was so awesome was because of the ramones you couldn't have made the same movie and put something like the sex <UNK> or the clash in place of the ramones it just wouldn't have been the same <UNK> young clint howard vincent van <UNK> mary <UNK> paul <UNK> and the hall <UNK> just added to the movie the whole entire movie is about the ramones especially joey so everybody showed see rock <UNK> roll high school if your a huge fan of real punk not the sissy new crap but the loud and fast kind the kind only the ramones could do r i p rest in peace joey <UNK> 1951 2001 dee dee <UNK> <UNK> 2002
<START> when i read most of the other comments i felt they were way too glowing for this movie i found it had completely lost the spark found in the earlier zatoichi movies and just goes to prove that after a long absence from the screen it's often best to just let things be i completely agreed with the star trek <UNK> from another reviewer who compared the first star trek movie to the original series millions of excited fans were waiting and waiting and waiting for the return of the show and were forced to watch a bland and <UNK> <UNK> of the original br br the plot is at times incomprehensible it is terribly gory though the recent new zatoichi by beat <UNK> is much <UNK> and lacks the heart of the originals i didn't mind the blood at all but some may be turned off by it particularly the scenes with the severed nose and the severed heads in addition time has not been good to <UNK> he seems a broken and sad man in this film much much more than usual and that's something fans of the series may not really want to see br br this was a very sorry return for zatoichi unless you are like me and want to see every zatoichi film this one is very <UNK> see one of the earlier versions or the 2003 all new version
<START> in cold blood is masterfully directed and adapted by richard brooks however it's also so bent on being realistic it's sometimes more <UNK> than entertaining <UNK> the brutal killing of a <UNK> family author truman capote focused on <UNK> <UNK> himself and the reader up in the subject and subjects brooks <UNK> wildly from that approach in favor of something closer to <UNK> although he films on actual locations he keeps his distance the murderers are portrayed as <UNK> <UNK> which surely they were they're not seen as misunderstood souls as in the capote book and the <UNK> of their act is <UNK> blunt scott wilson and robert blake are excellent as the killers as is the supporting cast including john forsythe and paul stewart as the reporter the capote character the landmark photography is by the great conrad hall
<START> 1 out of 10 br br this is the kind of movie that you cant believe you just wasted 2 hours of your life as you see the credits role i honestly think i could make a better vampire movie and i know nothing the only thing that does not just suck harder than a vampire is jason scott lee his character is at least a little bit cool has some mystery and kicks a little butt
<START> please someone stop ben stiller from acting in any movie write the studios hell write your local <UNK> even i've gotten more laughs going to a funeral then i have watching any stiller flick jack black tries to make something about a comedy about disappearing dog crap and christopher walken perhaps on of the greatest actors of his generation simply looks embarrassed to be there stiller is his unfunny self but now even with someone to <UNK> him out proves that he is way overrated as a comic it's no wonder why this movie <UNK> badly and was available of the dollar movie theaters after only a handful of weeks i warn you and you must warn your friends do not watch this flick it is just awful worst then <UNK> personally i'd never thought i'd say that worst the plan 9 worst the <UNK> worst then the golden child please hollywood quit allowing ben stiller in your movies he's not funny he's a god awful actor and he's bringing others down with him the following film was <UNK> 1 because there are no negative scores allowed so while the board says one i'll give it a zero
<START> ironically for a play <UNK> on film or video for so long arms and the man has remained fairly constantly available on stage over the years since its debut in <UNK> in no small part because it has aged so well as a solid satire on the nature of <UNK> and the business of war whenever the world sinks into <UNK> arms and the man seems to <UNK> as ever more <UNK> and relevant br br this is the play which oscar <UNK> converted leaving out most of <UNK> best ideas into the successful <UNK> the chocolate soldier when hollywood got to that they left out the last <UNK> of shaw rather than pay him for the rights he was by then an oscar winner in his own right while the best of shaw has always been his ideas and his dialogue rather than his bare plots in arms and the man the plot <UNK> as well and the master manages happy endings for all concerned br br young <UNK> helena bonham carter daughter of an officer and the <UNK> man in her town is <UNK> to a dashing officer in the <UNK> <UNK> and all seems well until a <UNK> swiss <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from the other side climbs up her <UNK> fleeing from the battle where his army has been <UNK> as usual in a shaw satire nothing is as it first appears and societal conventions are stood on their head in the light of simple and not so simple reason there are no good guys or bad guys just people of a variety of classes getting by on the best of their wits just like life only better and naturally with shaw the wit is finely <UNK> from all concerned br br the early 1932 motion picture version from <UNK> own screenplay of this most traditional and <UNK> funny of <UNK> stage <UNK> and one of his first to make a real hit on this side of the atlantic has long been among the missing shaw didn't sell the screen rights to his plays only <UNK> them for 5 year periods and it appeared that with rapidly <UNK> sound technology making 1932 films look primitive only a few years later shaw did not <UNK> the license to show it consequently we're immensely in the <UNK> debt for finally putting out their 1987 broadcast version in a dvd box with nine other <UNK> plays somewhat sadly <UNK> that many view as <UNK> best comes off least well on this set in a production with <UNK> redgrave and james <UNK> br br even paired as it is on its dvd with the less impressive one act a man of destiny arms and the man makes for a real treasure br br helena bonham carter went on after cutting her teeth on <UNK> roles like this to a major film career that will bring many viewers to this early role they should not be disappointed for ms carter gives a performance in line with the layered innocence audiences have come to expect from her but under james <UNK> jones' somewhat pedestrian direction and despite the <UNK> uniformly beautiful and well observed physical production the <UNK> mischievous fire and her outrage at being <UNK> in the last act is <UNK> at only about 80 of it's potential br br much the same can be said of the real star of the piece <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> the <UNK> it's a fine appealing performance but doesn't go for the physical comedy <UNK> in the early scene where the young soldier can barely stay awake despite his mortal peril br br these <UNK> notwithstanding this is a solid production of a wonderful play transferred to the small screen with <UNK> it deserves to be seen widely and <UNK> <UNK> an even <UNK> big screen remake with the style and <UNK> of the recent remake of <UNK> an ideal husband virtually any arms and the man is to be <UNK> and with a lot of luck perhaps we'll even eventually get to see the original 1932 version <UNK> one or the other <UNK> this production will please anyone who loves good shaw
<START> the shop around the corner is one of the <UNK> and most feel good romantic comedies ever made there's just no getting around that and it's hard to actually put one's feeling for this film into words it's not one of those films that tries too hard nor does it come up with the <UNK> possible scenarios to get the two protagonists together in the end in fact all its charm is <UNK> contained within the characters and the setting and the plot which is highly believable to boot it's easy to think that such a love story as beautiful as any other ever told could happen to you a feeling you don't often get from other romantic comedies however sweet and heart warming they may be br br alfred <UNK> james stewart and clara novak margaret <UNK> don't have the most <UNK> of first <UNK> when she arrives in the shop <UNK> co he's been working in for the past nine years asking for a job they clash from the very beginning mostly over a cigarette box that plays music when it's opened he thinks it's a ludicrous idea she makes one big sell of it and gets hired their <UNK> takes them through the next six months even as they both <UNK> of course fall in love with each other when they share their souls and minds in letters passed through <UNK> box <UNK> this would be a pretty thin <UNK> to base an entire film on except that the shop around the corner is expertly fleshed out with a brilliant supporting cast made up of entirely engaging characters from the <UNK> but lonely hugo <UNK> frank morgan himself who learns that his shop really is his home <UNK> felix <UNK> <UNK> sidekick and friend who always <UNK> out of the room when faced with the possibility of being asked for his honest opinion smarmy <UNK> du <UNK> <UNK> joseph <UNK> who ultimately gets his <UNK> from a <UNK> righteous <UNK> and ambitious <UNK> boy <UNK> <UNK> william tracy who wants nothing more than to be promoted to the position of clerk for <UNK> co the <UNK> love story between <UNK> <UNK> is played out in this little shop in <UNK> <UNK> in which <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and subsequent promotion to shop manager help the two <UNK> to be along it's nice that everyone gets a story in this film the supporting characters are well developed and <UNK> own journey in life is almost as touching as the one alfred and clara share his <UNK> to new <UNK> boy <UNK> charles smith for christmas eve dinner made in the <UNK> beautiful snow of a hungarian winter makes the audience glad that he is not alone we come to care even for the characters whose love story it isn't this film's business to tell br br aside from the love story i must say that james stewart is truly one of the best things about this film he doesn't play the full <UNK> jimmy stewart persona in this film c f <UNK> smith goes to <UNK> for that in fact alfred <UNK> is <UNK> and abrupt and not particularly kind he's rather a <UNK> man in fact with little hint until perhaps the very end of the <UNK> <UNK> down home <UNK> charm stewart would soon come to <UNK> when he finds out before clara that they have been <UNK> in secret in fact <UNK> doesn't <UNK> up he waits it out to see how far he can take the <UNK> especially since he quickly realises given his <UNK> relationship with clara as boss and <UNK> that loving the person he knows through the <UNK> letters might not <UNK> with loving the person herself his description to clara of the fictional <UNK> <UNK> what a name who was to become her <UNK> is hilarious in the extreme but also his way of proving that the letters don't reveal all there is to a man just as her letters don't reveal all there is to her stewart plays this role perfectly he keeps his face perfectly controlled whenever clara insults mr <UNK> as she is often wont to do even and especially to his face and yet one believes underneath the <UNK> and <UNK> that he could reveal his identity with as much <UNK> and sincerity and sheer hope as he eventually does br br special mention must be given to the other members of the cast as well margaret <UNK> <UNK> rather less well in the first half of the film but she really comes into her own in the closing shop scene on christmas eve when she almost gets her heart broken again by <UNK> most vivid description of her <UNK> sweetheart frank morgan turns in a great performance as the jealous hugo <UNK> driven to nervous breakdown the man who has to <UNK> his meaning in life when he realises that his wife of 22 years does not want to <UNK> old with <UNK> and felix <UNK> plays the role of the meek but loyal <UNK> wonderfully a lubitsch regular since he appears as a hilarious russian <UNK> in <UNK> of particular note is the scene in which he helps his good friend alfred get the christmas present the latter really wants a <UNK> instead of that ludicrous cigarette box clara is so hung up on br br <UNK> lubitsch really does himself proud with this film for example the <UNK> lavish and <UNK> care given to detail in the creation of the <UNK> shop is well worth the effort right down to the hungarian names on the door the <UNK> and the cash register and so on but even though lubitsch chose to have the story set in <UNK> the setting is actually universal it could happen anywhere it could happen to you <UNK> lies the charm of this simple story these believable characters who really are people the snow on christmas eve is real as well or at least as real as lubitsch could make it he had snow machines brought in at great expense it is this desire to make everything appear as real as possible that helps make the story even more believable that gives this entire film a dreamy realism that cannot be <UNK> no not even in a remake like you've got mail br br this is really the jimmy stewart christmas film that people are missing out on when they talk about it's a wonderful life not to detract from the merits of that other film but <UNK> be no harm and in fact a lot of good done in watching the shop around the corner this christmas instead it's sweet funny charming and stewart is impeccable in his role we should all be so lucky as to have the romance depicted in this film the best thing about this film is that we come away from it feeling that we very possibly could
<START> i recently bought the dvd forgetting just how much i hated the movie version of a chorus line every change the director attenborough made to the story failed br br by making the director cassie relationship so prominent the entire ensemble premise of the musical <UNK> out the window br br some of the musical numbers are <UNK> up and rushed the show's hit song gets the entire meaning <UNK> when it is given to <UNK> character br br the overall staging is very self conscious br br the only reason i give it a 2 is because a few of the great numbers are still able to be enjoyed despite the film's attempt to squeeze every bit of joy and <UNK> out of it
<START> not sure if it was right or wrong but i read thru the other comments before watching the short i have to say i disagree with most of the negative comments or problems people have had with it br br as a first time lone wolf director producer i like to see things that i can <UNK> to not necessarily from the <UNK> but by people just getting their feet wet like me br br if indeed this is also from a first <UNK> as i read i applaud the effort marvelous job then in that respect there were some comments about the music i thought it was quite nice for the piece some say it kind of <UNK> along for a while but i found that created tension without us necessarily being conscious of it and when he pulled the gun out and the guitar started <UNK> <UNK> it was like we knew there was a train on the tracks but realize it is just now moving yes there is a <UNK> degree slip clip in there but <UNK> happens did anyone else see <UNK> dirty shirt turn white near the end in the rain in australia look how much money and people were behind that movie give the kid a break for gods sake all in all i think it was very well done only 2 things i would have mentioned are hardly worth mentioning don't walk up to a shiny <UNK> picture frame with the camera and i would have just displayed the splatter at the beginning shots to a still shot so people wouldn't necessarily know what it is br br my experience so far has taught me that it's not that it's hard to make a movie it just takes time to learn how to do it then the time to actually do it and then you better take some more time still to think of all the details you'll need to have shot before you call post production time imho it looks like director writer ryan <UNK> did his <UNK> and if this indeed is his first report card i'd give him an a the rest of you report to the principals office for a <UNK>
<START> this is one of the best made movies from 2002 maybe it is not the best movie but it looks the best has great acting and is directed perfectly by sam <UNK> who <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> br br it tells the story of a gangster named michael sullivan tom hanks who is seen by his son tyler <UNK> on one of his jobs michael's boss john rooney paul newman thinks things will be okay but his jealous son connor rooney daniel craig sets both his father and michael up leading to the death of michael's wife jennifer jason leigh and second son michael thinks rooney is responsible and rooney has to choose for himself and sends a hit man <UNK> maguire jude law to finish the job since michael is a respected man within the organization he tries to win some friends who can help him including mob boss frank <UNK> stanley <UNK> br br in a way <UNK> to <UNK> is a standard gangster movie but it is so well made you almost can not see that this movie is good in its production design art direction sound music and most of all in its cinematography all these elements are able to surprise and create suspense although the outcome is pretty certain that <UNK> is not a annoying kid and hanks law and newman know how to act helps of course br br based on a comic this movie is so much better than you would expect and although it has it flaws it belongs to the better movies in the genre sometimes there are events where you realize you have seen it so many times before but for some reason it also feels fresh at the same time the scenes between the adult hanks and the child <UNK> help in that area see this movie that will look familiar at times but is totally new on a lot of areas
<START> i saw jack frost for <UNK> 00 at my local store and i thought it looks pretty good for a low budget movie so i bought it and i was right it was good for starters this film is about a killer snowman so that's something to laugh about and the way it looks was funny compared to the snowman on the cover br br the acting was okay and the lines jack frost said had me laughing i only <UNK> you for a smoke and worlds most <UNK> ed off snow <UNK> how funny and camp is that the tale at the start was pretty funny and silly too jack be <UNK> jack be quick jack <UNK> eyes with candle sticks if you're looking for a for a b movie comedy horror that's full of <UNK> then check jack frost out 10 10
<START> elephant walk was a thoroughly dull film and i really was quite happy when finally a herd of elephants <UNK> through the mansion and ended this film considering the money and cast you'd sure expect the film to be a lot better though i also question the odd casting of dana andrews as a man who is in love with elizabeth taylor it's not just the age difference but i just can't see the pair as a couple perhaps some of this may be the fault of <UNK> miss taylor for vivian leigh at the last minute due to miss <UNK> <UNK> mental condition though i also have a hard time <UNK> andrews and leigh as well in addition for an english woman miss taylor doesn't even seem to try using an accent br br the film begins with peter <UNK> and taylor meeting and marrying in england their plan is to return to <UNK> tea plantation in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and at first it seems like a good life however there are no women to talk with and the household staff seem to <UNK> her on top of that once back home <UNK> behaves like a <UNK> jerk and taylor is miserable neighbor andrews can see this and he declares his <UNK> passion for her however taylor isn't yet ready to abandon her marriage but through the course of the film <UNK> treats liz more and more like an object and finally she is ready to leave when out of the blue <UNK> strikes the plantation so it's up to andrews <UNK> and taylor to work together to save the day though by this point i really didn't care as there is absolutely no chemistry between the characters the dialog is pretty dull and you can't understand why taylor didn't leave her <UNK> husband within days of arriving in this <UNK> hell br br the film isn't particularly engaging or convincing and despite a decent budget by paramount the film is a <UNK> mess i particularly was surprised that although the film appeared to be filmed on location many scenes were clearly filmed in a studio with a rear projected and grainy shot that wasn't integrated well in one scene for instance taylor <UNK> and the lot are sitting on the <UNK> and the grass is bright green then when the picture cuts to people dancing right in front of them the grass is brown it's clear they really are not in <UNK> in this scene or the scene with the giant <UNK> <UNK> my advice is to skip this one or at least keep a pot of coffee nearby to keep you awake despite its budget it's just not a very good or inspired film br br by the way could miss taylor have been pregnant during part of this film in some scenes particularly at the beginning she's wearing <UNK> clothes has a double <UNK> and looks <UNK> this isn't a criticism after all women do get pregnant but if you look carefully you'll see what i mean br br also by the way the basic plot in many ways is similar to giant a great taylor film indeed it's amazing how casting and decent direction can do so much
<START> this series was cbs networks answer to the success of the big valley it was a 90 minute western just like the abc program was while it was an answer it did not have the stuff to make it past season 2 br br the problem really became reality got lost on this show for example in one episode johnny gets his eye <UNK> out by a stick amazingly by the end of the show johnny had <UNK> entirely along with that the stories on this were no where near as strong as the big valley br br this is a show that i would not want dvds of frankly hope they are never released think since cbs was running out of lots they re used many familiar settings this was one the last western series cbs produced as westerns were not real popular in the 1970's
<START> oh my god this movie insults the intelligence of everybody i mean really who thinks three kids can fight 30 to 40 ninjas and win not to mention the brainless humor thrown in this film is <UNK> the movie is an omen the only thing it's good for is a time killer or unintentional laughs
<START> in this strangely <UNK> apocalypse the world suffers from a <UNK> plague of zombies and vampires but no one seems to be too worried about it in this grade z film which <UNK> less resemblance to sheridan le <UNK> famous short novel than my mother's <UNK> recipe bored <UNK> still run gas stations and doctors still make house calls and helpful police officers still show up with <UNK> fluid just when you need it the plot and i use that term loosely involves a father and a daughter trying to <UNK> with the general whose daughter is missing at a church to kill a vampire who very conveniently happens to be traveling with the father and daughter i must confess that a moment or two of genuine humor can be found between vast stretches of unintentional humor the film also boasts just enough nudity to keep a boy of <UNK> interested anyone older beware
<START> <UNK> <UNK> attempted a plot to lead up to a chase finale in <UNK> to god's <UNK> of the previous year and she failed miserably this time she does better although it seems pointless <UNK> <UNK> hardly has a plot lying outside of the chase there's a brief premise which sets up the hero co author and <UNK> boyfriend to have to save the girl played by <UNK> then it's nothing but an exciting implausible chase from there of course it plays out like an hour long <UNK> for a <UNK> <UNK> but the entire movie is <UNK> ridiculous it doesn't seem that she learned much from the last minute rescue films of d w griffith or its parodies by mack <UNK> and other comedians which she's imitating br br one point of interest is that <UNK> writes and directs herself into the film as the writer of the film's story which has as its protagonist a writer <UNK> again although she doesn't do much else clever or humorous with it even though she attempts to again others had <UNK> the writer's joke in the <UNK> like anita <UNK> with <UNK> and <UNK> or frances marion with 'a girl's <UNK> both <UNK> at least <UNK> gives the impression that she doesn't take herself or the film seriously and neither do i <UNK> new ' despite its claim is hackneyed
<START> maybe you shouldn't compare but wild style and style wars are original hip hop beat street does have a lot of the original artists of early hip hop but they've been obviously made clear that this could be their big break of course for some it was and that's nice but if you view this as original hip hop culture you're wrong it's <UNK> and has a hollywood <UNK> rather look for the first two movies i mentioned they have convey the <UNK> that comes with life in the ghetto yes the rating for this movie is low but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving this is probably because although the story the acting the dialogues and the direction all are dreadful the music and dancing is what the people love about it me i do love the dancing but at the time thought that <UNK> was the death of hip hop i was so glad when round <UNK> a new generation of now classic hip hop artists appeared like <UNK> one public enemy <UNK> <UNK> jungle brothers <UNK> to name a few and i still don't like most of the beats in this movie and that is why it doesn't work for me i mean wild style has not much of a story but the music there is great and authentic of course tastes <UNK> and that's alright but as far as i'm concerned this movie is trash except for the break dancing and some of the music and so i can't rate it higher than a 4 out of ten
<START> from the star of mitchell from the director of <UNK> and <UNK> revenge these are <UNK> that would normally keep me from seeing this movie and the worst part is that all the above mentioned statements are true <UNK> joe don baker eats every other five minutes in this film it's like a bad remake of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the 1960's tv series <UNK> owes it's idea from this movie this is the movie that jimmy stewart kim novak made right after they were cast together in vertigo by alfred hitchcock this one is not as obsessive as that one but novak is just as captivating br br this was jack <UNK> <UNK> movie and he is good in support here as well as ernie <UNK> the movie has a lot of good things about it <UNK> <UNK> is very good in this movie almost as good in support here as she was in the music man the cast is very solid br br this movie has a late 1950's new york city feel a cat that is as <UNK> as any <UNK> in any movie it is well worth watching as it is a love story with all the emotion of any a little magic too boot br br it is not vertigo but i think because it followed that movie viewers then did not rate it as good as it deserved sure am glad that william <UNK> saw it so that the 1960's series got created i am not so glad about what will ferrell did to it on the big screen this movie is much better than that
