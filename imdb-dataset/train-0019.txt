<START> well vivah is quite a good but typical <UNK> <UNK> movie it shows different aspects of indian families wedding <UNK> etc the movie is more than good but not extremely good br br the big plus point of the movie is direction music and shahid and <UNK> acting especially the last scene the movie starts with a common factor of indian movie a girl being disliked by her step mother story is the movie is a bit common but it is good good enough to make the movie a blockbuster br br minus point is common story of bollywood movie overall i would say it is two times must watch movie if you want to see typical indian family values and of course love
<START> ok so i just saw the movie although it appeared last year i thought that it was generally a decent movie except for the storyline which was stupid and horrible first of all we never get to know anything about the creatures why they appeared wtf are they doing in our world and really have they been on earth before we were or did they just come from space secondly the role of the butcher to maintain order is just so obviously created really how large could the underground for a sub station could have been there were only so many of those creatures so i think instead of killing innocent people in vain they could have just planted some <UNK> bombs or maybe clear the are and a <UNK> would have done the job i know it sounds funny and it is but i do not see the killing of people as being necessary <UNK> leon acts like superman jumping on the train and fighting <UNK> jones who was way <UNK> and bigger in stature then again when he faces the conductor he does nothing and acts as a <UNK> watching all the <UNK> i mean ok the conductor had creepy help lol but if leon was so brave he would have gone all the way i mean he risks his life first then does nothing exactly when he should have he could have died as a hero but lives as a coward this might be the case but not after showing so much <UNK> earlier on then the cop thing come on this was a city having a subway i bet there must have been other cops except that lady other police stations this was really kind of silly all in all great acting by <UNK> jones interesting idea up to the reason behind it which is not really built at all by the way what did the signs on the chest mean <UNK> jones cannot make up for the rest
<START> horror is perhaps one of two genres where logic doesn't always win out over imagination we all know that killers like freddy jason michael and even <UNK> shouldn't be able to sustain the amount of pain they do and still live to fight another day most of us don't believe that zombies really rise from the dead to stalk people and eat their brains and let's hope that at least some people know that when you enter places like <UNK> and old <UNK> that <UNK> crimes are not going to be <UNK> against them this is where imagination wins out over fact horror and most films in general requires us to suspend our disbelief for a couple of hours and just go with the flow this usually isn't a problem when i watch <UNK> balls being <UNK> down the stairs at george c scott or when i see an unseen force stalking three amateur film makers in the woods near <UNK> but what i do have a problem <UNK> without wanting to <UNK> is when a film has a killer like the one in this film to give away who the killer is would actually be a huge spoiler and it would take away all fun of watching it for yourself but just suffice to say that i actually enjoyed this film right up to final scene when the killer is revealed there are too many events in the film that <UNK> for it to make any sense that the killer is who it is but the 90 minutes prior to this point is a well done suspenseful blood <UNK> film directed with <UNK> and skill by john <UNK> if the film would have offered me a different killer then i would actually be raving about it this may sound like a completely <UNK> reason to <UNK> the film but believe me anyone who has seen the film is almost sure to agree with me br br john <UNK> plays dr sam <UNK> he and his daughter jenny played beautifully by <UNK> <UNK> have just recently moved to this small new england town <UNK> is a recent widow and it is unclear how his wife died we see several flashback scenes where a mystery woman one can only presume it is his wife is laying <UNK> on the ground during a <UNK> <UNK> her face is <UNK> and her eyes are closed again i am not sure who this woman is and what relevance she has to the story but she is there anyway <UNK> it has to be mentioned is strange to say the least <UNK> is a loving father but his love for his daughter seems to be a little more than just <UNK> there are a few scenes that hint of incestuous possibilities it never comes to <UNK> but it just seems to be <UNK> but somewhere just beneath the proverbial <UNK> thankfully the film never really explores this element of the relationship but it does make you a little uneasy br br <UNK> seems like a cross between the porno actor john leslie and screen great james <UNK> he has a <UNK> smile and a <UNK> commanding voice that makes you sit up and take notice but he also looks like he is about to <UNK> during a business <UNK> in every scene he just has that slimy <UNK> <UNK> uneasy way about him he never really looks like he can be trusted in this film i guess that is a credit to the writers the director and to <UNK> himself there was always something that just bothered me about his character from the get go br br the story begins on an excellent note as two would be lovers are swimming in the local <UNK> there is a <UNK> old changing shed near by and as we can see something or someone is watching them when the young man briefly disappears to get something from the truck the young woman wanders into the shed just to play a prank once she is there she is attacked the young man <UNK> to the shed to find her and he is <UNK> with a board and nail <UNK> <UNK> sets us up for the payoff pitch when the young man comes in he looks <UNK> <UNK> the room and spots his would be lover bleeding in the corner and then <UNK> the guy gets it it is a very tense moment and it starts the film off on the correct note br br also introduced into the <UNK> <UNK> of a story is a young man named tim that seems to be having strange dreams of a <UNK> woman that is bound in a torture chamber surrounded by men with <UNK> covering their faces tim seems to think that his dreams have something to do with the murders because every time a murder takes place he has another dream toss in a quiet and <UNK> grandmother a <UNK> female reporter and a strong yet <UNK> local sheriff and you have all the ingredients necessary to create the <UNK> of an <UNK> in the small town of <UNK> br br throughout the film more people are <UNK> but most of the time the males are slaughtered with extreme prejudice and the females are raped this is my first feeble and careful attempt to tell you that this is what left me <UNK> with the denouement it just didn't strike the right <UNK> br br the <UNK> is a well done film it is tense tight and even most of the performances are very well done i was intrigued by the dreams that tim was having and i was anxious to find out what significance they had to the story and ultimately to the murders but when you get through all that was good in the film you are still left with that <UNK> taste in your mouth and bitter <UNK> are always more difficult to swallow than sweet ones br br 7 out of 10 this could have been a nine too bad
<START> for two of the funniest comedians the movie was awful fast <UNK> it and never got any better waste of time and waste of money tina <UNK> is such a great writer i thought that she would be so great in the comedy the previews were so great but they only showed the best parts of the movie my husband even thought that for a chick flick it sucked what is up with that movie was very slow <UNK> boring i will not recommend it to anyone at this time i would like my money back for this one boo from us here in arizona thanks but no thanks who does this kind of stupid stuff to make people think that you are pregnant i thought that it was going to be so funny i have had my own children and i have helped others have children it could have been more along the lines of reality
<START> if any show in the last ten years deserves a 10 it is this rare gem it allows us to escape back to a time when things were simpler and more fun filled with heart and laughs this show keeps you laughing through the three decades of difference the furniture was ugly the clothes were colorful and the even the drugs were tolerable the hair was <UNK> the music was accompanied by roller <UNK> and in the words of <UNK> <UNK> a joint was a bad place to be take a trip back to the greatest time in american history fall in love with characters and the feel good essence of the small town where people were <UNK> to each other this classic is on television as much as full house don't miss it and always remember to shake your groove thing
<START> sorry gave it a 1 which is the rating i give to movies on which i walk out or fall asleep in this case i fell asleep 10 minutes from the end really really bored and not caring at all about what happened next
<START> br br whether any <UNK> was intended must be taken into consideration if in the year 2000 there were still <UNK> of feeling between <UNK> and <UNK> americans in georgia such as shown in this film obviously there remains a somewhat <UNK> mentality among a lot of people out there it is rather <UNK> to say the least if everyone <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> goldberg <UNK> <UNK> campbell denzel washington will smith et al whilst out in the backs there <UNK> <UNK> racial <UNK> br br white grandmother suddenly gets black grand daughter thrust upon her only to meet up with black grandfather in a very white social <UNK> the story is sweet not lacking tragic overtones and <UNK> predictable as in most of these kinds of tv films though the final scene has you guessing will he won't he br br gena rowlands in her typical style offers a sincere rendering and louis <UNK> is a good match for her the little penny <UNK> fortunately does not steal the show br br a <UNK> way of relaxing after sunday lunch without having to force your mind too much though you might just find yourself having a little <UNK> in the middle of it
<START> ah yes the 1980s a time of <UNK> and sly chuck and a host of other action stars hiding in a remote jungle blowing away <UNK> at the time i <UNK> t believe how movies like rambo missing in action and <UNK> <UNK> and who can forget the ridiculous red dawn made money at the box office they re turgid action crap <UNK> with a rather off putting right wing agenda and they have dated very badly troma s war is a tongue in cheek take on these type of movies but you <UNK> got to ask yourself did they need <UNK> in the first place of course not troma s war lacks any sort of sophistication though it does make the point that there s no real difference between right wing <UNK> and left wing ones and sometimes feels more like a grade z movie than a send up maybe it is
<START> vincent <UNK> follow up to house of wax 1953 the film which <UNK> his reputation as a horror icon similarly revolves around a bitter  albeit <UNK>  <UNK> though a remake the former shot in technicolor remains the superior effort that said apart from some <UNK> comic relief the obligatory resort to cheap <UNK> it was another 3 d showcase and occasional narrative shortcomings whatever happened to the missing bag which supposedly turned up at some police station containing a severed head this offers more than enough grand <UNK> type thrills and overall camp value price <UNK> it up in a variety of <UNK> as an <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> star <UNK> who had taken advantage of his genius to stand on its own two feet incidentally director <UNK> involvement here proves no mere coincidence  since the narrative <UNK> elements from two horror titles both starring <UNK> <UNK> he had previously <UNK> i e the <UNK> 1944 and <UNK> square 1945 the young leads are played by mary murphy as <UNK> <UNK> assistant and patrick <UNK> as her police detective boyfriend  curiously enough he would himself take the lead in a similar piece chamber of horrors 1966 which i have acquired just in time to serve as an <UNK> to this one an interesting <UNK> here is the <UNK> <UNK> of a novel <UNK> technique <UNK> which is crucial in bringing about <UNK> downfall in a predictable but rather awkward fiery climax <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> of his amateur crime novelist <UNK> has at least as much to do with it in the long run watching the star in a made to measure role the film emerges a good deal of fun  particularly at a <UNK> 73 minutes
<START> this film was shot on location in gerard gardens in <UNK> and was the <UNK> answer to films such as <UNK> <UNK> the film stands the test of time quite well with all the moral stories still or even more relevant today the film feature some fine performance from some notable british actors such as david <UNK> stanley baker peter cushing and anne <UNK> baker plays a <UNK> cop assigned to juvenile <UNK> duties with the premise that if you catch the kids at an early age they will end up being responsible adults br br notable cameos in the film include <UNK> <UNK> fred <UNK> and melvyn hayes gloria <UNK> <UNK> and michael <UNK> play brother and sister they are real life brother and sister who are caught up in an <UNK> web <UNK> <UNK> is still acting and can be seen in the latest nicole kidman film 'the <UNK> br br violent <UNK> features a gun siege in a school so is unlikely to be shown on tv following similar events in scotland russia br br i lived in gerard gardens where the film was shot though was not born at the time and have fond memories of the area i have recently completed a documentary on gerard gardens which includes <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> and a small uk film <UNK> to <UNK> which stars <UNK> henry and pete <UNK> the <UNK> were <UNK> in 1987 and the films go some way in keeping the memory alive br br there were some complaints from the residents when the film was released as the film portrayed the area in a bad light time has helped <UNK> those wounds br br a little gem of a film i would recommend you seek this out
<START> i checked this one out on dvd for a dollar so i could easily smile as this dreadful movie unfolds every time that you think it cannot get any worse it inevitably does the acting is absolutely horrific the plot makes no sense at all the title cold vengeance in the us dvd version has absolutely nothing to do with the script the action scenes are so obviously taken in their first take there are lots of mistakes during dialogues <UNK> that there is just no intend to do another take to at least try to make this movie bearable i cannot remember having seen a worse movie and i do occasionally get bad ones well except for <UNK> with wesley snipes no who am i kidding while a bad one <UNK> deserves best picture awards at the oscars when compared to this piece of crap
<START> i understand that this movie is made for kids and as a parent i have sat through many movies that don't particularly hold my interest but i can appreciate from a <UNK> point of view in how it is being received by my children parents are supposed to be encouraged after all to take part in their children's activities and to <UNK> the quality of the entertainment that they view so there should be something that appeals to an adult audience on some level even in children's movies disney has always understood this which is why it is so hard to <UNK> how it could allow such a complete piece of <UNK> to bear their name br br technically the sound editing is horrible and all dialog sounds over dubbed and unnatural personally i hate that but it was <UNK> awful considering the dialog itself seemed as though it was written by a 12 year old for a school project the acting reminded me of a school play and none of the child actors had any range of emotion in their voices thankfully it was a very short movie br br now before i come off like a video geek <UNK> a kids movie with an adult yard stick the one thing that can save even the worst children's movie is a positive message far be it from me to determine how a message has to be delivered so long as the right one is let us take a walk through this film to see what messages are given br br if you are lost don't worry you will inevitably find your way home br br approach wild animals without any fear br br you can win any competition just because you know you can br br and my favorite the final message left in the film br br it's okay to <UNK> authority figures and do what you think is right
<START> despite being released on dvd by blue underground some five years ago i have never come across this italian sword and <UNK> item on late night italian tv and now that i have seen it for myself i know exactly why not because of its director's typical <UNK> for extreme gore of which there is some examples to be sure or the fact that the handful of women in it parade topless all the time it is set in the dark ages after all <UNK> is quite simply very poor stuff indeed in fact i would go so far as to say that it may very well be the worst of its kind that i have yet seen and believe me i have seen plenty especially in the last few years i e following my <UNK> to the 2004 <UNK> film festival reading about how the film's failure at the time of initial release is believed to have led to its director's subsequent and <UNK> career <UNK> into mindless low budget gore i can see their point i may prefer <UNK> earlier giallo period 1968 <UNK> to his more popular stuff horror 1979 <UNK> myself but even on the latter his commitment was arguably <UNK> on the other hand conquest seems not to have inspired fulci in the least  seeing how he decided to <UNK> the proceedings with an annoyingly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it with <UNK> characters cannibals vs werewolves anyone irrelevant gore we are treated to a gratuitous nasty cannibal dinner just before witnessing the flesh eating <UNK> having their brains literally beaten out by their hairy <UNK> and even some highly <UNK> <UNK> between the masked brain <UNK> <UNK> don't ask and her slimy <UNK> pet for what it is worth we have two heroes for the price of one here a young magic bow carrying boy on some <UNK> <UNK> odyssey <UNK> <UNK> and his rambling muscle bound companion <UNK> <UNK> i e <UNK> from howard <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1970 who despite being called <UNK> short for <UNK> perhaps seems to be there simply to drop in on his <UNK> from time to time and get his younger <UNK> out of trouble particularly during an exceedingly unpleasant attack of the <UNK> unfortunately even the usual saving grace of such <UNK> material comes up short here as ex <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> electronic score seems awfully inappropriate at times fulci even <UNK> to give the film a laughably <UNK> <UNK> with the surviving <UNK> hero going <UNK> out into the wilderness after <UNK> one and all with the aid of the all important magic <UNK> much for his own supposed physical strength onto his next  and thankfully <UNK>  adventure
<START> yes <UNK> wrestling how can anyone forget about this unreal show first they had a very short <UNK> named marty <UNK> who made rock n roll buck <UNK> look like a nose tackle then it was gene <UNK> who when he got mad as the wrestler would say either were out of time or well be right back acting like he was mad but actually sounding forced after he went to the <UNK> ken <UNK> took over even though his mustache looked like week old soup got stuck to it was a very fine <UNK> who <UNK> jimmy <UNK> called mouse face which made me fall off my chair laughing after he jumped ship then larry nelson came on board which he was so bad that <UNK> george would of been an improvement then there's doug <UNK> the best wrestling <UNK> ever who made every match exciting with his description of blows then he was offered more pay by the <UNK> north stars hockey team at <UNK> who can forget roger kent who's <UNK> of words and sentences were historic like when a wrestler was big hes a big on <UNK> or kicked in the guts right in the <UNK> or when kicked he <UNK> him or the <UNK> should be banned after nick <UNK> used it on a helpless <UNK> right roger like you care after he left to <UNK> money <UNK> they had rod <UNK> who's <UNK> style was great but different like when a wrestler <UNK> the sole of his boot across another guys <UNK> he'd say right across the front e <UNK> or when a wrestler is in trouble hes in a bad bad way he also would say <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> most scientific <UNK> are here right in the <UNK> no extra money <UNK> <UNK> after he left <UNK> larry <UNK> <UNK> nelson took over and i would talk to someone else or totally ignore him wwe wisely didn't take him also greg <UNK> had the <UNK> wrestling boots i ever saw a yellow color of something i don't want to say also when hes looking for the tag he looks like he wants to get it over with so that he can run to the nearest <UNK> <UNK> jim <UNK> was such a great <UNK> artist that you wonder why greg was ever his partner jerry <UNK> rip was also a superstar wrestler but you wonder why <UNK> had himself win against him <UNK> then when vince <UNK> would hire <UNK> <UNK> he would make most of them <UNK> <UNK> matches i like to see the <UNK> family say <UNK> real now
<START> i recently caught up with this little gem of a film on cable it took me by surprise even though i should have expected it from the team involved with this movie br br henry <UNK> directed this film with a sure hand and it shows one always wonders about the secret life of hit killers one doesn't have to go too far to realize they probably are one's own neighbors or social <UNK> or even friends they're no different from us at least on the surface br br in this story the grandfather is a despicable character who does not hesitate in <UNK> anyone for the right price he has no <UNK> in teaching the <UNK> to his own son and even to the <UNK> br br alex is a man living in turmoil he knows what he has done in the past and suddenly is coming to realize the consequence of his actions he has to see someone to help him find peace with himself in going to dr parks he is trying to find <UNK> although he doesn't find it there on the contrary there is a dramatic twist when alex learns about who is supposed to kill next br br alex brilliantly portrayed by william h macy <UNK> us not only is he a fantastic actor but he makes us believe he is that man one of the best things in the movie is the late john ritter he is equally convincing as dr parks the man who <UNK> the mystery br br donald sutherland as the grandfather is perfect he is a natural actor in everything he does <UNK> campbell surprised in her pivotal role of sarah she shows a <UNK> and range that are incredible <UNK> <UNK> is martha the suffering wife and she doesn't get to do much also barbara <UNK> in a rare appearance is the grandmother from hell david <UNK> is a delight in the film he shows a maturity beyond his years br br
<START> there were only two things that kept me interested in this film i was waiting for owen wilson to die and catherine zeta jones br br this was basically a one woman show catherine zeta jones was just there to provide eye candy liam neeson was totally wasted in this film like jones he had no role at all the film was all lily taylor <UNK> ready to wear she was the only one that had any real part in this crappy script by david self ok it was his first one and he did redeem himself with road to <UNK> br br i don't know what director jan de <UNK> problem was he did a great job with speed and <UNK> he really fell down on the job here maybe he was still recovering from the disaster speed 2 cruise control he should thank his lucky stars for the wild wild west else this would be the worst picture of 1999 br br avoid at all costs
<START> so i rented this from netflix because somebody gave me roger <UNK> book i hated hated hated this movie and he gave this one a rare zero star rating in the book and said at the end of his original review mad dog time should be cut up to provide free <UNK> picks for the poor so i figured from ebert saying that i would see if it was really as bad as he said it was i know most society says not to listen to critics and to judge for yourself but i could not express how much i hated this piece of junk like ebert did and never since <UNK> review of rob <UNK> north where he said he hated that movie ten times had i ever heard such a brilliant hatred movie review here we have richard dreyfuss as a gangster which i don't think it would be terrible to see dreyfuss as a gangster if the screenplay for this movie were written well but above all the other things that were awful about this movie i can certainly tell you the script was not written well at all while the movie starts off with jeff goldblum saying that he enjoyed watching <UNK> girlfriend while dreyfuss was at a criminal hospital the movie starts off with some decent dialog after the opening credits but after that first 4 or 5 minutes the other 85 minutes just consists of dumb characters talking pointless garbage for 30 seconds then someone gets shot then there are a whole bunch of jokes about dreyfuss being mentally ill haha not funny then we get an unpleasant and unfunny scene <UNK> frank sinatra's my way sang by gabriel <UNK> apparently to insult dreyfuss of course because the screenplay was written on the level of a sixth <UNK> dreyfuss shoots <UNK> over five times and <UNK> just will not die are we as the audience supposed to even care or find that mildly funny i can certainly tell you i did not care or find that funny not only am i disappointed in dreyfuss who i admire much as an actor for producing and starring in this tripe but i am also extremely disappointed in jeff goldblum because this was released the same year that independence day was the top <UNK> film of the year and ultimately one of the most successful films in history did goldblum feel that independence day would be a flop and then just take the next role that was offered to him to make some money if independence day were a bomb what did an oscar winner and the star of two of the biggest money making films in history find remotely enjoyable about this the opening sequence of mad dog time says that the movie is set on another planet i only wish now that i have wasted <UNK> minutes watching this trash that it would have stayed and opened in theaters on the planet where it supposedly takes place so that way everyone on this planet would never here of this ridiculous waste of <UNK> minutes out of my life that i will never get back ebert saying the movie should have been cut up is not good enough i am afraid every copy of mad dog time should have <UNK> <UNK> all over it and be lit on fire i have yet to top a worst movie i have ever seen because this one has won it's honor as the worst movie ever
<START> like the <UNK> nights this film plays with storytelling conventions in order to make us feel that there's plot plot and more plot it opens with what appears to be the frame device of a blind man telling the story of his life then <UNK> into a flashback which takes us right up to the blind man's present where we discover that about half of the story is yet to come it must be admitted that the second half doesn't quite live up to the promise of the first like the <UNK> nights it tries to <UNK> as many middle eastern folk <UNK> as possible into the one work a freed genie a beautiful princess a flying carpet fantastic mechanical toys sea <UNK> a crowded <UNK> a wicked <UNK> <UNK> i don't know why it all works but it does everything is just so beautiful the sets are beautiful june <UNK> is beautiful <UNK> score is especially beautiful as usual it sounds hungarian but somehow he manages to convince us that he's being hungarian in a <UNK> way
<START> i feel very sorry for people who go to movies with a pad and <UNK> to write down flaws and keep notes on how bad a movie is i feel equally contempt for people who go to movies and can't suspend reality and or let themselves enjoy 90 minutes <UNK> from their boring or busy lives get a grip people <UNK> is a very entertaining movie if you take movies seriously this is not for you if you are expecting the movie to resemble the book in any way this is not for you but if you enjoyed the utter hilarity of <UNK> queen of the desert or the what the hell am i watching of <UNK> <UNK> or the gross out comedy of the <UNK> thing then let yourself escape to <UNK> it has some really funny parts hilarious actually it also has some really good music kudos to <UNK> lang also did i mention it has 90 minutes of uma thurman need i say more
<START> i am a student of film and have been for several years and the concept of a <UNK> kung fu satirical <UNK> had me wondering is this the film that's going to break the mold let's face it america has never been let down by any piece of cinema that features a <UNK> <UNK> after such great classics as monkey trouble and <UNK> <UNK> in i thought that the best ideas were already taken but then comes funky monkey i laughed i cried i <UNK> suicide br br now i've read about demon possession in the bible but that still doesn't explain why someone would create such a product of evil first off having at least a shred of intelligence i realized that a <UNK> was in fact an ape not a monkey at all however i was sure that the filmmakers would clear this problem up further into the film they didn't let me sum up this work of art a company by the name of z i t has decided to train <UNK> as soldiers why i think they mention something about the soldiers working for <UNK> but when it would cost about an <UNK> 13 million dollars of government money to train one <UNK> this doesn't seem cost effective well anyways z i t brings in a cia <UNK> matthew <UNK> to train <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> is everything z i t hoped for he can take out an entire shift of guards who all appear to have gotten their training skills at the local mall and yet still manage to remind us that we're watching a kid's movie as you may have guessed <UNK> finds out that z i t 's intentions may be evil gasp and decides to break <UNK> out being a cia agent and all <UNK> knows that best way to make himself disappear is to go to a large city rent a guest room regularly make appearances on television while fighting crime and using <UNK> to pay for everything br br z i t finds out where <UNK> is staying and sends two of their finest to retrieve him these guards are possibly the greatest comedy team up since martin and lewis or was it turner and <UNK> it doesn't matter anyways because in the end for a heck of a twist ending the good guys win <UNK> <UNK> for predictability throw in a nerdy kid who learns to be himself a lonely mom who needs a date and music montages that feature songs that would even be <UNK> by radio disney and you get funky monkey the climax to the movie a football game played by thugs <UNK> a <UNK> and the nerd boy no one seems to care about such <UNK> at a high school football game br br funky monkey never lets up it's edge of your seat entertainment some might even call this the american beauty of monkey filled features after finishing this epic i <UNK> hearing a story about a <UNK> worker who lost much of his brain functions when a metal rod <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> funky monkey is a metal rod among movies
<START> the film starts with a voice over telling the audience where they are and who the characters are and that is the moment i started to dislike the movie with all the endless possibilities any film director have in hand i really find it a very easy and cheap solution to express the situation with a voice over telling everything i actually believe voice overs are <UNK> to the film making concept br br i hate to hear from a voice over saying where we are which date we are at and especially what the characters feel and think i believe that a director has to find a visual way to <UNK> the feelings and the thoughts of the characters to the audience br br but after the bad <UNK> intro a very striking movie begins and keeps going for a fairly long enough time the lives of a middle class family and all the members <UNK> are depicted in a perfect realistic way i think the director has a talent for capturing real life situations for example a father who has to make his private calls from the bathroom might seem <UNK> at first but life itself leads us some situations which might seem <UNK> but also very normal as well i think the director is a very good <UNK> about real life br br but that is it after a while the realism in the movie begins to sacrifice the story telling i really felt like i'm having a big headache because of the non stop talking characters it was as if the actors and actresses were given the subject and were allowed to <UNK> the dialogs it is realistic really but characters always asking really is that so etc to each other or characters saying no or are you listening to me ten times when saying it only once is just enough causes me to have a headache br br i also think the play practicing and book reading scenes are more then they should be i understand that the play and the book in the movie are very much related to the plot but i think the director has missed the point where he should stop showing these scenes
<START> not much to say beyond the summary save that this is an example of j <UNK> <UNK> constant attention to maintaining a good <UNK> profile they don't make movies this bad very often especially with the likes of jimmy stewart and vera miles in the blend too bad br br
<START> this and not a certain slightly overrated southern soap opera was the greatest epic to come out of <UNK> greatest year 1939 i will not not <UNK> the obvious cary grant victor mclaglen who was a <UNK> <UNK> and douglas fairbanks jr give superb comic performances however i want to note two other less understood elements of this masterpiece the magnificent final battle sequence as the wonderful sam <UNK> climbs <UNK> up to the <UNK> of the temple to blow his <UNK> and warn the <UNK> is simply grand it never fails to <UNK> me yet another underrated element in the film is <UNK> <UNK> performance as the guru this is no fu <UNK> caricature but an well drawn <UNK> historically informed have you ever heard of <UNK> <UNK> he defeated the <UNK> left in india by alexander the great villain indeed one can see parallels between this mystical evil <UNK> and a certain well known figure of the thirties a german not an indian gunga din anti nazi <UNK> not quite but still a tremendous funny moving epic
<START> i'm a big fan of the true crime genre but i couldn't sit through this <UNK> piece it was almost as if dahmer was intended as <UNK> down to the porn <UNK> soundtrack there was no look at what made dahmer <UNK> no exploration of who his victims were nothing but look at how creepy this guy is and i have to give the filmmakers this much their dahmer is the <UNK> thing ever to disgrace the screen
<START> three story lines and not enough <UNK> them together inside man was very <UNK> and an <UNK> attempt to be artistic and realistic though having its moments the movie started off looking like a fast thriller which quickly grounded to a slow crawl jumped quickly between <UNK> and <UNK> and only barely picked up steam again near the last 20 minutes i will give credit to denzel washington he played his part extremely well with a full grasp of his human side and not just the typical super detective with all the answers clive owen also did quite well with his <UNK> part as evil genius and criminal mastermind both not the same in retrospect overall though each person <UNK> created a great sub section yet when the parts finally came together and everything counted there was no sudden ah ha or <UNK> of everything it all ended up with very little of the energy it began with with a lot of plot holes tons of questions and as i said earlier no where near spike lee's normal level i have to completely disagree with the so called professional critics this is not the movie they play it up to be
<START> i basically picked up this movie because i had seen <UNK> <UNK> brilliant remake of zatoichi and was in the mood for another updated samurai tale which also starred <UNK> <UNK> these two movies are worlds apart zatoichi added humor and depth to its characters and <UNK> traditional samurai movie clichés <UNK> goes off the deep end in the other direction br br first off i hate movies that have other characters inform the audience what the main character is like instead of having the character develop over the course of the movie you cannot decide whether you are a monk or a warrior says almost every character in <UNK> presence yet this inner turmoil is barely conveyed within the character himself instead of character development we get <UNK> boring gory battle scenes <UNK> character is undeveloped and even he looks like he is bored and doesn't know what he is doing there i know that he usually looks distant and cool and that is part of <UNK> appeal but this movie doesn't serve him br br a lot of the camera movement is nauseating there is a scene that goes on forever in which the camera <UNK> around the main characters until my wife and i felt like <UNK> the ending is ridiculous and rather anti climatic br br its too bad that really good samurai movies aren't being made in japan nowadays with this type of budget the colors scenery and costumes were great but the rest is just a <UNK> waste of time i would rather see one of the <UNK> versions of this myth
<START> this is a slow moving story no action no crazy suspense no abrupt surprises if you cannot stand to see a movie about two people just talking and walking about a story that develops slowly till the very end and about <UNK> <UNK> romance don't waste your time and money br br on the other hand if you're into dialog masterful story telling thought provoking ideas and finding true love in the fabric of life then this is your movie i recommend you watch this movie when you are most alert though because the pace the music and the overall tone of the movie can put you in a <UNK> mood it's truly fantastic i really mean that br br ethan hawke and julie <UNK> are annoying with their mannerisms at times but thankfully the chemistry between the two makes the acting very natural warm and tender they act and feel each other out from the very beginning making you feel as an intruder br br in their conversations there are excellent <UNK> on many subjects that will <UNK> thought and conversation between you and your partner i thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters but i may be <UNK> their intelligence still it did not ruin the movie br br the overall story is very simple which i think gives the movie it's charm and ultimately it's power br br bottom line the movie's flow is slow the dialog is fascinating the story builds gently <UNK> and <UNK> the build up to the finale is satisfying and in the end rewarding
<START> i gave this film 10 not because it is a superbly consistent movie but for it's pure ability to evoke emotions in its audience the story of one woman's struggle against all odds is an old cliché by now but very few films have carried it off with so much warmth and sincerity as the color purple br br it also showed a different side to the african american experience showing that after slaves were granted freedom many fell into the ways of the hated <UNK> man' and were abusive of their own people i find this an important point as it goes against the portray white on black violence and win an oscar trend br br also the acting performances are superb especially oprah who i now have a new found respect for br br well worth watching but keep some <UNK> handy
<START> my comment is for the russian version of space race named <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> battle for space shown on <UNK> first channel on april 10 13 2006 bad translation could have ruined some details but i doubt it's the case the number of factual errors is such that it's impossible to list them especially in the first episode the development of first <UNK> even the u s half of the film contains multiple errors and <UNK> the audience is not told of any v 2 a 4 <UNK> from the u s three different <UNK> c rockets are launched with the same serial number <UNK> <UNK> apollo 1 is to be launched to the moon etc in the russian half each and every person is ludicrous <UNK> is scared of <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is alcoholic etc men as functions no motivation no life at all uniform and <UNK> are awful <UNK> sings a <UNK> song awaiting launch i think this was added specially for russian version
<START> fabulous fantastic probably disney's best musical adventure i have loved this film for over 35 years because it is so imaginative clever and fun even despite the silly flying bed scenes the other scenes and dialog are magical and funny could they have picked anyone better than angela lansbury to play <UNK> i cannot think of anyone more suited to the role <UNK> this classic would be as stupid as <UNK> mary <UNK> br br david <UNK> though he had few quality movie roles absolutely shines in this adventure he was a comic genius who is often forgotten nowadays <UNK> <UNK> and proper <UNK> nobody could really do slapstick and pull it off as <UNK> as he does it would be tragic to remake this film because <UNK> has been deceased for a few years and nobody could step into his shoes and do his character justice br br the dancing <UNK> and armor have a magical aura about them that other movies with witches just don't capture i particularly enjoy the parts where the germans <UNK> <UNK> house and she must defend it in any way she can br br <UNK> along <UNK> along on the bottom of the beautiful <UNK> sea richard and robert <UNK> <UNK> themselves on the musical numbers all of them are fantastic and worth remembering <UNK> road being one of my favorites br br a great film that still holds up today
<START> i would rather have 20 root <UNK> than go through this film again the prince of annoying <UNK> <UNK> has wasted nearly two hours of my life with this piece of cynical pseudo cool the only amusing thing in this whole mess is mr <UNK> obnoxious off camera <UNK> about tits and ass <UNK> takes a great concept and <UNK> it into the dust it is choppy and badly done in an apparent effort to make it seem edgy or funny it is neither i seldom feel that a movie was a waste of film or tape but this one qualifies for that distinction if a date suggests seeing this film run
<START> having seen versus previously i had high hopes for alive the description of the movie on the back of the dvd jacket sounded promising alive did not deliver very slow development loads of potential with the cast and the cool visuals the premise was intriguing but the payoff did not <UNK> the build up could have done so much more at the end most of the movie is just sitting around to put it <UNK> three of us were <UNK> to sit down and watch this movie and by the 50 minute mark we were struggling to make it thru to the end it really needed more shock elements if you are looking for <UNK> the killer or versus type fights then save yourself some and loads of disappointment
<START> i am going to go out on a <UNK> and actually defend shades of grey as a good clip show episode which <UNK> into the life and death struggle of commander william thomas <UNK> who was battling a <UNK> fatal disease br br the scenes from the flashback sequences were <UNK> quite well with the mood <UNK> was in such as when he was <UNK> his romantic episodes such as <UNK> angel one and up the long ladder tragic moments were <UNK> such as <UNK> death in skin of evil as well as elements of pulse <UNK> danger in heart of glory conspiracy and the aforementioned skin of evil <UNK> also <UNK> courage under fire by telling some humorous jokes such as an <UNK> of mine was bitten by a <UNK> once after 3 days of intense pain the snake died this episode <UNK> the psychological ordeal of will <UNK> under extreme <UNK> and yes i am biased in my opinion in <UNK> shades of grey as a solid episode because at the time of its original airing my face was covered in sweat wondering whether or not <UNK> would <UNK> of it alive and live to see other great <UNK> <UNK> adventures beyond the final frontier br br of course in subsequent years i seem to have formed a <UNK> opinion of this particular episode but if an award should go for the best clip show episode in the history of television then i believe that this episode should be highly regarded in that respect
<START> hmm hip hop music to a period western modern phrases like cool and too many others to keep track of the <UNK> are in <UNK> house french <UNK> nails on hard riding girls <UNK> packs clearly visible on <UNK> <UNK> back i just can't go on with the <UNK> of errors made by the director and <UNK> br br the acting isn't as bad as i've ever seen the women did well enough with a poor script br br it was weird hearing louis <UNK> speaking in his native accent br br the girls are beautiful the costumes fabulous albeit completely incorrect i just can't believe they would dumb down what could have been a great story i would feel offended to believe that this movie was loaded with such <UNK> that it would play well in the inner city br br
<START> this movie starts slow then <UNK> off after watching for about an hour and seeing absolutely nothing happen i walked out i mean nothing happened zero <UNK> <UNK> there is no story the characters are vague <UNK> of the most boring people any of us know the producers of this film could be <UNK> in a court of law if they try to sell it as a motion picture there is no motion i could have told the same story with a couple still pictures with <UNK> the script is a joke it's just awful i doubt that any script doctor in the world could save it my biggest regret is not that i wasted 60 minutes of my life watching love in the time of money but that i missed a great opportunity to be a leader i could have been the first to walk out but i waited a bit too long instead i watched about 20 people walk out before me
<START> it's interesting how 90 of the high vote reviews are all comprised of random <UNK> from united states no state pride who all say more or less the exact same thing with the exact same <UNK> style and all with the exact same complete lack of taste in movies i would delve further into this suspicious trend but alas this is a review of the movie and not the reviews themselves br br let me start by saying that i am both a christian and a true avid movie fan this means i have seen a great many movies from good to bad and can <UNK> claim that facing the giants is in fact not a good movie it has good intentions but fails to meet many if any basic standards that i associate with a quality <UNK> experience br br the acting mostly terrible <UNK> at best hearing that most were apparently <UNK> does not at all surprise me br br the dialogue clumsy cheesy the script comes off as a long version of some cheesy skit you'd see performed in sunday school or youth group function the rave review robots <UNK> in the absence of meaningless words but the cold hard truth is that such words are a part of the real world and the complete absence of it is <UNK> let's just say the mean ol' head coach of a team in a state championship game would have a lot more to say than oh no when things are not going his way br br the plot mind <UNK> predictable it has been commented that this movie is not a hollywood cliché and yet it's like it was pulled directly from making an underdog sports movie for <UNK> including the mandatory quasi romantic subplot for the ladies and just had a christian themed coat of paint slapped on it i'm not lying or <UNK> when i say i had almost every major detail in both the plot and subplot <UNK> immediately upon their <UNK> only someone who has never seen a decent sports movie in their whole life would be emotionally <UNK> by the story presented here br br the directing editing it too was <UNK> almost exactly after the generic underdog sports movie <UNK> still acting aside there weren't many noticeable goofs so at least facing the giants was technically competent br br the message ask jesus and he will grant all your wishes part of me hoped that this movie would end in the <UNK> eventual defeat to really emphasize the whole if we lose we praise you part because in the real world you will fail at one point or another and it's good to be prepared for that but in the world of facing the giants if you fail clearly someone either screwed up or is cheating another interesting question being what if the <UNK> came across another team that had gotten religion would they be caught in an endless loop of <UNK> plays and last minute saves or would the universe simply have <UNK> br br the bottom line for the hardcore conservative christian parents crowd <UNK> the <UNK> of hollywood facing the giants will be another mediocre at best christian film to hold up on a <UNK> as the preferred model for modern film making for everyone else the effects will range from boredom to a burning desire to be watching something else and a warning any attempt to show this to non christians will lead not to <UNK> but to <UNK> i give this two stars one for the one scene that did not have me rolling my eyes and another for basic technical <UNK> on a low budget
<START> this documentary film is based on <UNK> <UNK> of the evidence in which brian <UNK> perhaps <UNK> fails to mention important evidence to the contrary perhaps his most crucial mistake is one of the earliest his claims concerning the <UNK> of paul's <UNK> about jesus christ disregard key facts like the existence of some <UNK> <UNK> within paul's letters these <UNK> suggest that most of the central claims about jesus were already <UNK> into statements of faith possibly within a few years of <UNK> death and <UNK> the <UNK> of the early christians can't just be tossed out as mere fantasy there were indeed many people claiming to be the <UNK> during that period but only one of them has remained jesus why because it would have been preposterous for anyone to have actually believed christ was the <UNK> and go on to die for those beliefs if they knew that he had not been <UNK> even if the <UNK> are dated more <UNK> we are still talking about accounts of jesus written within the <UNK> of other <UNK> that would have pointed out inaccuracies in these <UNK> and there is evidence that the <UNK> were written much earlier br br what i am saying is that <UNK> documentary is an incredibly biased and self serving piece of work that <UNK> <UNK> different arguments and evidence to serve his anti christian view don't be fooled by poor investigation
<START> i like chris rock but i feel he is wasted in this film the idea of <UNK> heaven can wait is fine but the filmmakers followed the plot of that turkey too closely when eddie murphy remade dr <UNK> and the nutty professor he re did them totally so they became murphy films vehicles not just tepid remakes that's why they were successful if chris had done the same this could have been a much better film the few laughs that come are when he is doing his <UNK> routine so he might as well have done a concert film it also would have been much funnier if the white man whose body he <UNK> was a truck driver or <UNK> so why does hollywood keep making junk like this because people go to see it because they like chris rock so give chris a decent script and give us better movies don't remake films that weren't that good in the first place
<START> what we have here is a classic case of too much <UNK> this is what happens when you live in a small country with very little next to none even cinema history whenever somebody does come up with a slightly more ambitious film project  other than the usual dramas about struggling farmer families or long feature slapstick movies of local comedians  everybody feels <UNK> to love it and even responsible to spread <UNK> reviews across the <UNK> borders this is especially the case when the writer director of this particular film is already a <UNK> sweetheart because he's also the <UNK> and lead singer of a popular rock band any way the wind blows is by no means a bad film but it's definitely overrated if that is even possible within the boundaries of a small country and has absolutely nothing new or even remotely original to offer this is basically the <UNK> version of classic movies such as short cuts and <UNK> and illustrates a <UNK> of characters whose daily lives initially appear to be unrelated but eventually come together in the end the only thing that seems to <UNK> the eight protagonists at first is the city of <UNK> where they all live and work but gradually the deeper relationships between them become transparent and near the climax they all gather for a party the main problem with any way the wind blows at least according to yours truly lies with the characters they really are random uninteresting and honestly don't experience anything that could be considered out of the ordinary it was presumably writer director tom <UNK> intention to depict the average regular <UNK> of <UNK> but then seriously what is the point one of the characters gets fired from his film <UNK> job another one is a failed novelist struggling with a marriage crisis two siblings recently lost their father and the most mysterious one of them all is followed by the wind wherever he goes there are a couple of more characters regularly walking through the screen but they're even less worth mentioning these people simply drivel on and on about very random topics like life in the 80's dates and each other's <UNK> motions and philosophy about matters nobody cares about some of the dialogs do evoke mild chuckles especially the interactions between the two twenty something guys from <UNK> but still nothing extraordinary or even memorable the film actually works best as a <UNK> video to promote the city of <UNK> and as an extended versatile music documentary there are several stylish nifty <UNK> images of <UNK> and there's always beautiful music playing whether really loud or subtly in the background generally speaking any way the wind blows is a competently made and stylish effort but too mundane and slightly boring and i honestly wonder most of its fans would even had bothered to watch if it weren't a <UNK> production
<START> dream quest was a surprisingly good movie there were some noticeable goofs but that can be expected in a movie like this that was made in such a short time i did not feel any urge to fast forward during the movie and i found it pretty entertaining it gets kind of silly at times but overall i recommend it they probably used up all the <UNK> in the nearby stores and some of the costume designs were pretty good
<START> a french novelist disgusted by his wife's society friends goes to north africa for a <UNK> there he encounters a <UNK> talented <UNK> girl living in poverty to spite his wife who is <UNK> a <UNK> he decides to train <UNK> the girl and present her to <UNK> society as the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br the marvelous <UNK> baker is perfectly cast in the title role in this very enjoyable french film with her enormous eyes <UNK> smile she makes contact with the viewer's <UNK> immediately her over sized personality obvious joy of performing make her a pure pleasure to watch baker makes us care about what's happening to poor <UNK> during her transformation introduction to european <UNK> br br albert <UNK> does very well as the <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> also effective are georges <UNK> as a half <UNK> servant and jean <UNK> as the mysterious <UNK> br br the film is very handsome well made looking a little reminiscent of busby berkeley movies being produced at the same time in america although unlike american films of this period <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hasn't any racism it should be pointed out that there was no <UNK> office or production code in france some of the dialogue action is rather provocative but it must be admitted that baker singing dancing to <UNK> the african sky ' as well as her culminating performance in the <UNK> nightclub are two of the <UNK> more memorable moments br br actual location filming in <UNK> greatly enhances the film br br <UNK> baker was born in st louis in <UNK> into a very poor family her talent driving ambition however soon pushed her into moving east and she was briefly a cast member of the <UNK> <UNK> realizing that america in the mid <UNK> held great limitations for a gifted black woman she managed to get herself to paris where she eventually joined the <UNK> <UNK> le <UNK> <UNK> the french <UNK> her and she became a huge celebrity a short return to america in <UNK> showed baker that things had not changed for african americans she returned to france became a french citizen worked for the resistance during the early days of the war baker <UNK> to <UNK> for the duration and entertained allied troops <UNK> there br br after the war <UNK> <UNK> began to slide and she faced many financial personal difficulties for a while she was even banned from returning to the united states finally baker accepted an offer from princess grace of <UNK> to <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> baker was on the verge of a comeback when she died of a stroke in 1975 at the age of <UNK> br br having appeared in only two decent films <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> baker is in danger of becoming obscure but she deserves her place alongside <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as one of her <UNK> truly legendary performers
<START> <UNK> is an awful movie it is so simple it seems they tried to make a movie to show the reel life just like <UNK> did many years ago but unfortunately <UNK> lacks good young actors leon are by many still the little girl in <UNK> <UNK> and laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role several times in the movie she plays with out soul and this is destroying the movie br br even though i consider it a movie you ought to see i do not agree that the youth are behaving like this but i think it can show how it can end if you are letting your child down also it is important to support danish movies and new companies like film <UNK> br br all in all i think people should see <UNK> not because it is a great film but because it is a movies which is dealing with important themes i also think it is important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it and actually it is in these scenes laura is acting best like the ending where she is holding the gun
<START> i saw this last week after picking up the dvd cheap i had wanted to see it for ages finding the plot outline very intriguing so my disappointment was great to say the least i thought the lead actor was very flat this kind of part required a performance like <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> gate of which this is almost a complete rip off but i guess tv budgets don't always stretch to this kind of acting ability br br i also the thought the direction was confused and dull serving only to remind me that carpenter hasn't done a decent movie since in the mouth of madness as for the story well i was disappointed there as well there was no way it could meet my expectation i guess but i thought the payoff and explanation was poor and the way he finally got the film anti climactic to say the least br br this was written by one of the main <UNK> to <UNK> and you can tell he does love his cinema but i would have liked a better result from such a good initial premise br br i took the dvd back to the store the same day
<START> spanish films are into a if not golden definitely a silver age <UNK> is another example of a movie that takes people and their conflicts seriously although the feelings are strong or nearly at life or death level they still aren't really melodramatic this could happen br br there are different stories here which become connected one is about the retarded girl who doesn't dare to pass the street to the next block one is about the middle aged woman who finds the lover of her life in a foot <UNK> another is about the girl with drug problems who's lover leaves her still another one is about the <UNK> of a <UNK> who almost finds true love br br definitely worth seeing it's in spain the <UNK> take women seriously
<START> personally i absolutely love this movie and novel i read the book first and decided to see the movie first of all the plot is truly original and one of a kind the acting is also great and i love the cast judd <UNK> plays fred <UNK> fits his role perfectly and really sells it to you there are also a few corny lines thrown in there <UNK> if they were meant to be corny but they really will <UNK> up the mood and provide a good laugh the <UNK> atmosphere is really a perfect spot to film this movie and it kind of draws you in throughout the movie not only will you love it but you'll want to see it again and again i recommend this 100 to any horror fan
<START> this astonishing waste of production money is <UNK> proof that the rich and famous can be just as stupid and <UNK> as politicians from a silly play by <UNK> williams and directed with a dead hand by joseph <UNK> and starring taylor and burton and <UNK> coward this project filmed in a spectacular cliff top mountain island mansion in the <UNK> must have seemed a sure fire winner when presented to universal in 1967 the result is so absurd and tedious that it almost defies belief visually the film is spectacular but that is the force of nature that has allowed the setting and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set the shrill antics of a <UNK> taylor <UNK> half asleep <UNK> the loony dialog <UNK> coward laughing at himself the ridiculous story and plot devices and the absurd <UNK> simply <UNK> the viewer boom is a disgrace a waste of money and talent and clear proof that <UNK> famous people can be idiots just like the rest of the <UNK> <UNK> not even fun just terrible and mad shocking waste
<START> this movie is a little unusual in that it's got a very slim plot and the movie itself is done at a very slow and <UNK> pace while this makes it pretty different from the average grant film it is still highly watchable and entertaining it's sort of like someone said let's just follow cary around and watch as he gets <UNK> at all the little problems that come up when you are having a house <UNK> considering what a fun actor he is in the film and the great support he gets from myrna loy and <UNK> douglas the film works very well while the film has pretty modest <UNK> it makes the most of the material it's a great film for cary grant fans or for the whole family
<START> robert <UNK> normally a very strong character actor is lost at sea here cast as a new york family man seeking revenge on the thugs who murdered his son and attacked his wife in a home invasion scary subject matter exploited for <UNK> thrills in the death wish vein it isn't difficult to <UNK> at these smarmy proceedings the dialogue is full of <UNK> the crime <UNK> are <UNK> dated and the supporting characters are ridiculously over written particularly a despicable judge who allows an accused murderer to walk right out of the courtroom low rent production is <UNK> in its self <UNK> especially as the violence in our cities has only <UNK> from
<START> <UNK> 100 fred astaire and ginger rogers never made anything but great films together although this is not one of their best it is an excellent musical there are a few outstanding musical numbers good support from randolph scott two notable appearances betty <UNK> and lucille ball make memorable early screen performances ball is particularly good and a blonde as well the let's face the music and dance is one of the musical <UNK> best numbers ever harriet <UNK> better know as harriet nelson of <UNK> and harriet plays ginger <UNK> sister the basic plot is pretty familiar but with a cast this exceptional it works excellent art direction and score
<START> this has to be <UNK> most twisted holiday film that i've ever <UNK> eyes on and that's saying something i know that the mexican people have some odd ideas about religion mixing up ancient aztec beliefs with traditional christian <UNK> but their day of the dead isn't half as scary as their take on santa claus br br so santa isn't some jolly fat red suited alcoholic take a look at those <UNK> <UNK> sometime rather he's a skinny <UNK> <UNK> living in heaven or the heavens <UNK> with a bunch of kids who work harder than the one's in kathy lee <UNK> sweat <UNK> they sing oh so cute traditional songs of their <UNK> while wearing clothing so stereotypical that i was surprised there wasn't a little african american boy in black face singing <UNK> this santa is a <UNK> tom <UNK> who watches and <UNK> to everything that everybody does from his <UNK> in the <UNK> this is so he can tell who's been naughty or nice with an emphasis on those who are naughty i'd bet br br there's no mrs claus no <UNK> what does he need <UNK> for when he's got child labor and the <UNK> are mechanical wind up toys this floating freak show <UNK> on a cloud presumably held up by its silver <UNK> br br <UNK> nemesis is the devil what is this santa our lord and <UNK> weird <UNK> satan sends one of his <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> devil named pitch to try to screw up christmas let me get this straight the forces of <UNK> evil are trying to ruin a completely commercial and greed driven holiday seems kind of redundant doesn't it br br pitch is totally <UNK> he tries to talk some children into being bad but doesn't have much luck i was strongly struck by the storyline of the <UNK> little girl <UNK> who's family is very poor all that she wants is a doll for christmas but he parents can't afford to buy her one they spent all of their money on the cardboard that they built their house out of so pitch tries to encourage her to steal a doll in reality that's the only way that a girl that poor would ever get a doll because being <UNK> and praying to god and holy santa doesn't really work but <UNK> <UNK> temptation and tells pitch to get <UNK> behind her and so is rewarded by being given a doll so creepy looking that you just know that it's <UNK> sister br br along the way pitch manages to get santa stuck in a tree uh huh from <UNK> he's rescued by <UNK> <UNK> you have got to be kidding me since when do mythical <UNK> figures appear in christmas tales or have anything to do with a christian religion and doesn't god <UNK> of magic they'd have been burning <UNK> at the stake a few hundred years ago not asking him to come to the rescue of one of god's aspects or that's what i assume santa must be to be going up against satan this movie is one long huh from start to finish and it'll make you wonder if that <UNK> you <UNK> wasn't <UNK> or something probably it was since this movie is like one long giant <UNK>
<START> dressed to kill is brian <UNK> best film an absolute thrill ride of suspense humor and style that remains <UNK> today <UNK> has a bum rap in hollywood as most people claim that he rips off alfred hitchcock he does not hitchcock could only dream of what <UNK> shows in his thrillers br br sadly the original uncut version of dressed to kill is no longer available on video the current copy released by <UNK> is the jack <UNK> <UNK> r rated cut but some copies of <UNK> original cut still exist it is the one distributed by warner home video in both a green cardboard box with angie dickinson on the cover or in a black <UNK> case with the theatrical poster on silver <UNK> these are the ones to get if you can find a copy i have the green one and it is among my <UNK> <UNK> br br anyway back to the story dickinson plays kate miller a sexually frustrated wife who is being treated by dr robert elliott michael caine for her obsessive fantasies while on a trip to the museum a real tour de force for <UNK> in terms of camera work and suspense br br miller is picked up by a stranger you can pretty much guess what happens to her since the ads and box art give away the story but there are a few complications a hooker nancy allen is the sole witness to the murder kate <UNK> son peter keith gordon is a teenage genius determined to solve the crime and dr <UNK> answering machine has a certain message on it about a missing razor br br i'm not spoiling the film at all for you since what i have described above takes place within the opening half hour and <UNK> biggest surprises are reserved for the last hour this film is explicit however enough for <UNK> head of the mpaa to demand cuts in the film what surprises me is what cuts he wanted several cuts in the opening shower scene and one or two <UNK> scenes and some of nancy allen's dialogue <UNK> wanted <UNK> changed to <UNK> this is a film that is very violent and bloody yet the <UNK> are to sexual content i'd love to hear <UNK> <UNK> at how seeing two women in a tender love scene in lost and delirious is somehow more <UNK> to a young mind than arnold <UNK> blowing away people with a chain gun it just isn't fair br br what makes dressed to kill so good is that not only are the technical credits first rate but the performances are very good as well michael caine who was in a lot of crap in this time period gives one of his best performances as the doctor angie dickinson is better than usual possibly because she actually has a strong role here nancy allen adds this to her range of performances that has her <UNK> as one of the most underrated and overlooked actresses in the world keith gordon is wonderful as the genius and i loved all those <UNK> of his br br <UNK> is one of our best directors who has never received the recognition he deserved the recent joke of the <UNK> 100 best thrillers list showed that very few people actually know what a thriller is if they were to actually open their eyes for once they would see that <UNK> has <UNK> his career in thrillers and is actually the best <UNK> this is even better than psycho it's a shame that very few actually know that br br out of 4 stars
<START> boom has garnered itself a something of a reputation with <UNK> taylor burton <UNK> coward <UNK> williams and joseph <UNK> one might be tempted to think how bad could it be well it's a lot worse than you could possibly imagine br br the sad and disturbing fact of boom is that is seems to <UNK> the decline and fall of the aforementioned <UNK> it was only director joseph <UNK> who having <UNK> the depths with modesty blaise and boom some may wish to add secret ceremony managed to <UNK> and in 1970 create his best work the wonderful go between br br saddest of all is the work of <UNK> williams from the mid forties until the early sixties williams penned a number of plays which have gained classic status remaining in theater <UNK> throughout the world many becoming much praised films when <UNK> <UNK> deserted him probably <UNK> to his notorious substance abuse it deserted him for good williams at his best is an actor's dream providing many unforgettable performances were <UNK> <UNK> or deborah kerr ever better than in night of the <UNK> taylor in particular <UNK> in both cat on a hot tin roof and suddenly last summer there is an <UNK> in which supposedly taylor asks john gielgud whether he would teach her to play shakespeare to which he <UNK> if you will teach me to play <UNK> williams had gielgud seen boom he would have held his tongue taylor simply has never been worse turning in a cringe inducing performance despite her face <UNK> well she is decidedly <UNK> besides the physical decline from this time <UNK> she would basically lose credibility as a serious actress with a string of completely forgettable and worse roles to her credit br br much the same could be said of burton following his short lived theatrical stardom he won fame and fortune in hollywood but the body of his work from this point <UNK> 1968 would be <UNK> to say the least br br <UNK> coward had long <UNK> being a force in the theater where his drawing room comedies had been replaced by the likes of williams and the british angry young men he seems to be enjoying himself camping it up but barely manages to <UNK> that from the man who claimed such a talent br br the only cast member who maintains her dignity is young joanna <UNK> who in a few years would <UNK> a promising screen career to become mrs sidney <UNK> br br boom <UNK> of self <UNK> it's simply out of control a rather sad <UNK> to careers gone wrong rather than a camp fun fest as some have suggested
<START> this is an awful film <UNK> the girls are pretty but its not very good the plot having a cowboy get involved with an indian maiden would be interesting if the sex didn't get in the way well okay it might be interesting but its not because its so badly paced and and only partly acted i can only imagine what the close ups of the dancing <UNK> looked like on a big screen probably more laughable then they do on tv i won't even mention the topless knife fight between two women who are tied together and spend the whole thing chest to chest never read about that in the old west this is a film that requires liberal use of fast forward br br i like schlock films but this is ridiculous there is a reason that i don't go for this sort of films and that they tend not be very good the plot taking a back seat to breasts the original <UNK> <UNK> as they are called were originally <UNK> films or films where there was no touching but as the adult industry began to grow the film makers either tried to be clever or tried to exploit something else in order to put <UNK> in seats the clever ones were very few which only left <UNK> who were of limited talent the comedies often came off best with the humor approaching the first grade level <UNK> but <UNK> fun something that could rarely be said about any other genre cross dressed as a <UNK> br br the <UNK> looks good and has a couple of nice pieces but its done in by being neither western nor sex film br br i need not watch this again br br of interest to probably no one the rapist and killer in the film was played by bobby <UNK> a member of the <UNK> family who was arrested for murdering a school teacher not long after filming wrapped br br obviously these sort of things will ruin some peoples lives
<START> this first part of the <UNK> trilogy has more passion and plot <UNK> than lola but less of the magic of <UNK> <UNK> the political <UNK> have point to them we see the <UNK> after the war how the <UNK> were able to control so much of the day to day life delicious moment when fassbinder playing a <UNK> tries to sell a complete set of <UNK> to <UNK> who remarks that burning books don't provide much warmth she really wants <UNK> br br there's some <UNK> in the first hour the scene in <UNK> room with the black soldier interrupted by <UNK> appearance should go <UNK> the train scene when maria meets karl <UNK> falls flat when she insults the <UNK> i <UNK> it was so bad but as the story develops and the years go by i was drawn more and more into this glossy cold world
<START> mr michael jackson is an artistic phenomenon his short movies i e music videos are simply the best i do not care if i get a sane sci fi feature from this man but i do care to get a <UNK> of his crazy dancing <UNK> yells cool crowd choreography and some bits of cgi and animation there also should be a few <UNK> videos everything i've mentioned is here stupid plot and over the top vanity fair are not a problem when i witness mr michael jackson in action to me he will always be the ultimate king of music videos not king of pop which sounds moronic especially for us russians because pop sounds like the russian word for <UNK> and <UNK> is definitely not king of <UNK> i can re watch his best music videos which are artistically beautiful and i never get tired of them br br my first impression of this film was what is this bits of different videos some drawn images unsettling jumps from one theme to another absence of any cohesive plot line some kids <UNK> around etc but as i watched it till the end i could tell that it was great and really nothing like anything else shown on tv nowadays what i like here too is that it never shows any shameful material and can be watched by kids easily br br without mr michael jackson the universe of music videos would be rather poor even the best classic videos of other artists cannot come very close to the energetic <UNK> of <UNK> musical insanity and artistic quality he knew how to get the audience of different ages and he knew how to remain a man with moral principles br br when i see a proper dvd release with mr michael jackson videos i know that it deserves to be purchased even if some clips have already appeared in some other previous release history i history ii and <UNK> are all great though only <UNK> is more like one movie with a solid smooth criminal theme <UNK> topic and a few weird spoofs and twists br br being no fan of <UNK> i can still give this film like no other a solid 9 out of 10 i've been hit by smooth criminal for sure and my major complains are the following initial segments of the movie could have been dropped while the main <UNK> anti drug campaign should have been given more sky <UNK> insanity and stress and there should have been more <UNK> itself of course thanks for attention
<START> the husband and wife team of <UNK> fields and <UNK> <UNK> were huge stars in vaudeville yet they made very few films as is the case for some other performers of their era george m <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lawrence the most accessible piece of film footage for fields and <UNK> is the biopic about them in which they're portrayed by other actors <UNK> loves <UNK> starring betty <UNK> and that <UNK> song and dance man ralph <UNK> br br in their <UNK> fields and <UNK> were so hugely popular that another husband and wife vaudeville act jesse block and eve <UNK> achieved nearly as much stardom performing an almost identical act effectively becoming the second team fields and <UNK> <UNK> though there was a major difference in the <UNK> living <UNK> fields and <UNK> lived in hotel <UNK> paying room service rates for every meal they ate and eventually running out of money block and <UNK> lived <UNK> and invested their <UNK> wisely ending in comfortable retirement br br the first 30 seconds of this <UNK> short are occupied by two <UNK> wearing <UNK> apparently these two men had some slight name value of their own in 1930 although i've never heard of them finally fields and <UNK> rush in and start performing they both have plenty of <UNK> and she's fairly attractive br br i was annoyed that both performers keep making movements as if they're about to break into a dance but they never quite do so until the third of the three songs they perform in this short when they finally start <UNK> the results are not impressive br br i was delighted to have this opportunity to see these two major performers doing their <UNK> act now that i've seen it i understand why they never became stars in movie musicals my rating for this one just 4 out of 10 and i'll stick with block and <UNK>
<START> twisted desire 1996 was a tv movie starring melissa joan hart <UNK> character jennifer <UNK> a <UNK> year old <UNK> her current boyfriend nick ryan into murdering her two parents the movie is based on the 1990 murders of the parents of 14 year old jessica <UNK> jessica had her 17 year old boyfriend douglas christopher thomas shoot and kill her parents thomas was executed in 2000 jessica was released from prison when she turned 21 years old evidence now suggests that it was jessica who fired the fatal shot that killed her mother jessica is known to now be <UNK> somewhere in the state of virginia
<START> i first heard of <UNK> 2 when i drove past a cinema when i was on holiday in america i really did not take much notice of it until i bought the original on dvd which led me to find out about its three sequels i subsequently started to read about the return on the imdb and asked friends what they thought of it despite their horrific criticisms of it i still went out of my way to see it and was on the brink of buying it until i saw it for hire on dvd i wasn't expecting much but thought that it must have been half decent to get a theatrical release in the us after all how often is it that you see van damme on the big screen well nothing could have prepared me for this it is so bad i almost cried what a total waste of 80 minutes and <UNK> 50 it is hard to explain how bad this move is honestly this is idiotic film making no it's more than idiotic i just cannot believe how this got made i cannot believe that someone out there has not murdered <UNK> rogers how stupid can people possibly be firstly van damme actually thinking the script and finished film was good secondly the fact that <UNK> <UNK> of terminator 2 and air force one status <UNK> himself to this film i simply cannot believe the stupidity of this movie it takes itself so seriously but comes across to the audience like a spoof here is an example <UNK> daughter yes luc is now a human again i want my daddy seth so do i oh yeah and some guy tries to shut down seth by pulling three huge <UNK> with wait for it on and off written on them the acting all round is like <UNK> acting i'm sure mr director <UNK> <UNK> reporter girlfriend on april <UNK> from the cartoon teenage mutant hero <UNK> she refuses to go because she ' needs her <UNK> i mean come on how many cliches can a film possibly use please listen to me fellow imdb users don't touch this with a <UNK> pole to conclude universal soldier the return has no relation whatsoever to the first movie in fact if they weren't called <UNK> then you would never know it was a sequel luc is now a human again what the hell the only place in which he can access the internet is in a <UNK> all the new <UNK> <UNK> look like they were dragged off the street they are that unconvincing this is pure torture to watch so do yourself a favour don't torture yourself p s best part of the movie romeo jumps off a building and shouts <UNK> sh <UNK>
<START> ugh where to begin first campbell scott's non stop angst becomes a real turn off after awhile a very short while as he <UNK> his <UNK> anguish curiosity and anger only we don't care these characters as presented by the writer and director are wholly unlikable and <UNK> lies the key they haven't given us anything to make us care if they are <UNK> and whether or not they are still in love with one another when scott quietly tells his wife i could kill you before their three daughters at the dinner table after the shock of his <UNK> poor timing wore off i almost wished that he had and then done the same thing to the smug <UNK> <UNK> of denis <UNK> before being <UNK> off the the looney bin an utter waste of time and perhaps only perhaps resources
<START> first of all do not call this a remake of the <UNK> film even though this version is <UNK> to the stage play it is extremely long the casting was good with some exceptions <UNK> phillips was not a good casting choice she was almost 30 when she did this film and it was hard to believe she was a teenager jason alexander was good choice but after a while he gave me a headache <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> her part as mae peterson george <UNK> was funny as harry <UNK> and showed he could even hold a tune like the <UNK> film they casted an unknown to play conrad <UNK> marc <UNK> had fun with his role as <UNK> and it showed i even have the soundtrack and i love listening to his singing so what made this a tv ratings flop it was lengthy for one they put in new songs and scenes even though some of the new songs were good like let's settle down was it really necessary now don't get me wrong i liked it but i rather watch the <UNK> film see my review this was just a case of some actors <UNK> roles making some changes and once again length one more thing i forgot to mention is vanessa williams she does a good job with the role and the music give her any lyrics and she could sing them so here is my advice coming from someone who's done a couple productions of bye bye <UNK> if you want to watch an entertaining take on the play watch the <UNK> film if you want to watch a version that is <UNK> to the play watch the <UNK> version just take it in <UNK> though don't be a hero and try watch it all in one sitting
<START> many of the reviews and comments i have read about this movie say that this is a rather stale film and performance by clara bow although the story line was rather typical of <UNK> later <UNK> i still find it somewhat heart stirring and incredibly fun clara plays a happy go lucky <UNK> girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she loves never mind that this man is married <UNK> lack of modesty was shocking in the day but i believe it lends to the <UNK> and general fun of the movie though definitely not a brilliant story line quite typical actually this movie is a nice showcase of <UNK> ability to make the audience laugh
<START> the sopranos is arguably the greatest show in dramatic television history br br its hard to think of another series that boasts so much intelligence sublime writing or first rate performances br br across its epic scope it produces fresh and iconic characters and a constant level of high quality <UNK> around the life of one tony soprano a man who lives in two families one is the conventional wife and two kids nuclear family the other a huge new jersey mafia group of which he is the boss of both played by james gandolfini of true romance and the mexican fame tony is a fascinating scary but also likable guy full praise must be given to gandolfini for making a <UNK> and <UNK> aggressive <UNK> a genuinely <UNK> and perfect leading man <UNK> american drama has never had such an <UNK> and iconic figure as tony br br the cast of hundreds never boasts a flat performance and such stand out characters like paulie <UNK> and ralph <UNK> will stick in your memory for ever br br the true genius of this tale however is the creator and writers bravery and revolutionary take on a conventional drama series twenty minute long dream sequences powerful and original use of symbolism and <UNK> imagery and truly shocking scenes of violence yet all this style is met by truly touching themes of love honour and respect for family the series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitous br br with tv now <UNK> and often poor the sopranos stands tall above the rest as america's most original and compelling drama forget family <UNK> this is television <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dick powell wins a studio contract and goes to hollywood he stays at <UNK> hotel of course at the same time big <UNK> star <UNK> marshall lola lane has a <UNK> and refuses to attend the premiere of her new picture in a panic the studio hires <UNK> virginia <UNK> lane to <UNK> her and have <UNK> take her to the premiere not telling him it's not marshall naturally they fall in love you can pretty much figure out the rest of the plot yourself br br the plot is old to put it nicely but powell and <UNK> lane make a very likable pair and have beautiful singing voices the score is good <UNK> by <UNK> for hollywood and director busby berkeley shows off his unique visuals in a really fun drive in musical sequence with edgar kennedy doing his <UNK> slow burn also glenda farrell has a few funny bits as <UNK> sister <UNK> br br still the movie isn't that good the rest of the cast <UNK> <UNK> and most of the humor is just not funny lola lane especially is just lousy trying to play <UNK> for comedy also there is racism a stereotypical black maid is played for laughs and there's some truly appalling racist humor at one point that's probably what keeps this off tv most of the time i realize it was accepted at the time but it comes across as revolting today br br all in all a so so movie with some serious problems helped by a good cast and some great songs i give it a 7
<START> i wasn't sure how to rate this movie since it was so bad it was actually very funny i'm not a gackt fan by any means though he is talented despite the weird <UNK> that sounds like a cat <UNK> up a <UNK> i always thought hyde was talented though faith is an interesting album br br but on topic here folks this movie is ridiculous it's so over the top and nonsensical it's almost like a parody of supernatural action films br br the movie has almost no plot here except it's just about vampires with gangster friends in a way this film almost reminded me of spider man 3 with how there were too many ideas which resulted in not enough time to pay attention on one of them br br the action scenes were laughable quickly edited almost hard to understand with choreography that's so laughably bad though hyde looked very stylish during the action scenes but that's this film's only such redemption i'm a sucker for good action movies but the action was horribly done though the final shootout was ok and the highlight of this otherwise depressing movie br br it keeps jumping between genres not a good thing it wants to be a drama or an action flick or a horror or a romance what the hell br br if this review is making you mad why is it because gackt and hyde are your love don't fool yourself this movie is bad
<START> oh for crying out loud this has got to be the <UNK> movie i've seen all year and i'm sorry the normally awesome john cusack was even involved in this brainless <UNK> piece of stupidity where <UNK> in seattle delivered what amounts to be the same message albeit on a more subtle somewhat more mature level <UNK> delivers it with a <UNK> and then proceeds to pound it into your psyche for the next tedious hour and a half or so and that's an hour and a half of my life i'll never get back again thank you very much it's bad enough the main characters of this movie have the emotional maturity level of <UNK> year olds actually i've known better <UNK> year olds except maybe for jeremy <UNK> who was enjoyable enough just the first 15 minutes or so of the movie where kate <UNK> character plays that annoying silliness of a game about throwing all sensibility to the wind literally had my best friend and i irritated beyond belief i told my husband <UNK> had more intelligence and at least the characters in <UNK> weren't half as dysfunctional as the idiots were in this <UNK> mess it's annoying to watch protagonists who seem to have no clue about choice in their lives and feel they're nothing more than puppets to destiny and the <UNK> of fate how utterly tiresome i'm sure this movie will be more likely enjoyed by those who'd rather not engage in the chaotic <UNK> of making more complex life choices and then <UNK> living with the consequences after all here's a movie where our hero and heroine live happily ever after only after <UNK> havoc and misery on two other people's lives namely their respective <UNK> not to mention other relatives and friends just to get there br br

<START> i wasn't born until 4 years after this wonderful show first aired but luckily i managed to catch the reruns of the mid 90's and the rest is history i was hooked the premise was pretty simple two hardened nemesis agents richard <UNK> and craig <UNK> william <UNK> and stuart damon are <UNK> up with an expert if not young doctor and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to head behind the <UNK> curtain to retrieve a dangerous <UNK> agent from being used by red china whilst making their escape their plane is hit by machine gun fire and they crash in the heart of the <UNK> where their lives are saved by a mysterious and previously <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> and enhance the senses of the trio thus setting the scene for many exciting adventures to come br br the series lasted for 30 hour long episodes and i guess it was its relatively short lived one season run that has set it up for cult status br br monty <UNK> the producer was notorious for making things as cheaply as possible and sometimes the show suffered for this with incredibly tacky sets particularly in episodes such as happening a studio <UNK> for the australian <UNK> and the <UNK> sets of operation deep freeze and the beginning but if you can get past this and focus on the characters and the story lines the show was really a lot of fun it had a great mix of adventure and plenty of deadpan humour mainly from some terrific one liners from william <UNK> br br the chemistry from the three leads was fantastic you get the sense that they were really having a lot of fun making the show and this is <UNK> out in the 2005 reunion documentary where the three reunite after over 35 years to <UNK> about the show and laugh about anthony <UNK> awful wig they all shared equal screen time and all had their moments to shine i have to say i was always a richard <UNK> fan i loved his <UNK> humour along with that dangerous edge he was certainly a man you didn't cross and those eyes the <UNK> eyes you would probably see on tv i have also followed bill <UNK> career with interest since however craig <UNK> certainly would have had his legion of female fans and i am sure alexandra <UNK> had a whole <UNK> of male fans <UNK> over her too br br the show also had a <UNK> of guest stars to <UNK> with including donald sutherland jeremy brett peter <UNK> burt <UNK> anton <UNK> kate <UNK> jenny <UNK> paul <UNK> and colin <UNK> br br notable episodes for me were auto kill the <UNK> the fanatics the mission and the <UNK> cage but i am sure every one has their personal favourites br br if you do get a chance to watch this show for the first time or to re watch it after many years remember to watch it in the context of the time it was made and just sit back and enjoy the characters and the chemistry from the three leads is what made this wonderful show for me and i don't think i will ever tire of it br br enjoy
<START> this is the kind of film for a snowy sunday afternoon when the rest of the world can go ahead with its own business as you <UNK> into a big arm chair and <UNK> for a couple of hours wonderful performances from cher and nicolas cage as always gently row the plot along there are no <UNK> to cross no dangerous waters just a warm and witty <UNK> through new york life at its best a family film in every sense and one that deserves the praise it received
<START> what a fascinating film even if it wasn't based on real life forbidden lies was a fascinating portrait of a con artist in her element and it is the kind of film psychology students could study to learn about <UNK> <UNK> br br the author of forbidden love norma was revealed as a fraud in the media but this move really does give her ample opportunity to clear her name br br but the twists and turns she takes the documentary maker through are amazing what a patient woman i loved this movie i have not read the book but simply heard good reviews and went to see it on boring rainy afternoon the journey this film takes you on is clever interesting and totally engrossing
<START> born raised and educated in scotland i was appalled at this disgusting portrayal of a man who was no more nor less than a cattle <UNK> worse yet the thread of the entire movie was sex in one form or another by <UNK> or <UNK> to view it one would think that 18th century scotland was populated by a bunch of sex <UNK> and <UNK> lange was a joke acting as the young mother at age <UNK> but liam neeson was even worse taking a bath in a scottish <UNK> is not <UNK> as they portrayed him but it did give them yet another opportunity to demonstrate how sexually driven we were save your money and watch <UNK>
<START> dr <UNK> what can i say jeffrey combs has done it again br br anton <UNK> has been on earth for 100 years waiting for <UNK> an evil <UNK> to come so he can kill him <UNK> and <UNK> used to train together as kids so <UNK> knows all <UNK> tricks br br the film as a little bit confusing at begin with but soon you feel a part of the action i won't give away the ending so go and watch doctor <UNK> br br i found the film to be very enjoyable because it doesn't have a lot of violence in nor sexual scenes the film focused on the plot and that's what i like i find the best films are the ones where times seems to fly by this is because you are so <UNK> in the film doctor <UNK> is a <UNK> engrossing movie i give it a 20 out of 10 worth seeing br br
<START> i am very surprised by the positive comments because there were four of us that saw this at one screening and we all walked out we personally felt that it was painfully slow to watch and couldn't sit through the whole movie and we really tried to stick with it in particular those in the group who really wanted to like it because of their personal experiences with sexual <UNK> alienation in the school years depicted didn't like or identify with it at all br br that said it is great to see that this film really <UNK> with a lot of people here on the boards and with reviewers that's the beauty of the <UNK> art form of film
<START> the bat people is a really bad film that deserved the mst3k treatment just as well like that other film the <UNK> terror br br in it we are in some sort of <UNK> <UNK> full of bats we see many things happen like bats flying out and attacking and stuff station <UNK> chases <UNK> at the <UNK> room and much more all this plus the cheesy mediocrity of the 1970s hey think mitchell here making the bat people actually one of the very best of the last mystery science theater 3000 episodes made in the series <UNK> it's awful it should be avoided like the plague unless tom <UNK> and crow are watching with you br br the bat people more like the bad people lol br br 1 10 of course
<START> a routine mystery thriller concerning a killer that <UNK> in the <UNK> during the early days of television this one was shown so often when dad would say what's on tv tonight and we'd tell him <UNK> of the swamp he'd pack us off to the movies we went to the movies a lot in those days

<UNK> and edited such classic titles as a better tomorrow 1 2 <UNK> <UNK> and the cult hit the <UNK> is quite simply a work of genius his <UNK> of the perfectly choreographed high flying tree climbing sword fights makes them some of the best hk cinema has ever created fast moving outlandish but never confusing they are even today the <UNK> of their art br br the crew of <UNK> have also done <UNK> this is a film where every shot is an expertly crafted painting where wonderful blue <UNK> night sequences <UNK> in an ever present ghostly fog are the breathtaking platform for our story to unfold it's a film where everything is used to <UNK> a <UNK> beauty even the <UNK> <UNK> and dresses worn by <UNK> <UNK> become living parts of the movie whether in romantic sequences or battle scenes the ever present <UNK> flows across the screen even a simple scene where <UNK> <UNK> changes <UNK> is turned into a thing of <UNK> beauty as every skill on the set combines to create a most memorable scene from such a simple act the sets are also amazing giving an other <UNK> sense to the <UNK> and the temple and <UNK> to the <UNK> flag filled <UNK> of hell for the amazing finale the production design by <UNK> <UNK> deserves the highest praise br br another major factor to the films success is the music by romeo diaz and james wong hong kong films have given us some fantastic music and songs that have added so much to the success of a sequence but on a chinese ghost <UNK> the music is quite simply vital from the opening song <UNK> the music becomes as important as the characters br br the score is a perfect mixture of modern and traditional <UNK> drums <UNK> and <UNK> pound away over the action sequences to great effect but it's in the slower <UNK> romantic pieces that it comes into it's own here <UNK> strings and female <UNK> effects create what are possibly the finest pieces of music heard in an hk film add to this the female vocal stunningly beautiful song that plays over <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> love making nothing is ever seen but the effect is wonderful this is lovingly innocent movie romance and you have a shining example of the power a film's music can have br br and we of course have the acting talent leslie cheung a better tomorrow 1 <UNK> and a very popular singer is outstanding as the innocent tax collector his work in the thankfully mild comic sequences is never over the top and his scenes with joey wang are played with just the right amount of passion and innocence br br joey wang who would later be mostly <UNK> to support roles in films like the <UNK> <UNK> fat andy <UNK> classic god of <UNK> has never looked more <UNK> than how she does here she is the epitome of <UNK> beauty her portrayal of the tragic <UNK> <UNK> is stunning she shows her characters sadness at what she has become and what she is made to do but also gives off a subtle <UNK> in the scenes where she is <UNK> the men to their gruesome deaths veteran actor wu ma mr <UNK> <UNK> is great fun as the wise brave but ever so grumpy <UNK> he <UNK> a fine line between the eccentric and the annoying with <UNK> ease and what so easily could have been a character that could have <UNK> the film is actually wonderfully entertaining and memorable br br but what about the monsters and <UNK> i hear you cry well they range from the rather crude but fun stop motion <UNK> zombies that inhabit the temple resulting in a great running gag with constantly <UNK> attempts to <UNK> on the <UNK> unsuspecting <UNK> <UNK> to the rather cheesy but surprisingly effective lord black complete with an <UNK> of vicious flying heads and quite outstanding wire work most of which has to this day never been topped br br but the most outstanding effect and creation is the tree <UNK> killer tongue we first encounter this thing with an evil <UNK> style <UNK> camera effect as it powers down its victims throats to deliver a lethal french kiss that turns the victims into <UNK> <UNK> but later it's shown in all its crazy glory it can grow so big and long that it shoots through the forest after prey rips apart trees <UNK> itself around buildings and <UNK> it's slimy length around people before picking them up and throwing them against tree <UNK> it can even split open to reveal a <UNK> filled mouth it's an outrageous idea that given the deeply romantic main plot shouldn't work but it does to fantastic and unforgettable effect br br so what all this adds up to is a classic example of hong kong movie making a true team effort that has given us a truly ground breaking movie it's a film packed with wit invention action monsters martial arts ghosts fantastic ideas lush visuals beautiful music and most important to it's enduring charm one of cinemas most moving romances
<START> <UNK> unleashed is the worst thing that could happen to the classic characters created by chuck jones the loony tunes have many spin offs and different versions some were good others not very much but <UNK> it's the worst the concept is stupid and derivative of shows as the power rangers and teen <UNK> there wasn't any similarity with the original characters and the stories are boring and poorly made the new designs are ugly and the animation is pathetic this show just doesn't work this horrible waste of animation is a complete failure and this shouldn't have be nothing more than a bad joke lame zero stars
<START> this amazing oscar winner 4 in total and john ford's first academy award winner is simply <UNK> with a <UNK> score by max <UNK> called an art film because ford had very little money to make this great story about guilt and <UNK> and greed and stupidity but what makes this movie such a classic is the direction and astounding photography and use of fog and lighting that was so different from the usual american film and more in the tradition of german <UNK> and the oscar winning performance by victor mclaglen as the drunken gypo is simply unbelievable basically the movie takes place in ireland and gypo turns in a friend in the rebel movement to the english to collect 20 pounds to give to his girlfriend but having all that money he starts blowing it on an all night drunk and giving it away while the leaders of the movement are trying to track down the informer the whole movie is one night in a dark and <UNK> ireland and a cast of characters that are memorable but all along the whole world of gypo is closing in on him both psychologically if i had to pick maybe three directors to have all their movies on a deserted island forever and nobody <UNK> john ford would certainly be one of them what a truly remarkable movie
<START> i have never understood the appeal of this show the acting is poor debra jo <UNK> being a notable exception the plots of most episodes are trite and uninspiring the dialogue is weak the jokes unfunny and it is painful to try and sit through even half an episode furthermore the link between this show and the <UNK> is extremely <UNK> beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old unfunny clichéd scripts that modern sitcoms have dressed up as depicting a show from twenty years ago in the hope that it will gain some nostalgic viewers or something like that both happy days and the wonder years employ the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to watch in contrast to this horrible pathetic excuse for a show
<START> i love dracula but this movie was a complete disappointment i remember lee from other dracula films from when i was younger and i thought he was great but this movie was really bad i don't know if it was my youth that fooled me into believing lee was the ultimate dracula with style looks attraction and the evil underneath that or maybe it was just this film that disappointed me br br but can you imagine dracula with an <UNK> english accent and the body language to go along with it do you like when a plot contains unrealistic choices by the characters and is boring and lacks any kind of tension then this is a movie for you br br otherwise don't see it i only gave it a 2 because somehow i managed to stay awake during the whole movie br br sorry but if you liked this movie then you must have been sleep <UNK> and home alone in a dark room with lots of <UNK> space behind you maybe alone in your parents house or in a strangers home cause not even the characters in this flick seemed afraid and i think that sums up the whole thing br br or maybe you like this film because of it's place in dracula cinema history perhaps being fascinated by how the dracula story has evolved from <UNK> to what it is today cause as movie it isn't that appealing it doesn't pull you in to the suggestive mystery that for me make the <UNK> myth so fascinating br br and furthermore it has so much of that tacky <UNK> feel about it the scenery looks like cheap theatre and i don't say that <UNK> everything made in the <UNK> cause i can love old film as well as new
<START> this movie had the potential to be a decent horror movie the main character was <UNK> done and i felt sorry for him and there was a decent amount of <UNK> however everything else sucks the director <UNK> is quite incompetent at film making he uses some of the most idiotic shots ever br br a couple of random sequences of random images <UNK> throughout the film i don't know if he tried to be deep and intelligent and poetic but he wasn't it was stupid random shots of the trailer the main character lived in random buildings random pan shots of buildings random cat which walks away wtf and clouds lots of gloomy dark clouds br br he really liked this technique of having a scene cut up into different shots rather than being just one continuous shot ex guy is trying to light his <UNK> and the camera circles around him instead of just one shot he edits it into like 10 different shots so its really edgy and hip and smart stupid br br the acting is horrible but it's what makes the movie so funny and the scarecrow is a <UNK> cause he <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> all the time and some of the deaths could have been better you expect the main bully to have a long well built up death but nope a simple <UNK> in the ear the love interest was hot <UNK> which is why this movie gets a 2
<START> this movie is not only boring it is also really badly done the graphics are so bad they are not even second rate they are dreadful the characters do not show any facial <UNK> the voice acting is empty and without any soul and the plot absolutely lacks well anything and everything my 5 year old likes it but thinks it's a bit boring i agree with him
<START> this is the last dutch language film paul verhoeven made before going on to make mainstream hollywood films basic instinct <UNK> and total recall among others he sets the stage by opening this story with a black widow spider catching prey in her web before we meet gerard <UNK> an annoying self centered writer with a morbid imagination gerard has been invited to be the guest <UNK> at a literary club meeting in sea side town an hour or so from <UNK> verhoeven lets us have glimpses of how <UNK> imagination twists reality asked if writers are a bit close to insanity he admits when he reads the newspaper and it says <UNK> i read <UNK> ' when it says <UNK> i read <UNK> ' when it says <UNK> i see <UNK> ' when he tells a story enough times he begins to believe it i lie the truth he accepts an offer to be the overnight guest of the club <UNK> a beautiful wealthy <UNK> owner as he gets to know her and learns her husband has died he begins to imagine she is 'a black widow ' is this his more of his reality twist or is she a <UNK> this is a psychological drama and in <UNK> which of these old films have stuck in my memory i figured out is my favorite gender looking at his body of work it is seems to be paul verhoeven's too and he is a master in making us question our own understanding of reality it's a nice change of pace from the usual hollywood fare i saw it in 1983 and it is a film that stuck
<START> <UNK> <UNK> once wrote that god gave to all people the ability to love the whole world but given that a human heart is very small in size every human has that special place that he loves more than any other it seems to me that this may have been the <UNK> of some of the most <UNK> directors of today when they set out to <UNK> the eternal love for that special place and depict situations in the lives of its <UNK> and <UNK> the result is a wonderful collection of short films paris je t'aime in which our <UNK> van <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> payne and others take us on a breathtaking <UNK> through <UNK> <UNK> human feelings <UNK> and expectations br br always some other quarter always some utterly moving story about ordinary people in search for love be it in a parking lot art studio tube station and paris je t'aime is about vast array of loves love for one's partner child parent for those who meant the world to us but are no longer around love that needs <UNK> <UNK> love for that stranger as your eyes meet or love that just is not meant to be today but tomorrow who knows br br nevertheless this film is not solely about love but life itself joy pain loneliness confusion everyday ups and downs and its most important quality is the fact that it is not <UNK> at all but rather warm and full of hope br br i give this film a 9 because the final section of it suggests how some of the stories might further develop but not all of them and that is the thing that i find missing and by further development i do not mean some specific reference to the characters' future as far as everything else is concerned i can only say captivating makes you want to leave everything behind you flee to paris and live those little romances yourself
<START> in the beginning of this film one of the <UNK> says that he was told that he has two strikes against him he is black and male but in addition to that he has a third strike he's gay you're going to have to be stronger than you ever imagined he is told paris is burning is a documentary about gay black and hispanic men who are <UNK> or <UNK> br br the miracle of paris is burning is that director <UNK> <UNK> takes a subject that could have very easily become a freak show and allows the people in it their humanity we learn their views of homosexuality men women their hopes their <UNK> their dreams some of these dreams are so <UNK> it's tragic many of the people are seriously in denial br br this is not a film for everyone there are shots in this movie of nude <UNK> if you have a problem with homosexuality then this movie isn't for you but if you do see this movie you'll realise paris is burning isn't really about men wearing women's clothes it's about a group of people who are <UNK> <UNK> and put down by society at large and what they do to get a sense of community in their lives br br i've watched this movie four times since it was released in 1991 because it says so many things it's a commentary about <UNK> in our culture about gender roles about rich and poor people about the media and what it <UNK> about fame and <UNK> paris is burning is one of the most <UNK> and one of the saddest movies i've ever seen
<START> if you like films about school bullies brave children hilarious <UNK> and worm eating then how to eat fried worms will appeal to you br br the film is about a boy named billy who when arriving on his first day at a new school discovers that some of his classmates have played a prank on him by putting worms into his lunch the school bully joe and his team of friends start <UNK> billy and calling him worm boy br br billy decides to play along by saying that he eats worms all the time joe and his friends don't believe him but billy <UNK> them and <UNK> joe that he can eat ten worms in one day otherwise he will come to school with worms in his pants br br the boys take billy up on his bet leaving the weak <UNK> child with a mission to gain respect from his classmates by eating worms <UNK> fried or alive br br the film may sound gross but there are a lot of messages in it for one it portrays true friendship and how to accept people for who they are it also shows you why some bullies resort to bullying other children br br the film's protagonist billy is a strong minded and brave person who all of us can relate to it is easy to empathize with him as we <UNK> cheer for him to reach his goal even though we might not always agree with what he's doing or the choices he makes br br the children in the film are portrayed exactly how children are in real life and the film deserves a lot of credit for that the child actors are the stars of this show showing true emotion and feeling than most other children's movies portray br br some adults may not enjoy this film but kids will perhaps even teenagers br br there are hardly any other good movies on circuit at the moment so if you're not in the mood to see snakes on a plane try worms on a plate in how to eat fried worms it is a feel good fun film and not just fear factor for kids
<START> this movie is practically impossible to describe the alternate title don't look up is a lot more <UNK> like most japanese cinema the story is not as linear as american the story revolves around a director who is filming a story about a ww2 <UNK> the set is haunted by an actress who died during the filming of a tv show back in the 60s the director is the only one who saw this show if you have seen <UNK> the director <UNK> <UNK> is the same and liked it you'll like ghost actress i loved ghost actress a lot more than <UNK> a truly scary and disturbing movie a 10
<START> if the only sex you've ever had is with a farm animal then the tag line for this movie is probably still misleading br br this is by far one of the most boring movies i've had the pleasure to try and watch lately i found the dvd lying around at my friend's house and i made the sad mistake of not burning it br br i am unable to tell any details without spoiling the movie because there are only about 5 details to this movie just try to imagine someone making a movie about things on c span only the fictional movie is 10 times less interesting than the most boring debate on c span br br i think there is a conspiracy somewhere in this movie but i was unable to tell exactly what it was after i <UNK> my <UNK> out and threw them at richard gere
<START> murder and insurance fraud take an <UNK> couple to the end of the line br br tv was visually vulgar back in the early 1970s and this <UNK> made for tv knock off hurt my eyes it can't possibly compare to the 1944 billy wilder film noir classic as anyone in their right mind ought to know sight unseen but that doesn't mean this update should be seen as a separate <UNK> either although based on the original paramount screenplay there's over half an hour cut out and the director's bland indifference makes what's left <UNK> forgettable with rare exception the younger generation wasn't interested in watching old black and white movies on tv back in 1973 still true today alas so this lurid compelling tale was new to the overwhelming majority of viewers then as now ratings rule and <UNK> in was its only reel <UNK> <UNK> gus van <UNK> remade alfred hitchcock's psycho for similar reasons and if these <UNK> led to the seeking out of the original films or novels so much the better i loved the james m cain source novel enough to tune in back then and i enjoyed this time capsule <UNK> the second time around for the <UNK> hair <UNK> tops <UNK> ugly <UNK> and lush <UNK> locks of guest star samantha <UNK> who didn't try too hard in addition to <UNK> a few of the incidental cast from a childhood spent in front of the <UNK> tube lee j <UNK> was able to hold my interest as a world weary tired looking <UNK> but richard <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> walter <UNK> only reminded me of bill <UNK> on a bad day improvement upon the original was of course never intended in a rush to make a buck but instead of a mindless <UNK> a new adaptation of the novel would have been a novel idea <UNK> book <UNK> somewhat from its celluloid <UNK> and the horrific shark <UNK> in the <UNK> ending is killer the <UNK> in me is thankful this <UNK> up me decade update was included as part of the double <UNK> dvd extras but the experience not only made me long to see the original it had me nostalgic for any episode of the better made columbo tv series i also <UNK> back to a very good 1973 abc tv movie of the week that i haven't seen since its initial airing john d <UNK> linda starring the beautiful stella stevens as a ruthless femme fatale who murders her <UNK> sexy john <UNK> wife and then frames her mild mannered husband for the crime and if i remember correctly there's also an open ended ending like double <UNK> it was needlessly remade with tv movie queen virginia madsen as the titular <UNK> and richard thomas as the <UNK> husband
<START> this film was <UNK> in scandal for so long that it became a very sought after item the outrage the mystery etc it had everything to be a great piece of film making but ultimately fails in every extent it's a terribly bad comedy a pathetic horror movie a lame erotic film br br the 2 disc dvd includes a gorgeous <UNK> with stills interviews <UNK> on <UNK> etc as well as an extensive interview with the more than pretentious director for those who have heard about it but never seen it the package will seem fantastic until one actually sees the film disc 1 contains the edited film badly translated to english but with good visual quality disc 2 contains the director's cut in an awful transfer in french br br what can i say about the actual beast a hand puppet of <UNK> the frog would have been more effective and shocking
<START> for a danish movie i have to say that this is very good movie br br it's in a class of its own yet it has an international potential br br the movie has a big budget and is starring famous danish actors and a few <UNK> who play very well it can be watched by anyone who like adventures and a little bit of <UNK> movie br br don't be afraid be thrilled
<START> this is just typical bruce willis action movie <UNK> watch it with some popcorn and your buddies rent it to save money br br none of it is realistic the battles aren't realistic the soldiers aren't realistic the victims aren't realistic and why was tom <UNK> character talking to willis from the deck of the <UNK> what's up with that he can't do that from inside the ship br br of course bruce w gets a <UNK> wound there's a bunch of average explosions br br if this movie accurately represents the navy <UNK> then don't get stuck in africa expecting them to come rescue you br br the noble attack on the village bothered me the most front row seats to an ethnic <UNK> as bruce looks at the slaughter going on in town so what does he do he <UNK> into town on his belly yep how many died while they were <UNK> around oh well a body count was needed i guess br br and if that one african guy was so important why didn't he get on the <UNK> with the elderly and children can he say duh br br finally the movie was very dark not just in plot but so much happens at night it was difficult to make out what was going on br br rent it
<START> i really liked the film at ending i was in tears this film is incredible go watch the movie you will enjoy it i could have given it <UNK> more than 10 i liked the <UNK> between chance and sassy i like the <UNK> of shadow overall this movie was perfect br br its sequel is good but not good as this movie i think there should be a third sequel to it not only this film <UNK> children but also adults my whole family enjoyed this film chance was full of humor sassy is an intelligent cat br br again i say this movie is a must watch the more u see this movie the more you are attached with this movie this movie is a classic
<START> very rarely do i give less rave reviews on a show or film i dislike on imdb but mighty <UNK> power rangers is just so <UNK> dreadful it's terrible br br i wouldn't have minded if this had been an animated series would've been better that way i guess but as a live action show it <UNK> the terms <UNK> and <UNK> of which power rangers is five multi <UNK> <UNK> wearing teens battle evil by using their martial arts skills the costumes are horrid they look like something that is reminiscent of what track and field <UNK> and female <UNK> would wear the acting is <UNK> and the fight choreography is so shockingly bad and so lame to watch it makes jean claude van damme look as equally as good as bruce lee which is an understatement in itself in fact they look as if they are jumping and dancing about like it was some version of the <UNK> or they were doing ballet rather than fighting besides there are some cartoons that heavily feature martial arts and yet it is done in a fun yet not so cheesy way that makes it look silly br br kids show or not this is just so lame and on the verge of absurdity and even though this version is set in america you could be forgiven into thinking that as you watch some of the fight sequences that they were not filmed in the us but rather in japan thus the somewhat <UNK> fighting and footage was borrowed from the japanese version only to be <UNK> onto the us version br br if you like this type of thing then stick with <UNK> the japanese equivalent
<START> spoilers i guess br br the absolutely absurd logic of the ending ruins the entire movie i just couldn't get over it and what is wrong with mark <UNK> character if i suddenly found myself crashed landed on a planet full of talking apes i'd be all like <UNK> run for your lives the monkeys have inherited the earth but he's all like talking apes okay next that's pretty jaded i'd say he must run into even stranger things on a regular basis besides that this is rick <UNK> best work yet this film is a true testament to how far we've come in the monkey makeup field 3 10
<START> <UNK> <UNK> first giallo feature the night evelyn came out of the grave was a great combination of giallo and gothic horror and this second film is even better we've got more of the giallo side of the <UNK> this time around although <UNK> doesn't lose the gothic horror <UNK> that made the earlier film such a delight <UNK> puts more emphasis on the <UNK> details of the plot this time around and as a result it's the typical giallo <UNK> with characters all over the place and red herrings being thrown in every few minutes this is a definite bonus for the film however as while it can get a little too confusing at times there's always enough to hold the audience's interest and <UNK> storytelling has improved since his earlier movie the plot opens with a scene that sees two young girls fighting before their grandfather explains to them the legend behind a rather lurid painting in their castle the legend revolves around a woman called 'the red <UNK> who legend has it returns from the grave every hundred years and kills seven people a few years later murders begin to occur br br even though he only made two <UNK> <UNK> does have his own set of <UNK> it's obvious that the colour red is important to him as it features heavily in both films and he appears to have something against women called <UNK> he likes <UNK> gothic <UNK> and stylish murders too which is fine by me <UNK> may be no <UNK> when it comes to <UNK> blood but he certainly knows how to drop an over the top murder into his film and here we have <UNK> involving a <UNK> beetle and a death on an iron fence that is one of my all time favourite giallo death scenes the female side of the cast is excellent with the stunning barbara <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> heading up an eye pleasing cast of ladies that aren't afraid to take their clothes off the score courtesy of bruno <UNK> is catchy and even though it doesn't feature much of the psychedelic rock heard in the night evelyn came out of the grave it fits the film well the ending is something of a turn off as although <UNK> <UNK> up the gothic atmosphere it comes across as being more than a little bit rushed and the identity of the murderer is too obvious but even so this is a delightfully entertaining giallo and one that i highly recommend to fans of the genre
<START> boy this movie had me fooled i honestly thought it would be a campy horror film with absolutely no humor in it whatsoever boy i got the cold shoulder that time this movie was and i'm truthful pretty damn good it was not scary at all but the <UNK> and the sly humor really mad this movie interesting some to the horrible acting and cliché killings were so painful to watch i almost laughed at how bad it was but to some extent i enjoyed it the killings all vaguely relate to snow sports and christmas which made things more intriguing the <UNK> camera angles were awesome br br the movie is about a <UNK> killer who dies in a car accident <UNK> with a chemical truck while being transported to prison he is later <UNK> in that very same chemical with snow spliced into the mixture these were the ingredients chosen to make the perfect killer snowman he than takes his revenge as the snowman on the police officer who convicted him br br this movie had such bad acting with the exception of christopher <UNK> that is was funny i will say that i am also pretty disappointed that this movie was not a horror but in fact a dark sitcom they had a great story with a good plot but it wasn't executed right all in all i like the movie at first but now it is really annoying but this movie is way better and darker than the sequel
<START> after world war i an expedition representing the allied countries is sent to cambodia to stop the efforts of count <UNK> in creating a zombie like army of soldiers and <UNK> hoping to prevent a possible <UNK> of war due to <UNK> actions the group <UNK> through the jungle to <UNK> <UNK> in spite of the <UNK> the group includes <UNK> who has his own agenda contrary to the <UNK> wishes according to the dvd <UNK> synopsis br br heads up the zombie make up department <UNK> before the cameras started to roll br br also this revolt of the zombies has little to do with its supposed predecessor white zombie 1932 which starred bela lugosi if that film's zombies didn't thrill you this one's certainly won't a younger than usual dean jagger as <UNK> <UNK> stars as a man obsessive with blonde dorothy stone as claire <UNK> a couple supporting performances are good <UNK> roy <UNK> as <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> however neither are given enough material to really pull this one out of the <UNK> br br revolt of the zombies 1936 victor <UNK> dean jagger dorothy stone roy <UNK>
<START> whether it's three guys in their <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to a dude bound in <UNK> or a girl saying what up dog to a <UNK> of <UNK> there's something please everyone in <UNK> jones it is strange and surreal and not altogether a completely <UNK> yarn yet it never loses you the first time i saw it i nearly laughed myself sick and every night after i would come home and watch it again forget <UNK> ugly this is the movie that <UNK> my crush on <UNK> <UNK> see it before it's too late
<START> i only today picked this up at the 99 cents only store today and i still think i got ripped off dream to believe is a pretty boring and unrealistic <UNK> drama and 1 is just too <UNK> expensive for this this film is probably only notable for 2 things 1 it has a young keanu reeves and 2 it's directed by paul lynch the man who also did <UNK> night now onto the movie br br it's about a girl named robin played by olivia <UNK> who is badly injured from a car accident that also cost her father's life so the accident <UNK> her from competing in <UNK> <UNK> she is often picked on during her classes and eventually she meets some wild kid named tommy played by keanu robin when not in training works part time along with her mother and <UNK> at a <UNK> owned by her abusive <UNK> eventually she is chosen to compete br br overall keanu alone and some catchy 80s tunes are what prevent me from giving this 1 star and it's also not one of the worst movies ever but still far from good the dvd itself is not getting any <UNK> either as it appears to be <UNK> from an old vhs and towards the end the sound goes out of sync and when the end credits are almost over it fades to black even though sound can still be heard so this can probably be passed as a <UNK> the dvd artwork makes no sense either as it has what appears to be recent photos of keanu and olivia and the background has nothing to do with the movie as it's also not in the movie itself so the <UNK> obviously <UNK> in any case avoid at all costs unless you're a keanu fanatic i probably won't be hanging to it any longer i'm probably gonna give it to the cinema <UNK> who's a great <UNK> critic btw hey if any of you have any crappy movies that they no longer want in their sight feel free to <UNK> to him to keep his show running
<START> the jokes are obvious the gags are corny and the characters are walking <UNK> but i couldn't stop from laughing at his highly entertaining movie no matter how many times i see it i still get a kick out of this one and i recommend it highly for all lovers of mindless entertainment it contains many <UNK> moments and some of the best sight gags i've seen to this day if you've had a bad week and you need a chuckle rent this one on your way home friday night to give your weekend a good start
<START> i expected alot from this movie kinda like lee as a <UNK> like <UNK> but instead all i got was a waste of time and a boring movie i can't even explain this movie it had wooden acting terrible script from pieces from the bible like <UNK> <UNK> waves and <UNK> but that was at the end the rest of it i had to wait and hope that something <UNK> would happen but it didn't this movie is about a couple that tries to find out the changes going on in the world like places in china where there was an <UNK> and end up at a convent run by eight nuns and a priest the convent end up being the key to the <UNK> the whole movie is <UNK> and boring one of <UNK> worst
<START> as a huge fan or the cracker series i have been waiting 7 years for the next addition this episode i'm afraid just does not live up to the legend br br <UNK> returns to <UNK> after 7 years for his daughters wedding and gets involved in a murder investigation were a soldier tormented by flash backs from his tour of duty in northern <UNK> goes on a killing spree br br what i did not like about this episode is the extremely convenient way it is all set up and how <UNK> is led to the murderer it is all fat to far fetched br br there are however some good scenes in flash backs from northern <UNK> which are filmed great
<START> i loved this movie for two reasons 1 jeff combs is absolutely wonderful in it plays the role of the modern wizard to the <UNK> and is absolutely adorable 2 the movie helped to inspire a role playing game i thoroughly enjoy <UNK> the awakening i've shown it at various <UNK> after parties and it's always a big hit br br d d love and jeff <UNK> aside it's not exactly a masterpiece but it's well done and thoroughly enjoyable the plot is fast moving and engaging in its simplicity the special effects are pretty good for such a low budget and the script while nothing stellar was not too badly done and cheesy in all the right places a good way to spend an evening
<START> no strings attached features carlos <UNK> doing stand up that makes us both laugh and think not only does he poke fun at racial issues like many <UNK> claim but he also talks about the best way to get illegal immigrants out of the country what women mean when they say they want to be treated equally why americans are <UNK> than arab terrorists why nobody needs to pray for the <UNK> and what he hopes he's doing in heaven a theory of how <UNK> aka big ups to jesus day traditions got started his viewing of the movie passion of the christ and his sub <UNK> argument with a woman about whether or not he's affected by jesus how society should treat the physically handicapped and even if you have the right to tell a joke or not br br also he never stops reminding us that each of us has a voice so we should use it to speak the truth say what we think and not be afraid if others are offended br br carlos is the bomb
<START> one reason pixar has endured so well and been so successful is that while their films remain technical <UNK> and visual <UNK> they have a story to match their style and often very moving style at that affecting charming and cross <UNK> that a lot anime speaking in broad terms and a great many other animations fail to match their technical <UNK> with real substance is i think and i might be wrong partly because either the makers aren't bothered with character and plot and focus far too much on sound and image or the sheer effort that goes into making some animations is so enormous so <UNK> that they don't have the energy to create a really engaging story br br that same cannot be said of renaissance there are flaws in its plot but i'll get to that later those same flaws however are not reflected in the visuals renaissance is <UNK> short of stunning the ultra high contrast images sometimes so high contrast that is nothing but one face or one <UNK> of light visible and incredible detail are always impressive always a joy to behold the futuristic paris on display is the grim <UNK> of blade runner and brave new world dark murky quite <UNK> and even clean but <UNK> in intrigue corporate <UNK> obsessed with beauty capital of the <UNK> after all and <UNK> the <UNK> and neglect of its <UNK> <UNK> with a <UNK> of monumental sophisticated architecture br br it's a compelling environment not entirely original but great all the same the film's much <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> technology and incredible attention to human and design <UNK> result in images a black and white photographer would die for not that the detail <UNK> entertainment because christian <UNK> <UNK> some superb action sequences a hell for leather care chase a couple of gruesome <UNK> imaginative murders several <UNK> in the dark and a nasty dust up in a gloomy apartment the locations are great too i want to visit the nightclub while the central character of <UNK> is your regular off the shelf maverick cop the other two female characters who are sisters are the real <UNK> of the movie coming from war torn eastern europe products of a war <UNK> and a family <UNK> they're a compelling metaphor for europe as a whole br br the film is tremendously atmospheric its <UNK> <UNK> faux camera moves and adult tone making for a very engaging experience however the plot it never becomes more interesting than the initial hook in which <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> must find <UNK> <UNK> a drop dead gorgeous and <UNK> scientist after she's <UNK> from the street the sinister corporation <UNK> is any corporation ever not sinister which she was working for on <UNK> projects are hell bent on her <UNK> and soon <UNK> is up to his neck in official <UNK> dead bodies cigarette smoke and <UNK> missed bullets and falling in love with <UNK> sister <UNK> very <UNK> voiced by catherine <UNK> as he <UNK> the depths of the city's <UNK> <UNK> and his own past br br text book noir in other words but while i enjoyed the film a lot more than sin city to which it bears a passing visual resemblance the plot and resolution are dull the theme of <UNK> being raised but never examined and the <UNK> of high rolling <UNK> <UNK> paul <UNK> are also dull <UNK> a lot of the dramatic tension the basic ideas are familiar sci fi genre <UNK> and there's a <UNK> sense that the visuals and atmosphere are <UNK> the mundane material br br however the film as a whole is <UNK> and perfectly coherent even if some of the scenarios the characters get into occasionally feel like excuses for displays of technical <UNK> but it's the projection of life in paris circa <UNK> the vision of community and creation of another city from the ground up that makes this film something to behold i may be taking it too seriously and if that's the case i can at least say that it's superbly made extremely entertaining and pretty mature too and with an ambiance like no other
<START> fascinating look at fascist italy and the people who <UNK> out a life under <UNK> street scenes and lifestyle glimpses alone are worth watching combine this with a masterful plot and <UNK> acting and you get a film that you will want to watch again and maybe again
<START> dick tracy is easily the best comic book based movie made to date the movie has the same feel as the comic book staying true to the color scheme the batman series has <UNK> fallen <UNK> and fallen again dick tracy has true staying power as something that both adults and children can enjoy the good guys triumph over evil without blood and gore to get the point across al pacino does a wonderful job of his own adaptation of big boy <UNK> and madonna is memorable as breathless but the best job by far is warren beatty who just <UNK> dick tracy just as he did with clyde <UNK> i can't wait until it comes out on dvd on april 2 2002 my tape is wearing thin
<START> well what are the odds at the exact right moment that a few redneck amateur scientists discover cave paintings <UNK> that some type of dinosaur monster might have inhabited the area thousands of years ago a burning meteor crashes into the lake and <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> egg that has been lying there  for over a thousand years i suppose the <UNK> lake monster is a movie that literally must be seen to be believed but you better do so in the company of many friends and a pile of <UNK> in order to make the wholesome a little bit easier to <UNK> yes this is a terrible film with the <UNK> <UNK> screenplay imaginable and numerous irrelevant padding <UNK> that are downright embarrassing but it's also <UNK> charming and so clumsily put together that you simply have to <UNK> some kind of <UNK> for it half of the film  at least  revolves on the wacky adventures of arnie and mitch these two local <UNK> own and run a boat renting shop near the lake but spend most of their days picking their <UNK> and <UNK> over fascinating stuff like to spell the word bait it is mostly during their <UNK> laurel hardy situations that new <UNK> of blood or decapitated heads are discovered in the lake steve <UNK> the heroic but not exactly sharp sheriff is on the case but only if he's not too busy chasing big city thugs traveling through the area halfway through the film there suddenly is an abrupt scene about a thug robbing a <UNK> store and killing two people in the process this <UNK> wtf moment appears to take on the complete other side of the country like in new york city or something and has absolutely nothing to do with the events going on at <UNK> lake only like twenty minutes later the <UNK> pops up again in <UNK> and there's an <UNK> chase through the woods ending in the <UNK> hungry <UNK> the absurd little details in the <UNK> lake monster are too numerous to mention for example this is probably the only creature feature in which the players discover the obligatory gigantic <UNK> after they already spotted the actual monster the goofs in continuity should be legendary as far as i'm concerned it's like everybody forgot to pay attention to it night turns into twilight into day and back into twilight  all during one and the same <UNK> course the monster is undeniably the best aspect about the film especially since it's accomplished through good old fashioned and adorable stop motion effects the cute <UNK> is a <UNK> meaning an <UNK> dinosaur looking like a <UNK> between denver the last dinosaur and an alligator <UNK> lake monster is a unique and unforgettable movie experience that i can only encourage to track down the miserable 1 out of 10 rating is just out of principle and because basically this is a very bad film should be put into perspective because i might as well could have given it 10 out of 10 for sheer entertainment value
<START> <UNK> and her young daughter pamela are heading out to the country where her <UNK> boyfriend peter left his doctor's position in the city to become a writer and fix up a bed and breakfast <UNK> although this <UNK> has a terrible past and pamela learns from one the girl's who lives in the town that a <UNK> witch once <UNK> in that house they called her the <UNK> <UNK> as she would kill kids after getting their last baby tooth this work on the <UNK> has <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> now she has her sights on pamela and her last baby tooth but if any gets in the way they face the same fate that <UNK> pamela br br this <UNK> old folk myth of the <UNK> <UNK> doesn't paint her in a very generous way as you would believe when you were a child don't they just love turning happy childhood memories into nightmares another one which did fall into the same category was darkness falls 2003 i can't compare how similar they are in the premises because i haven't seen the latter but i mostly read they have basically share the same idea for a little straight to dvd film this <UNK> effort looks good and has some promising images surrounding the senseless and <UNK> by the book plot device low expectations are needed as i wouldn't class it as an success but i found it be to <UNK> entertaining br br <UNK> <UNK> and cookie <UNK> <UNK> story or background for this <UNK> <UNK> character is completely bare with it <UNK> more towards a slasher vehicle than anything really supernatural silly is a good way to describe what's happening in this poorly scripted story but it never really feels like a fairytale horror the dialogues can seem rather redundant and morally <UNK> while the acting is simply sub par with the bland characters they have to work off but director chuck <UNK> offers up some inventive blood splatter and terribly nasty <UNK> this kinda makes up for the lack of suspense the zero scares and generic tone his direction is reasonably earnest and visually able where he gets some atmospheric lighting <UNK> well with its slick photography the promising opening scene is <UNK> effective his pacing can slow up in parts and there's the odd and unnecessary slow motion scene put in but nonetheless it never gets too <UNK> with something active occurring which made sure that i wasn't bored br br the make up special effects provided the goods as there's enough repulsive <UNK> and the tooth <UNK> appearance is especially <UNK> the figure of the tooth fairy can look threatening in its black <UNK> <UNK> make up and swift movements being on location helps <UNK> out a more natural feel and can get <UNK> rich in its sense of <UNK> child actors can be incredibly annoying but nicole <UNK> was decent in her part <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> west are somewhat solid but can be a little too <UNK> in their performances as peter and <UNK> the <UNK> gorgeous carrie anne <UNK> is one of their <UNK> p j soles shows up in small part as a <UNK> <UNK> who tries to warn them about the evil that <UNK> at the <UNK> br br i thought it was a okay time <UNK> that has a sound concept which just isn't fleshed out enough and the execution is pretty <UNK> stuff watchable nonsense but at the same time extremely forgettable
<START> if fassbinder has made a worse film i sure don't want to see it anyone who complains that his films are too talky and claustrophobic should be forced to view this to learn to appreciate the more spare style he <UNK> for in excellent films like the bitter tears of <UNK> von <UNK> this film <UNK> down with so much arty quasi symbolic images it looks like a parody of an art film the scene in the <UNK> and the scene where <UNK> prostitute friend channel <UNK> for what seems like ten minutes are just two of the most glaring examples of what makes this film a real test of the viewer's <UNK> but what really <UNK> me about it are the few scenes which feature just elvira and her ex wife and or her daughter these are the only moments that display any real human emotion and prove that at the core of this horrible film there was an excellent film struggling to free itself what a waste
<START> of all the football films i have watched this is one of the 2 best the other being fever pitch but hero is about the greatest world cup ever and consequently arguably also the greatest player ever to play in a world cup diego <UNK> this story is centered around him <UNK> but also revolves around the other giants of the game at the time br br the musical score is <UNK> and the images are powerful the narration by michael caine is suitably <UNK> and also <UNK> dramatic this story is not about the individual games of the world cup rather it is more about the emotions of the players and the beauty of the event itself br br exciting games like france v brazil one of the greatest games of all time were covered in the same vein the final <UNK> v w germany was also in the same vein highly recommended a classic of world football to be watched over and over again <UNK> if you're a <UNK> fan
<START> this is one of my all time favorites it is so simple and sweet definitely a chick flick romantic comedy i really like a film full of good quotes and this has it one of my favorites is when albert einstein says to ed <UNK> are you thinking what i'm thinking and ed says now what are the odds of that happening in my opinion a film is fabulous if you can watch it again and again and get the same amount of enjoyment out of it and with this one you can i also really enjoyed walter m s way of portraying einstein i think all the characters fit together really well and the story flows nicely there are so many times that i find myself smiling right along with the film and <UNK> my favorite lines as i watch it i would recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart and enjoys a feel good romantic comedy now and then
<START> carla is a secretary who is essentially deaf without her hearing aids when she finds herself <UNK> at work she is able to hire paul to help her out paul is just out of jail and his past is not entirely behind him to say too much more about the story which has many twists would be a mistake br br the most interesting thing about this film for me is how sound is used to indicate when carla can hear and when she can't a sort of point of hear like point of view the early scenes that set this up as well as the early character development of carla and paul was more interesting to me than the twists and turns later on some of which were hard to follow and or stretched credibility a bit there is also some unpleasant violence back to the positive side the cinematography was very good br br the film is worth seeing but perhaps not seeking out seen at the san francisco international film festival on 4 28 2002
<START> ok first i have to point the fact that when i first saw this flick i was 9 years old if i had seen this one two weeks ago for the first time <UNK> probably have noted that this is just another cheaply made cable tv horror film with some well made scenes but when <UNK> nine you just <UNK> care about those facts this scared the hell out of me back then especially those aforementioned <UNK> scenes and they still do nowadays <UNK> kind of hooked to this film i have to see this maybe once in a month and on every new <UNK> eve i watch this with a 12 pack of beer bunch of friends it´s like an <UNK> for a good party i kinda agree to those people who said that the acting here is pretty <UNK> <UNK> and crosby do look like i wanted louis and rachel look like but one <UNK> see very much devotion or feelings on the faces of these two hughes and <UNK> pretty much save the scenes which the <UNK> <UNK> what i actually want to say about this is the fact that there really is no other film that has any kind of similarity to pet sematary and i <UNK> mean the zombie stuff here the atmosphere of this film is certainly a novelty and one of a kind honestly how many times you have seen a film which on superficial level looks like a cable tv one but leave you with a chill compared to only the best horror <UNK> out there alright i <UNK> some of the <UNK> balls a minute ago but i have to say that all pieces in that level too <UNK> the overall acting to perfection but hey tell me if you really know some film which is similar to pet sematary i really would love to know and i <UNK> mean night of the living dead here this one is way beyond compare in intelligence compared to that stuff
<START> this is one of my favorite sports movies dennis quaid is moving and convincing in the part of a man who gave up his dream of being a baseball <UNK> when his arm gave out on him as a high school coach he challenges his players to win the division championship by telling them he'll try out for a baseball team if they do they win partly because of all the <UNK> practice they take with a coach who can pitch over 90 miles an hour and he keeps his side of the bargain and is signed br br if you have ever decided to try something new and terrifying as an adult jim <UNK> story will <UNK> with you it is moving and inspiring and the man's relationships ring true br br inspiration is not the only reason i rent this one though dennis quaid is just downright <UNK> in the part and a baseball movie with a good looking man changing a <UNK> is my idea of heaven ladies if you feel the way i do check this one out
<START> if you like films that <UNK> with little plot exposition <UNK> with kinky sex this film is for you on the plus side the lead actor actress newcomer <UNK> does have an interesting screen presence but not enough to add up to much more than a mildly interesting movie if that essentially this film is about 3 social <UNK> <UNK> prostitute male hustler and russian gay immigrant who somehow have developed a bond why is not clear we are expected to accept these <UNK> are at the core basic honest people who have the ability to love while they <UNK> their bodies on the street right and anna nicole smith was truly in love with her ninety something sugar daddy the filmmaker shows a gritty unpleasant side of life while wanting us to believe underneath it all these seriously damaged people are really quite normal to the extent they have a <UNK> a <UNK> which helps them through life quite a fantasy but unfortunately portrayed here as real look of life on the wild side in sum no plot no truth and no real reason to spend much time here unless of course you just like to <UNK> in the <UNK>
<START> went to watch this movie expecting a <UNK> really <UNK> action flick still got very disappointed the opening scene promised a little action with a <UNK> of comedy it keeps you hooked for the first half <UNK> till then you are expecting that now its time for the action to kick in well nothing of that sort happens the movie drags and the ending just <UNK> you down to a point that you get annoyed wonder what was the director thinking made no sense <UNK> the movie lacked in all aspects had no real storyline and it seemed very hollow even if rambo was in it i don't think he could have helped the rating at all there is simply no logic to the movie a perfect way to waste your time and money by far the most irritating movie i have ever seen and i am sure there will b others <UNK> have the same viewpoint after enduring it definitely not for people who have a little movie sense left in them
<START> okay i've watched this movie twice now i have <UNK> it heavily on the net i have asked several people on there opinions i have even gone to the length of reading the original sheridan <UNK> classic <UNK> a book that this movie is supposed to be based on i feel that the best way to review this movie is to describe a game to play whilst watching it as the plot of the movie doesn't seem to make any sense at all here is the plot of the book br br laura lives in a castle in <UNK> with her father mr de <UNK> they carry on with their lives <UNK> and <UNK> one day they get a letter from the <UNK> a man who has made it his mission in life to avenge his daughters death he makes claims of supernatural powers being at work and explains that he will visit them soon meanwhile a chance encounter with a strange woman results in the <UNK> looking after her daughter <UNK> for several months soon laura starts to be overwhelmed by strange dreams and begins to come down with a strange illness who is this mysterious <UNK> and just what has she to do with <UNK> condition and the general br br i have invented this game and would like as many people as possible to play it and let me know what their results are i even have a catchy name and would have a <UNK> too but i can't be bothered with that it's called the this movie doesn't make any sense game br br all you have to do is whilst watching the movie try to come up with a complete plot that explains what is happening i mean complete all questions answered everything makes sense absolutely complete br br it will have to answer such questions as br br why can vampires walk around in day light br br why are they all lesbians br br why is a girl called bob and why does she shoot herself br br when is the movie a dream and when is it real br br why does killing zombies appear to be an accepted part of life that doesn't make anyone bat an <UNK> br br why does travis fontaine spot and run down a zombie without <UNK> down whilst driving his car yet when faced with a woman with an obvious hostage in the back of her car accept the excuse that she is a zombie too br br and why does he then let a girl which he later openly reveals that he knows is the head vampire drive with him in his car br br and then let her drive off alone with his daughter in a stolen car br br what the hell is the asylum scene all about br br what the hell is the green goo all about br br why does the head vampire suddenly start dressing like a nurse br br why are there never any vampires fighting zombies br br what is the significance of the <UNK> what is it made of why does it kill vampires and how does jenna know that br br in fact <UNK> it it's just as much fun trying to come up with as many questions about this movie too br br i have my plot and i have to admit it is not quite there but it is a pretty good effort br br in conclusion br br <UNK> vs <UNK> has no moment in it where there are actually vampires fighting zombies everyone in the movie seems to know exactly what is going on yet they seem very reluctant to let the audience in on this and somehow it is based on a classic 19th century horror novel how why what the hell is going on
<START> highly enjoyable very imaginative and <UNK> fairytale all rolled into one stardust tells the story of a young man living outside a fantasy world going inside it to retrieve a bit of a fallen star only to find the star is alive young and beautiful a kingdom whose king is about to die has said king <UNK> a competition on his several sons to see who can retrieve a ruby first to be king whilst a trio of witches want the star to <UNK> up and use to keep them young these three plot threads <UNK> <UNK> together throughout the entire picture <UNK> with good acting dazzling special effects and some solid sentiment and humour as well stardust is a fun film and has some fun performances from the likes of claire danes as the star i could <UNK> at her for quite some time to michelle pfeiffer i could <UNK> at her at full magical powers even longer playing the horrible witch to robert deniro playing a nancy boy air pirate to perfection charlie cox as the lead <UNK> is <UNK> and credible and we get some very good work from a group of guys playing the sons out to be king who are constantly and consistently trying to kill off each other mark strong jason <UNK> and <UNK> everett plays their roles well in both life and death loved this whole thread as well peter o'toole plays the dying killer daddy and watch for funny man ricky <UNK> who made me laugh more than anything in the entire film in his brief five minutes nice feet but the real power in the film is the novel by neil <UNK> and the script made from his creative and <UNK> mind stardust creates its own mythology and its own world and it works
<START> this film is predictable it is more predictable then a <UNK> <UNK> pass when he <UNK> the ball for the <UNK> one saw the ending coming up halfway through the film the politics reminds me when i was back east many people know when the fix is in i gave this four because of the acting but the story is lame
<START> this <UNK> in the new doris day collection doesn't really need to be included as she is only in the film for less than 30 minutes what she does do however is shine when she's on screen the near plot less movie is just an excuse to showcase some warner contract players of the day <UNK> rule shows promise and it's a shame she didn't become a big star ruth roman handles the role of the go <UNK> with <UNK> better if this was in color the travis air force base locations with some rear projection work well what's best about the movie are some wonderful musical <UNK> if you enjoyed thank your lucky stars and hollywood <UNK> you'll like this one
<START> not only was this the most expensive canadian film ever shot in <UNK> but easily the worst never seeing the light of day the director is not even canadian but british and boy does it show we are all made out to be a bunch of over <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and morons the spirit of what it means to be canadian is absent and this is supposed to be the reason we <UNK> this <UNK> of course the british character is normal the rest are a crop of sitcom stereotype can you say norm the cinematography <UNK> from pretty <UNK> images to murky <UNK> <UNK> the actors always seem to be <UNK> are they as bored as the viewer or is this the directors idea of cinema avoid this mess and check out some of bruce <UNK> films a true canadian boy with something original to say <UNK> you won't be compelled to walk out on his films after 10 minutes
<START> <UNK> is your everyday <UNK> vs authority movie <UNK> the main character is <UNK> early as a bad influence on the children in the neighborhood with the words of wisdom from a couple of <UNK> he meets along the way he finds changing his mischievous ways hard yet worthy of doing personally i found actor who played <UNK> too annoying to sympathize with however the change of tone of the movie would allow most to feel the emotional struggle <UNK> has when he wants to be good but bad things still happen this struggle makes the movie a little different than other movies of the same genre that's the little flavor i meant all in all i did not really care for this movie although it was most likely aimed for a younger audience
<START> the title of this film nearly put me off watching it not being a <UNK> united fan the mere mention of beckham was a bit off putting however i put my prejudices behind me and i'm glad i did br br i wasn't expecting much of a film but i was pleasantly surprised the film <UNK> along with me never looking at my watch and i enjoyed every second of the film if you liked east is east then you'll love this film ok so the storyline is nothing new and the classic <UNK> are contained within the film but it's all done very <UNK> and with a breath of fresh air the film moves very fast and keeps the <UNK> entertained the <UNK> funny moments are a good chuckle and not some poor attempt at humour and best of all it's a good british comedy
<START> astaire and rogers at the height of their popularity in 1936 americans thought of the navy as a place for song and dance wwii was still a few years away fred and ginger dance up the town br br the plot is decent but who cares by the way notice the cameo roles for betty <UNK> and a glamorous <UNK> ball br br a load of irving berlin songs including the famous let's face the music and dance in that scene <UNK> heavy <UNK> dress <UNK> fred in the face during one of her <UNK> and almost knocks him unconscious fred insisted on keeping the take as the dancing was superb nonetheless br br ginger once commented that she was a better dancer than fred since she had to do all the same moves in step and backwards br br come to think of it <UNK> voice was nice too the man was <UNK> in motion br br here's a movie to <UNK> up on the couch with a loved one kick off the shoes and enjoy the entertainment
<START> you can do a lot with a little cash blair witch proved that this film supports it it is no more than a sitcom in length and complexity however because it has john <UNK> as sherlock holmes it manages to be hilarious even on a budget that couldn't afford a <UNK> the highlight of this film is arthur lowe as the sincere bumbling watson his <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> quick <UNK> wit if you ever run across the film watch it for a quirky laugh or two
<START> ignoring if possible the <UNK> gratuitous marijuana smoking which seems to be mandatory in australian government <UNK> films the cast of this movie gives a reasonably credible performance that's a far as it goes the rest is simply awful the <UNK> <UNK> with wow <UNK> which are meant to look good on film but go nowhere a gross example is the giant <UNK> <UNK> obviously left over from a town parade and <UNK> by the local <UNK> factory it was just too <UNK> to waste what was hopefully a free but nevertheless irrelevant prop the <UNK> is given a <UNK> unexplained wash down at one stage but that's where it ends br br similarly the contrived black spot road sign where <UNK> parents were killed is intended to <UNK> the eventual escape from her past but her escape to what she's had a pretty good deal where she was especially considering her visual <UNK> and the <UNK> loving patience and care of her understanding young female guardian br br the <UNK> prize for corny melodrama however goes to the characterization of alan alan successfully <UNK> to the noble role of trade union shop <UNK> but rats on his fellow workers by becoming a <UNK> for a wicked multi national <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> alan performs the <UNK> villainous dirty work he <UNK> <UNK> until surprise surprise the whole plant is closed and alan himself is left as a pathetic unemployed failure no cliché free <UNK> here mate not only this but alan also loses the seductive <UNK> from the most unlikely relationship you'd encounter if you think the plot is melodramatic and <UNK> don't ask about detail what's the significance of the <UNK> cream on <UNK> seductive leg why doesn't the hotel where the couple makes love eventually <UNK> that someone's gaining illegal entry to one of its <UNK> <UNK> and among other <UNK> the sheets are regularly <UNK> quite spectacularly on one occasion <UNK> this movie up in one word avoid avoid avoid
<START> i loved the episode but seems to me there should have been some quick reference to the secretary getting <UNK> for effectively being an <UNK> after the fact while i like when a episode of columbo has an unpredictable twist like this one its resolution should be part of the conclusion of the episode along with the <UNK> of the murderer br br the interplay between peter falk and ruth gordon is priceless at one point gordon playing a famous writer makes some comment about being <UNK> by the famous lt columbo making a tongue in cheek <UNK> to the <UNK> real life fame as a crime <UNK> this is one of the best of many great columbo <UNK>
<START> what can i add that the previous comments haven't already said this is a great film and the light <UNK> duel star wars tribute has to be seen to be believed there are moments of genius throughout this movie if you can see it now thanks again to rick baker who gave me this movie many years ago
<START> journey of hope tells of a poor turkish family and their odyssey of hope which <UNK> <UNK> into despair as they travel to switzerland in search of <UNK> although this oscar winning film is fairly well crafted it is lacking in substance and has many <UNK> much of the film's 1 7 hour run time is get on the bus get off the bus get on the boat get off the boat get in the van get out of the van etc time which could have been better spent or left out completely the story has a predictable conclusion especially for those who have an awareness of the common crime of <UNK> in illegal immigrants a worthwhile and reasonably entertaining watch but over rated
<START> for a long time it seemed like all the good canadian actors had headed south of the border and i guessed all the second rank ones filled the top <UNK> and that left the <UNK> for the sex comedies br br this film was a real surprise despite the outlandish plots that are typical of <UNK> the actors seemed to be trying to put something into their characters and what we the viewer got back was almost true suspension of belief when the extras from the music video attacked the <UNK> police you almost believed it was possible br br if you are a fan of some of the better sex <UNK> canadian or not you should definitely seek this one out and the big surprise this sex farce is also loaded with some very good nudity
<START> i bought a set of 4 dvds for 10 bucks at my local <UNK> which contained this movie and three other trashy horror flicks including its sequel witchcraft <UNK> so basically i paid the rock bottom price of 2 50 for this movie if you do the <UNK> i can't exactly say i was ripped off i have a thing for trashy horror movies but this is the kind of trash that gives trash a bad name the budget couldn't be over 1 000 though it appears as if they spent a total of 1 50 i know it's a low budget film but that's no excuse for totally uninspired <UNK> the film blood cult though not very good was made for an extremely low budget and still had fairly good <UNK> and acting the acting in this movie is the definition of <UNK> especially from that muscular guy with the texas accent everyone is pretty much reading their lines off the page you can take that <UNK> or literally i wouldn't be surprised if the script was off camera as they were performing i said before that i've never seen a bad english actor this movie has quite a few bad ones and though english movies aren't always good they always seem to have at least a level of sophistication which is why i don't see why any <UNK> or <UNK> would <UNK> to do a home video style schlock flick like this did <UNK> <UNK> put a hold on their casting calls usually i think people are too hard on directors and actors even some of the worst movies in hollywood have some level of <UNK> in the directing acting and cinematography <UNK> even when you watch a movie like <UNK> you can't honestly say it looks like a third <UNK> shot those scenes though a third <UNK> could've written the script i've seen home movies that are shot better than witchcraft x and that's no exaggeration whatsoever even the gore is minimal since the filmmakers only had money to buy some fake blood on sale at party city not a single effort was put into making this movie let's just sum it up like that you get the picture there's a good deal of nudity though that doesn't save it however i must say that girl with the red orange hair who's either naked or wearing a <UNK> popping outfit throughout the film is really hot br br my score 1 out of 10
<START> rea sutherland <UNK> and von <UNK> in a small role are all brilliant in their performances sutherland is particularly <UNK> at this sort of role where he must portray a character whose morality is at first uncertain to the audience as is so often the case with <UNK> characters we must ask is he a <UNK> in this case a minor one or a hero br br this is a disturbing story intelligently told about the incompetence and <UNK> <UNK> in the old soviet union that <UNK> the efforts of extremely competent people as <UNK> character <UNK> notes the measure of a <UNK> is its ability not to make special exceptions the <UNK> meeting between rea and <UNK> characters after <UNK> is <UNK> with its revelations has enormous emotional impact you can feel the suffering of the dedicated people who <UNK> in that system br br the handful of dramatic scenes portraying <UNK> family members adds emotional <UNK> to the impact of the story this is seldom a feature of a film with this sickening subject matter but effectively reminds us that the victims had lives and were loved br br this is a sad but very important film which deserved its showcase on <UNK> history television
<START> <UNK> denis again <UNK> her theme of estranged fathers men who follow their own bliss in determined fashion <UNK> of the emotion <UNK> on their family but while <UNK> and <UNK> from the earlier film live in a narrow world of <UNK> our examination of louis <UNK> in the intruder takes us from a remote location along the french swiss border to half way around the world to korea and <UNK> again the film begins in mid stream with louis in his sixties <UNK> with an <UNK> heart while attempting to maintain a high level of <UNK> we learn that louis is no stranger to violence as his cabin is the location for <UNK> and <UNK> a regular <UNK> louis sleeps with a large knife under his <UNK> with <UNK> nearby denis is in no hurry to move the action along and we must <UNK> build our understanding of louis from his daily activities and the few people he deals with along the frontier including a son sidney <UNK> colin almost <UNK> with long hair and a <UNK> of a mustache who rejects him as a lunatic shown as a dedicated father of two there are many brief scenes which while seemingly unrelated build up an impression of louis and his <UNK> ms <UNK> camera work is <UNK> here the controlling metaphor is <UNK> heart transplant for which he goes to korea and then to <UNK> to search for another son not found and where <UNK> new heart rejects him just as sidney rejected the old we are <UNK> to brief scenes in <UNK> film which are inexplicable <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> feeding with a <UNK> a drive by shooting of <UNK> father and then the <UNK> of images of <UNK> with a <UNK> wound in the head a scene of louis in a <UNK> with a <UNK> with the <UNK> of a transplant but the body of sidney the <UNK> of the last two is a <UNK> real or imagined by a father kills something <UNK> in a son
<START> like the great classic bugs bunny cartoons this movie has humor at different levels i just introduced this to my 10 year old daughter and 11 year old son both enjoyed the movie <UNK> out laughing quite a few times and my daughter is not much of a sci fi fan the movie kept me laughing despite having seen a few times the adult level humor that is humor that adults will get simply because of greater life experiences no <UNK> or r rated stuff to be found here keeps the movie equally enjoyable for adults for example of the adult level humor the martian voices are based on characters of different movies actors the martian pilot <UNK> has the voice and mannerisms of jack nicholson the scientist that of peter <UNK> dr <UNK> the special effects are surprisingly good for this film the lack of top 10 actors actually works in the movie's favor and the actors actresses play their part well in fact i would say the producers picked out actors and their skills for the <UNK> needs over box office draw power an excellent example is wayne <UNK> <UNK> character i had to write this review the kids are playing this for the 3rd time in 4 days over dinner right now good for a rainy day or a late night weekend there's nothing on and i'm bored movie
<START> i approach films about talking animals with care for every wonderful one like babe you get an equally poor one like the dreadful remake of <UNK> bound the incredible journey or in the case of cats dogs you have a great idea for a film not living up to its potential when i heard about paulie the premise of a <UNK> parrot didn't exactly fill me with confidence but i found the film a pleasant surprise and it manages to sneak its way into your heart without you <UNK> br br a russian janitor <UNK> <UNK> tony <UNK> gets a job in a research laboratory one day he hears singing coming from the basement and when he <UNK> he finds a parrot in its cage singing its little heart out <UNK> becomes fascinated with the bird especially when it turns out the parrot can not only sing it can talk and not a few phrases either its a parrot you can actually make conversation with br br the parrot is called paulie voiced by jay <UNK> and <UNK> a fellow <UNK> in <UNK> wondering how this world to the wise bird ended up in a dusty basement <UNK> convinces paulie to tell him his life story which all began when he was a baby and in the care of marie a five year old girl with a <UNK> the two of them became birds of a <UNK> ok bad pun br br when <UNK> parents became concerned about her close friendship with a bird they considered sending him away and they finally did after marie nearly injured herself in a fall after teaching paulie to fly desperate to be reunited with her paulie begins a long journey across america which includes a diverse number of new owners flying great <UNK> and even ending up behind bars of a cage that is br br paulie was one of a number of talking animal films released by <UNK> in the late 90s and although it wasn't <UNK> the same recognition or box office success of babe paulie succeeds on quite a few levels and is an occasional work of striking intelligence br br jay <UNK> stand up style of acting is well suited to the part of paulie he never plays the part as too smug even if he is a bit of a smart <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but he is also naive in his way br br because he's lived a rather <UNK> life with marie when he's taken away he has to <UNK> for himself for the first time and when he falls into the hands of different owners they make promises to paulie to reunite him with marie which he believes only for those promises to be broken time and again br br paulie is admittedly a little episodic it follows the <UNK> people paulie ends up with and how he slowly gets brought closer and closer to marie he first winds up in a <UNK> shop where he is adopted by <UNK> gena rowlands a kindly woman who teaches him the meaning of manners she <UNK> with <UNK> situation and drives an <UNK> across america to find marie br br paulie is an occasionally very touching film his scenes with <UNK> are some of the best wonderful moments of paulie <UNK> on her shoulder singing tom jones numbers the way she <UNK> in him the need for hope is great and some of the dialogue is quite well written and even thought provoking br br there are things in life you put off because you think you're gonna do them later but the real thing <UNK> taught me is you gotta live like there may not be a later br br the scene where <UNK> passes away en route leaving paulie all alone is a very heart <UNK> moment and the sequence where he <UNK> up the courage to fly for the first time across the grand canyon <UNK> <UNK> is such a beautifully composed scene it stays with you for hours after the film's over br br despite the occasional sad moment there are plenty of laughs to be had paulie falls in with a group of performing <UNK> at a spanish <UNK> restaurant the <UNK> effects here are really excellent as four birds do a perfectly choreographed dance number and paulie even gets to have a romance which is <UNK> when he falls in with a petty thief played by <UNK> as well that may be the only complaint i have as soon as you get comfortable with one situation the film then moves paulie on to another br br the scene where paulie is taught to steal money from <UNK> machines is funny but a little disturbing too i'm amazed <UNK> were granted the chance to include such a scene in a kids film and <UNK> diamond robbery is very mission impossible he's caught in the act and <UNK> off to the lab for animal testing where he's remained ever since br br the story finally comes full circle at the lab where <UNK> <UNK> to help paulie of course they do find marie but the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity i was left <UNK> for several minutes paulie may never get the <UNK> babe has but i believe its an equally brilliant film the same laughs the same flawless effects and the same surprising intelligence br br a minor gem
<START> this film was excellent the emotional power of tom <UNK> and ray <UNK> performances brought tears to my eyes and joy to my heart this film shows us that there is still hope in the world if this film had come out at the end of 1988 instead of rain man <UNK> would certainly have been at least nominated for a best actor oscar definitely a must see
<START> this movie is amazing for several reasons harris takes an extremely awkward documentary and turns it into a relevant social commentary <UNK> gary is a small town kid who is assumed well liked for his many <UNK> when he decides to play olivia <UNK> john in a local talent show for whom he is very passionate <UNK> actions show that he is at odds with the conservative social environment in which he lives this results in him making various <UNK> for his actions so that people will not think that he is in fact a <UNK> or other such social <UNK> in the second installment harris <UNK> the struggle between gary and <UNK> in a <UNK> attempt to make a narrative out of the original documentary the third and final installment to the trilogy is truly amazing for <UNK> extreme sensitivity with the subject unlike the second installment the <UNK> kid shows gary as a truly troubled character he struggles to gain acceptance within his own community to no <UNK> his secret passion for dressing like olivia <UNK> john <UNK> him even further from the people that already consider him a social <UNK> the movie is depicted so realistically that like reality it lends itself to many reactions surely one can see gary as a ridiculously pathetic character but may also identify with him as an <UNK>
<START> this is a pretty ok film yes some parts are lame and exceptionally convenient and the movie doesn't really justify the large star cast <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> however the actor that really impressed me here was kay kay <UNK> not to be confused with the singer <UNK> in the scene where he first meets <UNK> character i thought that a man who can just look at <UNK> keep staring and not say a word and still look strong is definitely a good actor in fact he has proved himself worthy again in <UNK> alongside <UNK> for a second time this guy should get more roles he's brilliant br br if you've read any of the other reviews here on imdb you already know the plot and i do agree that <UNK> <UNK> entry into <UNK> was a little too easy and the little love angle he shared with what's her face was completely unnecessary but he is a fairly good actor as seen in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is cool to watch always and <UNK> what can i say i don't know if i'm his biggest fan in the world but i know i can definitely compete for the spot br br an interesting watch considering it's bollywood although a bit inspired by hollywood <UNK> like the great escape and bridge on the river <UNK>
<START> i'm not particularly fond of remakes or to steal the modern <UNK> <UNK> but this film truly <UNK> me off the original prom night while not in my humble <UNK> a masterpiece still realized what it was horror there are some simple things to remember when making a horror film suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience sorry folks but a white <UNK> film this was not the scares were cheap and <UNK> terribly a good example of scare which has been done to clichéd excess now is the cat jumping out of the closet followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film this film couldn't successfully pull that off so how could i expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film there needs to be a likable hero or heroine this film doesn't have one the person i most identified with was the head detective his calm demeanor but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this <UNK> should have common sense approach to events that occur if you're running from an axe wielding psycho you turn and <UNK> in the opposite direction not <UNK> whilst looking back ever three seconds <UNK> the killer's progress only to trip over every branch and <UNK> object in your path if you friend disappears you don't go looking for them alone and if you suspect foul play you tell someone not investigate yourself these clichés are tired and well <UNK> in the horror genre in general and in this film in particular
<START> i didn't think this was as absolutely horrible as some people apparently do it passes as one of those cheesy horror movies you might waste time with in the middle of the night when you can't sleep although admittedly it's no better quality than that it's true that the acting isn't great i thought <UNK> <UNK> as cathy <UNK> for example came across as completely <UNK> but the main problem is that several aspects of the plot didn't really make sense to me the <UNK> are on a trip described by john stewart moss as part work and partly the honeymoon they never had now that's romantic the work part has something to do with <UNK> <UNK> which in itself sounds strange how does being part of a tour group through a cave relate to anyone's work but it gets stranger when we find out that he's a doctor doing research in the area of <UNK> medicine huh that connection completely lost me bitten by a bat while he's in the cave he begins to <UNK> into what i guess was supposed to be a human bat hybrid although when we finally see him in makeup he looks a lot more like an ape man of some sort and a killing spree starts here's another problem the first killing is a nurse in a hospital at first everyone thinks her death was an accident the second murder is of a young girl who is described as having her throat ripped out the sheriff michael <UNK> then tells us that her death was similar to the <UNK> meaning throat ripped out how could anyone think that was an accident and what's with the sheriff he seems pretty no nonsense until the scene in <UNK> hotel room when he takes a <UNK> of <UNK> and then almost rapes her after which everything seems to go back to normal it's <UNK> with an ending that left almost everything <UNK> and also with one of the most irritating theme songs i've ever heard in a movie even for all that there was something here that kept me watching sometimes pure cheesiness can get you through an hour and a half pretty bad yeah but not as awful as some people say
<START> wow i loved this movie and love judy <UNK> this girl isn't just an awesome pretty face she's funny and really really talented she made me laugh many times just by being very naturally rough with victor who was desperately hitting on her we'll be seeing her a lot in the next coming years and probably also from director peter <UNK> and co star victor <UNK> br br raising victor vargas is one of the best film i saw in a long time very refreshing it's true nice funny well filmed it got it all good story good actors good film direction br br if you like simple slow paced real life urban movies like maybe jersey girl from kevin smith you'll love victor vargas it's better
<START> this is a better than average silent movie and it's still well worth seeing if you are a fan of the <UNK> however if you aren't yet a fan of the genre i suggest you try a few other films before watching this one that's because the plot just seems pretty old fashioned and difficult to believe in spots but despite this it's still a good film and kept my interest br br a nice lady unfortunately hooked up with the wrong man and ran away to marry him the film starts five years later after she has come to realize that he is really a brutal thief despite this she tries to make the best of it and not <UNK> on how good life had been before this jerk came into her life however the rent is due and there's no money so the lady is forced to look for work she becomes a personal <UNK> for a rich lady whose husband is trying to swing a business deal unfortunately the lady who they were trying to hook up a potential client with for a dinner party can't make it and the <UNK> is paid <UNK> to be the man's date well like cinderella she <UNK> up pretty well and the man is <UNK> with her what to do now given that she is actually married and the new <UNK> wants to marry her well see the movie yourself to see how it's all resolved i didn't like how they handled the husband as it seemed awfully predictable and clichéd however once he was out of the way i do admire how the film also didn't give up a by the numbers finale and left the film with a few loose ends br br all in all a very good film worth seeing but certainly not great
<START> i think this is almost all i need to say i feel <UNK> to explain my actions though i've basically never seen such an <UNK> production and i mean that in all senses of the word although he physical camera work boom <UNK> operation and other technical aspects of this film are laughable unfortunately its not the only areas br br unlike some classic independent films that have been saved by their scripts great characterization and plot this unfortunately has an awful script awful acting and worst of all awful annoying characters br br it's a crime that for the every independent film that gets distribution like <UNK> tunnel there's a 101 other indie films that died silent deaths i don't know who the kornbluth brothers know at <UNK> but that can be my only explanation as to how this amateur family production ever got distribution i'm quite <UNK> as to why they picked this up br br the only part of this film that holds out any intrigue is its title however the reason for that is even a let down i hope this review will save a few people that may be intrigued by this films title from going to watch it i've seen a lot of films in my time and i'm very <UNK> when in the cinema but this was too much i'll never forget <UNK> for <UNK> an important point in my life experience of cinema shame it's such a low point
<START> really started the 80s trend of disgusting violence <UNK> as a horror film i was the target audience for this <UNK> piece of trash and i was disgusted then as now br br oh where do we start let's see the setup you can bring people back to live if they died a violent death so that laughably weak premise is the excuse to butcher people in horrible ways because well that's needed to bring them back to life this might have worked if played over the top for black laughs a la re animator or something but no it's played straight there is a whole terrified family in a <UNK> that gets hunted down one of the few scenes at least where their demise is off screen however just about everything else is on screen there is actually a scene where a young girl walking along is beaten and killed by zombie <UNK> who are all filming it and <UNK> with several cameras then there is a <UNK> of her face as the filmmakers lovingly and time <UNK> reveal in time <UNK> photography her beaten face being <UNK> down to a skull and <UNK> to look normal again this done of course by a <UNK> jack <UNK> as the <UNK> behind it all he likes to drive around in a <UNK> <UNK> playing old tommy <UNK> tunes i guess that is supposed to be cute br br in the end of course even the sheriff is undead and the doctor offers kindly to fix his rotting hands not clear why the sheriff is not out with the other <UNK> killing children with glee and <UNK> their faces off sticking <UNK> in burn victims eyes etc br br i wonder really wonder what people see in a geek show like this to give it any kind of rating at all it's not scary the twists are laughable and overall it's kind of sick it's not even well enough done to see it on a dare or enjoy on a level you might watch a bad <UNK> lewis film it's just god awful trash made for people who get off on this type of pointless gore and made by people <UNK> for a paycheck br br sad that <UNK> was even involved
<START> to <UNK> this review i must say that i was i suppose a little curious about this movie however i probably would not have seen it had i not had my arm slightly twisted br br in my opinion this movie shows just how <UNK> man can be in my eyes the worst thing about this whole springer phenomenon is not that type of people on the jerry springer show act as they do which in itself is <UNK> <UNK> but that many people are so curious and excited to watch them and hear about their lives yes i suppose that includes me to whatever extent it is true if not <UNK> that kind of behavior as some might say at the very least we may be subtly <UNK> our minds and or <UNK> ourselves to this type of behavior br br but enough <UNK> sort of here's the skinny the movie has an r rating and while it may deserve only that i did look away at some scenes so i'm not completely sure i feel that an <UNK> 17 tip of the hat to the other reviewer might be a little more appropriate for the immense sexual content a <UNK> might comment that the movie was just one big excuse to show sex on the big screen the plot is very bizarre <UNK> together the stories of an absolutely dysfunctional family and a group of stereotypical blacks upset who will appear on different springer shows at the end the movie leaves one with some <UNK> and springer <UNK> about the need for us to see the real world evidently as seen through his show i agree with him there it is important to know how the world really is so that we can seek to effect positive change having said that let me just tell you the world's pretty bad glance in a <UNK> or the news to see that but let's not shell out good money to support the kind of <UNK> and perhaps formulaic <UNK> that springer seeks to give us
<START> office work especially in this era of computers multi <UNK> copy machines e mail voice mail <UNK> mail and <UNK> ' is territory <UNK> with satirical possibilities a vein previously <UNK> in such films as <UNK> and office space ' and very successfully this latest addition to the <UNK> humor pool however <UNK> tunnel ' directed by josh kornbluth and <UNK> kornbluth fails to live up to it's predecessors and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door waiting for a chance to sneak in unfortunately for the audience that chance never comes so what you get is a nice try but as the man once said no <UNK> br br as the narrator star of the film josh kornbluth playing josh kornbluth points out in the opening frames in a monologue delivered directly into the camera this story is pure fiction and takes place in the fictional city of san <UNK> ' it's an innovative if not very <UNK> presented <UNK> and not all that funny it is however a <UNK> of what is to follow all of which like the <UNK> just isn't all that funny br br kornbluth plays kornbluth an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a <UNK> ' it's a job that suits him and it gives him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time but when he goes to work for a lawyer bob <UNK> warren keith he does too good a job on the first day and <UNK> <UNK> head secretary <UNK> <UNK> helen <UNK> to kornbluth to <UNK> him to go <UNK> ' the thought of working full time for the same company though initially strikes fear in the heart of kornbluth but he <UNK> in and signs on for the position he's nervous about it but at least now the other <UNK> acknowledge his presence which of course they would never do with a <UNK> and if things get too rough he has <UNK> important letters he's <UNK> up that now just have to be <UNK> out to fall back on he's been holding them back because the <UNK> is the easy part and he needs that something easy to <UNK> in <UNK> in case it all gets to be too much for him these are <UNK> letters however and by the end of the week kornbluth still has them in <UNK> on his desk and it doesn't take a genius to figure out that when <UNK> finds out about it <UNK> days as the fair haired boy are going to be over and quick br br the brothers kornbluth who not only directed but along with john <UNK> also wrote the screenplay for this film should have taken a page out of the ben stiller book of comedy where it says if you play it straight they will laugh ' but they didn't and the audience won't because in comedy even looking at it as <UNK> as possible when the main character as well as most of the supporting characters in this case <UNK> funny as in he <UNK> he's being funny he never is and that's exactly what kornbluth does here so rather than being funny ' he comes across as <UNK> and pretentious a <UNK> error in judgment on the part of the <UNK> because by allowing it they <UNK> their own movie br br in trying to <UNK> exactly why this movie doesn't work it comes down to two basic reasons the directing which if not necessarily <UNK> is at least <UNK> and secondly the performances beginning with that of josh kornbluth quite simply kornbluth just seems too impressed with himself to be effective here unlike stiller or even steve martin both of whom use self <UNK> humor very effectively kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he the real kornbluth is in reality much more clever than kornbluth the character and being unable to get past that does him in as well as the film rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach so what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with with an inexplicably narrow focus given the potential of the rich subject matter it's easy to understand why this one just doesn't fly br br the one saving grace of the film is the performance by warren keith as <UNK> whose subtle delivery is convincing and which in and of itself is fairly humorous the <UNK> of it is <UNK> however <UNK> as keith has to share his scenes with kornbluth which somewhat automatically <UNK> out his positive <UNK> to the project br br <UNK> and sarah <UNK> julie <UNK> also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances which are commendable if not entirely memorable they at least make their scenes watchable and <UNK> even manages to elevate <UNK> performance if only <UNK> but it's still not enough to save the day or the film br br the supporting cast includes amy <UNK> <UNK> brian <UNK> <UNK> june <UNK> <UNK> joe <UNK> jimmy the mail clerk with a cameo appearance by a <UNK> looking harry <UNK> as the <UNK> leader a role that begs for an answer to the question what was he thinking when he agreed to this ' in any work environment there will forever be situations <UNK> that one way or another will <UNK> become fodder for someone's comedic cannon and the films depicting said situations will always be with us the good ones see paragraph one may even become classics in their own right <UNK> tunnel ' however will <UNK> remain very long amongst them for it's destiny lies elsewhere in a realm known only as obscurity ' i rate this one 1 10 br br br br
<START> a typical <UNK> film but then again not typical <UNK> writes directs and play one of the leading roles this is really a great film about normal people living normal lives trying to make the best of it the 4 primary actors were fantastic br br fritz <UNK> was convincing you believe that he really is sick br br <UNK> <UNK> plays a nurse that really is an actor but it turns out that she is the best nurse to take care of the old man br br everybody has problems and those who nobody believes in ends up being happy but nothing good comes easy they have to fight to win their life and love
<START> these two men went thru hell and beyond and have produced the movie that conveys the terror that many did not survive this is definitely a movie about survival but not without it's touching moments br br the finest piece of work i have seen <UNK> the 9 11 <UNK> tragedy of new york city
<START> this is not a boring movie the audience might stay on its chair fascinated by this selfish character miles <UNK> both film maker and actor here the storyline is simple after a divorce and ten years of a <UNK> non career the author plays is quest for love in front of the camera the first question is about how true is all that what is written what came by chance both answers yes or no portrays m <UNK> as a low average human <UNK> if you look for a self fiction about love like this one i <UNK> you to read some <UNK> comic books <UNK> brown joe matt br br beside of this i felt quite disappointed to hear so much against my country france i know american people usually say that the french are arrogant that might be true then etc and for sure the french and the whole world have lots of <UNK> against america but why so much hate don't think i couldn't like this movie only because of that anyhow
<START> by far the worst movie of all time even <UNK> <UNK> could not save this turkey i have heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled the treasure but was changed to <UNK> treasure in order to take advantage of the excitement created by jaws i think sharks were in one scene of this movie the fact that they happened to be included in this thriller was supposed to sell tickets didn't work anytime something good happens in the movie the <UNK> crew <UNK> each other with a certain brand of beer that had just been introduced at the time the movie was made gee do ya think that beer might have been a <UNK> could they have made it any more obvious the only time anyone should break out the beer is if they make it through this thing that's cause enough for celebration
<START> <UNK> aka <UNK> directed by <UNK> <UNK> starring <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> belongs together with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> rebellion to the best <UNK> movies existing br br its the story about <UNK> <UNK> who plays <UNK> <UNK> working for <UNK> who wants to become the <UNK> <UNK> being the <UNK> for <UNK> is being treated like a dog and after quite a while he realises what he <UNK> is to <UNK> br br but there is so much more in this movie every fan of japanese cinema should have seen it br br <UNK> means heavens punishment
<START> i finally got myself set up on mail order dvd rental so i could find movies not available to me in the stores i chose the <UNK> opposite because i love christopher <UNK> and also like small often ignored films br br this one is such a treat <UNK> has such charm in this part it's easy to <UNK> hole him is you only ever see him as his alter ego elliot <UNK> <UNK> in this film <UNK> is an out of step <UNK> mid <UNK> who is hitting the <UNK> in many ways only to find a path to happiness in someone unexpected br br the relationship drawn between barry <UNK> and tim <UNK> character is realistic and not over done i haven't seen <UNK> since <UNK> and he was fun to watch but it was all <UNK> film i became such a fan girl all over again br br it is a bit slow in the beginning i will admit i thought some of the flashbacks could have been edited down but overall this film will delight you male or female as it has an honest refreshing view of relationships today
<START> i don't watch a lot of tv except for the office <UNK> <UNK> and e 's soup i think i hold this show in good company br br i love the <UNK> review of pop culture that this show gives soup also helps me stay on top of what people in the office are referring to when talking about a <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br the best part is that soup shows clips of the highlights of these shows which are usually the funniest or most controversial moments c'mon most people get hooked into watching american idol because of the freak show that are the <UNK> which is why most people claim to watch and that means i don't have to suffer through the other 98 of these mind numbing talk shows or reality shows for one <UNK> of funny or shock the only reason why soup doesn't get a 10 in my opinion are sometime the sketches are not that funny and on an even <UNK> occasion the commentary isn't always up to par but they can't all be home runs either if so soup wouldn't be on e br br <UNK> quick wit and <UNK> writing team which includes <UNK> make for a great show i happen to enjoy the laughing and comments from the crew who are off camera even when they're being blatantly obvious by giving occasional courtesy laughs it's hilarious because it is forced they're obviously being ironic and that's part of what makes this show funny
<START> so yes it is quite nostalgic watching the 1st episode because this is the one episode i definitely remembered i enjoy watching the first season and yes compared to the action packed shows we have now this show seems lame but frankly i like the less violent part of the show and the story line has more substance than the new ones now i thought it interesting that <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> have similar theme the lead actor hawke and harm both are looking for an <UNK> relative brother father wonder if robert <UNK> personal life <UNK> these 2 <UNK> theme br br question does anyone have pictures of <UNK> cabin i love that cabin kinda like a dream cabin of mine and that is one of the scenes i remember about <UNK>
<START> i happen to be the director's nephew it's taken me years to get my hands on a copy of this film and i can confirm that it is indeed one of the worst movies of all time my uncle doesn't even have a copy of it anymore i asked i'm looking forward to bringing him a copy br br currently the film's average rating is 1 9 10 as far as i can tell that should put it somewhere in the mid 30s in the imdb bottom 100 however with only <UNK> votes it hasn't yet placed br br it's sad that the film doesn't even get the respect of a bottom 100 title br br anyhow i'm giving copies of the movie to family members this year for holiday gifts best worst gift ever
<START> this film is regarded by some as a classic i've no idea why it is terrible to the point of being laughable the only saving grace with this movie are the delivery of cheesy lines that are so toe <UNK> embarrassing that you have no choice but to laugh at them br br there are a couple of good songs and good choreography in this film but so what there is no plot it is set in a theatre with no change of scenery and michael douglas is as depressing as ever my brother once forced me to watch this film because he said i wouldn't believe how bad a film can get he was right br br normally with a film this dreadful i would recommend that people shouldn't watch it but in this case i think people should as it will put every other bad film you've seen in perspective
<START> i <UNK> to see the film at the recent <UNK> film festival because it had been selected to the cannes film <UNK> <UNK> competition section i was surprised that cannes could be so off the mark in judging quality br br the film some reviewers have noted does not have too much of <UNK> but the inherent violence is repulsive imagine killing your enemy <UNK> in front of your young son or forcing someone to eat a <UNK> <UNK> to prove loyalty there are some hints of the <UNK> <UNK> sons in <UNK> godfather that seem to <UNK> here in this chinese hong kong film but the quality of the two are as distinctly different as <UNK> and cheese br br this film is only recommended for violence <UNK> there is no great cinema here at best it might be considered to be better than the usual run run shaw production for production values
<START> the first time i saw this film i was in shock for days afterwards its <UNK> and absorbing treatment of the subject holds the attention helped by good acting and some really intriguing music the ending quite simply had me <UNK> first rate
<START> too bad chuck norris has gone to tv he made some good movies before he hit tv this is a typical tv movie intended to pass the time unfortunately it wastes <UNK> talent as an actor i hope he returns to the big screen some day
<START> this is the worst brain damaged ultra cheap super stupid silly pointless piece of trash i've ever seen an unbelievable garbage of instant cult status among fans of the bizarre if you think that ed <UNK> plan 9 is bad well let me tell you looks like citizen kane compared to that one <UNK> effects again plan 9 is star wars <UNK> <UNK> johnson is al pacino so it's beyond bad really but if you are looking for that kind of incredible movies it's for you i'm a fan of american international for so many glorious horror movies the price corman poe saga and some great <UNK> stuff but with star creatures they <UNK> right down to the z level of course my 1 out of 10 works in reverse if you like to watch bad movies for fun the guy playing an indian chief is great so have fun and enjoy if you can
<START> from director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of fortune i think i saw a bit of this in my media studies class and i <UNK> the leading actress so i tried it despite the rating by the critics basically cool kid richard <UNK> half <UNK> ryan <UNK> and justin <UNK> <UNK> michael pitt team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them investigating the murder is homicide detective cassie 'the <UNK> <UNK> sandra <UNK> with new partner sam kennedy ben chaplin who are pretty <UNK> by the evidence found on the scene e g non relating <UNK> the plan doesn't seem to be completely going well because cassie and sam do quite quickly have richard or justin as suspects it is just a question of if they can <UNK> them away also starring <UNK> <UNK> as lisa mills chris penn as ray <UNK> r d call as captain rod cody and tom <UNK> as <UNK> d a al <UNK> i can see now the same concept as sir alfred hitchcock's rope with the murdering for a challenge thing but this film does it in a very silly way and not even a reasonably good <UNK> can save it from being dull and predictable adequate
<START> this film on paper looked like it could possibly be good after watching though i realised that this film was completely terrible the plot has no meaning and i think i counted the best part of <UNK> cut scenes each one making the film more annoying boring and ridiculous i watched this late night pitch black no noise at all just to add to the <UNK> of it but the truth is the only thing that scared me was the music what they would call tragic music they play opera i mean be serious this film sums up all of what is not good about this type of film to be honest ill say no more but watch at your own risk this film is just complete rubbish enjoy
<START> i really liked this movie kurt manages to act without speaking letting moments speak for themselves he doesn't have to <UNK> or <UNK> his actions he simply decides and takes action he is supported by a good cast of actors and settings and is able to show us a more <UNK> side of soldiers without getting to corny
<START> much about love life can be learned from watching the folks at the shop around the corner br br <UNK> lubitsch had another quiet triumph added to his credit with this lovely film with <UNK> dialogue courtesy of his longtime <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and wonderful performances from a cast of <UNK> talented performers he created a truly memorable movie always believing in playing up to the intelligence of his viewers and <UNK> sophistication over slapstick the director <UNK> a <UNK> cinematic <UNK> seasoned with that <UNK> enigmatic quality known as the <UNK> touch ' br br although the story is set in <UNK> and there is a <UNK> of accents among the players this is of no consequence the beautiful simplicity of the plot is that any great american city or small town could easily be the <UNK> for the action br br jimmy stewart margaret <UNK> are wonderful as the <UNK> in love with romance and then with each other without knowing it their dialogue so <UNK> handled as to seem utterly natural perfectly conveys their confusion quiet desperation as they seek for soul mates theirs is one of the classic love stories of the cinema br br <UNK> frank morgan has a more serious role than usual that of a man whose <UNK> importance in his little world is <UNK> when he finds himself to be a <UNK> an accomplished scene <UNK> he allows no emotion to escape <UNK> additionally morgan provides the film with its most <UNK> few moments near the end when he <UNK> that his <UNK> <UNK> employee an <UNK> youth enjoys a memorable christmas eve br br joseph <UNK> adds another vivid depiction to his <UNK> of screen portrayals this time that of a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who thoroughly deserves the punishment eventually <UNK> out to him gentle felix <UNK> has his finest film role as a family man who really can not afford to become involved in shop <UNK> yet remains a <UNK> friend to stewart br br sara <UNK> <UNK> the small role of a sales clerk william tracy is hilarious as the ambitious <UNK> boy who takes advantage of <UNK> developments to <UNK> himself onto the sales force br br in tiny roles charles <UNK> plays a no nonsense detective and <UNK> <UNK> appears as a pompous doctor movie <UNK> will recognize mary <UNK> mabel <UNK> both uncredited in their single scene as miss <UNK> grandmother aunt
<START> spoilers br br i was blown away by this movie i've been renting on <UNK> for a bit and decided to check this movie out alot of boxing movies seem to <UNK> the blood in this movie it shows it at the <UNK> level though i do wish that perhaps more attention would have been brought to perhaps her <UNK> her <UNK> the movie points out the problems some families face with gender br br i was a bit concerned with the ending but the ending wasn't a disappointment either br br i think it was pretty clear by the title that she'd win what was unexpected was that the two of them got back together sort of at the end br br loved the score for some of the scenes highly recommended br br 10 10 br br quality 9 10 br br entertainment 10 10 br br <UNK> 10 10
<START> it's hard to say what was the worst thing about this show the bad acting poor <UNK> of different portions bad cgi <UNK> sets for the period the poor script it would have been nice if the script followed the original tale a bit closer there's enough tension and good material in beowulf to provide a great deal of good material and a better story line than the <UNK> could come up with br br and why introduce a strange new weapon like a <UNK> that fires explosive <UNK> br br i see that this movie was made in only 21 days it shows in the lack of quality i'm beginning to think this is general poor attitude taken by sci fi channel and others when it comes to making movies out of classic tales in the past few years br br what a waste
<START> oh my god what the hell happened here i'm not going to say this again but what sort of <UNK> movie is this the dubbing in this is way worst than the dubbing in king kong vs godzilla linda miller had to be the worst actress in it and the suits are really cheesy its about some villain called dr who who gets henchmen to build a robot gorilla that has the same strength as king kong but when this robot breaks down he builds another one and then tries to kidnap kong when he does thats when linda miller gets annoying he makes kong his slave but everything goes wrong and king kong escapes then dr who sends the robot after him br br later when i was watching the movie i got a headache when linda miller and the other <UNK> started <UNK> as i sat through the misery of watching the dvd while it was playing i was hoping that the madness in the movie was going to end until the fight the ending has to be a really bad one because they could've shown kong back on his island fighting dinosaurs again br br don't watch the movie under any circumstances or if you do beware of the disappointment you will receive
<START> the characters are cliched and predictable with everyone being either snow white pure or wholly evil the acting is too stilted for it to be bad in an amusing over the top way it's <UNK> disappointing if you're a bette davis fan because her character is not a typically fun bette davis type character she just gets to <UNK> <UNK> a lot br br on the whole neither my wife nor i found the movie to be interesting moving or enjoyable at all
<START> i saw this movie at the 2006 palm springs international film festival and it is a movie and not a film since it apparently was shot by hbo to be shown on their cable network sometime this year this movie presents page as a bondage and discipline fetish <UNK> and b d <UNK> film actress who had enough talent to become a real actress page was a little more than that and the film touches on some of her other roles in <UNK> but not enough to balance out the career of the 50's <UNK> icon this film is supposedly based on the book the real bettie page by richard foster it's shot in black and white for that 1950's nostalgia feel i have the book called bettie page the life of a <UNK> legend that has a lot of great photos <UNK> the career of page and i must say that this movie <UNK> on film with gretchen mol as page many of those famous <UNK> very accurately mol herself with the bettie page black wig and brown contact <UNK> is bettie page not only does she have the bettie page look but she has the smile and characteristics of her personality that came through the camera down perfect and her body is as close to a <UNK> of <UNK> as possible terrific casting the story is kind of thin and <UNK> and certainly could have been a lot better but this is a pretty good tv movie i would rate it a 7 0 of a scale of 10 and recommend it's viewing when it comes on tv
<START> i remember watching <UNK> ho as a child with my mother and wondered why she would always cry in the last few minutes i of course found the entire movie hilarious particularly the mannerisms of the characters it wasn't until i was much older and watched it again that i realized how much deeper this show actually is br br michael keaton and <UNK> <UNK> shine in their roles as the reluctant <UNK> keaton <UNK> to <UNK> me with his real life style of line delivery and <UNK> adds humor and pathos to the mix i also thought that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was simply fabulous in her role as the comic relief br br i think this movie is one of the most underrated films of the 80s we can all learn a lesson from the <UNK> of the american and japanese workers in this film sometimes you really can have the best of both worlds and now i understand why my mother felt the way she did in those closing moments i'd rather have one of those cars too
<START> i'd been following this films progress for quite some time so perhaps expected a little too much i consider both gillian anderson and danny <UNK> to be good at what they do and was interested to see what dan reed could come up with but unfortunately it just didn't work for me br br the problem lies in the fact that the film doesn't really seem to understand which genre it's falling into and as such it fails to impress on drama horror and thriller elements because rather than focusing on one of them and doing it well it's a bit of a jack of all <UNK> and master of none br br the premise as with most revenge films is simple couple meet and go out something bad happens and they get their revenge it's a simple formula and one that many directors have handled expertly over the years <UNK> in this case it's as if dan reed thought it'd be great to do one of those revenge films that goes a little deeper by showing a more human side to all the characters and <UNK> into their mental state in more detail wrong there are also a few key elements missing in this type of movie there's generally some kind of warning a don't do this or this might happen element which adds to the tension but there's nothing of the sort here it just simply happens then nothing happens for an hour then something interesting happens and then it ends br br there's a lot of really stiff competition in this genre and hats of to dan reed for trying i have no issue with his directing abilities but in term of writing i'd say next time he should stick to the formula for the type of film he's making instead of trying to be too clever and he'll have a quality movie on his hands
<START> 10 out of 10 this brilliant super documentary is a must see with film clips from the war which people did not seen for years <UNK> this was screened in 1974 the film clips in this documentary from the war doesn't miss out anything some of the clips left me <UNK> the whole series is over 20 episodes long and sir lawrence olivier is the narrator and tells a stunning story of war simply this is still probably the best documentary of war still and now over 25 years old still is able to pack a tremendous punch you must watch this at some time even if it's a few episodes even at that you will still be blown away at the impact this documentary means to those who have been there suffered and died in the name of war in a world at war
<START> i have been known to fall asleep during films but this is usually due to a combination of things including really tired being warm and comfortable on the <UNK> and having just eaten a lot however on this occasion i fell asleep because the film was rubbish the plot development was constant constantly slow and boring things seemed to happen but with no explanation of what was causing them or why i admit i may have missed part of the film but i watched the majority of it and everything just seemed to happen of its own <UNK> without any real concern for anything else i cant recommend this film at all
<START> i've bought certain films on disc even though the second rate presentation wasn't an option a certain company i won't identify here has put out several pan and <UNK> dvds clean and sober star 80 and this one to name just three of films i don't think anyone wants to see in this <UNK> format some <UNK> give the viewer a choice of <UNK> or full screen and others are just in their theatrical release 1 <UNK> 1 ratio br br that off my chest i'll say deathtrap was a spooky and oddly enough amusing picture my only complaints are the <UNK> score what is that f g <UNK> that is usually dragged out for films set in 18th century france and <UNK> cannon screaming at regular <UNK> couldn't her character have been an <UNK> who grabbed for an <UNK> when she was <UNK> minor complaints both the benefits of <UNK> include being able to fast forward to get beyond those things which you don't like br br i never saw a staged version of deathtrap so having these folks in the roles sets a great impression of their careers at the time before broadway tickets cost an arm and a leg the theatre was more <UNK> to average people now anyone paying less than a king's <UNK> to get live entertainment probably isn't going to a hit show on the great hyped way br br michael caine and christopher reeve were both large <UNK> <UNK> in the early 80s and that's integral to how we'll react to their profession and overall image here they're definitely not <UNK> men who can't fight or will back down from an <UNK> the two are equally great as their criminal <UNK> becomes their ultimate deathtrap
<START> the movie has a distinct albeit <UNK> and rough humanity for all its borderline <UNK> the <UNK> lyrical score points up the comic side of their <UNK> and even when they're at their most <UNK> like <UNK> the woman on the train a semi pitiful vulnerability <UNK> never far away <UNK> sucks on her breasts like a baby <UNK> cuts away from the scene where depardieu may be about to rape <UNK> so we're never sure how <UNK> to read the <UNK> <UNK> aspect of their relationship either way that incident is the start of their relative <UNK> so the movie could certainly be read as pro gay although it could likely be read as pro anything you want the movie has many <UNK> scenes and points of sexual politics and is probably best taken as a general cartoon on the <UNK> of both <UNK> making a mockery of the whole notion of sensitivity and honesty and hitting numerous points of possible <UNK> on the basis that if you fire off enough shots some of them are bound to hit
<START> i first saw blood of the samurai at its premiere during the hawaii international film festival wow blood just blew us away with its sheer <UNK> gore <UNK> gore excitement gore utter <UNK> and even more gore and all in such great fun especially for those of you who enjoy all those japanese <UNK> samurai and ninja films you definitely have to see blood
<START> i seems in the beginning a interesting film a spanish thriller in a interesting nowadays <UNK> but it <UNK> t none of that is actually a film only interesting for future films directors learning about what not to do making a film it can t be worse in others words even the presence of a oscar winner mira sorvino <UNK> t enough to justify the 3 00 dollars <UNK> to see this film the acting is horrendous and it seems the actors were just waiting to finish the daily shots to go home it lead to nowhere and is boring weak and bad don t <UNK> time or money on this film
<START> a serial killer dies in a <UNK> and gets mutated into <UNK> the <UNK> evil twin then goes on a killing spree interesting plot sounds scary and it is scary if you're five years old otherwise it's kind of cheesy i saw it on cable and i'm glad i didn't pay money to see it it has all the charm and style of a low budget movie which may become a cult film i'm sure it has a loyal fan base somewhere i'm just not in it even though i didn't like the movie as a whole there were some scenes i found amusing such as the <UNK> scene and the post explosion scene with the <UNK> reference it was also enjoyable to watch the many ways the heroes try to kill jack and he just doesn't seem to want to die in short jack frost is a good low budget b movie comedy but a bad low budget b movie horror
<START> it's been a long time since i saw this mini series and i am happy to say its remembered merits have <UNK> the test of time br br most of the <UNK> of 'a perfect <UNK> the adaptation of <UNK> finest novel in my opinion are top <UNK> outstanding aspects of it are the musical score and the masterful screenplay the latter written by arthur <UNK> who was also i believe the screenwriter for <UNK> <UNK> soldier <UNK> with alec guinness a few years before br br the actors are mostly very good some superb like alan <UNK> jack <UNK> and ray <UNK> ricky <UNK> peter <UNK> is fascinating to watch because his face changes with every camera angle the passage of time and the effects upon the physical appearances of the characters is very <UNK> done so much so that i wondered exactly how old peter <UNK> was at the time of filming the only <UNK> comes after the character of <UNK> <UNK> is transferred from the very able hands of a young actor named <UNK> taylor to those of a <UNK> too old peter <UNK> just fresh out of <UNK> but this is a minor and <UNK> <UNK> in the whole br br <UNK> has trouble being convincing only when the text becomes melodramatic and he needs to be upset emotionally ie cry none of the actors have a very easy time with these moments aside from the wonderful frances <UNK> who plays peggy <UNK> for all she's worth and steals the episode with ease br br jane booker is annoying as mary <UNK> she has part of the character under her skin but often displays an amateurish <UNK> that <UNK> her as a tough cookie <UNK> housewife which mary <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> is splendid as <UNK> amusing ironic and brilliant i also enjoyed sarah <UNK> camp turn as the <UNK> br br the british view of americans is vividly rendered in some <UNK> hilarious scenes when the <UNK> have come abroad to <UNK> with bo <UNK> head of <UNK> the american <UNK> are portrayed as empty headed <UNK> who appear to have <UNK> a lot of long words out of the <UNK> and <UNK> them <UNK> with american <UNK> and psycho <UNK> much to the <UNK> <UNK> of the english br br the humor and sadness are subtly <UNK> <UNK> has a knack for mixing <UNK> elements in his stories and <UNK> has brilliantly captured the melancholy yet <UNK> atmosphere of the original br br not a perfect production what is and yet the best of the <UNK> adaptations to reach film or television to date br br highly recommended to all spy thriller lovers and especially <UNK> fans dvd available from <UNK>
<START> spoilers 9 11 is a very good and very realistic documentary about the attacks on the <UNK> 2 french film makers who are in new york to film the actions of a <UNK> are being confronted with this event and make the most of it before 9 11 nothing much really happens which gives the movie an even more horror like scenario on the day of the attacks it seems like just another dull day at work but this will soon change as one the film makers goes on the road with the <UNK> he films the first crashing plane this is the only footage of the first impact he rides with the <UNK> to the <UNK> and goes inside the building as the second plane crashes the people understand that this is not an accident in the next period of time we see <UNK> making plans to save as many people as possible in the meanwhile we hear <UNK> sounds these are the sounds of people who jumped down from the tower and falling on the ground this is the most <UNK> moment in the documentary then the tower <UNK> and our french friend has to run for his life you hear him breath like a madman while he runs out of the building then a huge sort of <UNK> <UNK> over him and the screen turns black he was very lucky to survive and now he can film the empty streets of downtown new york because this documentary has got so much historical footage and because the film was <UNK> to be something totally different this documentary will probably stay in everybody's memory i saw the attacks live at home because i had the afternoon of so this makes it even more realistic to watch 10 10
<START> first off consider that this film is nearly fifty years old yet it still stands up as one of the great films of all time i wonder how many of todays throwaway celluloid productions will still be talked about in <UNK> br br the story is simple yet solid enough and the effects are nothing short of phenomenal for the day i can still recall the first time i watched this as a kid when the monster enters the force field protecting the ship and you got to see its outline for the first and only time had me <UNK> in fear i can tell you looks dated today but still more than effective enough br br the scenes with the tiger show their age now you can see the outline where the tiger was <UNK> into the shots with <UNK> but they are only just visible br br likewise the effect <UNK> the creature <UNK> its way through the <UNK> doors are wonderfully done br br it's also amazing to see leslie <UNK> better remembered for the airplane and naked gun movies as a young but still mature man he was 30 when this film came out nearly 80 now br br all in all a good movie that is sure to continue being a favourite for years to come timeless
<START> seven pounds this was the movie where i was just convinced will smith is really going for the i'm going to make you cry films one thing i can give him a ton of credit for the man can cry my only thing is as moving as the story is will smith has proved time and time again that he can act so why is he taking this extremely depressing story but nevertheless it's still a good movie i do have to admit it made me cry but i felt that the stand out performance was rosario dawson i absolutely love this girl ever since i saw her in <UNK> hour with ed norton i knew this girl was going to go far she's beautiful charming funny and talented can't wait to see how much further her career is going to go but her and will smith not so sure if they had the great chemistry that the film needed that would've made this into a great film br br two years ago tim thomas was in a car crash which was caused by him using his mobile phone seven people died six strangers and his fiancée a year after the crash and having quit his job as an <UNK> engineer tim <UNK> a lung <UNK> to his brother ben an irs employee six months later he <UNK> part of his <UNK> to a child services worker named holly after that he begins searching for more candidates to receive <UNK> he finds george a junior hockey coach and <UNK> a <UNK> to him and then <UNK> bone <UNK> to a young boy named nicholas two weeks before he dies he contacts holly and asks if she knows anyone who deserves help she suggests connie <UNK> who lives with an abusive boyfriend tim moves out of his house and into a local motel taking with him his pet box <UNK> one night after being beaten connie contacts tim and he gives her the keys and deed to his beach house she takes her two children and moves in to their new home having stolen his brother's <UNK> and making himself known by his brother's name ben he <UNK> out candidates for his two final <UNK> the first is <UNK> turner a blind <UNK> meat salesman who plays the piano tim calls <UNK> turner and <UNK> him at work to check if he is quick to anger <UNK> remains calm and tim decides he is worthy he then contacts emily <UNK> a self employed <UNK> card <UNK> who has a heart condition and a rare blood type he spends time with her <UNK> her garden and <UNK> her rare <UNK> <UNK> he begins to fall in love with her and decides that as her condition has <UNK> he needs to make his <UNK> br br seven pounds is a good film and no doubt worth a look i would just recommend going for the rental vs the theater will smith pulls in a good performance but not his best just most of the film required him crying in every scene but the last one with him is a <UNK> but i loved the ending it was beautiful and really made you appreciate life and to not take it for granted there is still good people in this world and ben's character reminds you to value life and to give to those who are in desperate need although he went a little far but it was still a beautiful story br br 7 10
<START> when you get to the scenes that involve albert brooks without his shirt try not to gag on a fur ball br br i like albert brooks i've seen most if not all of his movies but it was the first time seeing this one modern romance is an interesting take on the subject of love there are few movies that handle the desperation of love as well or as overtly as modern romance although <UNK> <UNK> scenes of winter comes very close they both essentially deal with obsessed men that are too psychologically attracted obsessed to their respective women br br where as <UNK> scenes of winter borders on the subject stalking this movie has a more grounded foundation with the subject of love because both people are already in a relationship and out of the relationship and back in it again br br and because it's a movie that was released in 1981 it is of its time in terms of styles and such that's the main reason i like this movie my basic rule when it comes to movies is if it sucks at least it may have some historic relevance you know time capsule stuff br br which leads me to the horrific scenes of albert brooks sans shirt br br the man is hair very hair like he's wearing a black curly fur <UNK> hairy and what's worse is he almost looks burn victim hairy it's not a pleasant sight and the scenes with him without a shirt go on and on back in the early 80's hairy men were seen as normal and nothing shocking but in 2009 the sight of something like this is just plain revolting sorry albert i wish at some point someone said hey let's try this scene but with you wearing a simple t shirt i mean you might scare people it's just really bad and i feel sorry for the poor pretty actress that had to deal with albert brooks naked body on top of hers she was probably pulling out his <UNK> from her teeth for days after that br br anyway it's an ok movie it could have been better if i hadn't see albert brooks without his shirt for what seemed like 10 long continuous minutes because that will forever <UNK> my viewing of this movie
<START> sad story of a <UNK> b 17 pilot brady is shot down over occupied territory the local <UNK> extended him kindness and protection at the cost of their own lives i had never heard of this movie and it <UNK> me for two hours after the film is over i'm glad i took the time it's an entire story told to explain the look on <UNK> face at the start of the film
<START> well i just ordered this on my pay per view at home because i was bored and needed a laugh i have to admit i did chuckle a few times but i don't even remember what parts they were at i don't understand why this movie was made it claims to be a comedy but <UNK> i don't find a singing penis or a naked 70 year old woman very funny this movie was trying to fit itself into the <UNK> <UNK> comedies of recent years such as american pie and road trip but it just failed miserably it was way to much gross out then it was comedy also why on earth did cameron diaz <UNK> her name to this movie the only thing i liked about this movie was when dave and angela were in the pool i thought it was sexy and enjoyable and well done besides that avoid this movie 3 10
<START> in 1948 this was my all time favorite movie betty <UNK> costumes were so ravishing that i wanted to grow up to be her and dress like that douglas fairbanks jr was irresistible as the dashing hungarian officer silly and <UNK> as this movie might appear at first when i was eight years old it seemed to me to say something important about relations between men and women i saw it again the other day i was surprised to find that it still did
<START> the <UNK> began as a 1971 short novel by the now deceased bernard <UNK> writer <UNK> <UNK> the conflicts between jews and african americans in the <UNK> atmosphere of brooklyn at the time the book was written as a novel the story was gut <UNK> real as <UNK> into a screenplay by <UNK> david diamond and danny green who also directs it is more of a cerebral <UNK> that gradually <UNK> into action in the final moments br br harry lesser dylan mcdermott is a jewish novelist with one book under his belt but currently attempting to finish his <UNK> book ten years into the writing convinced that he must complete the novel in the same environment where it was started he is the sole tenant in a condemned brooklyn <UNK> owned by <UNK> seymour <UNK> who constantly tries to <UNK> <UNK> harry's <UNK> so that the filthy <UNK> building can be <UNK> into this atmosphere enters another black <UNK> quasi anti <UNK> writer willie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> whom harry befriends hides and offers help to the <UNK> <UNK> attempt to write about the death of all white people harry's attempts to help willie lead to conflict not the least of which is harry's meeting <UNK> girlfriend the white jewish irene bell rose <UNK> at a less than friendly gathering of <UNK> <UNK> black brothers and sisters willie and irene are on the <UNK> and harry gradually falls in love with irene and they plan to leave new york as soon as harry finishes his novel when willie hears of the <UNK> and is further <UNK> by harry willie explodes and begins the <UNK> descent of not only a delicate friendship but also a competition between writers the ending <UNK> the <UNK> nature of the human condition and the human capacity for violence and <UNK> br br the actors do their best with a script that is a bit awkward but despite scripted lines that border on preaching they create believable characters the cinematography enhances the story keeping the mood <UNK> and dense and primarily confined to the condemned building the musical score appropriately makes use of the solo jazz <UNK> and blues piano to <UNK> the tension and isolation of each of these <UNK> characters though it takes some patience to make it through the cerebral <UNK> the film in the end is worth watching at least it attempts to recreate <UNK> bizarre look at life in the big city grady <UNK>
<START> i saw his film at the ann <UNK> film festival i am a film student at the <UNK> of <UNK> so i know a thing or two about film and <UNK> <UNK> film is outrageous he basically exploits the mentally challenged not only is <UNK> temple the anti christ which i admit is a little funny telling the mentally challenged to kill each other but there is an obsession with killing <UNK> <UNK> also plays with the idea of being in love with one of his actors who is as they all are mentally challenged <UNK> and human rights should be all over this thing it's not <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> stated at the ann <UNK> film festival it's exploitation
<START> tears of <UNK> is an original yet flawed horror film that <UNK> into the <UNK> of a cult group in india comprised of german <UNK> who have learned how to control their <UNK> and their bodies to the point that they can cause others to be <UNK> through radical techniques that can trigger nightmarish hallucinations and physical pain and torture to release the <UNK> up demons inside them br br the film is shown as a series of vignettes about the taylor <UNK> group the above mentioned cult group the first segment is somewhat slower than the rest but serves fine to set up the premise for the rest of the film the rest of it plays out like a <UNK> <UNK> film with some of the key <UNK> thrown in the mix full frontal nudity some gore to keep you happy br br i say check this out may not be spectacular but it's concept is pretty <UNK> and it delivers in the right spots 8 10
<START> i went into deathtrap expecting a well <UNK> and intriguing thriller and while that's something like what this film is i also can't help but think that it's just a poor man's sleuth the classic 1972 film is obviously an inspiration for this film not particularly in terms of the plot but certainly it's the case with the execution the casting of michael caine in the central role just <UNK> it the film is based on a play by ira <UNK> who previously wrote rosemary's baby and the <UNK> wives and focuses on sidney <UNK> a playwright whose best days are behind him after his latest play bombs sidney finds himself at a low and this is not helped when a play named deathtrap written by an amateur he taught arrives on his <UNK> deathtrap is a guaranteed commercial success and sidney soon begins <UNK> a plot of his own which involves <UNK> round the amateur <UNK> killing him and then passing deathtrap off as his own work br br despite all of its clever twists and turns deathtrap falls down on one primary element and that's the characters the film fails to provide a single likable character and it's very hard to care about the story when you're not rooting for any of the players this is not helped by the acting michael caine puts in a good and entertaining performance as you would expect but nobody else does themselves proud christopher reeve is awkward in his role while <UNK> cannon somehow manages to make the only possibly likable character <UNK> with a frankly irritating performance it's lucky then that the story is good and it is just about good enough to save the film the plot features plenty of twists and turns some work better than others but there's always enough going on to ensure that the film stays interesting director sidney lumet deserves some credit too as the style of the film is another huge plus the central location is interesting in its own right and the cinematography fits the film well overall i have to admit that i did enjoy this film but it could have been much much better
<START> the movie was terrible easily the worst movie i have seen in the past few years one of those movies i will be able to tell people for the next three years that it was the worst movie i can think of thank you for giving me an answer to that burning question what is the worst movie you have seen answer <UNK> prophecy trust me i read the book enjoyed the message and was excited to see the movie but then they treated the audience like we are r <UNK> there is no story and the story that is there is crippled by too much magic and coincidence it is too bad they have to spell out the nine <UNK> and can't simply <UNK> them into a story that is entertaining to follow they didn't spend any time on character development and it was easy to not care if any character died it was embarrassing to be one of the few people who stuck around until the end of this incredibly boring movie the book is pretty boring too but i enjoyed the parallels that could be seen in everyday life while you read the book the film does not offer the same opportunity and i would suggest not seeing it if you want to continue to hold the words of the book close to your heart don't see this movie trust me
<START> paul <UNK> and his wife <UNK> must deal with their two teenage daughters and weird son but after the <UNK> passing of john ritter the show became more about <UNK> with the loss of a loved one br br i found this show passing through the channels one afternoon and i have to say i was laughing myself till my <UNK> <UNK> simply at the range of characters the witty lines and the situation paul would find himself dealing mostly with his daughters from then on i caught the rest of the show when i was free and i have to say the writing was very good but then i read about john <UNK> death shortly afterwards i watched <UNK> part 2 and i have to say i was nearly in tears watching the emotions of the characters losing a loved one how <UNK> punches a wall in anger and frustration how <UNK> deals with having to sleep in her bed all alone <UNK> and <UNK> talking about what they should have done br br but the show does move on bringing with it jim <UNK> and <UNK> barnes who provide great laughs as <UNK> father tries to protect his family and give <UNK> issue <UNK> to <UNK> but the true gem is <UNK> who is absolutely hilarious as the wild cousin br br it will always be john <UNK> masterpiece
<START> this was a wonderful little american propaganda film that is both highly creative and openly <UNK> the nazi atrocities before the entire extent of the death camps were revealed while late 1944 and into 1945 would reveal just how evil and horrific they were this film unlike other hollywood films to date is the most brutally honest film of the era i have seen regarding nazi atrocities br br the film begins in a courtroom in the future after the war is over the film was made in 1944 the war ended in may 1945 in this <UNK> world court a nazi leader is being tried for war crimes <UNK> <UNK> is totally <UNK> and one by one witnesses are called who reveal <UNK> life since <UNK> in a series of flashbacks at first it appears that the film is going to be sympathetic or explain how <UNK> was pushed to join the nazis however after a while it becomes very apparent that <UNK> is just a sadistic monster these episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and also make the film seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate drama br br all in all the film does a great job considering the film mostly stars second <UNK> actors there are many compelling scenes and performances especially the very <UNK> jewish <UNK> scene towards the end that can't help but bring you close to tears it was also interesting how around the same point in the film there were some super creative scenes that use crosses in a way you might not notice at first overall it's a must see for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good film br br <UNK> this is not meant as a serious criticism of the film but hitler was referred to as that paper <UNK> this is a reference to the myth that hitler had once made money putting up <UNK> this is in fact not true previously he'd been a starving artist homeless person and served well in the german army in wwi a horrible person yes but never a paper <UNK>
<START> people i know is a <UNK> with no one to root for and no one to care about despite the game efforts of a talented cast br br pacino delivers his usual tour de force as eli <UNK> a past his prime publicity agent <UNK> out by a lifetime of moral corruption but unlike michael <UNK> it's impossible to have an emotional investment in this character his dilemma or his fate br br the film <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for a benefit for a liberal political cause while distracted by a <UNK> ryan <UNK> good in an <UNK> part latest dirty <UNK> in this case a tv actress companion who's gotten involved with the wrong people tea <UNK> brings her <UNK> star power to this supporting role although again the script doesn't give her much to work with as <UNK> sister in law kim basinger manages to evoke sympathy despite implausible plot <UNK> br br this movie is strictly for those who like watching pacino <UNK> his stuff and enjoy the other principals unfortunately between the script and direction people i know is strictly amateurish hence its limited theatrical release and <UNK> journey to dvd consider yourself warned
<START> the underground comedy movie is perhaps one of the worst comedies i've ever seen i should have known it was going to be bad when the box had the phrase guaranteed to offend written on it meaning that the filmmakers were going to focus more on <UNK> you out than making you laugh br br this movie is an amateurish <UNK> of childish skits bad characters and worse jokes from the pathetic bat man sketch to the painfully unfunny arnold <UNK> skit they just aren't funny the few skits that are a little funny are few and far between watching micheal clark <UNK> play a gay virgin for example but even they go on too long and get ruined from vince <UNK> <UNK> at comedy br br keep the underground comedy movie underground bury it
<START> this movie had a lot of blood in it when the <UNK> attack it also i loved it when that guy and the women were having some good time and then the <UNK> attacked the women and ate her stomach and took the <UNK> out that was the best and the <UNK> <UNK> walking on its front legs hilarious to make this movie better more action and less talking if you know what i mean and also please please people who made this movie don't make <UNK> movie like this movies ending cause it was terrible 1 <UNK> alive and killed that women in the end this movie reminds me of the <UNK> ending always there's 1 enemy left ok damn it this movie sucks i can <UNK> believe it i loved it when my <UNK> <UNK> got freaked from the attacks stomach <UNK> out and the blood ya
<START> the <UNK> is about well a <UNK> a servant of satan and whose goal is to get the key that will <UNK> the door where his master is trapped he is some sort of demon who possess human beings and when the body dies will possess another anyone who happens to be possessed will go on some <UNK> rage dolph lundgren plays lukas a member of a secret order of <UNK> who is <UNK> to keep the key away from the <UNK> the movie begins a thousand years ago in the middle east where a couple of knight <UNK> flee from the <UNK> then flash forward to 1999 where the key winds up somewhere underground in new york an <UNK> is assigned to study dig the place where the key was found needless to say the <UNK> is after the key and the movie becomes a long <UNK> chase scene between the <UNK> and lukas and <UNK> br br the movie is just that a low budget b movie flick the movie lacks energy and just <UNK> along you'll follow the chase but you won't ever feel involved in the story which <UNK> takes ideas from previous movies especially the terminator films the fight scenes with the <UNK> is <UNK> in that you never get the sense of how good or how bad a warrior this demon is it <UNK> becomes a one man army when fighting a squad of <UNK> but sucks when it comes to one on one and it's supposed to be around for a long time all this goes to show that any sense of logic is just thrown down the drain for <UNK> the whole idea of a secret order of <UNK> a door to hell and the key isn't well explained we are merely to accept that they just exist the movie seems to have been made with the feeling there's not much potential to the story but only enough to make a few bucks dolph lundgren sure looks like he wish he were somewhere else br br the verdict 2 of 5 stars
<START> this movie is goofy as hell i think it was written as a serious film but then when it came time to film michael <UNK> said hey let's throw in some humor and spice it up the characters are actually slightly developed too oh and the death sequences are the best one thing i hate though was the <UNK> weapons what was that all about
<START> this movie was recommended to me by a friend i never saw an ad or a trailer so i didn't know clooney was in it and was not bothered by the fact that his role was so small i thought the whole cast was suitable and found the film pretty enjoyable all in all the opening scene with the small crew of <UNK> standing at the side of the road looking whipped and <UNK> caught my attention immediately it had a way of telling you don't go away this won't be boring and it really wasn't it turned out to be an interesting light hearted comedy with enough twists and turns to keep you in your seat to the very end but when the ending did arrive i felt a little bit cheated just a little bit the events kept building up so that you expect them to continue building but at a point that i can't define it sort of levels out making the ending a slight disappointment i <UNK> i expected a bigger bang of a climax but it turned out sort of low key if you watch the movie with that in mind and you can live without high <UNK> of george clooney you should find this flick very entertaining and well worth watching now i'd like to see the original big deal on madonna street but it's probably a rare find in the united states
<START> this was a very good movie and is absolutely unfair to judge it without taking into account the time when it was released there are some movies which do not get older but this is clearly out of date however i saw this film when i was a boy and for more than twenty years both the images as the story were unforgettable for me and most of my friends until we could appreciate it again on dvd actually i do remember this movie as the topic of several <UNK> and <UNK> where old boys were talking about things we have in common therefore there was a little feeling of disappoint and even sadness when we finally had the dvd firstly there was a theory about how <UNK> our generation was secondly i think there is something more i would asset that this movie has something which should be interesting for all the modern film makers specifically those who focus on the <UNK> horror genre this is the <UNK> the idea which gives <UNK> to the film the fact of a human being <UNK> produces a deeper horror than death and torture i remember how sick the sensation was when the monster rip <UNK> arm out and at the end when the creature bites the doctor's neck to take a piece of his <UNK> another remarkable thing is the morbid atmosphere which <UNK> without <UNK> in intensity through all the scenes no matter if the action is on a secret lab a lonely street where the man in a car is looking for a female body a <UNK> dressing room and so on may be the reasons why it is not longer a good movie are just technical things for example in the scene of the accident and the man saving his <UNK> head a more accurate work made for another and modern second unit director could be interesting same thing with all action scenes including the one of <UNK> arm furthermore something could be done with the <UNK> make up some remakes have been good i think in this case an attempt would worth while nevertheless the black and white tones should be <UNK>
<START> the title sequence shows the credits written on a rain <UNK> sidewalk as people <UNK> on it music is provided by someone <UNK> alfred <UNK> street scene then we meet <UNK> sgt mark dixon dana andrews who always wanted to be something his old man wasn't a guy on the right side of the law but he's pretty vicious for a good guy after several complaints over his <UNK> people up his boss <UNK> nicholas <UNK> robert f simon <UNK> him <UNK> tells him he's a good man but needs to get his head on straight and be more like <UNK> lt thomas karl malden who has just gotten a promotion br br meanwhile tommy <UNK> gary <UNK> in a <UNK> slimy performance has an illegal <UNK> game going and is looking to make a sucker out of the rich ted <UNK> harry von <UNK> who was brought in by ken <UNK> craig stevens and his beautiful wife morgan gene tierney she figures out too late her husband is using her as a <UNK> and <UNK> strikes her when she refuses to play along the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but <UNK> knocks him out cold that seems to be the worst of it but later it turns out the guy is dead and <UNK> looks guilty br br but this won't be <UNK> story soon dixon has fallen in love with <UNK> not before losing his temper again and committing a terrible deed that he tries to cover up <UNK> father a tale spinning taxi driver tom <UNK> may take the rap for it it's up to dixon to try to pin the blame on <UNK> br br otto preminger directs a script credited to ben <UNK> and three others from the novel night cry by william l stuart this is a solid film noir with excellent performances and all the shadowy photography and murky morality we expect from this genre it holds up until the <UNK> lit ending which looks like something the studio had filmed to <UNK> the censors of course the classic noir directed by preminger and starring andrews and tierney is laura you'll enjoy this but you can't miss that
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i saw it at the toronto film festival and totally regret wasting my time completely unwatchable with no redeeming qualities whatsoever br br steer clear
<START> there's hardly anything at all to recommend this movie chase masterson is always nice to look at and actually can act though her role in this <UNK> is a waste unfortunately the rest of the cast <UNK> from bad to mediocre in a lot of films like this someone will shine through the material and you make a note of them for future reference no such luck here creature unknown a clichéd monster on the loose flick with the kids getting knocked off one after the other the monster is a man in a rubber suit which <UNK> back to the days of paul <UNK> so bad it's good the rest of the show is just so bad it's bad a little humor might have made this more <UNK> but everyone plays the deadly dull material straight up there is a twist or two at the end but by then you won't care anymore
<START> i've seen mystery men cop a bit of stick in the press and with the general public take the imdb vote for instance but my overall feeling is that mystery men is more fun than most films definitely <UNK> than most so called comedy films and very nearly <UNK> br br the cast is superb greg kinnear is excellent as are geoffrey rush and tom waits <UNK> <UNK> scene with ricky jay is perfect <UNK> movie <UNK> and he <UNK> his character with the right balance of comic book quality and realism to make him work br br i will admit the pacing is a little off in places and visuals are certainly very flash bang possibly to the <UNK> of further characterisation but at the end of the day this is high concept film making it's about the little moments what's up tiger lily and there are so many great ones in this film to make it worth repeated viewing
<START> <UNK> and <UNK> is a magical adventure film with a certain charm despite not being one of the best disney works it has a generally good story nice songs great characters good actors magical and delightful special effects good settings and lovely landscapes of england br br it also combines very well live action and animation the animation itself is of course pretty good the animation resembles very much that of the 1973 animated film robin hood and the same can be said about the animated characters there are plenty of wild animals such as bears elephants <UNK> lions <UNK> and others like in robin hood besides the king a lion seems to be a mix of prince john and king richard not to mention that the bear does look like little john br br this movie is often compared to mary <UNK> with a reason both combine live action and animation with a similar artwork both have similar settings in london both have their own magic and a magical woman the kids carrie charlie and cute little paul are a bit like the banks children both movies were directed by robert stevenson and both cast david <UNK> however instead of a very serious man like george banks david <UNK> plays a <UNK> and magical man professor <UNK> <UNK> with its magic this movie has also some slight but significant similarities to harry <UNK> stories br br the majority of the songs are good the age of not believing and the beautiful <UNK> sea are the very best <UNK> road is nice too br br david <UNK> is great in this film once again angela lansbury is great as miss price and the 3 kid actors are all fine too cindy <UNK> as carrie ian <UNK> as charlie a boy in <UNK> age of not <UNK> and roy <UNK> as the youngest brother paul br br i like the black cat it's pretty cool it looks a bit like <UNK> the black cat from the tv series sabrina the teenage witch i find cute whenever one of the movie's characters is transformed into a white rabbit <UNK> are really cute <UNK> and adorable animals i just love them even funnier is whenever professor <UNK> <UNK> is transformed into a white rabbit because when he's transformed in human again he shakes his nose like a rabbit it's really hilarious combined with his comical figure and that mustache br br overall this is an okay movie but its ending is quite bad the first minutes of the movie are nothing special but then it <UNK> a lot the ending however is weak that's my major criticism about it in great part because the animated knights thing is a little too much for me and also due to the war feeling
<START> allen goes to the country somewhere he hates going in real life and has a weekend with his friends which are the usual successful white middle class <UNK> types that feature in many of his films br br i usually find something to <UNK> in woody allen comedies but here he really falls totally flat on his face even the one liners seem to have deserted him the really is no plot bar bits and pieces of <UNK> shakespeare but allen seems to use the location to allow a semi mystical air which just makes the thing even more witless and half baked br br it just doesn't work at any level and is just a giant bore the best thing about this film apart from the end credits coming up is that the bad reviews seem to get him to wake up and realise that simply throwing together a <UNK> script and casting your mates in it doesn't make for entertainment
<START> the only reason i watched the movie till the end was the hope to see something interesting the movie is really bad and the performance of the girl it is really really bad honestly i am not a movie critic neither an expert but you just need common sense to notice that this work it is incredibly bad br br the first thing that came to my mind as soon as she started to talk was she has an affair with willem dafoe and he accepted to help her with the screenplay and appear in her movie since she is the brilliant director surprise surprise next day after i watched the film i found out on internet that <UNK> <UNK> is his wife awful story and terrible performance
<START> just a warning this is the worst movie i have seen in years i couldn't watch it to the end it is a pure waste of time i really feel sorry for snipes that he ended up in such a movie there really is not much to say about it horrible acting incredibly bad lines story everything the only reason i would advise you to watch this movie is if you really want to see how a movie shouldn't be just to tell you one scene the police are searching for snipes and they are surrounding the building with <UNK> and cars they are shooting around inside the building but still they are <UNK> so that snipes doesn't suspect a thing
<START> most italian horror lovers seem to hate this movie since because it has no connection to the first two demons films and with the demons iii in the title one would assume it would the problem is that this film was never intended to be part of the demons series the <UNK> only a demons iii above its original title the ogre to cash in on the other films popularity the new american dvd release of this picture has the title demons iii the ogre on the box art but the film itself only says the ogre i don't know if past releases had the title demons iii on the actual film itself but this new release just seems to be a little white lie if you can get past the demons iii in the title you might some enjoyment in the ogre it starts out with a creep intro and stays pretty creep throughout there's no gore and the film movies slowly but i still <UNK> it just don't expect it to be like the other demons films i give the ogre 7 out of 10 italian fans should try it out
<START> this film has little to recommend it though that little being the breathtaking scenery cinematography and direction of <UNK> it is difficult to bring up its weak points in the company of such rave reviews it is precisely these things however that make the lack of a satisfactory plot and its execution so disappointing br br i watched this with my children and none of us was too impressed by the end yes the pictures were great the broad landscapes across the forest and mountains magnificent but what was going on in the <UNK> the rather dull narration of the stupidity of an insipid girl who learns all too slowly a very basic lesson about <UNK> <UNK> and gets off quite easily given the track record of that sort of thing it is certainly not a new story in fact there is nothing remotely novel about the way it is told and we have all seen this before and indeed much more <UNK> by <UNK> de saint <UNK> br br the only thing really to be <UNK> from this film is a sense of how to work with these wonderful <UNK> and forest lighting the rest is a waste of time
<START> i saw <UNK> when it was first released in 1980 and i have just seen it again it <UNK> with age <UNK> is not just for lovers of indie films at a time when most american films are little more than cynical attempts to make money with cgi <UNK> and or <UNK> <UNK> holds up as a slice of american history it is also a reminder of how spoiled most of us modern <UNK> americans are br br nothing in this film is <UNK> or <UNK> no one <UNK> any hollywood movie speeches the actors really inhabit their roles this really feels like a small film but really it is bigger than most <UNK> dollar hollywood productions br br the film is based on the lives of real people in <UNK> <UNK> randall <UNK> ferrell who has never done anything better than this a widow with a 7 year old daughter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is living in denver but wants more opportunities she <UNK> for a position as <UNK> the ad is answered by clyde stewart rip torn one of our most under appreciated actors a <UNK> born <UNK> himself a widower with a <UNK> outside of burnt <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> accepts the position seven dollars a week and moves up to <UNK> with her daughter she and her daughter move into stewart's tiny house on the property it is rolling <UNK> <UNK> a place of endless <UNK> where the silence is broken only by the sounds made by these people and their animals it's guaranteed to make a person feel small the three characters go for long periods without seeing another human soul what is worse stewart turns out to be <UNK> to the point of being almost silent i can't talk to the man <UNK> complains to grandma <UNK> you'd better learn before winter replies grandma grandma <UNK> <UNK> is one of the only two other characters who are seen more than <UNK> she came out to <UNK> from germany with her husband many years before and runs her ranch alone now that she is also widowed grandma is their nearest neighbor and the local <UNK> and still she lives ten miles away the other supporting character is jack the hired hand barry <UNK> br br <UNK> routine and her <UNK> is one of endless <UNK> labor where there are no modern <UNK> and where everything must be made fixed or done by hand this is the real meat of the film watching the ordinary life of these <UNK> as they struggle against nature to <UNK> a living from the land but despite the constant <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is always looking for other opportunities she learns that the <UNK> <UNK> to stewart's is <UNK> <UNK> she files a claim on the property twelve dollars or almost two <UNK> pay meaning that if she lives on it and she must actually live there and works it for ten years she will get the deed to it naturally stewart learns what she has done with <UNK> logic he points out that with no money no <UNK> no credit and no <UNK> she has no chance of <UNK> he then offers a solution he <UNK> marriage the stunned <UNK> realizes that this is the only real alternative and accepts br br we think that stewart's <UNK> is purely <UNK> he wants the land and the free labor but we see that in fact he is genuinely fond of <UNK> and they grow together as a couple she becomes pregnant she goes into labor in the middle of a <UNK> <UNK> clyde travels for hours on <UNK> through the storm the ten miles to <UNK> and the ten miles back only to <UNK> that grandma wasn't there this is more like real life than is pleasant folks <UNK> has the baby all by herself with no help whatsoever their son is still an <UNK> when he gets sick and dies they lose half their <UNK> to the vicious winter they struggle on the last sequence in the film is supposed to be optimistic the birth of a <UNK> clyde calls <UNK> <UNK> to help him deliver the <UNK> instead of being head first the <UNK> is in a <UNK> <UNK> presentation he and <UNK> must physically pull the <UNK> out of the birth <UNK> there is no cgi <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or special effects what you see is what happened folks a <UNK> is born on a bed of straw in a wooden <UNK> by <UNK> with that the film does not so much end as simply stop leaving the viewer <UNK> but after a while you appreciate the film as a whole not just for its ending br br this little gem <UNK> patience and <UNK> it will be watchable long after most of the films of the last generation have long been forgotten
<START> for some reason in the late 70's and early 80's the local cbs <UNK> station in new york kept playing this movie in it's late night <UNK> on friday or saturday nights for several years usually at 2 a m or some such time it's a fitting movie for that time <UNK> since it's really hard to follow and quite odd see the other reviews for specific story info anyway after catching it numerous times in those days just before cable tv and even after it hit but before they offered much all night programming i kept catching this little <UNK> after not seeing it for many years i decided to see if i could find it on dvd well it is only available from every search i've <UNK> anyway in a pretty lousy grainy print on the budget label <UNK> video as part of a 4 pack of movies 4 movies on 2 double sided <UNK> called alien worlds if anyone is interested it's usually available for around 10 but even much less if you shop around the other 3 movies on this set are readily available in numerous other <UNK> of public <UNK> movies so no need to comment on them here but i haven't seen eyes available anywhere else though hardly a restored version in any way this print runs exactly <UNK> minutes so for once <UNK> stated running time of 90 minutes is not correct even with the <UNK> minute running time it's not unusual for a movie dubbed into english from another language to also have some of the running time <UNK> it seems to be a common budget conscience practice to sometimes save money by not bothering to dub some scenes at all if they are not considered to be important to the story would a longer version make in any less confusing who really knows unless you've seen it in it's native language by the way my attempts to watch this during the day don't work and i end up just turning it off there's something about watching this in the middle of the night that just fits this movie or maybe it's just from my earlier experiences who know
<START> series three <UNK> the third if you want something done properly kill <UNK> before you start hot on the heels of the second series the show returned with the current owner of the famous name down on his luck and in service as butler to the prince <UNK> a vain and stupid foil for <UNK> <UNK> played by hugh laurie <UNK> is still in <UNK> as the other piece of the comedic jigsaw the format is similar to the previous show after all now they had found the winning formula why change things we see <UNK> trying to get rich off of the back of the <UNK> <UNK> in many more ingenious ways trying to make <UNK> an m p or trying to <UNK> a suitable bride for the prince in many ways this is one of the most accurate of the series historically the prince <UNK> did take control of the throne during his fathers bout of madness and some of the characters <UNK> tell a lot about the times samuel johnson william pit and <UNK> all pass through the events and all manage to steal their scenes not an easy thing with such a stellar cast
<START> the only thing remarkable about this movie is that all the actors could bomb at the same time idiocy i want my money back and i got it free from the library <UNK> i would rather chew on tin fool and <UNK> my head with a cheese <UNK> then watch this again
<START> this isn't masterpiece theater you shouldn't go into it expecting that this is pure girl fun with the most fantastic cast of female leads like someone else here said this is the film baby mama was meant to be and the only downside i see to this film is that tina <UNK> was not in it besides that it stars the <UNK> and <UNK> girls on the planet the film is pure silliness on the surface but if you really watch you will know it has a lot of messages and deep meaning to any of us who wish they could go back and do it all over again in life knowing then what we know now pure fun and i recommend it to anyone looking for <UNK> minutes of great escape
<START> entertainment tonight has been going down hill for the last few years but as of last night <UNK> <UNK> 2006 they reached a new low br br in an effort to try to hype up their broadcast they decided to post actual photos of <UNK> <UNK> body in their <UNK> last night saying pictures from the case you have never seen before the two photos were graphic and very disturbing one was of the side of her face and head neck and you could clearly see the <UNK> that was used to <UNK> her around her neck and <UNK> on her face this was so <UNK> awful i could not believe it how has this got to do with anything remotely related to hollywood entertainment nothing they have dropped their level of dignity and values to a new low and it shows this used to be the premiere show to watch and it's just garbage now br br i will watch access hollywood from now on
<START> when teenagers go on a trip in a <UNK> van there are many clichés that you can guarantee will follow br br 1 the teenagers will be warned not to go where they are going by a crazy local dan van <UNK> handles that with ridiculous exposition about deadly <UNK> what who how and why are handled in one almost <UNK> burst 2 the van will break down 3 whilst looking for help the group will be split up and be picked off one by one by whatever monster they have been warned about 4 they will find a house inhabited by a madman he will capture them 5 the house will have a phone but it will not work it will be <UNK> <UNK> there will be <UNK> <UNK> light <UNK> and <UNK> 6 the madman will catch them as they try to escape in a vehicle that won't start here the high speed <UNK> was to be made on a <UNK> 7 the madman will be seemingly killed only to come back from the dead for a cheap weak scare and will then be killed properly 8 only a girl will be left alive from the group 9 there will be an unnecessary twist at the end br br add to these elements naked <UNK> who the characters seem to react to in startling different ways despite the fact that everyone that sees them is supposed to fall into lust with them immediately that seduce and kill the teens throats being ripped out and bodies being pulled in half and you have something resembling a twelve year old boys dream movie br br i think it is only fair to say that my opinion of the director and his previous work is as low as it is possible to be but i am happy to point out that there are a few elements that <UNK> on <UNK> and are a great improvement on his previous film <UNK> which is one of the worst films i have ever seen at times the cinematography is very good the music and editing are a cut above his previous films and some other low budget horror movies i was impressed to hear that it was achieved with a third of the money spent on the previous monstrosity however the worst things about this movie are not to be found in the body of the film it is ultimately a mildly <UNK> if pointless movie that has been done time and time again but amongst the dvd extras br br if you do rent this film i <UNK> you to listen to the director's commentary it is beyond belief there is more to say about this than the film itself one <UNK> part of the commentary is the director's claim that the film is cliché <UNK> because it was a <UNK> idea he says it is a deliberate attempt to use all of the clichés and openly he wonders if people will get it br br i'm afraid to say that if this is supposed to be a clever nod and a <UNK> to films of the past and the genre clichés within them then it is not <UNK> scripted enough acted in an appropriate tone nor directed with enough style to work if this film was made to order it leads me to ask one question what was the point this is s <UNK> that just slips right into the <UNK> of bad horror movies any attempt to do something clever or different haven't worked br br the next <UNK> of brilliance is a conversation about the <UNK> towards digital film <UNK> they rightly point out that digital is often <UNK> with <UNK> and ease of use however the best moment of the conversation comes when they <UNK> the fact that when michael mann makes a film in the format he is <UNK> as a <UNK> there is a simple distinction to be made here mann is a talented director who will use the format to fit his story and style roberts is a horror hack who uses it to produce bottom shelf genre pictures i think the differences are obvious and the comparison is not only arrogant but redundant br br the best moment is reserved for <UNK> comments about people who have taken the time to review his previous film those who didn't like it are <UNK> as <UNK> and he even goes as far as to single out specific people for having the nerve to voice their opinion in <UNK> that encourage them to do just that i must admit i was slightly disappointed that my review of his last film wasn't <UNK> out for <UNK> the <UNK> goes further as the group joke about norwegian reviewers complete with <UNK> accents to imply that people from <UNK> wouldn't know a good film simply because of where they are born as always these sorts of comments say more about those saying them than those they are <UNK> they simply make the director and his friends look ignorant br br the package in rounded out with a <UNK> <UNK> about how the <UNK> were cast <UNK> <UNK> blind in voice over 'i didn't want to make a film that was like <UNK> as we see audition tapes of topless and naked girls <UNK> around on the ground there is also a <UNK> self indulgent documentary about the making of <UNK> during which <UNK> says that a reviewer has claimed that forest is the best british film in years i don't know who he is trying to convince at one point in the commentary track <UNK> says <UNK> i can see people sitting at home saying this isn't amazing its sh t he isn't wrong
<START> <UNK> robert taylor as terry is <UNK> slap happy and can't see straight over <UNK> norma <UNK> as <UNK> she makes the sun shine even when it's <UNK> mr taylor explains but mr taylor gets a <UNK> in his throat whenever he gets near ms <UNK> finally at the palm beach casino <UNK> <UNK> taylor <UNK> i love you <UNK> <UNK> him off as she is engaged to george sanders as tony however to settle a gambling debt <UNK> hires taylor to pose as her cardboard lover to make mr sanders jealous br br this film's title invites the obvious and appropriate three word review her cardboard movie it is most notable as the last film appearance for <UNK> one of the biggest stars in the world from he who gets slapped <UNK> playing another <UNK> to the women 1939 to be fair this was likely the kind of <UNK> film mgm believed audiences wanted to see however the part is <UNK> br br <UNK> and powered taylor and <UNK> were better off in the escape 1940 if <UNK> had continued she might have become a better actress than leading lady apparently she was no longer interested and certainly didn't need the money taylor has a great scene <UNK> christina <UNK> when i am dead my <UNK> while threatening to jump from <UNK> balcony as directed by george <UNK> br br her cardboard lover 6 <UNK> george <UNK> norma <UNK> robert taylor george sanders
<START> i remember trying a few minutes of this film i'm very surprised i didn't watch all of it from director steve gordon his only film directed before dying of heart failure basically arthur bach golden globe winning and oscar nominated dudley moore is the happy drunk millionaire with everything he could want a mansion a butler <UNK> oscar and golden globe winning and <UNK> nominated sir john gielgud and plenty of booze he is to <UNK> <UNK> 000 000 if he marries the daughter of fellow millionaire burt johnson stephen elliott they woman he and the family have chosen susan jill <UNK> but instead arthur finds himself falling for queens waitress linda <UNK> golden globe nominated <UNK> minnelli which of course is threatening the inheritance and 3 4 of his family's fortune from father <UNK> thomas <UNK> and aunt martha <UNK> fitzgerald after the death of <UNK> arthur on the day of the wedding <UNK> the family's wishes but aunt martha still gives arthur the inheritance to live happily ever after with true love linda also starring ted ross as <UNK> barney martin as ralph <UNK> anne de <UNK> as gloria hooker maurice <UNK> as uncle peter bach <UNK> <UNK> as aunt pearl bach <UNK> <UNK> as mrs <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as harriet <UNK> maid john <UNK> as perry and peter evans as preston <UNK> party guest moore is wonderfully funny and a little cringing as the almost always drunk millionaire minnelli is likable as the woman he loves and gielgud of course makes a great oscar winning impression as moore's humorous humble sarcastic servant a terrific screwball comedy it won the oscar for best song for <UNK> theme best that you can do it also won the golden globe it was number <UNK> on 100 years 100 songs and it was nominated best writing screenplay written directly for the screen it was nominated the <UNK> anthony <UNK> award for film music for burt <UNK> and it won the golden globe for best motion picture comedy musical sir john gielgud was number 35 on the 50 greatest british actors and the film was number <UNK> on 100 years 100 laughs very good
<START> this is one of those movies which makes you think would hulk the real american hogan have done the same frankly i don't think so and he'd have been right i'm italian i cannot go proud of my country for many reasons but i wouldn't have <UNK> for another team the french for example simply because i'm in love with juliette <UNK> besides the protagonist doesn't fall in love desire with a british girl at the end of the movie but with a fellow <UNK> so why <UNK> against <UNK> as far as acting is concerned well all the players act very poorly and then you know i hated that dead <UNK> society atmosphere in fact that's another movie i hate
<START> this film seems to get bad <UNK> for some reason probably just by the mass <UNK> anyhow this is actually a very interesting movie the film is an under budget sci fi movie which actually works due to an interesting storyline and well done scenes br br this movie may not be for everyone though if there are any sci fi fans reading this i truly recommend this movie if you like good <UNK> science fiction the film has crazy ideas the setting includes nations going to war with gigantic machines which the entire countries <UNK> all it's money in the world has been <UNK> up into <UNK> anyone can challenge anyone else to a war or rather a <UNK> <UNK> the method of <UNK> is <UNK> than nuclear war since now everyone is wearing those breath masks <UNK> a movie that makes you think intelligent well written and good effects for the <UNK> budget br br i tend to like movies which have small budgets and actually work
<START> the first episode set the bar quite high i thought it starred william hurt as a hit man who is <UNK> to kill a <UNK> we are given very little information on his character or who is paying him to kill indeed the episode is notable for having no dialogue at all returning to his <UNK> <UNK> he is delivered a package containing toy soldiers this gives him a smile but he <UNK> it and goes about his business but he is in for a night of hell the soldiers are alive and are about to <UNK> war driving <UNK> shooting machine guns and <UNK> and even flying <UNK> the special effects are good for a tv show and it becomes quite tense as he <UNK> around the apartment using his wits to survive sometimes getting the upper hand and other times not i wont spoil the ending but suffice to say it was a clever little twist this gave me hope for the rest of the series but i was in for a disappointment the other episodes were all rubbish and i lost interest by the fourth one stephen king adaptations are always a mixed bag and these are no exception
<START> i used to love sabrina the teenage witch and have seen every single episode i remember when i used to sit at <UNK> every night and wait for it to come on <UNK> however when sabrina left high school the show began to go downhill the best series has to be when she was friends with valerie i'm not sure which one that is from there the next series friends with <UNK> was still really good but when she left high school it just didn't seem right all the main characters seemed to have left which meant that it didn't have as much of the old <UNK> however the first series where sabrina is in college is still relatively good and watchable however when her <UNK> leave and sabrina moves into their house it just isn't right she is no longer a teenager so therefore the name of the show isn't right and without <UNK> and <UNK> and josh the show just doesn't seem right especially when sabrina nearly marries someone that isn't harvey thank goodness he came through in the last five minutes of the last episode to take her away all in all i still love to watch the old episodes of sabrina the teenage witch but i think the writers took it too far and should have left it with sabrina leaving high school because after that the show definitely lost some of it's magic
<START> i just watched the last wave in my <UNK> fine arts library it's intriguing like all peter <UNK> stuff but it's not always as attention holding as i would have liked i found myself fascinated by the ideas being thrown at me because they are very well handled by the film's director <UNK> but at the same time i was not <UNK> enough by them aka i got a little bored in spots br br the plot <UNK> an aussie lawyer who becomes obsessed with certain dreams he has which link him to an <UNK> group he is defending br br it starts out with an intense weather sequence and has some very awesome mood effects throughout most notably the bizarre <UNK> sound design and strong direction but it just didn't entertain me like <UNK> later films do i might just need to watch it again though br br good film about obsession and mystery because in the end the mystery that exists between the whites and the <UNK> offers some very severe consequences br br god bless peter <UNK> though for him alone this film is worth watching very <UNK> director like an aussie response <UNK> i'd give it a 7 because it's got enough great ideas to overcome its boring moments
<START> the lowest score possible is one star that's a shame really i'm going to <UNK> imdb for a zero stars option to give this film even a single star is giving way too much am i the only one who noticed the <UNK> <UNK> over <UNK> head at the station and the acting or should i say the lack thereof apparently talent wasn't a factor when the casting director came to town my little sister's <UNK> school talent show provides greater range and depth of emotion and those fake irish accents were like nails on a <UNK> board the only thing that could have made this movie worse would have been oh wait no no it's already as bad as it can get
<START> the only previous gordon film i had watched was the kiddie adventure the magic sword <UNK> though i followed this soon after with empire of the ants 1977 he seems to be best remembered however for his sci fi work of the 1950s br br anyway i happened upon this one in a dvd rental shop hadn't i noticed orson welles' <UNK> figure on the <UNK> i probably wouldn't even have bothered with it â since i know the film under its original title <UNK> i'd seen a still from it on an old horror <UNK> of my father's the actor's presence in a film about <UNK> seemed like a great idea which couldn't possibly miss but the end result â particularly in this <UNK> edition â is a disaster i honestly felt sorry for welles who looks bored and rather than in his deep and commanding voice he <UNK> the inane demonic <UNK> almost in <UNK> br br the plot is basically yet another <UNK> of rosemary's baby 1968 a couple is invited to a remote community under false <UNK> and soon discover themselves to be surrounded by <UNK> the girl played by pamela franklin ostensibly has supernatural powers passed on from her mother who appears <UNK> throughout to warn her â though as delivered in an intense manner through <UNK> teeth the <UNK> speeches end up being largely incoherent and the <UNK> of immense hilarity every time she appears and is expected to revive welles' deceased young son from the dead for what it's worth franklin â a genre regular right down from her debut performance in the <UNK> <UNK> â isn't bad in her role which requires some nudity and experiences several semi eerie hallucinations during the course of the film <UNK> michael <UNK> however isn't up to the challenge of his john cassavetes like character some of the other girls look good as well â notably lee <UNK> whose <UNK> decision to help franklin in escaping from town eventually proves her <UNK> br br events come to a head in an incredibly muddled climax which sees the <UNK> ultimately turning on franklin and have her take the <UNK> boy's place in the coffin that's <UNK> for you while the added scenes do stick out the hilarious opening ceremony and other would be erotic <UNK> the overall quality of the film would have still been poor without them then again this particular version is further sunk by the tacked on electronic score â which is wholly inappropriate and cheesy in the extreme
<START> everything i remember about it was excellent great cast with sam <UNK> george <UNK> before he became more familiar to us audiences excellent scripts as only the english can do <UNK> sherlock holmes lord peter <UNK> albert <UNK> type mysteries but with a jules <UNK> twist sort of like <UNK> would have been had it been in england 80 years earlier right at the beginning of the scientific technological revolution of the 20th century br br i've often wondered if the creators of <UNK> saw these shows <UNK> first aired about 3 years later br br i still have 1 episode on a much <UNK> tape
<START> spoilers spoilers after two so so <UNK> <UNK> force and the <UNK> dirty harry seems to have <UNK> his <UNK> in sudden impact a gripping thriller that wisely plays to its strengths the charisma of clint eastwood who also directed and a story that spends just enough time on exposition and <UNK> its energy for the big scenes br br for once the case takes harry outside his native san francisco where he's again in trouble with his superiors for his shoot first ask questions later tactics to the hamlet of san <UNK> there warning potential spoiler a group of <UNK> is being <UNK> murdered one at a time by a woman whom they gang raped years earlier and whose sister has been in a state of <UNK> ever since the attack br br the killer is portrayed by sondra locke and she makes the character of jennifer spencer an interesting mix of compassion and cold <UNK> <UNK> cold eyes and <UNK> voice when either trying to comfort her <UNK> sister or <UNK> vengeance toward the <UNK> are very effective in painting a portrait of a woman <UNK> whose years of suffering and rage are now beginning to bear deadly fruit br br the <UNK> are a despicable lot especially the leader who has psycho <UNK> practically <UNK> on his <UNK> and a lesbian who seems almost one of the guys despite her <UNK> inability to participate the flashback scenes while not <UNK> explicit are nightmarish enough and clearly intended to make the audience cheer for jennifer as she kills her <UNK> br br some will dismiss sudden impact as trash a mindless manipulative revenge tale on a certain level this is true but it's well done trash what works to the movie's advantage is the strength of the sondra locke performance giving us a complex character whose wounds are more visible in her paintings than in her gestures or speech what we have here is an action movie with a point of view br br you can take or leave the idea that some <UNK> deserve to be <UNK> by any means necessary but as the mystery behind the <UNK> becomes clear to harry a realization that wisely is not spelled out with dialogue he is presented with a choice what to do about a killer whose motivations he can sympathize with but whose conduct he is bound by law to not tolerate this makes the story more interesting than the usual dirty harry fare br br the movie's other redeeming quality is eastwood's direction this is after all a dirty harry movie and eastwood knows the character better than anyone else the movie is directed with style and wit and edited to give the action scenes a big payoff some of the best harry moments in the entire series are here including harry's best known line go ahead make my day br br sudden impact is a movie that has the courage of its <UNK> in presenting a tale about a despicable crime and the brutal consequences that follow it is also a riveting detective story well made and well told and it is certainly never dull on those <UNK> it succeeds tremendously
<START> really i can't believe that i spent 5 on this movie i am a huge zombie fanatic and thought the movie couldn't be that bad it had zombies in it right was i wrong to be honest the movie had it's moments i thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it overall i think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a <UNK> slide on my bare <UNK> into a <UNK> of <UNK> then watch this movie again the movie could have been better if we could see some <UNK> but i had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that <UNK> beware unless you are into <UNK>
<START> director douglas sirk scores again with this the <UNK> of all dysfunctional family films this lush trashy saga is a masterpiece beautifully combining all of the elements of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> placing them all into one movie written on the wind very obviously influenced the 1980s tv series dallas and <UNK> as this is basically a feature length version of those later <UNK> <UNK> br br lauren bacall wonderfully and subtly plays lucy moore a new york city secretary who marries oil baron kyle hadley robert stack <UNK> to both of them mitch wayne rock hudson is also in love with the quiet but sexy secretary they all go back to <UNK> family's mansion in texas where we meet his white trash slut of a sister <UNK> dorothy malone in an oscar winning turn <UNK> the sparks begin to fly from the romances to the <UNK> this is a campy trip not only does mitch have to fight the feelings he has for his best friend's wife but <UNK> tries to sleep with everybody since she can't have her one true love who is mitch <UNK> it all off kyle learns he's <UNK> but somehow lucy ends up pregnant br br this is pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment how can you not love it this film <UNK> one of <UNK> most popular films and one of director <UNK> best works some of the dialogue is absolutely <UNK> and visual <UNK> are thrown in every which way the theme of wind throughout is great the cast is great although bacall is completely underused despite receiving top billing behind hudson <UNK> oscar loss reportedly <UNK> him he considered this his finest performance and apparently was none too pleased to lose out and he did turn out a fabulous performance as the <UNK> alcoholic what a stunning movie this film proves what i've been thinking for ages sirk is the master of classic melodrama where's his oscar br br
<START> this is a film i decided to go and see because i'm a huge fan of adult animation i quite often find that when a film doesn't <UNK> around a famous actor or actress but rather a story or style it allows the film to be viewed as a piece of art rather than a showcase of the actors ability to <UNK> his styles br br this film is certainly more about style than story while i found the story interesting a thriller that borrows story and atmosphere from films such as blade runner and many anime films it was a bit hard to follow at times and didn't feel like it all came together as well as it could have it definitely had a mixed sense of french animation and japanese anime coming together whether thats a good thing or not is up to the viewer visually this film is a treat for the eyes and in that sense a work of art br br if you like adult animation or would like to see a film that is different from most films out at the moment i would recommend it all i can say is that i enjoyed the experience of the film but did come away slightly disappointed because it could have been better
<START> this is meant to be a comedy but mainly bad taste and nothing remotely causing a smile in the film the movie is about a couple trying for a child and those people in real life who are in that situation will <UNK> at the depictions that are portrayed for instance scenes at a <UNK> clinic are not in the least funny and are quite frankly embarrassing the male lead who plays a construction worker and in his hard hat comes across as a poor excuse for a reject from village people the female lead is trying to look 20 years younger than she is both leads come across as unappealing unattractive and completely unconvincing there are various ridiculous and totally <UNK> gratuitous scenes in the film for example with a budget <UNK> which is devoid of any humor the only reason i give this 3 10 instead of 1 10 is one mark for shirley <UNK> who is a a class above anything else in the <UNK> and one mark for some half decent albeit old music
<START> those french and those germans sure have a long history of not liking each other it is interesting to note that <UNK> or <UNK> in translation takes place in 1931 only a few years later hitler would siege germany and begin his plans to take over the world france being a <UNK> of his ambitions but these are times of <UNK> compared to the future a group of <UNK> at the border try to cross over to france to get work they are <UNK> back and later at a nightclub by their french neighbors then a disaster happens in the mines of the french and a well crafted and written scene a <UNK> of german <UNK> decide to come to the rescue a simple story is it not <UNK> was a poet of silent cinema and i am not sure if this is his first sound movie or not but his poetry is there to be discovered he isn't <UNK> but brings a rugged realism to the ordeal <UNK> is even a flashback to a wwii event that <UNK> the point of this story supposedly based on a real event the movie does the events proudly with <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> that's what a movie needs to be
<START> the comeback starts off looking promising with a brutal death scene by a mask wearing killer the mask itself is pretty cool too and looks almost identical to the one used in the 1990's slasher film <UNK> from then on the film is mostly boring we get a few more deaths which again are good but there's not enough of them the reason the deaths are so good is because they are <UNK> and bloody the story behind the film is actually rather interesting and would have worked very well had it not been so boring for the most part br br i would avoid this unless you're a die hard collector there's not enough here to even make it an average slasher flick
<START> i loved this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end i found the director actor's style of directly addressing me the audience very engaging br br what i found most exciting and refreshing about this movie was its ignoring and thus challenging of gender and class stereotypes the <UNK> of the characters are portrayed as strengths and the absence of judgment and the characters' acceptance of themselves and each other <UNK> me to embrace them and allow myself to be drawn into their world without preaching and with intelligence and gentle and loving humor this movie has the power to open us to new possibilities and offers hope for a world in which people see and accept each other as unique and precious individuals i look forward to more offerings from this creative and talented director
<START> despite the <UNK> of george lucas this captivating and totally original fantasy in <UNK> a combination of animation through live action cut outs is about as far removed from the usual kiddie fare as anything made by ralph bakshi in his <UNK> brilliantly conceived characters such as the shape shifting dog ralph one of a duo of bumbling rejected heroes <UNK> <UNK> the hilariously foul mouthed villain and rod <UNK> the pompous <UNK> superhero breathe life into a uniquely clever concept <UNK> vs <UNK> or the eternal fight between dreams and nightmares in this context the <UNK> <UNK> songs on the soundtrack ought not to have worked but somehow they do it's a real pity therefore that i have had to watch this via a truly crappy looking boot <UNK> from a tv screening of the <UNK> version  there is also a <UNK> <UNK> that toned down the language for its vhs release  since the film is otherwise <UNK> on dvd interestingly both henry <UNK> and david <UNK> worked on this picture in <UNK> <UNK>
<START> a somewhat dull made for tv movie which premiered on the <UNK> cable station antonio and <UNK> run around chasing a killer computer virus and that's about it for trivia buffs this will be noted as <UNK> the same weekend that the real life <UNK> virus also made it's debut in e mail <UNK> across the world
<START> i'm on the opposite end of the previous comment br br first of all i don't think this was intended to be a straight sequel to the jerk i mean it's not titled the jerk 2 it's the jerk too which leads me to believe that while a lot of the character names are the same it actually revolves around a completely different person br br think about it virtually no connection to the previous movie other than character names a totally different story different cast and the fact that it's a partial musical br br i say give this movie some credit it does have plenty of laughs in it mark <UNK> at his prime
<START> there are four great movie depicting the vietnam war they are in no particular order apocalypse now born on the fourth of july platoon and finally <UNK> all but <UNK> focus on the actual war and the men in it <UNK> focuses on men in advanced training for the vietnam war the character of <UNK> is one of the most important depictions of a man questioning war and the absurdity of it this has been done in many war movies but rarely in boot camp also this is a very complex character whose method with dealing with his feeling and emotions are the driving force of this movie the character of <UNK> makes this movie so good it is a shame it did not get a major release it belongs on the shelf of any movie fan alongside the aforementioned movie titles
<START> i have watched this film twice now and think its quite good for the limited equipment used to create this film filmed in <UNK> dr <UNK> explains his theory about the <UNK> of south american pre <UNK> indians to the <UNK> islands by way raft fell of large <UNK> trees this documentary follows dr <UNK> and crew as they <UNK> <UNK> trees in <UNK> and <UNK> with them down river to the pacific for <UNK> in <UNK> they launch off on a 101 day sea adventure testing the strength of their primitive raft surviving only by means available to natives of that era see for yourself a real adventure
<START> finally an iranian film that is not made by <UNK> <UNK> or the <UNK> this is a non documentary an entertaining black comedy with <UNK> young girls subtly kicking the <UNK> in its ass it's all about football and its funny its really funny the director says the places are real the event is real and so are the characters and the extras this is why i <UNK> chose not to use professional actors as their presence would have introduced a notion of <UNK> the non actors will have you rooting for them <UNK> unless a your heart is made of stone b you are blind excellently scripted the film challenges <UNK> authority with an almost absurd <UNK> it has won the jury grand prize berlin 2006 dear reader it's near perfect where where can i get hold of it
<START> i saw the trailer for this film a few months prior to its release and man did it look scary especially how this film was based on a real life phenomenon i was incredibly interested and thought that this could finally be a decent horror thriller film after years if crap well you know how movie trailers make a film look better than it is maybe by showing all of the creepy parts or by <UNK> certain elements the <UNK> for the movie did both which lead to my ultimate disappointment br br by no means is this the most disturbing movie in years hell i doubt it was the most disturbing movie of that <UNK> release this movie takes the whole based off of fact thing too far br br this movie wasn't complete crap i must admit it held my interest and micheal keaton was believable as a man searching for answers by supernatural means other than that though this film is one big cliché after john's wife dies he learns about <UNK> which <UNK> the voices of the dead into everyday electronic <UNK> he all of the sudden receives messages from his wife my god it's not just his wife reaching him it's other dead people gee imagine that a movie about helping dead people come on give me a break the clichés don't stop there there's also the obligatory clock stopping at the same exact time every night trick and three evil spirits that menace our hero not only was the movie cliché it wasn't scary the film literally had two jump scenes and those two scenes are almost identical the ending is horrible as it leaves the door wide open for a sequel there's also an ending message with a message saying how only 1 out of x voices heard through <UNK> are threatening with a nice happy tune playing way to break the mood you guys <UNK> in the end if you want another forgettable horror film see white noise the only reasons i could possibly think anyone would watch this film for is that either that the person is a keaton fan or that they are interested in <UNK> sure the <UNK> aspects may be slightly interesting but i don't like my movie concepts to be shoved down my throat and blown up in my face this film tries to be scary original and disturbing but it's just the opposite you know you have a lame movie when the commercials use the ghosts to talk about there film i will see this film no more
<START> stewart moss stars as a scientist who is on a working trip with his wife and one gets the feeling that he was picked for this role for his ability to roll his eyes back in his head imagine the <UNK> for this can you no that's not quite it thank you next anyway he's bitten by a bat and then he's either changing into some kind of bat creature and killing people or he's not for no one else sees his strange <UNK> but he himself seems to think that he's changing because his wedding ring pops off when his hands turn into <UNK> etc to its credit the movie does kind of hold back on whether he's just nuts or whether he's actually <UNK> into something until almost the very end this has some good locations sort of a decent atmosphere at times but unfortunately none of that can make up for the somewhat lame story and the wonderfully bad acting kind of fun in a so bad it's good way but <UNK> more towards just plain bad 4 out of 10
<START> a brutally depressing script and some fine low key performances by peter <UNK> and pamela reed and some good location shooting in <UNK> power this fine tv movie about hard times in the <UNK> as the mills close and the union jobs disappear the blue collar workers are threatened by everyone management owners their wives and children <UNK> is completely believable in his role and pamela reed is as always wonderful see if you can recognize john goodman before he put on weight br br the heavy metal score was someone making a pun is at times <UNK> annoying but the cinematography by frank stanley is <UNK> particularly the mill scenes
<START> this movie was banned in england why tom <UNK> george romero <UNK> <UNK> lucio fulci and others had done far worse before and have continued to so since br br this movie has all the basic elements of a decent 70s or early 80's horror film good looking girls who can't act to save their lives by the way a terrible lightning storm with a <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> a crazy brother wandering around the family estate and actually a pretty damn good twist at the end but banned seriously when the english <UNK> banned this movie the italians probably laughed their collective <UNK> off at how backwards and <UNK> the brits really were br br there was maybe two minutes of total screen time devoted to the violence and gore which was greatly <UNK> there was nudity but no sex although <UNK> to sex were made obviously but absolutely nothing worthy of being banned br br i would like to see what could have been done if the filmmakers had a decent budget to work with as it stands the film is entertaining but the lack of picture and sound quality take away from the end result br br banned what a joke
<START> well if you are open minded enough to have liked <UNK> shop then you will like this canadian film br br if your mind is as closed minded as <UNK> knox then you will give it the current score that it has 2 5 br br this is a film for anybody prepared to watch films from outside of their own racial grounds it is engaging it is true to life on two or three occasions you lose the connections between the scenes but many times especially towards the end you find yourself having a tear or two in your eyes and this simply because it so often mirrors what life can be like br br i like it and recommend it to anyone open minded beyond the traditional american film
<START> i rented this film just to see <UNK> benson though after reading the box i thought it sounded like a good story however the first problem was that there really wasn't a story or actually there was a story but it made absolutely no sense the second problem was there was no set up for these characters yes i got that they all went to school together but within the first 3 minutes of the film you realized they had nothing else in common and didn't like each other so why did they keep getting together flaw number 3 the director though long pauses and tight camera shots <UNK> suspense especially with the typical suspense music dubbed in he was sadly mistaken it was painful to watch a terrific actress like <UNK> benson waste time trying to bring this back to life my only hope is the money she made here was put toward producing her own film
<START> there are two groups of people those who love every fellini movie they see and normal people while i will admit that i have really enjoyed some of his films i can also honestly say that i can't stand some of them my opinion by the way is not just some <UNK> jerk reaction i have seen most of <UNK> films and have also seen many films by the world's most famous directors with this in mind i feel that the most overrated and annoying directors can be both godard and fellini they both have delighted in the bizarre and often unwatchable and yet have received <UNK> of <UNK> from reviewers and the <UNK> while the average person would never sit through some of their films heck even a person who loves international cinema would generally be left out in the cold when seeing some of these films so since only a small <UNK> actually watches their films and they are already <UNK> to seeing the directors as geniuses it's not surprising that their films are so often praised it's like a cult if you don't believe me think about many of <UNK> films such as first name carmen or <UNK> or what about fellini <UNK> or juliet of the spirits these films abound with boredom weirdness and <UNK> now i am not saying a film can't be weird after all i love happiness of the <UNK> and shaolin soccer but it must be watchable br br now on to this movie somehow fellini has managed to make a story about a sexually <UNK> man completely boring and <UNK> this is no small task it took a lot of work to make this so unwatchable instead of cheap sexual thrills the sex acts are choreographed in a silly and annoying way while the character of <UNK> is buried under so much makeup and <UNK> that donald sutherland looks like a <UNK> i know some of this must have been <UNK> intention but many viewers will be left completely bored by this <UNK> performance especially since <UNK> lines are all poorly dubbed into italian and so he neither looks nor sounds like himself unfortunately when the movie is not wrapped up in these boring sexual <UNK> there really isn't anything else to watch br br an interesting note about the first sexual conquest shown in this dull movie is that the actress looks amazingly like a younger version of <UNK> wife <UNK> <UNK> considering that in addition to this that in previous decades fellini had <UNK> play characters such as a prostitute and a horribly abused woman it seems like he may have truly hated his wife and was having this acted out on screen i read a bit about them and their <UNK> relationship and it seems to bear this out as well this is about the only aspect of this turgid film that i found at all interesting don't say i didn't warn you
<START> i've always thought that cinderella ii was the worst movie i've ever seen followed by peter pan 2 and some other sequels like the lion king 2 and the <UNK> of <UNK> dame 2 all these movies are made with the same idea because the movie has no plot they try to make up for that by filling it with jokes i'm not saying the jokes are bad but they make up most of the movie the first time i saw the movie i would have given it a 1 10 but now i think about it most kids don't care how good the original movie was they just care that the movie is entertaining i still think the movie was a bad sequel but that doesn't mean it's horrible now i think it deserves a 3 10
<START> indian summer is a warm multi character film that would make a fine afternoon film with a bit of editing br br the film begins in the past with a group of children being shown a <UNK> which sets the tone perfectly before cutting into the present when a group of adults from the golden age of the camp are invited back again to spend a few weeks holiday by the head of the camp uncle lou the film then allows the viewer to spend time with these characters as they remember their times at the camp and form new memories in their latest stay br br the film succeeds in the great way it brings across its characters in this gorgeous setting and allows them room to develop without having to worry about plot developments watching these people <UNK> and their relationships with each other is what the film is all about and why it works so well it never goes to over the top and melodramatic always keeping its warmth charm and realism i've never seen a film where nostalgia is captured so well and found myself getting drawn in despite never having been to one of these camps as a child myself br br for a warm nostalgic character movie i sincerely recommend
<START> i must admit there are few books with <UNK> movies that i have actually read before seeing the cinematic adaptation <UNK> <UNK> four happens to be one of those rare cases the book was great it was <UNK> and interestingly <UNK> but the movie just plain sucked it is easily the worst film i have ever seen the only reason i didn't turn it off after the first 5 minutes was the fact that watching the movie was half of a two part assignment for a class it was dark and grotesque but did nothing in the way of achieving the proper atmosphere the acting was nothing above average and considering the fact that there wasn't much to act out this was severely disappointing the book for example didn't give me the impression that winston was unable to <UNK> out more than a single <UNK> at a time boring disturbing and visually unappealing the movie totally <UNK> the book wait a second isn't it british
<START> house of games is spell <UNK> it's so nice to occasionally see films that are perfect <UNK> there are few movies i've seen that can grip you so quickly from the opening scene this movie just gets you br br i'm trying really hard not to give to much away to those who may not yet have seen this but there will be a few spoilers so don't read anymore if you don't want to know br br i would say house of games is not just a superb film but is the best movie about con artists i have ever seen bar none from the moment the movie is over it begs to be <UNK> br br lindsay <UNK> as margaret ford is simply perfection from her mannerisms to the <UNK> of her voice she gets into the role immediately joe <UNK> was also wonderful the dialogue in this movie has an <UNK> almost <UNK> quality and these two people communicate as much in a look as they do with their voices i also loved the way the movie was filmed in that grainy surreal type of way it fit perfectly and helped make the film what it was br br there were a few movies i've seen and loved that this reminded me of including the <UNK> and the usual suspects but really house of games is completely different in it's way margaret and mike are two of the most absorbing characters i've seen on the big screen and not only do they have screen chemistry that is strong and <UNK> from the moment they meet but the <UNK> that starts from the moment they set eyes on each other is <UNK> you know <UNK> going to happen but you have no idea what and just when you think you've guessed what the something is you realize you haven't even <UNK> the surface br br house of games is one of those movies that may be <UNK> in to a certain genre of movie type but is essentially a movie about human nature the character study is not just about the mind of the con artist but the victim as well as the movie moves along and we get to know more and more about the main characters we learn about them not just through what they say but how they say it it is a great character study and is flawless in the way it <UNK> to it's conclusion br br in closing i'd rank this 10 of 10 call it although not my absolute favorite film pretty high on the list most definitely outstanding and would go so far as to say it does rank as one of the best character studies and contains some of the best twists i've ever seen as well although i love all types and genres of movies when it comes to movies of the human psyche it really doesn't get much better then this see this movie
<START> the film is severely awful and is <UNK> to rape victims on the surface it may be a daring film about rape but if you dig beneath the surface what lies is a not so positive message about rape <UNK> the rape victim is shown to be a helpless victim who cannot cope all because she is a woman she needs a man to help her when the society makes <UNK> about her and throws comments at her she does not stand up for herself it is all left to anil kapoor to do all the talking while <UNK> does all the crying br br the director <UNK> <UNK> went down the wrong path by portraying a rape victim as weak and <UNK> what would have been more effective is portraying a strong woman who rebels against her enemies in a courageous way the director is famous for being <UNK> his films are usually full of weak women but he tries to hide them in controversial roles he needs to learn that just because the role is controversial it does not mean that the character herself is strong br br the most <UNK> scene in the film is when <UNK> <UNK> herself after just being raped she does it to please her father who thinks that she is now dirty though it is commendable that shah shows the <UNK> against rape victims in such a stark light what he does not show us is whether <UNK> father was wrong for making his daughter do such a thing thus we are left with a confusing message about rape br br the comedy too is not needed in a strong subject film like this even more so the comedy is simply not funny ash is wooden in her role while anil kapoor does nothing but shout the music is mediocre except for the title track which is beautifully <UNK> the only bright point of this film <UNK> <UNK> role is disappointing and pointless overall what could have been a great movie to remember ends up being an awful <UNK> mash that will give some viewers severe <UNK>
<START> in the first 20 minutes every cliche possible was <UNK> out by the hack writer and director there was the <UNK> primary investigator with the tortured family life the politically tortured <UNK> board member played by i can kill any tv ted <UNK> the tortured father of a crash victim and the torturing sleazy <UNK> chasing lawyer br br hollywood still has no concept of the <UNK> of aircraft the crashed plane was a <UNK> and it was mostly sitting on the ground like a <UNK> who decided to take a <UNK> the first third of the <UNK> was intact the rear half of the plane was intact and the <UNK> field showed no wings or <UNK> most of the people should have walked away in light of how many people survived that plane that got <UNK> in <UNK> after it lost its <UNK> most of this tv plane wasn't even burned br br it reminded me of the scene in air force one where the <UNK> hits the water and then <UNK> along like it's made of inch thick steel br br the show was so bad it was impossible to watch even my wife who is more accepting than i was commenting on technical flaws what had me stunned was how this <UNK> could ever get made are the producers of these things so used to clichés that they can't even recognize them somebody read this script and said yes i want to spend a million bucks making this real i wish i was the guy's next <UNK> i have title to a wonderful bridge in new york that i'd sell cheap
<START> remember the good ol' animated batman show from the 90's the one that people praised the one that people of all ages could all appreciate the one that showed batman as a real detective instead of the hulk in a bat suit the one that had villains you could relate to the one that had villains with real motives br br well clearly warner bros doesn't hence this dreck br br honestly do these people know anything about batman have they even looked at a batman comic before do they know <UNK> meant to be a <UNK> putting together 2 clues does not make you a detective that makes you a slightly intelligent monkey br br this is the basic <UNK> for an episode br br penguin steals something <UNK> <UNK> batman finds dead <UNK> of where he is batman goes there and <UNK> into trouble commercial batman finds obvious stupid way out of it penguin escapes penguin does something obvious again batman follows they do kung fu by the way everyone and i mean everyone <UNK> kung fu for some reason batman <UNK> penguin he <UNK> knocked out goes to <UNK> note it's usually a different villain every episode br br well as you may have noticed from that <UNK> not a great detective joker left this piece of <UNK> candy on the ground maybe he's at the old amusement park yeah maybe he was there the last 6 times br br and i've already mentioned this but everyone knows kung fu even penguin what where they thinking probably because it's from the people who made that jackie chan animated series br br what's really <UNK> is that the show is just action no <UNK> none if batman needs think he'll use technology then do some kung fu br br but hey let's not forget the villains <UNK> what would batman be without his <UNK> gallery br br well first off i gotta say kudos for originality i don't think other batman media would have <UNK> joker and a dread locked monkey man <UNK> like an <UNK> and poison <UNK> as a minor which is kind of confusing when you think about isn't her sexuality meant to be her main strength br br what's even more crap however is that every character is now a 2 dimensional stereotypical crook br br e g br br killer croc wants to <UNK> <UNK> for no reason br br man bat is a power hungry mad scientist who is obsessed with bats for some unexplained reason br br penguin just wants to steal everything for no reason br br <UNK> a pattern here br br but the most insulting has got to be mr freeze br br do you remember the emmy award winning <UNK> of <UNK> episode from batman the animated series the one that gave mr freeze motives for his crimes the episode that was so good that it was used in the comics over his original back story mad scientist the one that made him a victim with a goal hell even batman robin acknowledged that using that as mr <UNK> origin in that p o s movie br br well this series says f <UNK> that and makes mr freeze a jewelry <UNK> before his accident with only wealth in his mind then gets frozen and gives him the power to make things cold he then continues to steal <UNK> for no reason while saying sh t lines like have an ice day br br maybe they did watch batman robin after all br br but hey look on the bright side this series makes you feel nothing for the villains so that means that you're a good person good for you
<START> a very funny movie it was good to see jim carrey back in top form it was definitely worth the price of admission morgan freeman and jennifer aniston both played outstanding supporting roles in this film i think they may have played the dog a bit too much however still a good film to see
<START> my 3rd year french classes always enjoyed this film very much in a multi cultural inner city high school the film provided many subjects for discussion in french in class but i know a lot of discussion went on in english after class the most obvious is the relationship between <UNK> and <UNK> compared to the one between <UNK> and france br br i always mentioned that i felt this film had one of the <UNK> scenes i had ever seen in a movie one year a 17 year old african american <UNK> yes when he figured out the scene the one where <UNK> is helping <UNK> <UNK> up her evening dress all the while both are <UNK> the reflection of the other in the mirror directors use the mirror technique when then want to focus on the inner conflict on the part of one or more character in a scene this is a perfect example of the technique and it is sexy br br most students had trouble understanding the end of the film one suggested that one theme of the movie was <UNK> and that no matter how much one loved africa or <UNK> one cannot become african like the driver tried to do one must be african
<START> the sarah silverman program is very similar to <UNK> own stand up it's so over the top with prejudice that you can't possibly take it to heart the fact is though that while most all people will get it it doesn't mean they will all appreciate it it's a very <UNK> and one dimensional show so if you don't like it after 10 minutes you may as well give up there if you do like it after 10 minutes stay tuned because every episode thus far has been as good as the last br br like all shows though it is not perfect personally i love the program but there are some huge faults with it racist songs are funny but get older a lot faster than silverman seems to realize a problem that i had with jesus is magic as well it seems as if silverman gave herself a <UNK> for songs per episode that doesn't need to exist not to mention that while the lyrics to the songs she writes are good the music well isn't br br another thing to keep in mind is that while this show will for some reason appeal to fans of monty python <UNK> citizens <UNK> etc it is nothing like those shows i can watch monty python all day but as much as i like this show i can't watch more than the half hour limit at a time it gets flat very fast the repeat value for this show is low too the second time around an episode is fairly funny and by the third time in my opinion it's boring br br still that first time around is very very funny give it a shot
<START> make the world go away get it off my shoulder say the things you used to say and make the world go away br br well dave david <UNK> and andrew andrew miller were in a <UNK> one for <UNK> and the other for kissing a child neither was guilty but faced with charges and their house about to be torn down they ended up in well nothing the whole world except for their house went away br br it is kind of weird but funny too just what would you do if you were all alone in the world the two friends just enjoy each other's company and do what they want but that gets old fast it seems br br then they start to improve their live by hating away memories the sound effects during this were great br br things really got weird at the end this film was the product of a great imagination and written and directed by vincenzo natali with help from the two stars it just has to be seen
<START> when the remake of when a stranger calls was out obviously i was interested in watching the original then when i read about the original which i recall had my sisters totally freaked out back in the day i saw that the real money is on black christmas which apparently beat everyone to the the <UNK> is in the house punch so i netflix that and it sits at the top of my list for months due to its very long wait all this time i am getting more and more eager to see it then one day out of the blue it finally arrives and it's a total <UNK> br br sure maybe i had <UNK> expectations but i don't think it would have gained more had i seen it fresh the thing is it's christmas in some canadian college town and there's this <UNK> having a party we see some killer <UNK> shots as he climbs this <UNK> and <UNK> into the attic so we know he's in the house then we're introduced to our <UNK> olivia <UNK> as the <UNK> whiny canadian <UNK> jess <UNK> <UNK> as the annoying overtly aggressive alcoholic <UNK> she's so annoying even her mother <UNK> invites her for her christmas <UNK> there's also this irritating <UNK> ian clone phil and this alcoholic <UNK> mother mrs mac seen taking <UNK> from the various <UNK> of booze she has <UNK> all over the house we also meet <UNK> highly strung boyfriend peter played by <UNK> <UNK> of 2001 and bunny lake is missing fame though halfway through the film i was still asking myself which one's <UNK> <UNK> br br so it seems that the house has been receiving obscene phone calls but this was before email so they couldn't ask him to send a photo <UNK> well you know how they say those plastic dry cleaning <UNK> are not a toy one of the sisters finds that out the hard way don't worry if you don't catch the first 14 shots of the plastic <UNK> corpse face as it <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> be 28 more interspersed throughout the film obviously there to make you say oh my god there's a corpse in the attic though after the first hour that changes to how come the dumb police haven't found the rather <UNK> placed plastic <UNK> corpse in the attic especially as it is made <UNK> clear that it is clearly visible from outside the house really any time before <UNK> came on the air must have been such a golden age of crime the cops are so dumb fortunately some of them look like john <UNK> br br anyway after a lot more darn boring human drama the house mother fears that her precious kitty has <UNK> a <UNK> ladder and has pushed open a heavy looking trap door that rests <UNK> it those <UNK> cats for she sticks her head in there and ends up with a hook <UNK> in her neck for the trouble now we have two corpses up in the <UNK> hey why don't we have 75 more shots trying to chill us by the fact that there are now two corpses in the attic br br so by now the police have begun to take the situation seriously and tap the <UNK> phone and station a cop outside they inform jess and her pal <UNK> ian that if the obscene <UNK> calls back they need to keep him on the phone jessica who has grown even more whiny <UNK> and annoying keeps asking the <UNK> who is this what do you want who are you after like the first <UNK> calls when it is clear that he is not going to answer her isn't that like a sign a <UNK> <UNK> the inability to learn from <UNK> attempts at something and what's he going to do suddenly say oh yeah hi it's bob from the <UNK> dumb jess br br spoilers anyway soon <UNK> ian and lois lane <UNK> are <UNK> in bed with <UNK> <UNK> on their faces this film's idea of gore and idiot jess realizes that not a single door or window in the house is locked hello are you being stalked or what then the cops realize that the killer is in the house and call jess and tell her don't ask questions just do as i <UNK> walk to the front door and get out so what does moron jess do starts screaming phil <UNK> phil <UNK> hey great idea sister now why don't you go right upstairs where you know a psychotic killer is lurking of course she does and sees her former friends all <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> this viewer to scream at the screen have a clue now br br now obviously one needs to be understanding and realize that this movie was made before the classic slasher movie <UNK> were <UNK> in place and that it doesn't move to the same pace we're used to and seeing a plastic covered corpse in the attic like <UNK> times probably was scary back in the day and people weren't used to being stalked by <UNK> so they wouldn't think to you know lock the doors or windows and they might be tempted to wander upstairs when they have just been told that a <UNK> killer is up there you see people were stupid back in the 70s we have to understand that one of the big shocks is that we don't even see our <UNK> final girl kill the psycho but believe me that fact is more interesting being read in this review than sitting through the movie for spoilers end br br hey check out cinema de <UNK> my website on bad and cheesy movies with a few good movies thrown

<START> i would never have thought that it would be possible to make such an impressive movie without any music but it is just the pictures watch out for that picture anne talking with that little boy benny <UNK> the soul really strong might make you feel different
<START> if this is the first of the nemesis films that you have seen then i strongly urge you to proceed no further the sequels to <UNK> prove to be no better hard to believe considering this entry is bottom of the barrel this movie tries but it's just not worth your time folks take a <UNK> instead
<START> this was a fabulous adaptation of jane eyre the only problem i had with it was that i didn't like zelah clarke i thought she was too old and made jane seem much to <UNK> in the book jane seemed like a much stronger character i was really annoyed by this portrayal of her the part where it's the morning after rochester asks her to marry him and she runs up to him and <UNK> him always makes me laugh i think they made a bad choice in casting her but dalton was absolutely wonderful as rochester he makes this version of jane eyre worth seeing another thing that made this version not quite 100 was the quality of film i know it was made in the eighties for tv if it had been a feature film and better quality it would have been perfect my main complaint however is that zelah clarke was definitely too old
<START> wow not only is this film a new lesson in real bad taste but also a lesson in real bad film making don't get me wrong i appreciated the concept of <UNK> <UNK> extreme <UNK> ' but at the same time one must realize when a movie is terrible in case you missed out on the storyline the plot of <UNK> <UNK> is about a government plane carrying toxic <UNK> that so happens to crash into the wilderness causing the <UNK> to <UNK> turning locals into hideous looking zombies the next thing you know zombies are all over the city eating people alive while a goofy looking doctor and a government agent are trying to figure out the disease that's making these people eat one another hence the name extreme <UNK> from then on all we see is zombies having a field day on every local in sight nothing but extreme and sickening <UNK> and <UNK> accompanied by endless <UNK> of guts and gore since this is a german film the film had to be dubbed into english and when you're not laughing at the feeding <UNK> of the zombies the voice overs are quite hilarious and entertaining as well as user <UNK> mentioned spoiler spoiler spoiler there is a scene in the film that crosses the line between what's acceptable and not acceptable hence the scene in which a woman who is carrying her <UNK> baby is being <UNK> around in her wheelchair by some dude and a <UNK> of zombies come out of nowhere and attack them one zombie grabs the baby and rips it into pieces eating its organs as you hear the baby crying wow that is a new lesson in <UNK> bad taste atrocious i tell you atrocious

<START> a talking parrot isn't a hugely imaginative idea for a new film but paulie turns a simple idea into a brilliant heartwarming film that will delight the whole family it manages to bridge the gap between sentimental trash and cruel <UNK> during marie and <UNK> <UNK> and all the events in the film lead to a hugely satisfying emotional conclusion the animal training is well done everyone will be affected when paulie <UNK> his wings and flies for the first time paulie is a great character and should have received way more success though this film wasn't a highlight of 1998 unlike saving private ryan this hour and a half will surely be an enjoyable one and one that you will remember <UNK> story is a moving sad happy and interesting one from the moment he is first seen to the moment he is united with his original owner you will enjoy following him and watching him learning about friendship and the grim realities of life along the way not one to be missed if you have any kind of heart or emotion 9 10
<START> this was the worst christmas movie i ever saw i took my two small children to see this it was the darkest most dismal plot family has no money mom loses her job father gets killed in the bank bank <UNK> steals family car with both kids in the back and after high speed chase drives off the bridge and <UNK> them in the river mom is left all alone no wonder her christmas <UNK> is gone christmas angels do not rescue children that have drowned and santa does not bring back dead fathers i thought this was the worst message to send children better to tell them that there is no santa than show them a movie like this
<START> wow how can i even discuss this movie without tears coming to my eyes it was surely the highlight of my year <UNK> my life as if the <UNK> graphics weren't amazing enough the award winning <UNK> continued to use the exact same shot throughout the entire movie even when the background didn't actually match up with the setting of the scene wow what genius and while the movie is full of plot holes for instance a few clips of a t rex type animal where a <UNK> should be and one key moment where <UNK> finds a torture chamber screams <UNK> a girl and runs out i will never forget the brilliance that is <UNK> planet thank you sci fi for another classic
<START> this movie is banned in just about every foreign country i can think of the japanese people who star in this must have been really desperate for a job or we're just friends here's the scoop br br three thugs torture the hell out of a helpless woman they use all kinds of things to eventually kill her they burn her kick her spin here around in a chair over 200 times they use sound torture by forcing her to listen to a static sound for over 20 hours it don't sound that bad at all but it can make you go nuts they throw guts probably from an animal at her while <UNK> knocked out and she freaks when she wakes up and who can forget the <UNK> finale the greatest <UNK> torture i have ever seen br br if you have not heard of these films and watch one without knowing that it is a <UNK> snuff film you will think it is just ask charlie sheen this is guaranteed to freak people out and make some sick like i said pure underground check it out if you are a fan of underground horror or foreign gore if your not i highly recommend you read up on the series before watching from the gore shock and creativity aspect it gets a 10 but from the storyline and all that stuff it is a 1 an underground classic br br my final rating is a 8 10 br br
<START> really the use of stock nature documentary of <UNK> bats employed by the bat people is some of the most effective ever there are shots of <UNK> bats hanging from the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> bats flying out of <UNK> or <UNK> about near the mouths of <UNK> that alone is enough to be unsettling imagine all of them <UNK> after you and they do indeed <UNK> in what should have been a show <UNK> sequence that happened at about the forty minute mark a downright <UNK> hilarious sequence where a <UNK> <UNK> of bats seem to attack a police car <UNK> across the <UNK> like bloody broken eggs the problem is that this sequence happens about fifty minutes too late to save the film most of which consists of one or more people running around screaming waving their arms about at <UNK> <UNK> about some poor <UNK> who managed to get bitten by a bat during his vacation br br the fear is that he is coming down with <UNK> which does indeed suck so their vacation is ruined as the plot synopsis on the top of the bat people's reference page does indeed point out so here is an effective summary of the movie a young couple goes on a romantic <UNK> which is ruined when the guy is bitten by a bat they <UNK> try to stick it out but he starts raving trying to convince those around him that it's a bit more involved than <UNK> that he can't control himself and they everyone should keep away br br now when some one is <UNK> at the mouth covered with sweat eyes <UNK> about like one of the cheaper muppets and screaming at you to get away from me you get away from him you don't try to give him drugs you don't try to tell him you love him you give the guy his space go home and try that <UNK> <UNK> next year br br but no the people in this movie all behave like morons insist on pushing the guy to his brink and he <UNK> out <UNK> into a part man part bat type creature and kills a bunch of non essential secondary characters nothing wrong with that but the movie forgets that it's a low budget creature feature and tries to be some sort of psychological study instead of a monster movie we get lots of people running around trying to get this guy to take a chill <UNK> and eventually he runs off into the hills looking very much more human than he should have people insist on trying to chase him down and pay the expected price br br the main thing wrong with the movie is that this should have happened in the first fifteen or twenty minutes thirty tops and the movie should have been about the guy after he had turned into a bat person rather than about the journey there it takes a good <UNK> minutes to really pick up steam on that front with some interesting character sketches along the way involving the always entertaining michael <UNK> as a small town cop who's lost his moral edge and the late paul <UNK> as a <UNK> friend who doesn't quite get the message br br the movie is dreadfully boring about fifteen minutes too long and missed the opportunity to be a nice forgettable little creature feature about a mutant run amok like the italian horror favorite <UNK> which i watched today and was sadly inspired to try this one after seeing me and my bright ideas though the scene with the cop car was a <UNK> too bad we couldn't have had another twenty minutes of that br br 3 10
<START> i really can't understand how could someone give this disgusting film more than 1 star how can you like such a retarded film where all the animal abuse scenes are real i don't even want to imagine the excruciating pain those innocent and <UNK> living beings felt in those horrific moments jesus what kind of <UNK> would torture them like that for no reason or just for money i tell you that director is either mentally retarded or he's just a monster with a <UNK> of stone or both he truly deserves to get his hands cut off and burn alive br br it contains various horribly <UNK> scenes that may cause shock especially to sensitive persons and children a real frog is skinned alive fish are <UNK> <UNK> and thrown back into the water a dog is beaten birds are thrown into the water br br this movie is more than awful it has to be the worst and most retarded film ever made along with another one called <UNK> <UNK> or something like that i'll never watch or buy any film directed by this heartless monster no one should waste their time watching it especially when there are a lot of truly great movies out there in which all the animal abuse scenes are staged br br fortunately only a few people liked this which is natural since it's the worst film ever so it wasn't successful i hope this will make the retarded director realize that such <UNK> <UNK> acts of extreme cruelty and violence to real animals will never be praised and that he will stage all the animal abuse scenes in his following films i truly believe that everyone receives but what they give there will be a day when all the retarded and cruel <UNK> will feel the same pain they once inflicted to others br br this however is probably my only <UNK> review i usually don't comment on a movie if i dislike it but this time i just couldn't shut up i had to speak the truth because animal abuse must stop
<START> this movie is awesome on so many levels and none of them are the level that it was intended to be awesome on br br just remember this when you're watching shaun of the dead and other recent zombie movies be they good or bad this is the formula that they are using this is what makes zombie movies so great br br and what makes it better than great is the story behind the movie a simple web search will provide you with everything you need to know br br all in all it doesn't <UNK> there's never a point where you think to yourself c'mon get on with it it moves quick and <UNK> nicely this is the <UNK> little italian number of zombie flicks br br so awful it's wonderful if your tongue spends an ample amount of time in your cheek rent it buy it love it br br as a great trivia note if you're watching it on dvd you'll notice that there is sound effects during the menu screen underneath the musical score well that's because that music was lifted straight from the trailer which is probably the only working print of that music that still exists which is long enough to loop
<START> shakespeare said that we are actors put into a great stage but when this stage is israel the work that we interpret <UNK> for ten and all the actions we do are full of a hard style dan <UNK> manages to do a spectacular portrait of a part of life in tel <UNK> but besides <UNK> manages to <UNK> into the heart of the israeli people and this people far from being simple prominent figures they speak to us from the heart <UNK> film allows israel escape from dark informative <UNK> in which they live and this wonderful country <UNK> to the light as a splendid bird which is born of his <UNK> it is very great for me because the reality of state of israel which the europeans only know for the informative <UNK> or the <UNK> appears as a close and <UNK> human reality the reality of million people who looking for his place exploring the whole state the whole culture with the only aim to feel part of it <UNK> <UNK> an absolutely wonderful documentary and he demonstrates that when a man films with passion the deepest feelings are projected with force and these feelings cross our hearts thank you dan for open our eyes and give us one of the most beautiful <UNK> of the most wonderful countries of the world
<START> this motion picture comes straight out of the dark <UNK> of full moon entertainment this production company gained fame and fortune during the first half of the 90's by producing terribly bad and cheesy horror movies the most famous disasters in their <UNK> are <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> none of these are recommended and neither is doctor <UNK> actually <UNK> director charles band did come to the right company for his film doctor <UNK> is amazingly dumb and cheesy and almost completely <UNK> i only saw it because it stars jeffrey combs i learned that it can have several <UNK> if you're a fan of him for every good movie it seems like he has made 5 inferior ones anyways the story is about the battle between 2 ancient <UNK> one good one who's here since 150 years to protect the humans jeffrey as dr <UNK> and one wicked one called <UNK> he wants to destroy every form of human life for some reason i already forgot combs gets his <UNK> from mentor that guy only exists of a pair of eyes in space very very cheesy that is every once and a while a <UNK> <UNK> is shown on the screen but that's about the only form of special effects this movie has got the whole thing is just a piece of whining and <UNK> and when the two <UNK> finally face each other it's over before you know it i would have expected for the wicked wizard to at least fight back a little but <UNK> in some scenes you really can <UNK> some originality and creativity like for example <UNK> lecture about the influence of the moon on criminals and if you really pay attention you might even find some very small but nice aspects like the <UNK> which is called edgar allen but overall it's a terrible waste of time and energy i'm a big fan of jeffrey and maybe he is a superhero in my eyes but he sure doesn't have to put on a stupid <UNK> for that
<START> i didn't have many expectation going into the film but i thought it was fantastic pierce brosnan is outstanding in a very different role he has dumped the slick <UNK> suits for a ridiculous look and pays off showing that he is an excellent actor pierce and greg kinnear play off each other great and make for one of the better buddy <UNK> in a long time the humor is dark the performances by brosnan kinnear and hope davis are great mix that with a touching element to the story about friendship and you have a great film this is probably one of the better buddy comedies in a long time this is a film that definitely shows that we can expect great things in the post bond era of <UNK> career
<START> a <UNK> plot uninteresting characters and sub par to say the least dialogue <UNK> this tv production that could hardly have been interesting even with a billion dollar production budget br br the characters aren't believable in their motives actions or their <UNK> <UNK> the plot reads like a bad <UNK> and dragons <UNK> hack but with <UNK> <UNK> and force fields there are severe continuity issues and the degree of pointless interaction between the characters has this author at least <UNK> br br avoid it like the plague watch any episode of dark angel and you will have better acting dialogue and plot <UNK>
<START> totally ridiculous if you know anything about poker you will find it absolutely appalling but also entertaining because it is so clueless the nerd who made this movie is obviously very religious and knows slightly about the game of poker but i doubt he's ever played above 3 6 i think he also knows nothing of golf where to start i've seen better productions in the intro to film class i took <UNK> year of film school the actors to watch in this movie are queen <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the loser who can never win at poker everyone else is as wooden as they come like bad porn actors br br spoiler the man the movie starts with in the opening sequence is the only reason the film got made he is a <UNK> who doesn't play poker and never has a line of dialogue but the actor is the man who obviously paid for the movie i can't think of a more useless waste of money than this man <UNK> out for this pointless production it's fitting that he had such a useless role br br there's very little poker in this movie most of the time is spent on useless side characters whose plots aren't resolved in the slightest queen <UNK> does have a show stealing scene where she throws her loser boyfriend through a window and tries to shoot his brains out also the <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> store also give brilliant performances when they debate whether to beat up or kill an older lady who <UNK> them their subtle performances are easily among the film's highlights it makes you wonder why they bothered getting all these white people to play the leads br br in conclusion complete nonsense plan 9 from outer space has slightly more <UNK> if you play poker though you might want to have a laugh also if you're christian you might enjoy some of the heavy handed religious conversation that pepper the movie like pointless pepper i hate movies made by religious people especially ones who think they know something about things they know nothing about it's sad that jennifer <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> got involved in this travesty as i can't help but think less of them they must be <UNK> of johnny chan for getting in <UNK>
<START> i thought this movie was really really great because in india cinemas nowadays all you see is skin music and bad acting in this movie you can see some tradition <UNK> and at least some decency although some parts were a little dramatic guess what that is what indian cinema is all about after watching this movie at least you don't get a headache from all the loud overrated music or any violence its just the truth it teaches about love and of course caring for the person you love throughout life i think it was an amazing movie kids can watch it without a doubt and adults will enjoy the simplicity that used to be <UNK> sure <UNK> until all these rap hits <UNK> and skin showing became a part of it
<START> this movie is funny and painful at the same time the <UNK> almost gave me a <UNK> despite what they imply <UNK> is not some innovative technical <UNK> it was developed as the result of an accident and they used it because it disguised the fact that their monsters were so stupid looking i also don't think it's a coincidence that the writer is sid pink br br this movie is good for a laugh if you are really looking for a movie made in 9 days on 200 000 dollars it is entertaining at least i can say that about it the bat rat spider is the highlight
<START> dear god i kept waiting for this movie to get started then i waited for it to redeem itself and when it did neither i just sat there <UNK> that 1 it could possibly be this bad and 2 that i had just wasted a couple of hours on just sheer stupidity i had faith that drew couldn't possibly have made this bad of a movie and boy did i ever lose my faith don't bother with this one drew tried but the movie was poorly written poorly acted and just poorly conceived i can't believe a script this bad ever got <UNK> it had a million chances to actually do something with the idea the word concept is too big for this movie to even qualify for and it still didn't go <UNK> its just pitiful where the other reviewer got the idea that it wasn't the worst <UNK> me because believe me if it got any worse i'd have <UNK> my <UNK> before finishing it
<START> made in 1931 this foreign film should be seen and enjoyed more often br br we open on a quiet little french village <UNK> the <UNK> of the sleeping citizens then we hear something that sounds like a party upon investigating the <UNK> two <UNK> men are told the story of two men supposedly friends who picked two numbers for the <UNK> br br our star of the picture has his number and his friend his when he asks his friend would he share half of the <UNK> should his ticket be the winning number his friend promptly says no in fact h e double hockey sticks no is the way he acts about it br br so when our man discovers he has the winning ticket and that it has been lost through no fault of his own he is frantic everyone is out for themselves looking for this ticket in something like a <UNK> to the great race even though this is all a flashback i was in <UNK> the whole time and got so upset over every little thing in this all for me show me the money cash in the bank film watch le million today
<START> felix <UNK> jack lemmon has just been dumped by his wife because he is one of the most annoying neurotic people in the world suicide is his way out but he just can't seem to get it to work so he heads over to his friends house oscar madison <UNK> matthau is also recently divorced and living it up in bachelor heaven smoking gambling hitting on chicks eating out and never cleaning is paradise to him well with the suicide attempts oscar decides to let felix move in at first it is a match made in heaven felix <UNK> and <UNK> and helps oscar pay his <UNK> on time but soon oscar is <UNK> for women and felix who in today's world would probably be gay isn't ready to move on they invite a couple of british birds over and they find felix so tender that soon they and felix are <UNK> and <UNK> about his family life leaving oscar denied this is it he explodes and throws him out but felix isn't as helpless as it seems and soon he has the upper hand my favorite quote you leave me little notes on my <UNK> told you <UNK> times i can't stand little notes on my <UNK> we're all out of <UNK> f u took me three hours to figure out f u was felix <UNK> based on a neil simon play who also wrote the screenplay this has a certain theatre feel to it set and the <UNK> and looks feel quite play like for better or worse lemmon and <UNK> have excellent comedic chemistry and have appeared in the <UNK> old men movies and out to sea <UNK> the same <UNK> <UNK> roles but with different names to avoid <UNK> issues i'm sure br br this movie is like <UNK> <UNK> in chocolate the chocolate is smooth sweet and rich the <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> and bright red unless you get those nasty <UNK> ones they are almost polar <UNK> but together the <UNK> highlight each other and make a wonderful <UNK> 7 10 br br http <UNK> <UNK> com <UNK>
<START> all dogs go to heaven is on a par with <UNK> down for scary <UNK> films both were dark and pretty sinister but at the same time the most <UNK> experience a child can have this was one of my favourite films as a kid i was in love with charlie and at the tender age of about five or six i'll admit i had a crush on a cartoon dog all dogs tells the dark story of lovable <UNK> charlie and his partner in crime itchy the story starts with charlie escaping from death row and <UNK> off to the nearest club to do some gambling of course as a child i didn't understand the concept of this film i loved the songs and the animation but as i've got older i do begin to wonder why i wasn't disturbed by this film as a <UNK> it deals with pretty adult themes gambling murder hell and prison but in a world of <UNK> <UNK> disney films it's something every child should watch once br br yes there's some sort of crazy <UNK> crocodile scene and the hell scenes scare me more now that when i was little but it delivers such a poignant message that should not be ignored by parents
<START> this movie was astonishing it is beyond atrocious i often get together with a group of friends and go to the movie store to find awful movies to watch for their comedic value my friend suggested this one but as we watched it people began to leave i really wanted to finish it just so that i could say that i had but i was unable to it's that bad horrible running gags lame acting the main characters are an annoying dinosaur <UNK> and whoopi goldberg i would rather watch <UNK> the <UNK> twelve times in a row than see a <UNK> of this movie again i think they try to deal with some dinosaur <UNK> issues but the part of the movie that really stands out is the dinosaur constantly knocking things over with his tail and then <UNK> about it it hurts watch it if you're an aspiring <UNK> otherwise leave this one alone
<START> this flick reminded me of those lame erotic thrillers i used to stay up late and watch on <UNK> when i was 13 i'd label this flick <UNK> core since there is just no <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> there is however a ton of nudity the opening scene is in a strip club we see kane <UNK> <UNK> or at least a stunt butt and then an inexplicable 10 minute lesbian dance scene in the middle of the film and a nude female werewolf who looks like they <UNK> on of the <UNK> for a costume 13 year old boys <UNK> br br other than that the werewolf transformation scenes have the worst cgi i've seen in years the shots look like <UNK> from the video game resident evil in terms of quality the wolf is too bad to be explained and despite the poor quality of the suit is shown way way too many times br br the plot and acting make no sense there is some oddball back story about werewolves and hybrid werewolves the <UNK> is the latter but from what i can tell <UNK> do the same thing all werewolves do look human change to a wolf an kill people the <UNK> is trying to find a mate but oddly can't find the mate but can <UNK> out anyone she touches once more this skills proves less than useful since the <UNK> winds up killing several folks his target never touched met or even saw as best i can tell the mate doesn't know she's a werewolf and she's fighting the transformation or something br br you'd think it'd be hard to mess up a simple monster movie s bad as this but well they did want quality low end werewolf <UNK> go rent dog soldiers want a ton of t a this is your flick
<START> frankie <UNK> lee <UNK> is a high <UNK> mobster who turns himself in to the police or illegal gambling for reasons that seem unclear to me tony tony lo <UNK> is a low level thug who <UNK> a pool hall and spends his free time <UNK> frankie by being in the right place at the right time tony gets arrested with frankie and is sent to jail where they form a bond that may not quite be friendship but it will do for now br br this film came to me under the title of frank and tony which is disappointing because i see an alternate name is mean frank and crazy tony which would have helped sell the film more effectively i presume that's an homage to dirty mary crazy larry but what do i know i watched it shortly after another italian crime film violent professionals and i must say the two <UNK> each other very well br br italians have always <UNK> behind americans in their budgets and production values which is a real shame with this film it is considered a <UNK> film which unfairly <UNK> it to a b movie or worse with a <UNK> sound and picture this could have been a hollywood hit i suspect i found the story very interesting the characters and actors better than average and unlike violent professionals the plot is fairly clear not too many secondary characters br br if you like mafia movies or crime films you should give this one a try a film about the mob that's actually from italy how much more authentic do you want is as much as you can ask sure it's not the godfather but it's not supposed to be this isn't a drama it's a light comedy heavy action buddy film like die hard with a vengeance from the point of view of the bad guys well okay not really br br if nothing else this film made me want to check out other films from the director and the principle cast films besides escape from new york where <UNK> plays <UNK> and the usual cult movies what's more fun than discovering a lost classic
<START> i can tell you just how bad this movie is i was in the movie and i haven't seen it yet but i cringe at the thought of anyone actually paying to see me drunk especially considering what we did that year the thing is that they probably over edited it especially the scene where my roommate was <UNK> coke of the tits of a mexican prostitute they probably should have followed him around we made a few come and go appearances but aside from that i can't really remember anything i was the <UNK> in a few scenes from what i'm told what i can tell you is that everyone avoided the camera crew since who wants to be remembered as the guy who threw up or the girl who showed her tits to the world or the girl that loser lost his virginity to overall the trip itself was crazy but people act different once the camera is on them
<START> i have no idea how anyone managed to stay awake during this show the acting was ham <UNK> and amateur the story was old news and plot development or lack thereof <UNK> had my <UNK> <UNK> less than halfway through each episode that's about all there is to say of it because it genuinely lacked substance of any kind br br how can you people like crap like this it's freaking stupid it's an insult to your intelligence i don't even know how to further explain it it's as if some of you will stare <UNK> at junk like this solely because you like the way some of the actors look or because for whatever crazy reason you haven't seen the same <UNK> in dozens of shows a million times before br br i just forget it this show sucked and thankfully it's gone forever i wish they'd get to work on <UNK> the o c once and for all
<START> i love the movie it was a very interesting fantasy movie b c of the real meaning of family in it the history of our country the fun filled action displayed in the movie i watch time the top about 4 <UNK> a week and i just love it i wish that a sequel had of been made to see more of <UNK> dad in the past and watching how susan <UNK> with her new baby sister and having no <UNK> computers <UNK> or anything of the 21st century i hope everyone else enjoyed the movie as much as i did i guess you could say i'm a time at the top fanatic and i don't mind the <UNK> boy in the movie robert lincoln walker was simply <UNK> i wonder who he is and how old he is today does anyone know if he's played in over movies or tv shows
<START> there is a key aspect of film that <UNK> seems to have forgotten it has the ability to tell a story by showing it to you you don't need to tell the audience what to think because they'll see it the action here is interspersed with some of the most <UNK> narration unleashed on the unsuspecting public the purple <UNK> of the sensitive fifth former and it should be unnecessary because their is a fine cast here and some beautifully composed and shot visuals maybe <UNK> felt that the basic story needed a lit bit of support and he may have been right it lacks a basic credibility 70s <UNK> wasn't exactly full of beautiful <UNK> girls with a <UNK> for the <UNK> underground and a soft spot for a passing <UNK> from the too neat and new looking clothes that character wears to the <UNK> <UNK> that tries to link it all together it's all too contrived for my taste
<START> hilarious <UNK> confusing brilliant film reminds me of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> holy mountain lots of strange characters <UNK> about and looking for what is it i laughed almost the whole way through all the while keeping a <UNK> eye on the <UNK> and occasionally horrified reactions of the audience that surrounded me in the theatre entertaining through and through from the beginning to the guts and <UNK> <UNK> all the way to the end if it was an end i only wish i could remember every detail it <UNK> me sometimes br br honestly though i have only the most positive <UNK> of this film as it doesn't seem to be available to take home and watch i suppose i'll have to wait a few more years until <UNK> glover comes my way again with his big slide show and subsequent what is it screening i saw this film in <UNK> almost directly after being involved in a rather devastating car crash so i was slightly <UNK> at the time which was perhaps a very good state of mind to watch the <UNK> talking <UNK> and the <UNK> in the superhero costumes and <UNK> glover in his appropriate <UNK> q setting scantily clad <UNK> rising out of the floor like a magnificent <UNK> wet dream br br is it a statement on life as we know it of course everyone expects art to be just that i rather think that the truth is more evident in the <UNK> and in the negative space what you don't tell us is what we must <UNK> but is far more valid than the lies that other people feed us day in and day out rather one what is it than <UNK> movies like titanic or <UNK> in seattle <UNK> gag <UNK> br br thank you mr glover additionally a fun man to watch on screen or at his big slide show smart funny quirky and outrageously hot make more films write more books keep the nightmare alive
<START> this is a script that ed wood worked over 10 years on trying to get made <UNK> <UNK> finally got the <UNK> to film a script that wood saved from his burning home at the expense of other more <UNK> <UNK> br br this is a dialogue free movie that some may <UNK> describe as silent in fact it is a quite <UNK> film without the inane <UNK> of most flicks in the hands of these filmmakers the music and sound effects provide a rich audio experience that works better than almost any <UNK> from the hollywood script mill particularly that stupid boat movie billy zane last was in <UNK> out ' <UNK> no ' j cameron <UNK> i'll take <UNK> wonderfully <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in this film over empty dialogue any day br br billy zane heads a team of players who obviously really wanted to be in this film <UNK> is <UNK> as always and the gods are shining when you can put sandra <UNK> rick y <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and andrew <UNK> name on the same poster br br the design is perfect the <UNK> set exquisite and ron <UNK> <UNK> performance is simply wonderful overall this is a chaotic visceral masterpiece lovingly crafted by fans of ed wood jr auteur and <UNK> a must see for anyone who really loves movies the way that the first rate <UNK> and his cast obviously do a film to make you wish you had made it yourself
<START> i simply cant understand why all these <UNK> from the <UNK> era refuse to let go one can see clearly how frustrated they were during the <UNK> censorship that <UNK> them so many things to show in their movies and now they imagine its <UNK> what big deal of artsy <UNK> freedom so fill the screen with people <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> swearing and any other kinds of <UNK> imaginable this is not cinema friends and neighbors this is simply visual <UNK> forget about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> about david lynch about <UNK> and <UNK> and other movie makers who were able to work with an <UNK> of <UNK> those people were <UNK> their jobs well you don't do us a favor all you <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> and other <UNK> old <UNK> and leave us alone its bit time to see some romanian movies on screen enough with your immature <UNK> you are not directors you are illiterate
<START> this film was really eye opening i have seen this film several times first when i was four and i actually remembered it and then when i was 12 the whole message that the director is conveying is for everyone to wake up and not make the mistake of leaving god out of our everyday lives or just plain going the extra mile to insult him br br a great movie for non <UNK> and <UNK> alike
<START> this movie was a classic i would have to say that this movie caught the best of a working man who learns from his mistakes if we could all get along and learn the way everyone in this movie did it had an important part of showing how family is an important part of life and how pride can cause you to lose something important in life if we can not find a big throat and swallow are pride
<START> this movie is directed by <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> miracle stallone is <UNK> walker cat and mouse on the mountains with ruthless terrorists <UNK> <UNK> knows how to direct <UNK> stallone needed this role to get back on track snowy mountain is very good place for action movie and who is better to direct movie where is snow ice cold and bad weather than <UNK> man action is good music in the film is spectacular the bad guy is john <UNK> other stars micheal <UNK> the portrait of <UNK> <UNK> turner strong medicine the is placed in beautiful place and it is very exciting movie overall good movie br br remember extreme <UNK> special <UNK> edition with good extras <UNK> soon in <UNK> straight to video
<START> i am a christian and i feel this movie is awful br br nobody but hard core bible belt christians are going to like this movie the message is just too in your face if you want to touch a wider audience you have to be way more subtle you can't have the dad waving the bible around and carrying it with him in every scene ridiculous br br poor direction the reveal of people missing should have been terrifying but it was laughable they leave their clothes on the ground it reminded me of old ed wood movies oh my god people are missing that scene in the plane is just stupid think about it if you found your <UNK> clothes next to you you wouldn't just scream oh my god they disappeared they're missing and start crying and yelling you would first be in denial you just wouldn't jump to that conclusion watch jodie foster in <UNK> my favorite shot is the dog sitting out on the lawn with a pile of clothes and boots sitting next to him i about fell off the couch i was laughing so hard br br the music was so bad and so distracting it was as if the composer was in his own world <UNK> his own movies here's my chance to do a thriller here's my chance to do action stop telling me how to feel james <UNK> a good score supports what's happening on the screen this movie needed more of an under score but instead it was as much in your face as the message was br br the writing was bland so was captain christian kirk cameron <UNK> was the worse you don't understand people are missing brad johnson was laughable the two stand out performances came from the anti christ and the older guy sorry can't remember their names in watching the making of to answer my question of what were they thinking the producers and filmmakers and actors are just <UNK> themselves saying we're gonna reach wide audiences and brad johnson is amazing and this is just like a hollywood movie i came to the conclusion that they just don't know what the heck they are doing br br i <UNK> the effort getting the message to a wide audience is a fantastic idea film is the best medium possible to do that look at movies like wide awake signs contact passion of christ even <UNK> where art <UNK> the bottom line is that the film needed to be made by people who have talent and vision unfortunately it was not
<START> you can survive surviving christmas i thought the television version was a bit edited way down i like ben <UNK> he plays drew johnson a family less adult who is willing to pay complete strangers the <UNK> starring james gandolfini and catherine o'hara as the parents and christina <UNK> as lisa <UNK> the daughter drew is lonely around the holidays because he doesn't have a family of his own so he <UNK> out a family in the chicago <UNK> for a quarter million dollars bill macy who i best remember for playing <UNK> husband arthur is hired to play <UNK> the grandfather when the whole situation comes crashing down the truth can be painful the <UNK> household is <UNK> apart from the drew situation <UNK> rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit you can't buy what you wish for the acting and writing is mediocre but the first rate cast pulls it through to the final scene
<START> i just saw of human bondage for the first time a few days ago and wow what a mysterious and almost spooky film i loved how the music went with the pace of each step of <UNK> feet it gave me the chills for some reason br br one of the greatest aspects of this film is that you get to see bette davis coming into herself right before your eyes she's great not necessarily because this is her best work but because it was so out of the ordinary to be so vicious gritty and <UNK> as an actress in 1934 bette was a risk taker always wanting to be different and this is right about when she started to realize that she could be as nasty and daring as she wanted and people would love her for it if you're a true lover of film it's amazing to see br br she just had a way of delivering a line that made the part and the film for that matter belong to her like a mass of music and fire that's me an old <UNK> and some <UNK> or but you are <UNK> you are in that chair or with all my heart i still love the man i killed those are from a few of her films but you get my drift she was just so brave sassy and exotic looking with those beautiful big eyes after seeing this i can't believe it was remade twice br br leslie howard was gorgeous so calm and <UNK> needing to be loved i thought he was adorable and couldn't understand how everyone wasn't falling for him but then again everyone was except mildred he did a great job br br the only thing that i didn't like was something that was common with the writing in the early films they'd make a character so hateful that it's almost unbelievable that someone would actually fall for them in the first place the performances were great but in real life philip would have never been interested in mildred that's just the simple truth see it
<START> cat soup is a short anime based on the legendary manga <UNK> it won the award best short film at the <UNK> <UNK> film festival and also won the excellence prize at <UNK> media arts festival br br when little <UNK> <UNK> soul is stolen by death she and her brother <UNK> <UNK> on a bizarre journey to get it back in the surreal <UNK> of the other side they encounter many fantastic characters and remarkable often disturbing adventures br br cat soup is an anime like nothing you've ever seen it's hello kitty on acid it is very original stunningly beautiful and possess a great sense of <UNK> and <UNK> cat soup is very <UNK> there are no dialogue and sometimes cruel and gory so it is more an anime for adults than children they may not understand at all a great journey for those who get the chance to see this absolute masterpiece an must see
<START> i tried to watch this movie in a military camp during an overseas mission and let me tell you you'll watch anything under those circumstances not this piece of sh t though br br the first five minutes set the tone by weak porn movie quality acting weird out of the blue plot twists and unbelievable situations and behavior it gets worse after that this movie does not have one single saving grace and yet it is not bad in a way that would make it funny to watch it's just horrible i've seen quite many movies in my life and i'm not one of those <UNK> know all critics i mean i'll enjoy most movies to some extent even if they're bad this one man br br steer well clear of this one my friend
<START> somewhere on this site someone wrote that to get the best version of the works of jane austen one should simply read them i agree with that however we love adaptations of great literature and the current <UNK> strike brings to mind that without good writers it's hard for actors to bring their roles to life the current version of jane <UNK> <UNK> shows us what happens when you don't have a good foundation in a well written adaptation this version does not compare to the 1995 version with amanda root and <UNK> <UNK> which was well acted and kept the essence of the era and the constraints on the characters with the exception of the bizarre parade kissing in the street scene in bath the 2007 version shows a <UNK> anne who seems angst ridden the other characters were not very developed which is a crime considering how austen could paint such wonderful characters with some carefully chosen <UNK> the sequence of events that made sense in the novel were completely tossed about and mrs smith <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is walking around in bath <UNK> away as many of the characters seemed to do the strength of character and the intelligence of captain <UNK> which caused anne to love him in the first place didn't seem to be written into the rupert <UNK> jones' <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> had more substance and was able to convey so much more with a look than p j was able to do with his poses all in all the 2007 version was a disappointment it seemed to <UNK> the novel into a hand <UNK> <UNK> melodrama of <UNK> worth if they wanted to bring our modern emotional <UNK> into <UNK> work they should have done what they do with adaptations of shakespeare adapt it to the present at least bride prejudice was taken out of the historical <UNK> settings and was fun to watch as was clueless this wasn't <UNK> but they didn't know what else to call it
<START> this is a strange cerebral surreal <UNK> film if there is such a thing as intellectual horror cinema this film is it i started to get scared and wish there was someone else watching it with me and it barely has a plot i'm going to have to see this film again multiple times before i feel i really understand it if you're the kind of person who likes my dinner with andre and films by godard or if you do a lot of mind <UNK> drugs you will probably enjoy this film wow
<START> inspector gadget 1999 br br starring matthew <UNK> rupert everett <UNK> fisher andy dick <UNK> coleman director david <UNK> 80 minutes rated pg br br by blake french br br disney's new film inspector gadget is about a cop named john who survives a major accident and is saved by a state of the art experimental operation that turns him into a robotic machine like agent who has tools and <UNK> of all sorts built into his body at his use when he says go go only to be called inspector gadget br br the actual movie's structure is much like the body <UNK> of inspector gadget himself it is <UNK> <UNK> energetic and consist of a bunch of half hearted <UNK> thrown together to make something that doesn't have much in common with anything else present the film is basically a series of zany action sequences that are kind of <UNK> together with characters and an uneven story that only kids between the ages of 6 9 would enjoy br br the cop who is dramatically <UNK> is played by matthew <UNK> who until inspector gadget was on a success spree with movies like election his character becomes inspector gadget after an encounter with the film's heavy handed villain named claw he is played by rupert everett who has already experienced catastrophe this year with the dreadful william shakespeare's a <UNK> nights dream br br there is a romantic subplot in this movie as well as ample amounts of scenes involving inspector <UNK> wacky body parts and <UNK> elements it has gadget and claw <UNK> over the attractive character brenda played by <UNK> fisher for both her looks and her knowledge of a specific invention made by her late father who was earlier killed by claw competition <UNK> into fight scenes and a reason for many happenings in the film also a major character is the gadget <UNK> a life like <UNK> that is <UNK> for inspector gadget himself it is voiced by d l <UNK> from the sitcom comedy the <UNK> br br inspector gadget is a movie that i found quite bad i know i am not exactly a target audience of the filmmakers but even my ten year old relative found the film to his <UNK> the movie is full of distinct flaws and obvious problems i never found myself caring about the characters there is no mood development beyond some neat opening credits unlike the much worse 1997 film mr <UNK> which opened using clips of the original cartoon is it too much to ask for that same type of thing in this comedy which is seldom funny and hardly ever convincing the overall production design is nothing but a mess of <UNK> sight gags and consists of one joke inspector <UNK> bumbling <UNK> br br in movies like this the audience <UNK> for boundaries something to help make out what can happen and what can not in inspector gadget there are no such boundaries this is <UNK> nothing more than a party time for the actors who <UNK> had lots of fun i am reminded of another lacking comedy released a few years ago called <UNK> which again contained lots of props and energy and the actors certainly had fun time with all the <UNK> and props but it too lacked something needed for every movie audience participation br br a character that i found being left out a lot is <UNK> daughter who by the end of the movie i still has not clue of what her name was she is used only as a plot device and i question how she was used to further the plot as well for her presence brings nothing relevant or <UNK> to the film we never know her reactions to her father's operation or <UNK> thus this is someone who could have been completely left out and would have not affected the movie a bit br br in closing i'd like to state that inspector gadget is an awful <UNK> excuse for a children's comedy and believe it or not i find myself comparing this film to last years violent and very anti young audience action picture blade i am stating once again that i had much rather have a movie where nothing happens than one in which everything happens inspector gadget had so much going for it at the same time it made literally made me <UNK> br br
<START> amazing movie that in theory should be boring but is delivered with subtlety and incredible acting that i have long <UNK> of ever finding instead of relying on clichés and overly <UNK> moments the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments the lead characters are not perfect and so relating to them as people you could know is easy the movie is not trying to pull laughs or push an ideal onto the audience but simply showing us the possibility of true love in any <UNK> br br i am now restless waiting for the weekend so i can see the sequel a moving thought provoking funny look at love that i think should be an absolute romantic classic up there with casablanca and breakfast at <UNK> will <UNK> even the <UNK> heart
<START> first of all let me say that this is not the movie for people looking to watch something spirited and <UNK> for the holidays this movie is cold brutal and just downright depressing mary <UNK> plays a <UNK> mom who is down on christmas because her husband has lost his job they are losing their house can't buy christmas presents for the kids etc you get the idea happy stuff for the holidays so along comes harry dean <UNK> as <UNK> the christmas angel who in his dark hat and long <UNK> comes off more like a <UNK> who hangs around children all day <UNK> them what better way to <UNK> the spirit of christmas in mary <UNK> than to kill off her family and then offer to bring them back if she believes in christmas again santa claus is a <UNK> and his christmas <UNK> looks more like a <UNK> for <UNK> nazis on the <UNK> the movie lays everything on so thick that you don't care about the happy ending when it comes because the rest of the movie is so bitter and unbelievable i'm sure this film wanted to be something <UNK> like but it left out the joy and sentiment on what a holiday film should be
<START> i can only assume that the other reviewers of this film are <UNK> in the production company as this was quite possibly the worst movie i've seen in the last five years from the opening shot of a <UNK> laughing <UNK> for no apparent reason it was clear that the actors in this film would kill to be considered b level both my wife and i were in a great mood before starting this film and we were genuinely looking forward to a funny popcorn movie we knew we hadn't rented citizen kane and we weren't expecting to see the most amazing movie ever however after 40 minutes of enduring the most painfully unfunny bit of garbage i've ever seen we shut it off instead of wasting another minutes of our lives br br if a comedy with no laughs terrible acting thin plot and annoying characters are your thing then this film is for you honestly <UNK> 2 is better at least i laughed at the popcorn sex scene br br i cannot justify writing a longer review of this picture because i've already wasted almost an hour trying to find one joke
<START> horror spoofs are not just a thing of the 21st century way before the <UNK> <UNK> series there were a few examples of this genre mostly in the 80s but like said franchise most of these films are hit or miss some like <UNK> mistress of the <UNK> mostly rise above that but other like <UNK> the <UNK> and it's sequel fail to deliver the laughs but out of all these types of films there is one particularly big <UNK> and that's <UNK> 6 <UNK> ' a major waste of time for many reasons br br pros a great cast that does it's best some of the dopey humor is amusing a corny but catch theme song some good <UNK> locations br br cons <UNK> plot mostly tedious pacing most of the humor just doesn't cut it the monsters are given little to do and little screen time i thought this was supposed to be a spoof of monster movies lame ending that will likely make viewers angry br br final thoughts this is a comedy if it is then why are the really funny bits so few and far in between comedies are supposed to make us roll on the floor not roll our eyes and yawn <UNK> for it to be over i can't believe anchor bay released this tired junk i'll admit it's not one of the worst films ever made but it's not worth anyone's time or money even if you're a fan of any of the actors see <UNK> <UNK> instead br br my rating 2 5
<START> one of the best if not the best <UNK> movies ever and it's not just mindless fun there really were a lot of clever jokes in it of course i love the ramones but with all the <UNK> and the i hate high school themes the film doesn't at all take itself too seriously which is what's great about it br br i first saw the movie in the spring of 1980 and i saw it again recently since i went to high school in the late 1970's it made me kind of nostalgic br br like i said this film doesn't take itself that seriously and isn't pretentious like so much other teen fare of the seventies eighties and nineties and to speak of it's not really dirty or disgusting either only pg rated that's rare for a movie in this category a great cult classic and a truly incredible time capsule
<START> this is an incomprehensible horribly low budget piece of awfulness br br i don't even have the <UNK> to say how dire turgid boring confusing and just plain strange this effort is hey what <UNK> know i do set in a post apocalyptic america some guys meet on a beach and slaughter and chaos ensue it was all so incomprehensible i couldn't make head or tail of any of it br br seriously how this got picked up by national lampoon totally <UNK> me it really is awful br br and not in a its so bad it's good cult way br br it is just awful awful awful awful br br honestly if you still don't believe me then watch it with every intention of loving it then come back here and tell me what you think even <UNK> on acid couldn't hope to understand this br br avoid or even better destroy
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a young woman that feels more and more trapped in her marriage with <UNK> <UNK> himself is struggling with the death of his father the previous year and has lost his way he has <UNK> himself in work laid of his writing and <UNK> desperately misses the attraction between them into this enters johnny and old friend of <UNK> who once were artists in <UNK> together but johnny has kept on painting and just have a day job for the rent he takes the day as it comes and leaves tomorrow to its destiny there is an instant raw attraction between <UNK> and johnny and they enter into an affair but <UNK> struggles with her lust to be desired and her conscience and love for her husband but none of them not <UNK> not johnny and not <UNK> can stop the relationships between them to spin totally out of control br br comments it is set as a thriller but maybe more a thriller of heart than a normal thriller where it's about life and death and threat of violence not that a thriller of heart can't take on fatal proportions but the threat comes from a different angle and it is not really until the second half in <UNK> until the thriller emerges and even though the foundation for it is laid in the first half i can't really describe the genre as a thriller then much more of a romantic drama than anything else but with the underlying <UNK> of other genres the developing thriller is there but it also has more than a little <UNK> of a sensual erotic kind because that is what it is all about what drives the characters and therefore the entire story desire the need to have and the need to be br br in my opinion it is quite good definitely a lot better than its current 4 1 rating anyway it takes its time but it grows a good feeling of suspense and it handles the erotic part very well with taste it is always an integral part of the story needed to be there to give the story it's needed weight and i never felt it was an excuse to show a naked breast or anything like that but unfortunately the climax of the story comes well before the end and the end itself feels kind of flat even if in its own way kind of dramatic br br the cast is impressive <UNK> by known actors like nicholas cage and judge <UNK> but the show is almost completely stolen by erika anderson beautiful and very <UNK> at acting out the sometimes subtle feelings of desire she excels were both cage and <UNK> sometimes goes a <UNK> overboard and become a little rough her career afterward is too thin for the talent she shows in <UNK> i can only hope it is because of her own choices also two personal favorites appear in small roles that give some extra edge to the movie it is steve <UNK> and joe <UNK> br br when you're in the right mood this is a very good movie it could have used another end to get the credit it really deserves br br 7 10
<START> basically there's a family where a little boy jake thinks there's a zombie in his closet his parents are fighting all the time br br this movie is slower than a soap opera and suddenly jake decides to become rambo and kill the zombie br br ok first of all when you're going to make a film you must decide if its a thriller or a drama as a drama the movie is watchable parents are <UNK> arguing like in real life and then we have jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film i expected to see a boogeyman similar movie and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots br br 3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents descent dialogs as for the shots with jake just ignore them
<START> this is a wonderful film the non stop <UNK> takes several <UNK> to fully appreciate the musical productions of busby berkeley will never be <UNK> i think this movie easily <UNK> all of his other efforts joan blondell and james cagney are incredible together some of the humor would almost push the boundaries of today's movies put rational explanation of how they did it aside and enjoy it for the spectacle that it is
<START> david lynch's new short is a very <UNK> piece full of darkness tension <UNK> <UNK> but very <UNK> background music and features again two beautiful actresses a blonde and a brunette a <UNK> theme in his work br br both characters create a very intriguing slave mistress relationship that could be seen as a direct follow up to the same kind of relationship featured in <UNK> dr br br beautiful for lynch <UNK> br br
<START> bad acting bad lighting bad plot this had the quality of a porno movie i have seen more interesting home video of a boring wedding than this movie it sucked big time don't waste your time or money on this crap it's amazing that they allow this kind of <UNK> to even be released on video it should be a crime
<START> the flock is not really a movie it's a wannabe movie with wannabe actors not including richard gere he gave an excellent performance but when only one of the actors truly gives himself to his character and the rest of the cast is just acting the result is pathetic just like this movie you see the idea of acting is to hide the fact that you're acting what the hell was claire <UNK> doing in this one she's the most inappropriate actress for this character in 99 9 of the movie she looked extremely out of place out of everything the only thing she was doing was asking stupid questions like do you really think so and making silly faces i was embarrassed by her acting seriously and i used to like her she's the romantic movie type i don't know who picked her among all the actresses out there lol and seeing <UNK> <UNK> this really made me laugh anyway if you want to get the feeling of throwing up this movie will do the job for you i wish i could vote 5
<START> thomas clay has been mixing with the wrong types that's the trouble with young people these days they have no respect br br seriously this film should be avoided at all costs the action in the main body of the film is slow and rather <UNK> and <UNK> to the drug crazed ending as if like it's director it has no where better to go we are introduced to the main title character who is a bit of an <UNK> we see him at school and at home not quite fitting in feeling awkward in himself as so many <UNK> do robert falls in with bad <UNK> and starts missing school and taking drugs and before you know it he is a psycho rapist br br the film is really about <UNK> total failure to understand the <UNK> between violence imagery and violent acts clay seems to think a generation of crazed youth are made evil by scenes of war on our <UNK> yet he has filmed the most disgusting piece of <UNK> violence is this guy for real br br if clay has not seen youtube perhaps he is naive and unaware of will be done with the brutal climax scene from his film all anyone will want to see is the most hideous scene from the end of the film and i am sure that will be what sticks with people br br the rest of the film is pointless for in committing such an act of violence to film clay not only <UNK> young people who are <UNK> engaged in <UNK> war he also <UNK> himself as <UNK> of extreme tasteless violence for no better reason than his own personal celebrity status br br shame on all involved
<START> but it's certainly not without merit already writer director preston <UNK> is <UNK> with unusual cinematic effects in telling his stories creating <UNK> drawn yet distinctive characters and situations and writing clever and sometimes unexpectedly wise and compassionate dialogue no wonder the <UNK> <UNK> next movie is going to be an homage to <UNK> br br the major problem is that the <UNK> not all the way there yet it lacks surprise the unexpected plot twists and sudden changes of fortune that keep viewers guessing the coffee <UNK> is a lousy thing to hang the plot upon and the ending is thoroughly predictable frank <UNK> does this sort of thing much better br br if you're new to preston <UNK> check out the lady eve or <UNK> travels or the miracle of <UNK> creek first if you've seen these already then go ahead and watch this one
<START> recreation of 1950's london <UNK> and the up and coming people based on a cult novel br br julian temple is a video director no more no less give him 15 million dollars and he will make you a 15 million dollar pop video here he forgets that two minutes with people that can't really act is one thing but two hours what was he thinking of besides who are the audience who cares about a book that was well remembered way back when the usual london story of the <UNK> taking his chance br br what could really drag this film even further down oh i know third rate songs that sound like they were made up on the spot david <UNK> <UNK> the film title over and over a few times and that is the highlight the soundtrack album is clay <UNK> material br br there is one good thing though good recreation of period <UNK> shame they couldn't think of anything to put in front of it
<START> spoiler bunch of passive aggressive people having family reunion the script has them saying and doing things people would never do at least anyone with a shred of decency the hero falls for a woman he sees as his soul mate at a <UNK> the day of the reunion unaware she will show up as his brother's girlfriend at the reunion he tries to <UNK> to his brother's claim but she knowing our hero is clearly <UNK> with her <UNK> him mercilessly by wearing sexy clothing and behaving like a stripper <UNK> all over the brother in a <UNK> excuse that she is showing him how to stretch at one point she actually <UNK> and gets into a shower with him he tries to cover his eyes his heart is breaking she thinks it's funny until she suddenly decides she doesn't want the brother and leaves the reunion br br the movie really drags the audience <UNK> and <UNK> its way through the long <UNK> the writing is <UNK> and unbelievable we almost walked out but kept thinking surely something would happen that would <UNK> things up but <UNK> all the lovely reviews must have been written by paid <UNK> out to <UNK> poor <UNK> like me into seeing crap like this comparing it to little miss sunshine <UNK> shame on them the writers the actors the producers and the theaters for letting anything this bad make it to the screen
<START> the most moving and truly eye opening documentary ever created i cried the whole way through from start to end watching the show you are immediately captured by a man's struggle to live without pain to live a life we would take for granted the first time i heard the title i was almost scared to see the program it was hard for me to comprehend living in agony every day of every year of my life i truly felt for him the saddest part of the documentary is when <UNK> picks out his coffin could you imagine doing that even more so even though he was in excruciating and unbearable pain he still opened up his own charity debra <UNK> is one of the only people that deserves true respect and admiration he is the definition of a role model what a true and <UNK> hero he was
<START> this film is about a male <UNK> getting involved in a murder investigation that happened in the circle of powerful men's wives br br i thought the walker would be thrilling and engaging but i was so wrong the pacing is painfully and excruciatingly slow that even after 40 minutes of the film nothing happens much seriously the first hour could be <UNK> into ten minutes that's how slow it is br br the fact that it lacks any thrills or action scenes <UNK> the boredom it's almost shocking that even argument scenes are so plain and devoid of emotion maybe it is because of the stiff upper lip of the higher social class br br it's sad that the walker becomes such a boring mess despite such a strong cast blame it on the poor plot and even worse pacing
<START> although i gave a rating of 9 my expectations were higher than what the film delivered i would have been happier had there been more deep diving since i am a diver myself but it was supposed to portray the life of carl brashear and that's what it was about this film made me angry in the beginning but happy in the end
<START> i'm a big fan of the tv series <UNK> <UNK> this movie was pain for me i had to use fast forward not to fell to sleep it was boring how can somebody ruin this title so much the story was the only good thing actors were sh t they can't live the role the main actor tom is a <UNK> watch the other roles of this actor the fighting scenes were unbelievable boring and not to <UNK> somehow they were not to follow the situation like other reviewer said low budget film with bad actors maybe next time somebody else can do better thing out of this title french can't do right thing with big films like alien 4 that was bit <UNK> after alien 1 2 3
<START> i cannot vote on this because i wouldn't watch garbage from these people they got my money with another movie mr <UNK> and i <UNK> it would never happen again i feel it's my <UNK> duty to help people stay away from this trash go to the <UNK> on this film and read where cast members try to act like they are seeing the movie for the first time one guy even responds to himself using the same name there are <UNK> in the forum that say it's as good as <UNK> redemption and citizen kane not even close by no means if this is the <UNK> 2nd movie it should be better than the first that means the 3rd movie should be a lot better not so i've seen it all i want to know is how you <UNK> this trash using the same names all the time having fun with friends and making a movie over the weekend is fine but don't try to market that trash
<START> this excellent drama had me in suspense the whole time i could not take my eyes off the screen for one second because every word kept connecting the pieces to this puzzling murder this movie really touched me because it showed how sad and hard life can be i really did cry in the end which i don't want to give away it also let me realize how cruel and sickening people can be when it comes to murder br br the cast was also very good the only bad cast member was the actress who played anne marie the actress did a great job but the director didn't i say this because he found someone who didn't look a single bit like anne marie <UNK> herself
<START> i saw this film a while back and it's still at the top of my <UNK> <UNK> list it is amazingly put together and what really makes the film are the detailed <UNK> bits such as the <UNK> <UNK> coffee <UNK> being <UNK> as a cup to wash her <UNK> hair that people aren't seeing because you will not understand this movie unless you are hispanic this is just one of those films that is very <UNK> specific and particular please do not bash this film if you have no prior knowledge of what foundation it's being built upon i completely see what the writer director was going for and he hit the target perfectly this film is highly deserving of a better rating
<START> how the grinch stole christmas instantly stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from my very first viewing now eight viewings later it still has the same impact on me as it did the first time i saw it br br screenwriters <UNK> price peter s <UNK> of who framed roger rabbit fame do a fantastic job of adapting the story of the grinch to the screen ron <UNK> direction brought the story to full life and jim <UNK> typically energetic performance as the grinch steals the show br br some <UNK> of the film have claimed that it is not true to the spirit or principles of the original story having read the original story i must say i cannot agree the movie makes the very same point about christmas and its true meaning as the original story indeed it enhances the impact of the story by making it more personal by showing us how and why the grinch became what he was br br mild spoilers they probably wouldn't ruin the movie for you but if you haven't seen it yet and you're one of those who wants to know nothing about a story until you've seen it you should skip the next two <UNK> br br i think just about everyone can relate to the <UNK> terrible experiences in school i think all of us at one time or another were the <UNK> one in school who was always picked on i know i was and that's why i personally had so much sympathy for the grinch and what he went through br br and cindy lou who's naive <UNK> believing that nobody can be all bad was heart <UNK> when everyone else had turned their backs on the grinch out of fear and ignorance cindy lou was determined to be his friend if only everyone could have such an attitude br br in fact i think the only thing that <UNK> made the film a little better would have been to further tone down the adult humor and content it was already pretty restrained but any of this adult humor like when the grinch <UNK> nose first into martha may <UNK> <UNK> just doesn't fit in a story like this br br this one's well on its way to being a christmas classic taking a richly deserved place alongside the book and the chuck jones cartoon as a must see of every christmas season
<START> the original movie dated 19 did not show any monster it just suggested scary things br br this version however shows every aspect of a sick minded ghost including unnecessary special effects br br the mystery as presented in the original movie was the most scary part one simply did not know what was causing the weird things that happened by showing the face of the old man this mister has completely disappeared even worse the special effects crying wooden children faces is ridiculous this is a stupid remake too obviously spectacular to even be close as scary as the original
<START> just cause showcases sean connery as a <UNK> law <UNK> kate <UNK> does she still get work as his wife slight age difference and lawrence fishburne as a racist southern cop and ed harris in a totally over the top rendition of a <UNK> southern serial killer br br weird casting but the movie plays serious <UNK> with the audience don't read if you ever intend to seriously watch this film or to ever watch this film seriously due to the spoilers first of all i felt myself rolling my eyes repeatedly at the liberal stereotypes the cops are all sadistic and frame this black guy with no evidence the <UNK> witnesses and even the lawyer of the accused <UNK> against him he is accused of the rape and murder of a young girl because he is black br br connery is a <UNK> law <UNK> who gives <UNK> speeches about the <UNK> against blacks and against the <UNK> death penalty he is approached by the convicted man's grandmother to defend him and re open the trial br br connery is <UNK> yawn by the small town officials and the good <UNK> boys club but finds that the case against blair the alleged killer now on death row was all <UNK> the main evidence was his confession which was beaten out of him br br the beating was <UNK> by a black cop who even played russian <UNK> to get the confession out of him connery finds out that another <UNK> on death row actually did the murder and after a few <UNK> a <UNK> with a seriously overacting <UNK> <UNK> like ed harris he finds out where harris <UNK> the murder weapon br br he gets a re trial and blair is freed br br i think film over br br then suddenly it turns out that blair is a psychotic psycho and that he used white guilt to <UNK> connery he <UNK> the story with ed harris in return for blair carrying out a few murders for harris br br now blair is on the loose again thanks to <UNK> <UNK> pc principles the final 30 min are a weird action movie tacked onto a legal drama connery and fishburne fighting the serial killer in an alligator <UNK> house on <UNK> yes you read that right in the <UNK> br br that was one weird film br br so the whole system is corrupt and <UNK> the cops are all just bullies and abu <UNK> type <UNK> but the criminals are really <UNK> and deserve to <UNK> br br truly depressing on every level the system is completely rotten and the pc white guilt types who challenge it are seriously <UNK> too br br two thumbs down connery obviously had to make a <UNK> <UNK> or something
<START> <UNK> bronson thriller unfortunately it's technically good and i gave it 4 10 but it's so utterly vile that it would be <UNK> to call it entertainment far more disturbing than a typical slasher film
<START> i was <UNK> excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week my 13 year old son was looking forward to it too i rented it and <UNK> down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screen br br boy was i disappointed this movie <UNK> off from the book more times than is forgivable george c scott is an excellent actor but in this it seemed that he was fully into character only about 20 of the time the rest of the time he was quite flat br br i realize that this was made in <UNK> pre cg effects for the most part but it looked to be very b movie quality especially the encounter with <UNK> <UNK> br br the biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story when the spirit of christmas present takes scrooge on the <UNK> tour of the world <UNK> people in the <UNK> of circumstances still having the light and love of <UNK> br br i will admit that mr scott did a good job with the <UNK> scrooge at the end that was a refreshing portrayal br br i wish that bob <UNK> had been portrayed as a little more <UNK> and down <UNK> and tiny tim oh don't even get me started on bad child actors
<START> there is one really good scene in <UNK> <UNK> the title character gets in an argument with another woman and after being threatened <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> her in the face the scene works because the act is so unexpected bizarre and rather funny at the same time in that one instance writer director <UNK> <UNK> gives the audience a character that is easy to root for an interesting film character that could be worth watching for two hours in the scene he presents a brave woman who is bold in her actions for the rest of the movie the only other thing he seems to present is <UNK> tones br br the tone is all over the place it's true not all movies have to clearly fit within a specific genre but i don't think <UNK> <UNK> fits into any genre supposedly it's a drama though there are moments of such broad comedy the aforementioned <UNK> in the face that it cannot be taken seriously on the other hand the film is certainly not a comedy with the <UNK> amount of serious topics <UNK> has <UNK> into the picture there is a way to successfully mix comedy and drama together unfortunately <UNK> doesn't find that balance instead one scene after another just drift into each other without much rhyme or reason leaving two different tones hanging in the wind br br <UNK> <UNK> also has the problem of running two hours long with an extremely drawn out finale the film ends with a big party where all the characters' conflicts are resolved only they aren't resolved quickly the scene lasts longer than any other scene going on for probably twenty minutes because the rest of the scenes up until this point have been meandering the finale is particularly hard to endure with <UNK> beginning early on in the scene making for a frustrating viewing experience br br perhaps i am being too hard on <UNK> <UNK> i am not the right audience for it i felt nothing towards the characters and had no connection to any part of the story there are people who will probably find something meaningful in the story and see strong characters however i was unable to do so and thus cannot recommend it
<START> well i too had heard read all the breathless reviews and comments about how this movie might deserve the best picture oscar so i went to see it today what a major disappointment 1 if you read the other reviews you will learn from members of the u s military who served in iraq how unlikely the events of this movie are they <UNK> my own thoughts as the movie played i a complete <UNK> kept thinking to myself say what there's no way that would happen like that 2 there's very little that actually happens in terms of plot a new bomb <UNK> guy shows up to replace one who was killed a death that isn't really clearly explained the new guy gets an <UNK> rush from his work his attitude puts others at risk that's it 3 this movie is nowhere near as suspenseful as claimed if you want suspense try one of the bourne movies if you want to see a war movie that's emotionally powerful try renting go tell the <UNK> which is about the vietnam war and stars burt <UNK> who told me personally in a <UNK> supermarket encounter that it was a film he was immensely proud of and one he viewed as some of his finest work and which he was still upset had been largely ignored in the wake of the over hyped apocalypse now or an old wwii black and white classic sink the <UNK> which especially for an english film is unbelievably heart wrenching don't waste your time on hurt locker
<START> an updated version of a theme which has been done before while that in and of itself is not bad this movie doesn't reach the ring like the other inherent and pure evil ones do br br predictable ambitious attempt that falls short of the mark not worth sitting through for the tired contrived ending
<START> one more of extremely <UNK> movies about computer <UNK> br br looks authors of that movie don't know real specific of <UNK> world br br 20 top <UNK> in the world program which have own <UNK> for what program which using satellite <UNK> somebody kill somebody to steal the <UNK> why and much more of stupid moments at this movie br br peoples who not <UNK> not will see something awful at that movie because not professionals on this but peoples will see not real things br br <UNK> will find that movie odd and awful because lots of moments inside movie is not related real life why movie not scifi in this case
<START> i enjoyed this movie unlike like some of the <UNK> up <UNK> trash that is passed off as action movies playing god is simple and realistic with characters that are believable action that is not over the top and enough twists and turns to keep you interested until the end br br well directed well acted and a good story
<START> in my opinion this is a pretty good celebrity skit show i enjoyed seeing greg kinnear as the host there are many reasons why i said that even though hal sparks was an okay host i sometimes wish that greg kinnear hadn't left if you ask me it seems that nobody stays with a tv show throughout its entire run anymore still i enjoyed seeing the various <UNK> and other people <UNK> celebrities if you ask me that was pretty darn funny before i wrap this up i must say that i kind of miss this show now in conclusion i highly recommend this show to all you die hard sketch show fans you will really enjoy it
<START> i feel like i've just watched a snuff film a beautifully acted taut engrossing and horrible thing a two hour <UNK> of <UNK> in the most basic and all <UNK> sense of the word sexual violence and torture rape <UNK> incest corruption live burial and abuse abuse abuse no redemption whatsoever and i was entertained i couldn't stop watching what does this say about me about the people who make and act in this sort of thing and a world that has become so <UNK> that eventually real snuff films will be the norm and i'm neither <UNK> nor <UNK> i don't try to hide from the existence of darkness and i definitely have not led a <UNK> life but i am ashamed of myself and i'm sorry to see my british cousins dragging the subject matter <UNK> the way my own tribe does it doesn't have to be <UNK> but does it have to <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this movie was very good if you are one who likes to watch horror movies i recommend it the acting was very good although i thought that the actress playing julie could have had more emotion behind her lines allan was very good and i thought the cinematography was amazing i was on the edge of my seat the entire time while my friends were freaking out and screaming it was a complete success in my opinion and should have made it to the big screen i give it two thumbs up i definitely would say that if you haven't already seen it then go rent it if you have seen it and didn't like it go and watch it again because there are parts that were completely unreal i also liked how a lot of the movie was filmed around and on my <UNK> campus
<START> read my lips tells of a strange <UNK> which develops between a plain socially <UNK> female office worker <UNK> and her <UNK> <UNK> a crude <UNK> <UNK> as the film <UNK> out this unlikely duo down to their <UNK> they become <UNK> in a chilling <UNK> of the minds each using the other for their own selfish reasons with an extraordinary outcome good stuff for anyone into character driven films with strong <UNK> <UNK> in french with easy to read subtitles and good translation b
<START> i was very <UNK> with this move everything was terrible from the start the comedy was <UNK> the action overdone the songs <UNK> even the storyline was <UNK> from a writer who has written successful scripts like guru and <UNK> i had high expectations the actors worked way too hard and did not help the film at all of course kareena <UNK> the screen in a bikini but for two seconds i think hindi stunt directors should research how action movies are done they tend to <UNK> way too much in chinese films this style works because that is their signature piece but hindi <UNK> signature are the songs a good action movie should last no more than two hours and cannot look unrealistic but in the future i'm sure these action movies will get much <UNK> also to be noted comedy and action films do not mix unless done properly good luck next time
<START> i always enjoyed watching this when it came on television during prime time every year in the 60's it's a typical hollywood history epic <UNK> stylized and full of inaccuracies but so what it's an entertaining movie and a good looking film cecil b demille at the end of his life is the executive producer of this remake of his 1938 film his son in law actor anthony quinn who had the supporting role of <UNK> in the <UNK> film is the director in his directorial debut and <UNK> song as he had never directed a film before and never would again demille assembled a crew who had recently worked on his 10 <UNK> to help quinn pull it off including longtime demille associate producer actor henry <UNK> <UNK> the project also from the 10 <UNK> are screenwriter jesse <UNK> cinematographer <UNK> <UNK> assistant director francisco day 2nd unit director arthur <UNK> art directors walter tyler and hal <UNK> set directors sam <UNK> and ray <UNK> costume <UNK> edith head john <UNK> and ralph lester who as a costume design team received the <UNK> only oscar nomination a great cast here from team demille headed up by <UNK> <UNK> as pirate jean <UNK> and <UNK> heston as future president general andrew jackson also in the cast are charles boyer e g marshall <UNK> greene claire bloom and <UNK> stevens at just over two hours it drags in some spots but makes up for it with some excellent battle scenes i would give it a 7 5 out of 10
<START> gee what a crappy movie this was i cannot understand what people find so scary about the grudge the director plays one trick i'd have to admit a very good one that is brought to life very stylized and then he repeats it for the rest of the movie over and over again as a consequence i <UNK> a few times in the first quarter of the movie but once i knew the <UNK> i practically fell asleep as the grudge grew more and more predictable by the minute to conclude i can say that there are a lot better movies in the genre to begin with that the so called predecessor the ring was way scarier and that buying a ticket for the grudge is a waste of money
<START> i wanted to like this movie but many elements ruined it for me the use of a <UNK> lens throughout and choppy editing did not give me a sense of being in the world of the <UNK> head but it did make me think i was watching mtv for a few short moments the movie never did seem to go anywhere and the acting was truly an excellent example of over acting i love movies that give us a glimpse into the seedy underworld but this film couldn't decide if it was a bad horror film or an even worse serious commentary on the horrors of addiction
<START> enjoyed this 1936 film with plenty of veteran classic actors and especially william powell dr lawrence <UNK> mister roberts who played the role as a doctor and detective dr <UNK> was once married to jean arthur paula <UNK> <UNK> and got a divorce and still they managed to live with each other and also fight all the time paula wanted her husband to investigate a homicide and did everything she could to convince him it was very important jean arthur plays a rather nutty type and there is plenty of 1936 comedy and the method of murder is something you will never believe especially with a <UNK> on a california race track robert armstrong nick <UNK> king kong gave a great supporting role as a <UNK> along with james <UNK> a detective who need the help of dr <UNK> in order to solve this very strange murder mystery if you see this film just remember it was produced and directed in 1936 and the people in the audience in those days thought this was great entertainment and it really was in those days
<START> <UNK> is a wonderful movie and <UNK> <UNK> is excellent so is <UNK> <UNK> who is usually excellent in most of her roles along with <UNK> its an example of <UNK> cinema at its best there are certain parts in both movies that tend to the <UNK> it would have probably enhanced the movie to not have the few scenes where the social message is <UNK> in these scenes probably emerge from the film <UNK> political concerns but the movie is realistic and moving enough to not need it but apart from such minor <UNK> its a movie that deserves to be seen more and one i strongly recommend <UNK> <UNK> concern and <UNK> shines through
<START> this is by far my most favourite movie in the world i enjoyed it when i was 4 and i still enjoy it at 16 its an absolute masterpiece no video collection is complete without it i enjoy every second of it and not only does the film have some great special affects but its sends a great message to the youngsters of the audience which may sound <UNK> but in actual fact the movie is done very <UNK> in actual fact although michael jackson has been in <UNK> movies now people still dont see him as an actor in reality he's the most talented actor i know he's so talented he's incredible <UNK> is a must see
<START> i rented this by mistake i thought after a <UNK> examination of the box that this was a time travel sci fi story instead it's a christian story and i suppose is fairly typical example if you are sold on the message you probably will overlook the <UNK> of the plot acting etc but i found it rather painful br br i have to admit that i'm bothered by the <UNK> of history in this story it paints the <UNK> as some sort of paradise of family values and morality a character is <UNK> that 5 of <UNK> end in divorce but it <UNK> very <UNK> sides of this highly moral society rigid racial sexual and social <UNK> were <UNK> for instance and at one point the hero complains to a clothing store owner about things that sound not all that different than the complaints of some iranian leaders about women's clothing styles as reported in a recent <UNK> br br overall thought i suppose that it's the sort of thing you'll like if you like this sort of thing and it's certainly wholesome
<START> one hour eight minutes and twelve seconds into this flick and i decided it was pretty lame that was right after <UNK> chris <UNK> drops on his horse from a tree to <UNK> the good guy <UNK> i was pretty <UNK> by the whole <UNK> cassidy great bar 20 gimmick which didn't translate into anything at all obviously the name coppola in the credits couldn't do anything to guarantee success here even with more than one listed br br if you make it to the end of the film you'll probably wind up asking yourself the same questions i did what exactly was the hook with the <UNK> what's up with the <UNK> scenario who was the stranger supposed to represent why did they make this film br br i could probably go on but my <UNK> been <UNK> look there's already a western called the <UNK> from 1950 with a guy named gregory peck as the title character watching it will make you feel as good as watching this one makes you feel bad that one i can recommend
<START> sean bean is great as are the photography locations and costumes however the plot is somewhat muddled and the conclusion flat the plot has been <UNK> altered from <UNK> novel and not to the better unfortunately this adventure is much better read than watched <UNK> was too <UNK> drawn here in contrast with his literary alter ego who seems more intelligent and determined despite his <UNK> in his new role as an officer promoted from the ranks i really enjoyed the brief scene in which <UNK> is <UNK> by a real officer and after a quick pause and <UNK> stare pushes the surprised and <UNK> officer right back it sets the tone for his later trials as a commanding officer br br rating 4 of 10
<START> it's a weekend i've been watched this funny film and i really like it all the kids are cute who remind me of my own childhood with those stupid thinking it's a real entertaining movie for a group of families at weekend night which could make lots of memories and <UNK> kid's humor always work nice acting as well simple story but cool shooting nice job for <UNK> to find the kid's way when it comes to the kid movie i think of 12 and holding another one this year but <UNK> aspect to the kid's world which is real and cruel awesome work <UNK> focuses on the happy side of childhood which every kid and family need p s <UNK> i think is the voice of <UNK> from finding <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> was already a star for his tour de force in wild <UNK> and he is one of <UNK> biggest indie stars in this film he plays cedric a local boy who meets <UNK> mathieu newcomer jamie <UNK> in a stunning nuanced <UNK> performance at the beach mathieu has a complex relationship with his ill mother demanding aunt and sister with whom he has a <UNK> relationship soon the two are falling in love br br the film's <UNK> narrative which is comprised of lengthy flash backs bits and pieces of the present and real time forward movement into the future is a little <UNK> director <UNK> <UNK> doesn't <UNK> which time period we are in and the story line can be difficult to follow but stick it out the film's final 45 minutes are so engrossing that you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen by turns heart breaking and uplifting this film ranks with beautiful thing as must see cinema
<START> this films makes no pretentious efforts to hide its true genre a campy b movie it will flat out tell you in the beginning the definition of campy it should have also given the <UNK> meaning of cheese but the two come together in this film in ways that make you go <UNK> that's so stupid and then have you laughing for example there is a scene back in <UNK> century japan which shows a couple of samurai walking in the <UNK> of a temple in the background of the temple there are several tourists looking off in the distance in <UNK> and shorts <UNK> <UNK> i could not stop laughing and the acting goes from decent to bearable to oh my lord but that's what makes it funny you'll see some decent actors and then find others really terrible i have to <UNK> somewhat though because i have seen stephanie <UNK> in several plays and she is awesome her air time in the film was pretty short though i have also seen bryan <UNK> in several plays in the islands during my visits and he's also better in theatre than in this movie anyhow it's an entertaining film if you've got nothing to do on a <UNK> evening
<START> i watched this movie also and <UNK> it is very well done i found it a <UNK> and would not recommend this to women who have small children the terror on this mother's face when she sees her child about to be run over by a train is truly heartbreaking and the sad thing is <UNK> she dies eventually she goes back to the <UNK> mountains all the money in the world which she makes from making dolls does not <UNK> the grief she has i remember her desperate face as she pulls money out of her clothes to try to have her child <UNK> i'm surprised this movie takes place in detroit because when i watched it i thought for sure the people had come to <UNK> <UNK> this also was a route for the poor from the mountains
<START> first off i never considered myself an uwe boll <UNK> since i think i never even saw one of his movies but after seeing this cheap excuse for a movie named seed which is the name of the serial killer this movie is about i am close to joining the hate club this movie makes absolutely no sense at all the plot is a joke and although boll clearly tries to get attention by shocking people 90 of this movie is just plain boredom you can sum up this movie like this br br 1 <UNK> killer watches clips of animals getting tortured on tv this is real life footage from <UNK> <UNK> and the movie opens with the ridiculous reason of making a statement about humanity and giving a <UNK> address since this movie has no message at all and is the worst piece of torture porn exploitation you already have a reason to hate the movie from the beginning <UNK> br br 2 death by <UNK> with a <UNK> that gives away what happens later in this movie <UNK> on screen so every <UNK> gets it br br 3 cops watch videos of animals babies and women <UNK> to death and <UNK> in <UNK> basement having stupid nightmares and crying into their <UNK> because seed is such an evil bad <UNK> although the acting is ok the movie takes a dive every time it tries to <UNK> any emotions br br 4 cops bust seed in his house act stupid and get <UNK> in the dark this sequence reminds me of a video game you barely see anything except <UNK> seed is a super killer that is everywhere at once and all cops act stupid enough to be killed except for one who <UNK> him br br 5 seed gets the chair and we see his <UNK> as lengthy as everything else in this movie he won't die and we are reminded of the opening statement that he must be set free if he survives 3 electric <UNK> guess what they just bury him alive to solve the problem br br 6 seed comes out of his grave kills everyone off in another <UNK> part and then seeks the main cop to take revenge on br br 7 a woman gets her head <UNK> in with a hammer in an endless sequence from one point of view just for the fun and shock value of it br br 8 seed captures the cops family <UNK> him to his house threatens to kill his wife and daughter after killing his wife with a nail gun the cop shoots himself in the head considering thats whats seed wants its hard to get into that guys head since he not just wears his mask even in prison but also never <UNK> a word the movie has barely any dialog anyway so don't mind br br 9 boll goes for a <UNK> shocker end where seed locks the daughter in with her dead dad to <UNK> like the persons we saw on video on sequence 3 br br this is it no message no plot no reason no face behind the mask no background except a stupid story that seed was burnt as a child br br this movie relies purely on few key scenes and their shock value i hardly remember a movie this empty of any emotion or message or entertainment its like watching august underground thats fine with me some people will enjoy this brainless snuff but what is really hard to stand about it is the pseudo message in the beginning and the fact that the movie is well made considering camera work effects and even the acting is too good for this waste of celluloid br br so how does boll get money to make such movies when thousands of talented directors work on <UNK> budgets seed is not just the essence of ridiculous its living proof that the free market is flawed lucky uwe that the german <UNK> is paying for a lot of this waste to get <UNK>
<START> a hard to find film which <UNK> on the still <UNK> mythology of senator joe mccarthy as a political demon king boyle as joe gives a compelling but historically inaccurate portrayal of the <UNK> senator the caricature mccarthy many take as the real one meredith as <UNK> army lawyer joseph welch who <UNK> mccarthy at the army <UNK> in 1954 is very good as always br br in fact mccarthy and <UNK> were quite right in worrying about the appalling security situation in the army and the 1954 army <UNK> became <UNK> in the <UNK> used by the army to <UNK> the investigation away from their security <UNK> which the <UNK> were investigating by counter <UNK> that mccarthy and <UNK> were trying to get <UNK> for their <UNK> david <UNK> whilst in the service br br the film is self satisfied agenda driven <UNK> based in the <UNK> <UNK> which have passed for the truth with many people for decades that the red scare was essentially phony and mccarthy <UNK> etc were always <UNK> away at the wrong targets being no more than lying career ruining publicity <UNK> who were <UNK> over the <UNK> rights of <UNK> innocent <UNK> who were accused of being security risks <UNK> br br people who know little about the matter still feel confident in repeating <UNK> on mccarthy and the red scare to this day <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is an example the <UNK> is <UNK> no wonder people have <UNK> it a recent <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> in the serious left wing uk newspaper the guardian <UNK> that the hollywood writer named names to mccarthy <UNK> the lie that mccarthy <UNK> hollywood as head of <UNK> the truth being that mccarthy was never even a member of <UNK> and he had little interest in the politics of hollywood types his <UNK> were confined almost exclusively to arms of the us government br br the mythology about the red scare being <UNK> is now completely <UNK> by recently opened soviet and us government documents if anything mccarthy and co <UNK> the sheer scale of soviet and fellow <UNK> <UNK> in the us but decades of public <UNK> about this period will be hard to correct br br one day maybe some really brave hollywood soul will make a movie telling the truth about how many american men and women <UNK> aided the mass murderer <UNK> and worked to <UNK> his vicious system of government on the western world giving an accurate account maybe of joe <UNK> career but i won't hold my breath till then we have this mythical drunken lying <UNK> of popular imagination so familiar in the media tail <UNK> joe
<START> anita and me seems to be little more than an excuse for <UNK> <UNK> the author of the novel and screenplay to air her prejudices <UNK> and general <UNK> towards the english the general sentiment of indian <UNK> over the english in this film is foul br br the english people in this film are portrayed as overweight violent foul mouthed <UNK> engaging in child neglect stupid <UNK> racist ugly eating poor food and dim witted <UNK> only by turning to indian culture can the local priest be redeemed at the end of the film br br by contrast the indian family are beautiful clever educated can speak many languages are caring and loving parents and <UNK> school fodder the film is so <UNK> <UNK> that i am <UNK> the bbc <UNK> it at all had it been the other way round an english family in an indian community depicted this way the film would have been seen as racist br br there were a few moments where my <UNK> shot so far up my <UNK> i thought it would <UNK> in my <UNK> first the <UNK> scene between the women at the <UNK> celebration <UNK> the english are dirty and <UNK> and the men <UNK> english women are prostitutes second the meal with anita where <UNK> family lie to her about <UNK> <UNK> the english are so stupid you can make them do anything br br but the underlying contempt towards anything english even english <UNK> are an object of <UNK> is evident all the way through the film the character of anita was drawn so <UNK> almost the fallen woman <UNK> that i finished the film feeling angry br br this is not a bend it like beckham where the humour is focused on loving <UNK> of a <UNK> behaviour and customs from somebody within that community and is a film about two girls from different backgrounds coming together instead anita and me seems to convey that a form of cultural apartheid is inevitable as the english are almost an version of the indian <UNK> <UNK> and this is <UNK> by a <UNK> <UNK> series of attacks upon the film's other community the english br br i felt anita and me is a hate filled <UNK> based piece of work on that basis the bbc should not have <UNK> its production
<START> wow i can't believe people consider this a <UNK> movie now i have seen much worse but there are much more romantic funny comedies with john cusack br br this is a mediocre film at best while the acting wasn't terrible but not great for a romantic comedy there was little passion little romance there were many loose ends that don't show up or are not addressed unfortunately the main characters do come off as complete <UNK> they don't know themselves well enough to realize that they don't love the people they are engaged to how do we know they aren't in love by the utter lack of <UNK> both characters have for leaving their <UNK> i can think of few things more romantic than the <UNK> escape from commitment that these two show br br the movie doesn't even end with a wedding scene more than likely both will get cold feet and drop each other like hot <UNK> once a commitment is <UNK> this movie is really about two people who can't commit to anything unlike <UNK> previous characters who were more than willing to make a deep commitment <UNK> in say anything martin in <UNK> <UNK> blank etc br br the greatest failure of this movie was the complete lack of any twists turns or anything of interest when the movie ended i felt like they had failed to include a climax to the story which basically fits the whole movie boring no suspense about whether the two will end up together no joy when they do no consequences to their actions br br it is sad that people are so blind to the <UNK> of this movie that they simply <UNK> any criticism with <UNK> is too cynical ' criticism of this movie is not cynicism simply <UNK> examination there are many other better romantic comedies even ones with grace kelly or eva marie saint br br if you think this movie is great try these movies you hearts will explode the princess bride say anything <UNK> <UNK> blank high <UNK> keeping the faith <UNK> rear window north by <UNK> or there's something about mary which is a good examination of <UNK> romance vs today's society
<START> i bought this game on ebay having heard that it was a similar game to elite the <UNK> is indeed very similar and is very <UNK> once i'd played it a couple of times i immediately went back on ebay and bought copies for all my kids so they could join in the fun too i have played this game right through and the storyline makes it feel as if you are actually in a movie it's brilliant if you have trouble feeling free to explore because of the <UNK> nature of the storyline in the single player game simply set up a <UNK> <UNK> on your own pc easy to do and the <UNK> is included and play to your <UNK> content there are still a huge number of <UNK> <UNK> on the internet so <UNK> is no problem and is not all that threatening because you don't often meant other players unless you want to so go get a copy of this game learn it by playing the single player campaign then set up an online presence and enjoy yourself the depth of this game is <UNK> with huge systems to explore and <UNK> to find as well as all sorts of other things to discover hidden planets <UNK> secret <UNK> the list is nearly endless fantastic game and especially as you can get it for a couple of <UNK> on ebay get one with the full written <UNK> if you can blue box not <UNK> red box it's loads better
<START> an excellent movie and great example of how scary a movie can be without really showing the viewer anything it's a set of four stories all revolving around the <UNK> of a <UNK> old fashioned house and their various gruesome and horrific <UNK> all tied together by a wrap around story about a scotland yard inspector searching for a missing horror film star it starts out with a story about a mystery writer whose main character becomes a little too realistic followed by a story about two old romantic rivals who become obsessed over a wax figure in a museum then a story about a <UNK> <UNK> little child who is anything but and closing with the story of what happened to the missing film <UNK> what he does to the inspector it's a gorgeous print that lets you really appreciate the work of director <UNK> and what he was able to accomplish with a very small budget add to that the acting talents of peter cushing christopher lee <UNK> elliott <UNK> <UNK> ingrid pitt and jon pertwee and you've got a movie that can be enjoyed again and again just don't answer the phone if anyone from <UNK> real estate calls to offer you a bargain on a beautiful house in the english <UNK>
<START> pointless boring film with charismatic <UNK> completely wasted released for a minute on a <UNK> in maybe one local cinema and avoided by the entire population of sydney except me and four others back of beyond is a project seemingly created by a producer looking for a <UNK> local actors like john <UNK> and terry <UNK> deserve better well <UNK> has <UNK> into a director of lame thrillers like <UNK> and hide and seek and terry <UNK> seems never to get a <UNK> apart from thug roles but paul <UNK> should have become one of <UNK> greatest <UNK> on screen roles like this are major <UNK> and films like this are just a waste of talent and time
<START> this was a fine example of how an interesting film can be made without using big stars and big effects just tell a true story about the struggles of two african american women over a <UNK> century br br this movie challenges us all to look at our own personal prejudices and see that people are people not white black etc br br good movie with a good message
<START> i found this film the first time when i was searching for some works in witch <UNK> <UNK> had participate still in an extraordinary <UNK> caused by the astonishingly beautiful <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in portuguese <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> i was searching for similar movies in the come of age line i found then <UNK> <UNK> a movie where the director <UNK> <UNK> deliciously <UNK> us <UNK> a nomination by the cannes festival in 2000 the story is about two guys the kind <UNK> next <UNK> mathieu <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who meet during the summer <UNK> in a land far from where he lives mathieu spends is days at the beach with his sister there he meets <UNK> a local with whom he starts this <UNK> and revealing relationship much by means of the sensual and <UNK> personality that <UNK> <UNK> gives his characters in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 6 years younger he still <UNK> the innocence of the sweet <UNK> witch <UNK> here in experience <UNK> in directing in the <UNK> sequence in the intimate and <UNK> description that is made about a boys first facing his still ambiguous sexuality and great love the first love in its terrible progression ecstasy despair the best of the film is the best of france the <UNK> passion the hot and excited <UNK> the <UNK> beauty the simple and natural acceptance made by the families although not without surprise and first anger still there is the beach the <UNK> the <UNK> e simplicity of summer the <UNK> of <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> s melody and the <UNK> eyes of an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hurt puzzled passionate the sex is not avoided nor exploited it is treated as it is with no <UNK> intention in virtue of pure talent this is a work of drama of <UNK> quality without cheap <UNK> showing an inevitably real image of two homosexual in their prime youth as any ordinary person although with a social fear of <UNK> and shame it is well worthy being seen especially by those who adore french movies although the dvd front cover is very lame with the two actors in between <UNK> of stars <UNK> with <UNK> a movie witch in my opinion deserves an 8 9
<START> don't drink the water is an unbelievably bad film it's based on a 1966 broadway play by woody allen it stars jackie <UNK> the comic genius behind the <UNK> the director howard morris has appeared in several mel brooks comedies life stinks high anxiety silent movie and has made a mark in animation characters he has voiced include <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and beetle <UNK> what went wrong br br i think the problem is that the premise is played out too seriously to work effectively allen's original play was tongue in cheek which is why it worked on broadway and in allen's 1994 remake the screenplay by r s allen and harvey <UNK> beats the premise to death and makes too many changes from the original play making <UNK> wife an <UNK> in this version when she was a <UNK> woman in the original is just one example of why this doesn't work br br the acting isn't much better <UNK> does the best he can with the material but he can't save this <UNK> was a comic genius but also a fine actor as he demonstrated in the hustler and soldier in the rain his <UNK> personality could have worked here but the lousy script doesn't even give him a chance too bad <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wife will drive you nuts after 20 minutes see how soon it'll take for you to want to <UNK> her that is also a shame because she is also a fine actress having turned in two exceptional performances in bonnie and clyde and rachel rachel none of the other actors do particularly well either br br woody allen hated this film so much that he remade the film in 1994 with himself and julie <UNK> <UNK> simpson in the leads they manage to hit all the right notes and the film itself is a comic masterpiece it's finally on video after a long battle over rights do go out and find that version all the 1969 original is good for is <UNK> out <UNK> guests who <UNK> their welcome br br 1 2 out of 4 stars
<START> there's only one thing i'm going to say about cat in the hat as a kids movie and a good comedy movie it sucks i lost track of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked but weren't exactly kid appropriate oh and by the way the way the cat in the hat talked was annoying as for the plot i completely forgot who cares it sucked anyway i'm not sure why mike myers joined but i think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in austin powers without the <UNK> talk and it overly succeeded but so what it was annoying don't see it it belongs in the bottom 100 the jokes are so <UNK> it's funny
<START> the <UNK> way to describe this movie is as a satire the target of the satire is quite vast from the us government to corporate america it is also not a <UNK> satire but rather a silly one br br think of this movie as a mix between the kentucky fried movie airplane and police squad series done with a much smaller budget and not as funny i can see how this movie is a satire of many sci fi disaster movies from the 50's and 60's i see this movie as a big influence on tim <UNK> mars attacks br br the plot is simple enough <UNK> <UNK> giant tomatoes go crazy and start attacking people and cities at first there is a cover up and then it blows over into full blown war br br the movie runs the gamut of characters and characterizations lois <UNK> a lois lane clone a very ambitious presidential press secretary clark kent mason dixon <UNK> agent who hasn't worked since the bay of pigs a useless president who only seems to be able to sign his name and attack new york an even inept <UNK> a sleazy marketing <UNK> and <UNK> team <UNK> of an <UNK> east german female <UNK> a <UNK> diver a crazed wwii <UNK> and an african american disguise expert disguised as george washington abraham lincoln hitler and finally as a <UNK> did i also forget to mention lots and lots of tomatoes there are all kinds of tomatoes from small tomatoes to giant plastic tomatoes to <UNK> tomatoes to <UNK> juice and finally to people dressed up as tomatoes br br on top of all this you have a couple of musical numbers as well they aren't that good and seem to be dubbed the best tune is by far the theme of the movie attack of the killer tomatoes it is way too catchy and you might end up <UNK> or singing it in public be warned br br most of the movie is quite amusing and shows the absurdity of various real life situations as well as various entertainment genres i don't believe i was induced to laughter but mostly <UNK> and <UNK> my head i definitely recommend this movie for fans of b and c grade movies but only as a rental br br celluloid <UNK>
<START> i would put this at the top of my list of films in the category of unwatchable trash there are films that are bad but the worst kind are the ones that are unwatchable but you are suppose to like them because they are supposed to be good for you the sex sequences so shocking in its day couldn't even <UNK> a rabbit the so called controversial politics is strictly high school <UNK> amateur night <UNK> the film is self <UNK> arty in the worst sense of the term the photography is in a harsh grainy black and white some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle even the sound is bad and some people call this art br br
<START> the creators of south park in their own film here this is a brilliant film with a huge entertainment factor if you like naked gun films and are not young and not too mature or serious on your humor you'll love this
<START> i am quite a fan of novelist screenwriter michael <UNK> his novel wonder boys became a fantastic movie by curtis <UNK> his masterful novel the amazing adventures of <UNK> and clay won the <UNK> prize a few years back and he had a hand in the script of spider man 2 arguably the greatest comic book movie of all time br br director <UNK> marshall <UNK> has also directed wonderful comedic pieces such as the gut <UNK> <UNK> and the genius short film series terry <UNK> office <UNK> and with a cast including peter <UNK> <UNK> miller nick nolte and <UNK> <UNK> this seems like a no <UNK> br br it is literally br br jon foster stars as art <UNK> the son of a mobster nolte who recently <UNK> with a degree in <UNK> jon is in a state of arrested development he works a minimum <UNK> job at book <UNK> has a vapid relationship with his girlfriend boss <UNK> <UNK> which amounts to little more than <UNK> amounts of sex with no plans other than to chip away at a career for which he has zero passion br br one night at a party an ex roommate introduces jon to jane miller a beautiful smart <UNK> later that night they go out for pie and she asks jon a question that begins to shake him from his <UNK> state of existence i want you to tell me something that you have never told a single soul if you do it will make this night <UNK> jon then tells her a <UNK> dream of his in which he wanders about town looking at the faces of strangers passing him by yet none of them look him in the eye i imagine it must be what death feels like he says br br the next day jane's wild boyfriend cleveland <UNK> kidnaps jon from work and takes him out to a <UNK> abandoned steel mill and soon jon cleveland and jane are spending every waking moment together going to punk rock <UNK> doing drugs and drinking lots of alcohol this doesn't sit well with <UNK> who pushes jon for a more personal relationship namely letting her meet his new friends and his father the film then attempts to take us on <UNK> journey as he shakes off the <UNK> <UNK> on him by his father <UNK> and his dead end job as he finds freedom and expression through his relationships with cleveland and jane br br there is a problem having us follow jon throughout the film he's completely uninteresting he has no ambitions passions or goals he walks through life like the invisible <UNK> he described to jane the night they met at the outset this isn't a problem but he never gets any more interesting he's a completely passive character he simply follows along the <UNK> cleveland and jane but he never once gives us any <UNK> as to what he cares about or wants to to do with himself br br consequently the film and its supporting characters have nowhere to go and little to do other than party have sex and get in arguments in other words much <UNK> about nothing what we have here is the shallow skin of a good movie without anything on the inside sweeping cinematography <UNK> voice over with characters staring off into the distance lots of sex scenes both straight and gay big arguments more angry sex a chase scene and a tragic death but it doesn't seem to matter ironically at one point jane confused at a number of <UNK> <UNK> actions asks him what's going on jon what is this all about yes jon do tell we in the audience are dying to know too br br the title the mysteries of <UNK> must refer to the characters themselves because that's what they are they are all <UNK> one dimensional stand ins for actual people the film never lets us in we never know what makes any of them <UNK> we see them do lots of things but we don't know why and the absence of why is one of the worst things a movie can have
<START> i had the <UNK> of watching holly at the <UNK> film festival last week what a powerful and moving story holly is a 12 <UNK> old <UNK> girl who is sold into prostitution by her own family and living in a <UNK> in cambodia patrick an american comes into <UNK> life and decides he wants to help her when holly is sold again patrick desperately <UNK> for her we follow they're difficult journey through cambodia and hope for their reunion br br holly is one of millions of children who are sold and <UNK> every day the movie portrays this difficult issue without crossing the line i walked away wanting to know more about the issue of child <UNK> and asking how can i help this movie should be seen by everyone because it is a beautiful story and it exposes an issue that we should no longer ignore
<START> this is not a profound movie most of the plot aspects are pretty predictable and tried and true but it was well acted and made some interesting points about what we might regret our mistakes as the movie calls them as we look back over our lives i had not read the book so didn't know much other than it was the story of a dying woman who has strong memories from long ago that she hasn't really shared with anyone thankfully they got a top notch cast meryl br br <UNK> daughter <UNK> <UNK> plays the young <UNK> and then meryl shows up at the end of the film as the old <UNK> in addition to an amazing resemblance duh the younger actress did a great job perhaps not quite up to her mom's caliber but who is all others in this film were fine although i wish there had been more of <UNK> close and thought the buddy character was <UNK> too dramatic br br this is more of a girls' movie than for the guys but a good one to see with your mom or your daughter and maybe start some dialog going how hard it is to really know a parent as a person
<START> quite possibly the worst movie that i have ever seen when has hollywood ever made a successful movie that attacked <UNK> why don't they learn the <UNK> chicks haven't these <UNK> live in their own elite bubble <UNK> among themselves oblivious to the fact that most of america is much further right than they are br br the best hollywood productions are not <UNK> and are rarely political at all br br dan <UNK> imitation of <UNK> was bad br br i would have thought <UNK> could have landed better movies br br it wasn't funny
<START> i read a couple of good reviews on this board for mr scarface but for anyone <UNK> in the genre of italian gangster films like myself the picture will probably make very little sense indeed after the initial setup involving the ten million <UNK> <UNK> the picture <UNK> into a fairly routine revenge flick with a minor twist in the identity of <UNK> al <UNK> character the whole gang war plot got <UNK> up for me with the inclusion of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but as most other viewers commented he's about the only one who gave this picture any life with his often <UNK> attempts at violence i found it somewhat unbelievable that <UNK> <UNK> who chased tony through the streets didn't actually stroke out before tony even laid a hand on them for all of his <UNK> as the title character jack palance was wasted rather <UNK> in an <UNK> near finale making the u s working title mr scarface rather <UNK> i've seen enough spaghetti westerns to know that they don't all work i guess in this case my first look at a spaghetti gangster flick didn't quite make it either
<START> the best part of an american in paris is the lengthy ballet sequence at the end where gene kelly and leslie caron are the living <UNK> of several major <UNK> kelly has earlier been established as a <UNK> artist in paris so the sequence is the logical ending to a musical <UNK> with life and energy gershwin tunes and cast members like georges <UNK> and oscar <UNK> kelly was at his best here it's a little different to <UNK> in the rain and the effect of all the film as one topped with the ballet gives it a definite wow factor no wonder the sequence ended <UNK> <UNK> after all other mgm musical highlights had gone by

<START> a beautiful new print of zabriskie point is playing in paris and seems to be doing well in the latin quarter it's time for a full <UNK> of the film let's hope that the new print means that a dvd with some insightful extras will be out in the near future br br i remember watching <UNK> when it came out and thought it was a crashing bore this time around i was totally <UNK> and would <UNK> it as a near miss masterpiece the first part of the movie is a time capsule of late <UNK> los angeles i lived there then and antonioni did a masterful job of capturing the essence of the place kudos to production designer dean <UNK> who found some incredible locations and did outstanding work br br the print i saw runs 1 hour 50 minutes it is forbidden to those under 16 or 18 i can't remember i suspect there is quite a bit of restored footage in this print spoiler i wonder how much of the desert sex scene was originally cut what appears today seems rather tame by current standards br br there is no soundtrack music until almost 1 hour into the film before we hear <UNK> noise such as radio <UNK> etc antonioni was very daring to do this i remember how much was made at the time of the lack of acting skills of non actors mark <UNK> and daria <UNK> this time <UNK> did not bother me <UNK> is weaker but gradually <UNK> as the film continues br br much of the student riot footage looks like stock footage to me one shot is in a different aspect ratio distorted by the wide screen of course there is actual staged footage but not all that much br br i'm still trying to figure out how antonioni did some of the shots of <UNK> flying the plane it looks like he really did some of the flying there's no blue screen or double in some shots br br i hope to get back to see the film a second time recommended highly to all antonioni fans
<START> how anyone can say this is bad is beyond me i loved this show before i even saw it for 3 reasons 1 the story intrigued me 2 jessica alba and 3 james cameron please ignore the bad comments and please watch the whole first season before you decide that it's bad because i know that if you watch the first season you will love it and go out and buy season 1 as well as season 2 on dvd and then join the campaign to get season 3 made br br i hate fox and i'm sure a lot of you dark angel fans hate them too they have a thing for <UNK> good shows don't you all agree
<START> i've always been enthusiastic about period dramas an art form in which the bbc has <UNK> in the past this presentation of byron was unbelievable unbelievably bad the script was dreadful the acting uninspired and all the characters woefully insipid apparently byron was mad bad and dangerous to know and set the ladies hearts all a <UNK> not in this production here he appeared as a <UNK> jumped up little <UNK> instead of a fiery hero of <UNK> and the greek struggle for independence it is said that byron walked with a limp this portrayal of the man was just limp all over br br i watched the whole two and a half hours waiting for something to spark into life not a <UNK> not even a <UNK> it was utter tedium if not downright boredom from start to finish br br having the opinion that no one will ever better the <UNK> of <UNK> i also believe that <UNK> poetry is over <UNK> and to my mind should be <UNK> on the back <UNK> and this <UNK> of his life should be <UNK> the same treatment br br i think the bbc lost its <UNK> with this one
<START> one of the most common entries in the <UNK> category is <UNK> though i'm beginning to believe that <UNK> and other goofs are more acceptable even ignored in very good films but are found front and center in rotten films kiss them for me is a rotten film and <UNK> of <UNK> yet when watching it closely i found almost nothing specifically <UNK> br br the shots of aircraft which <UNK> the film are certainly out of place the big 4 engine transport seen after the title <UNK> 1944 appears to be the post war c <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> colors the combat planes seen taking off from the <UNK> at the end are douglas <UNK> which entered service after ww2 and were made famous by their service in vietnam br br but <UNK> these two pieces of film and of course the <UNK> everything else is very possibly period authentic it just <UNK> so wrong i'm an admirer of stanley <UNK> we share the same birthday in his co directed on the town 1949 there is a car chase at the end with the police driving 1949 50 ford's yet there isn't the slightest feeling that this is out of place in a ww2 period film in fact as i reflected later there isn't anything which says that this is supposed to be a ww2 period film it just feels that way based on a wartime broadway musical which was based on a ballet fancy free which may have been based on the work of artist paul <UNK> the <UNK> in 1934 its a great film about sailors on a 24 hour pass in new york and so heavy with wartime <UNK> its merely assumed it takes place during the war and yet these contemporary cars do nothing to break the spell br br the first problem is old cary grant though far too old to represent a navy <UNK> dive <UNK> pilot it is a hollywood tradition for stars like grant gary cooper lou <UNK> jimmy stewart charles <UNK> to play younger it was the role which he is miscast in not his age he plays an <UNK> as they used to call them a guy who gets things done and breaks all the rules while doing it yet remains admired and loved for it a hustler a <UNK> dealer a de <UNK> character in a service comedy grant is the comic center of what is after all supposed to be a service comedy which is <UNK> to his comedy style br br thinking back on the great grant comic performances like bringing up baby 1938 or <UNK> and old <UNK> 1944 and he is the great <UNK> whose comedy is to be reduced by his context from dignity to a <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> in kiss them he is expected to be the comic spark plug which just isn't him people had already been exposed to the type most recently to comic phil <UNK> as sgt <UNK> on television the role would be <UNK> later by james garner but here grant just isn't funny and appears to be a bully getting his way by <UNK> pushing his cary <UNK> rather than <UNK> and <UNK> br br but the thing which really stinks the place up with <UNK> is the lead women there can be no more <UNK> 50s women than <UNK> parker and <UNK> <UNK> they are unique to the decade marilyn monroe can be placed in a <UNK> with carole lombard and marie wilson and any number of dumb <UNK> and grace kelly was another high class dame think of mary <UNK> but there never could have been an <UNK> exaggerated woman in films like <UNK> sure there were the <UNK> girls' e g <UNK> turner of ww2 but <UNK> was <UNK> the point <UNK> parker was the model who <UNK> the model business who changed the <UNK> like poses to become the first natural girl who moved and whose personality was captured by the camera see funny face 1957 also by stanley <UNK> br br of course in high 50s style there seems to be a lot of gender mixing at <UNK> parties but never even a hint of sex think of the 50s tv shows bachelor father or the bob <UNK> show where dinner <UNK> men returned from <UNK> alone the original book which i haven't read was published during the war and appeared as a play on broadway at the end of the war and the nuances of the situation must have been <UNK> for contemporary readers and audiences but broken down <UNK> and <UNK> a dozen years later and <UNK> miscast it remains a once forgotten <UNK> on otherwise <UNK> careers until the invention of the vcr and cable television <UNK> this <UNK> turkey br br so the lesson here is whatever the <UNK> it will be ignored in a great film like citizen kane who actually hears charles foster kane say <UNK> and <UNK> in fun dreck like <UNK> why were the robots given live <UNK> in the first place but absolutely <UNK> in a rotten film even if the goofs are really non existent
<START> what can i say i ignored the reviews and went to see it myself damn the reviews were so right what a waste of money considering it's budget br br good thing i went to see kill bill after this one br br to see a really scary movie would be <UNK> br br bottom line i like girl in gold boots better than this crap
<START> what happens when an army of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> eastern european <UNK> gather their forces south of the border gary busey kicks their <UNK> of course another laughable example of reagan era cultural <UNK> <UNK> wastes a decent supporting cast headed by l q jones and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i just saw this at the toronto film festival and i hope it gets wide release because i want to see it again it is a character driven film and andrew and david are more than up to the task any discussion of the plot might be br br considered spoilers so i'll just say that the storyline is clever the acting is superb and the effects are amazing well filmed and well paced too one of the best films i have seen in ages and very refreshing in this summer of dreary br br movies it had the audience laughing the whole time see it if you can i particularly liked the candy bar candy bar scene
<START> man if anyone was expecting a great zombie movie after reading that title then you are a <UNK> and you deserve to be disappointed as for myself i was expecting a low budgeted <UNK> zombie flick and that's exactly what i got i wasn't disappointed at all i thought it was a cool little movie the zombies were exactly as they should be because all of the zombies had just been turned so they are <UNK> undead zombies obviously they did that because it would've been pretty <UNK> if they had done full on <UNK> zombie fx i understood the whole thing i have no idea how anyone could seriously <UNK> this movie it's called hood of the living dead for the love of god would you watch redneck zombies and any uwe boll movie and actually expect it to be great of course not so why there are some morons on imdb whining like school girls about this movie i'll never understand oh and yes there are worse movies out there so stop saying that this was the worst you've ever seen 'cause you know you're full of it you ever watch <UNK> or <UNK> or house of the dead those are some of the worst i've ever seen if you can't see that it's just a low budgeted zombie movie obviously made by zombie movie fans then <UNK> wrong with you i just had fun with it thumbs up from me and i'd also like to see a sequel
<START> first off i must admit that both films i've seen by this director i saw without titles and so may have missed the points my czech isn't bad but having sat through two of his films i wish i hadn't even tried to learn <UNK> is too cool way too cool it's about ten different story lines that <UNK> in and out together that's not so deeply unusual in a town the size of <UNK> tiny really the main characters are between 20 and 30 they've got jobs and only one studies the best character is the young <UNK> girl her sentiments are <UNK> by immigrants here every damn day that's about it the only great character everyone else is making their own lives hell quite on their own how can i <UNK> with such obvious incompetence perhaps there are interesting bits with japanese tourists but do i need another stereotype in film if you like alright music see this film if you want to laugh at <UNK> stupidity see this film if you like irony and dry humor see an original <UNK> not an imitation and under no circumstances see <UNK> film <UNK> <UNK> that is unless you enjoy <UNK> stereotypes
<START> i thought maybe a film which <UNK> a cast including peter o'toole <UNK> york michael craig harry andrews might be worth watching alas i was wrong utter pretentious nonsense from beginning to end with both o'toole and york overacting wildly i watched it twice and still have no idea what is was about i've a feeling o'toole plays the <UNK> of a scottish castle who has a drink problem and likes <UNK> childhood games with his sister york he is also <UNK> mad but apart from that your guess is as good as mine br br the film has no redeeming feature whatsoever i can only assume the cast and director were <UNK> into making this dreary unimaginative <UNK> <UNK> clearly a waste of the time of a talented cast and director <UNK>
<START> this is a great movie for any fan of hong kong action movies <UNK> from it's little plot the weak drama and bits of comedy antics the movie is action packed with gun fighting and martial arts action kept me entertained from beginning until the end i thought shannon lee was awesome in the movie br br having an action director like corey <UNK> is what keeps hong kong action going strong this modern action film is highly recommended
<START> despite being a sequel to the more potent original this is more of a comical remake of friday the 13th concerning the further antics of <UNK> angela killing more <UNK> teens for their <UNK> at a camp br br pamela <UNK> sister of bruce looks great there are some pretty darn funny sex scenes with some pretty darn attractive girls but the movie's so unintentionally comedic rather than suspenseful it's a stinker br br out of br br mpaa rated r for graphic violence and gore nudity and for some sexuality language and drug use
<START> that's the question you have to ask yourself when you watch this movie what was the point this movie was nothing but an hour and a half of confusion with completely unlikable people not going to use the word actors and a script that you could tell didn't exist br br one of the things that made me laugh the most about this movie was how it said victorian story written by which means that there was actually a script to that part of the story the entire victorian section had no dialogue and was just comprised of shots of a guy staring at a girl and vice versa making that part of the movie as scripted as a camera left on at a train station br br ok time for the story it starts out with a guy sitting in a chair never once getting out of it oh <UNK> who needs you these <UNK> come to his house and practically beg him to tell this story about these dead girls so he starts off the story in victorian times and here's how the scene goes guy and girl are in a field pretty music starts to play guy stares at girl girl stares at guy guy stares at girl cut back to movie that's pretty much all that happens for about half the movie br br the rest of the film is incredibly awkward dialogue about a bunch of models wanting to buy an apartment so this real estate agent shows them one and when i say the dialogue is awkward i mean if it were a dancer it would trip during the <UNK> none of the characters in this movie are likable the models are incredibly irritating the victorian people don't talk and the guy telling the story has the personality of a sack of <UNK> so eventually all the girls get killed off and by killed off i mean drug <UNK> <UNK> you showed one death and by death i mean holding her face till they put the blood makeup on awesome br br how this guy even knows this story <UNK> me he says it's because he saw it but how there was no guy in that apartment the door was locked shut with no way out the windows were attached to a fire escape that was too rotten to work how the hell did he see all that oh plot holes we do love you so the movie finishes up with the <UNK> saying i think you made it up you're wasting our time despite the fact that she <UNK> him for the interview in the first place whatever this movie was stupid pointless and made no sense with a lot of plot holes i could go on and on about this movie but i don't see the need i'd much rather spend my time doing something <UNK> like <UNK> something <UNK> <UNK> more belongs in <UNK> with 2 dumb models out of 10
<START> of life in some <UNK> of course there were artistic <UNK> taken but some of what you saw in this film go on in some <UNK> br br i went to <UNK> in southern california where the races pretty much hang around with their own it's funny because these are schools that want racial <UNK> <UNK> etc and i can honestly say that it's there but the thing is when class lets out or when they're just hanging out waiting for class they students seem to just hang around with people of their own race or <UNK> is that bad not really everyone needs a feeling of <UNK> but like the school paper of one of the schools i attended once wrote about that we should all try to hang around with students of other <UNK> and try to know them otherwise you're creating your own <UNK> br br racism certainly existed in one of those schools i attended one time someone put <UNK> around campus talking about the <UNK> of the <UNK> race and had the symbols of some of those racist <UNK> fortunately nothing happened like the incident in the movie where the young <UNK> man went off and started shooting at a <UNK> gathering br br i can only hope and pray that nothing like that ever will happen br br so is higher learning overly dramatic exaggerated maybe is it way off mark it depends on where you went to or go to school the race thing where the <UNK> just hang around with their own does happen minus the hollywood <UNK> the race thing hit pretty close to home for me
<START> 9 11 is a classic example of cinema <UNK> a sort of <UNK> documentary in this case of new york <UNK> as they battle against one of the most extraordinary events of world history it's all tiny <UNK> hand held video cameras often betrayed by the poor quality of most of the filming and by the director <UNK> hand frequently <UNK> the screen br br in this film you get to know most of the <UNK> tony <UNK> the rookie or <UNK> in ny <UNK> <UNK> the fire chief joseph pfeiffer who finds he's lost his brother later on and a few others there are studio interviews with most of these people throughout the film just to <UNK> the personal <UNK> nature of the events the build up is quite dramatic and well done particularly the passing out ceremony at the fire department with a few useful <UNK> pans and a sort of <UNK> editing of the rather limited <UNK> just like rob <UNK> a few good men tony looks proud br br the viewpoint and camera angle is usually from amidst the <UNK> which is interesting and there is some excellent footage from inside the <UNK> of <UNK> while pfeiffer and his team plan what to do next this is classic cinema <UNK> there is also the <UNK> haunting sound of the occasional human body crashing against the <UNK> outside it is then that an increasingly <UNK> fire chief pfeiffer realises that his task is desperate and probably hopeless and this is before <UNK> <UNK> you have to give credit to <UNK> for knowing which faces to film and at which moment br br the sound of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is so awfully sad poignant and terrifying that you realise what an ordeal this is for the <UNK> from the <UNK> it looks feels and sounds like the end of the world and the poor <UNK> look so utterly <UNK> and frightened you hear an enormous <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> like that of a giant <UNK> beast slowly falling to the ground after being so <UNK> wounded the <UNK> tower has <UNK> yet the fire team remaining in <UNK> are oblivious to this event where is the communication br br this film is captivating yet the narration is amateurish and should have been avoided <UNK> like <UNK> really was a day like no <UNK> or <UNK> frequently banal <UNK> like <UNK> could see fear in everybody's <UNK> and 'i knew tony was freaking <UNK> the film is really just one long video diary there are no pictures from higher up the building where some of the <UNK> have gone imagine this film <UNK> with <UNK> footage from some of the rooms higher up or some of the news coverage from the day the effect would be greater you could even combine this story with that of mayor <UNK> and perhaps the famous <UNK> rick <UNK> who literally was many floors up acting the hero br br i don't see much of a propaganda element in this film as some reviewers suggest this film is no triumph of the will by <UNK> some time later the <UNK> <UNK> the american flag over a nearby surviving building <UNK> what has become ground zero so what br br there are also some moments of dubious <UNK> for example who is holding the camera when the two <UNK> brothers are reunited back at the fire station is it staged br br there is an excellent finish very much in the <UNK> of the excellent french director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with two <UNK> of light reflected in the water <UNK>
<START> i saw this at the mill valley film festival hard to believe this is ms <UNK> directorial debut it is beautifully paced and performed large cast of characters could be out of an anne tyler novel i e they are layered with back story and potential <UNK> there are no false notes surprising bursts of humor amidst self inflicted anxiety and very real if not earth shattering <UNK> if you saw the best of youth you will recognize how well drawn the characters are through small moments even as the story moves <UNK> along i really hope this gets distribution in the usa i live in a fairly sophisticated film market yet we rarely get swedish films of any kind
<START> i liked this movies its a another <UNK> raj film which you know will look good on screen all character are always nice or very nice with one exception who you know will eventually <UNK> to being nice another rule of <UNK> <UNK> film is that either hero or heroine s have only one or none parent think back to all of those films <UNK> <UNK> didn't have mom <UNK> salman didn't have parents and final rule is that you are 90 likely to see <UNK> <UNK> crying br br the film is good too its a bit slow at first but keeps you entertained there is almost no comedy but it does make you smile often enough the little kid hero's nephew is well placed and deliver very good one liners the actress is very pretty but shy you wouldn't get that in real life this film doesn't have <UNK> big happy families living in big house which i <UNK> was a good idea and allowed the film to be <UNK> from other films there will be lots of women crying at the end of the film there isn't a strong message from this film but its a good watch if you are married arranged marriage the film will remind you of what you went through and if you are not it will inform and may be scare you br br overall a very good looking film no big plots or twists but a very gentle film very much like bollywood classic
<START> this show comes up with interesting locations as fast as the travel channel it is billed as reality but in <UNK> it is pure prime time soap opera it's tries to use exotic locales as a <UNK> to bring people into a phony contest then proceeds to hook viewers on the contestants soap opera style br br it also borrows from an early cbs game show <UNK> beat the clock by <UNK> situations for its contestants to try overcome then it <UNK> the winner money if they can spice it up with a little interaction between the characters even better while the game format is in slow motion versus beat the clock the real accomplishment of this series is to escape reality br br this show has elements of several types of successful past programs reality television hardly but if your hooked on the contestants locale or contest this is your cup of tea if your not this entire series is as i say drivel dripping with <UNK> it is another show hiding behind the reality label which is the trend it started in 2000 br br it is slick well produced so it might last a while yet after all so do re runs of <UNK> island green <UNK> the beverly <UNK> the brady bunch this just doesn't employ professional actors the intelligence level is about the same
<START> lisa is a hotel manager or owner and she gets on a flight to miami she ends up sitting next to an assassin named jackson who tells her that she has to switch a room of a family or her father dies the reason she has to switch the room is because jackson wants to blow it up br br it's a great suspense movie because lisa tries several ways to escape this <UNK> that jackson has set up the whole storyline is great and i thought that they could have spent some more time on the plane there could have more to the plane but other than that the whole movie was pretty good br br i especially liked the ending because it was heart stopping i didn't know what was going to happen and i was surprised by it for me this movie just took off
<START> this is a wonderful movie in a lot of ways everyone in my family enjoyed it the animation is excellent and easily demonstrates that there are plenty of producers who create films that are as visually brilliant as anything that comes from the disney studio br br one difference from the normal disney fare is that this <UNK> movie does not feature some wise cracking side kick for comedy relief and there are no sudden moments where the characters break into song i am sure that a scene at the beginning of the film would not appear in a disney picture the birth of spirit but it is done <UNK> and is not offensive at all spirit was a great breath of fresh air don't get me wrong i have loved disney for years and will continue to do so br br spirit is another example of great animated fare as soon as it was over my kids wanted to watch it again i had the same feeling i thoroughly recommend it
<START> the film is based on <UNK> heroic lines that inspire hollywood's biggest movie 1939 out of the <UNK> rhythm of <UNK> most famous 85 lines rises a picture that will become known as the one great movie of the year big on the score of its <UNK> in battle its war elephants its <UNK> <UNK> its terror <UNK> thugs and <UNK> mountains of india the picture is bigger still in its scope and <UNK> is thrill and action but biggest biggest of all in the life <UNK> through three gary grant victor <UNK> and douglas fairbanks jr roaring reckless <UNK> sons of the <UNK> <UNK> men who <UNK> its mighty scenes in the flesh and blood of high adventure it's a honest film of it all that makes gunga din a new experience in entertainment joan fontaine <UNK> her against the <UNK> <UNK> three the romance between fontaine and fairbanks jr <UNK> through dangerous days and nights of terror in a land where anything can happen the motion picture has thrills for a thousand movies <UNK> for one mighty show it's a fabulous furious and far <UNK> adventure with the red blood and <UNK> heroes who rise from the <UNK> mystery of india and storm the screen with the <UNK> rousing <UNK> life thunder of men who fight for the love of it and love for the fun of it the pictures is interpreted for the brave and <UNK> gary grant who rounded hundred villains thugs and the mean guru <UNK> <UNK> grant shouts you're under arrest besides is the heroic water man sam <UNK> who <UNK> colonel <UNK> love says of him you're a better man than i am gunga din
<START> i've really enjoyed this adaptation of emma i have seen it many times and am always looking forward to seeing it again though it only lasts <UNK> minutes most of the novel plot and sub plots were developed in a satisfactory way all the characters are well portrayed most of the dialogues come directly from the novel with no silly jokes added as in emma <UNK> sense and sensibility br br as a <UNK> i particularly appreciate the perfect <UNK> of the actors the setting and costumes were beautiful i find this version quite on a par with the 1995 miniseries pride and prejudice but then the producer and screenwriter were the same kate beckinsale did a really good job portraying emma of whom jane austen said she would create a heroin no one but her would love she is <UNK> but has just enough youth and <UNK> to be still likable mark strong was also very good at portraying mr knightley not an easy part i think though he has not the charisma shown by colin <UNK> mr <UNK> in pride and prejudice even the end scene the <UNK> festival which does not happen in the novel provides a fitting end except for when it shows emma being cold and almost unpleasant with frank <UNK> whereas in the novel she was thoroughly <UNK> with him even telling him that she would have enjoyed the <UNK> had she been in his situation a strange departure from the <UNK> otherwise shown throughout the film i find the costumes more beautiful and elaborate than in other adaptations from jane <UNK> novels
<START> i can only echo the praise of the other reviews here it's a delightful film with a <UNK> factor that it achieves without crossing the line into <UNK> sentimentality naturally sweet no added sugar br br one small point it seems to me that the mild <UNK> raised about <UNK> character <UNK> being able to walk in and defeat the system security ignore the fact that <UNK> is clearly a genius <UNK> at this sort of thing yes the film was pretty computer illiterate but it did show <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at his flat and i believe the <UNK> was supposed to be that his gifts allowed him to simply <UNK> the whole subject practically overnight br br there were a few odd moments when it appeared in some scenes that <UNK> was trying to test <UNK> knowledge and call his <UNK> i'm not sure whether we were supposed to believe that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his way out of these situations or whether he was actually <UNK> enough to pass the <UNK> it was a little unclear br br certainly he had to know enough to set up the <UNK> accounts presumably <UNK> and ustinov were relying on their own rather <UNK> notion of how computers worked in those days and in order to understand in detail what they were getting at it's necessary to know quite what their concept was they knew there was something about <UNK> which was important they thought that the <UNK> <UNK> could actually control security rather than just indicate its state they thought that the dumb user <UNK> features would strongly influence what could be done on the <UNK> itself though apart from things like graphics feature i don't see it <UNK> br br mostly i think they tried to avoid the subject of actual computer <UNK> as far as they could and they did that rather well allowing them a bit of artistic license i don't think their efforts had any flaws worthy of note br br cd
<START> this is one of those movies that you wish you hadn't seen before so you could see it again for the first time van <UNK> books still bring pleasure but are <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by many this movie is by far the best film adaptation of his works william powell is william powell say no more the plot is intricate the story moves all too quickly because you want it to last enjoy
<START> okay sorry but i loved this movie i just love the whole 80's genre of these kind of movies because you don't see many like this one anymore i want to ask all of you people who say this movie is just a rip off or a cheesy imitation what is it imitating i've never seen another movie like this one well not horror anyway br br basically its about the popular group in school who like to make <UNK> lives living hell so they decided to pick on this nerdy boy named marty it turns fatal when he really gets hurt from one of their little pranks br br so its like 10 years later and the group of friends who hurt marty start getting high school reunion letters but they are the only ones receiving them so they return back to the old school and one by one get knocked off by yeah you probably know what happens br br the only part that disappointed me was the very end it could have been left off or thought out better br br i think you should give it a try and try not to be to critical br br <UNK>
<START> really enjoyed this little movie it's a moving film about struggle sacrifice and especially the bonds of friendship between different peoples the child actor who plays <UNK> is especially good there's so many large scale <UNK> films set around ww2 that this convincingly told little story is a real break from the norm and an original one at that i'll also add that this film is far from boring very far of course the horses are wonderful and the scenery breathtaking to anyone who really treats their animal as part of the family i do you'll find this film especially rewarding recommended to movie fans who look for something a little different
<START> i actually like the original and this film has its ups and downs here's just a few br br ups most of the original voice cast returned br br downs i didn't like the voice of <UNK> ma i know she did a voice in the simpsons but that show is just plain stupid br br ups we get to see <UNK> as a teenager br br downs they wasted it with a slug <UNK> contest between timon and <UNK> br br ups it was <UNK> who told timon about <UNK> <UNK> br br downs how did pumbaa find out about it br br ups songs again some of the original songs were there but they were just background music br br downs but stupid songs a k a <UNK> solo br br overall this is a pretty good movie i'd recommend it for fans of the original but if you don't like the original chances are you won't like this one br br my score 7 10
<START> the unborn is a pretty good low budget horror movie <UNK> the fears associated with <UNK> it's very well acted by the always good brooke adams and b movie <UNK> james karen although the supporting cast is pretty average for a b <UNK> the music by gary <UNK> of all people is good too henry <UNK> script is quite intelligent for this sort of thing although there is a hint of <UNK> about it <UNK> <UNK> direction is merely adequate and there are some unnecessary cheap scares if you're a fan of adams whose movie career is nowhere near as <UNK> as it should be check it out she's great as always
<START> i have to say i quite enjoyed soldier russell was very good as this trained psychopath <UNK> his humanity very watchable and nowhere near as bad as i'd been led to believe yes it has problems but provides its share of entertainment
<START> this is an interesting series that takes real life people jesse james john wesley <UNK> etc and <UNK> part of their real story with a continuing series character taking part in that story <UNK> detective matt clark takes a role in tracking down famous <UNK> from the old west in stories that are at least partly based on the true accounts in that sense it's almost an anthology series and as someone else pointed out this odd structure poses some <UNK> conflicts with the real events but it's a fun series with plenty of action to satisfy a western hungry 1950's audience and it still holds up pretty well <UNK> years later clark cuts a powerful figure in his western gear as he goes up against some of <UNK> <UNK> baddies and his girl sidekick frankie is quite a dish if you're a western fan be sure to check it out if you have a chance

<START> the second attempt by a new york intellectual in less than 10 years to make a swedish film the first being susan <UNK> brother carl which was made in sweden with swedish actors no less the results oscar <UNK> said it best in reference to <UNK> the old curiosity shop one would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at the death of little <UNK> pretty much the same thing here interiors is chock full of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i'm afraid of my anger looking into the middle distance i don't like who i'm becoming the directorial <UNK> to use a polite term from bergman are close to parody the incredibly self involved family keep reminding us of how brilliant and talented they are to the point of <UNK> i read a poem of yours the other day it was in i don't know the new <UNK> oh that was an old poem i <UNK> it far from not caring about these people however i found them quite hilarious much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from allen's earlier films only he's directed his actors to play the lines straight having not cast himself in the movie he has poor mary beth hurt copy all of his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and neurotic <UNK> turning her into an embarrassing surrogate much like kenneth branagh in celebrity br br the basic plot dysfunctional family with quietly <UNK> mother seems to be lifted more or less from <UNK> winter light the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst it all comes through in the <UNK> visual <UNK> tricks the <UNK> scratching of a <UNK> on paper the <UNK> surf that <UNK> the people walking on the beach etc etc br br allen's later serious films are less embarrassing but also far less entertaining i'll take interiors <UNK> rarely made a funnier movie
<START> steven seagal how could you be a part of such an awful film i rented this movie because your movies usually have been pretty clean i have lost a lot of respect for you being in an awful movie such as this one very very poor taste i am embarrassed that i even rented this movie steven if you keep acting in movies like this one i believe that your career is over my husband and i have enjoyed watching many of your movies because you always can get the bad guy with a few hand <UNK> and make it clean and also the language is pretty clean in your movies but this one is something else i will think twice before i rent another movie of yours
<START> esther williams gets her first post mgm starring role and gets off br br to a good start this film is a well acted entertaining suspense br br with a mature theme that would be repeated a million times more br br in the future innocent girl stalked creepy woman <UNK> esther br br looks great and if she wanted to probably could have gone on to br br do more and better films but according to her autobiography br br pretty much gave up working for marriage either way she is so br br likable and engaging that its fun to see her in a totally different role br br outside of the <UNK> <UNK> universal was fabulous for br br making films with former mgm stars after that studio began br br dropping its biggest names as it began to slide down hill stars br br like <UNK> turner june <UNK> and others got to make quality first br br rate films at universal as they obviously still had drawing power at br br the box office i wish esther had made more but since she didnt it br br makes this one all the more special
<START> ok i admit i watched this movie on mystery science theater 3000 which i am a huge fan of but i am not one of those people who automatically gives an mst3k movie a 1 10 rating although i hate many of the movies they play and some are among of the worst movies i've ever seen i have actually been able to enjoy some mst3k movies that being said this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen it is no wonder in fact that the mst3k writers themselves commented that this one was one of the worst don't believe me check out their site br br to me this movie is a good example of what not to do in filmmaking the dialogue is very bad the acting is worse the cinematography is pathetic the direction while perhaps being the best thing in this movie is bad br br the pacing is the worst part in this movie a few times in this movie the viewer had to wait literally minutes for something to happen while minutes may not sound like a very long amount of time it can be in a movie particularly in this one i'm sure it was meant to create a mood but i was just very bored it truly felt like ten minutes br br if suspension of disbelief means almost falling asleep during a movie then this has plenty of that but the screaming skull is just so horrible there is no way i could have possibly even gotten interested in anything that was actually going on in the film and thus the suspension of disbelief was indeed non <UNK> br br one of the worst and probably the most boring movie i've ever seen br br 1 10
<START> pretty crazy <UNK> featuring an all black cast trying to figure out who murdered the <UNK> <UNK> player who was just about to go to hollywood to make it big was it his wife his girlfriend his would be girlfriend her father his butler the newspaper guy who knows and who cares the result of this is just a little <UNK> and the actors here don't really get me in a mood to care one way or another finding out why snake <UNK> as a weapon who knows who cares the music in this is alright but there's little of it and most of it is pretty let's get this over with this isn't worthy of your time there are better all black casted movies out there
<START> the bank <UNK> chaplin the bank was one of charlie's <UNK> <UNK> films while these group of films are more watchable than their <UNK> counterparts this one seems a bit below average the gag with the <UNK> double <UNK> locked vault and the tough luck ending that has charlie waking up from a dream in which he is <UNK> the lead <UNK> hair only to be <UNK> the head of a <UNK> he had used as a quasi <UNK> are both classic chaplin moments they are both ironically the beginning and the end the middle is filled in with fighting with the rival co worker janitor and <UNK> up a bank robbery to win the girl the <UNK> is probably the greatest physical prop of this movie and charlie uses it to expert comedic effect whether while it is the intention of his character or not the <UNK> seems to be charlie's alter ego doing things he wishes he could do but wouldn't with his own two hands interesting stuff but there's better
<START> <UNK> from outer space is a short foreign film about black gay aliens who explore the galaxy until they stumble upon earth being gay their goal is to have a male only universe in which all people are gay hence when they discover women or female creatures live on earth they are at first terrified eventually they decide to eliminate all women on the planet and <UNK> the male population br br an offensive title with a racist <UNK> and sexist storyline albeit probably intended as a satire give this film some shock value however there's little substance underneath as another reviewer pointed out there are few jokes besides the characters' names <UNK> <UNK> i think i laughed once at one small gay joke i think i got the point of the film quickly a satire of bad science fiction but after that i had had enough i kept wanting the film to end already and it is a short film not brilliant or particularly well written
<START> if you liked blair with you'll like this one it has the same lousy camera work and soundtrack and it has the same non existent plot and suspenseful moments br br it also has tom <UNK> so if you like romero's dawn of the dead or tarantino and <UNK> from <UNK> till dawn you're in for a treat he is an icon and a very good actor as well br br no seriously this movie is definitely the <UNK> movie i've seen in a long time and i've seen quite a few movies bad ones as well i can tell you that i find most horror movies entertaining in some respect but this was just a pure waste of time br br the only reason why i gave this movie 2 instead of 1 was the naked chicks and the hot action with all the sharp looking plastic teeth no i'm just kidding i must have missed before i hit submit on the vote form br br stay away even though it has sexy girls with teeth on the cover
<START> sandler is amazing again i have already become a sandler fan this movie is the saddest sandler story its expression is fantastic i cried more watching click but there are some similar points to consider the value of the family before losing it and to be able to say 'i love <UNK> are a few of the most impressive truths in life it is tough it is real and actually there is a real owner of this success <UNK> i don't think another director could give these emotions in such a way br br cheadle and <UNK> are also amazing cheadle is one of my favorites since crash don't expect laughing or much positive atmosphere if you are ready to face the realities of life don't miss this movie
<START> definitely a very good idea screenplay was just ok could have been better the <UNK> are that it doesn't bore you if you're an adventure lover a new idea about the lost world of atlantis <UNK> are that i personally feel that this idea had so much more potential than this they should've ended up with a better adventure than this it wasn't bad at all but it would have been much better with some more runtime enjoyed it a lot though cant say that it was boring or wasn't good a good one for the people who like adventure animations like <UNK> like the road to el <UNK> this movie is also recommended for people looking for a nice little adventure with a very nice happy ending
<START> very funny to watch <UNK> island as kind of natural trash film it is like answer to jess <UNK> type of b movie <UNK> strikes back face to face to <UNK> the very very very stupid strike action unbelievably bad directed firing shooting scenes look even better than hand to hand fighting chasing scenes ridiculous saving <UNK> scenes incredibly stupid erotic scenes are very <UNK> the main luck of film is pretty landscapes and festival scenes don't miss arnold <UNK> joke at start of film and list of franco <UNK> <UNK> at the end special attraction naked <UNK> <UNK> forgot franco can sing
<START> <UNK> james stewart and walter brennan take their herd from seattle to <UNK> and on into canada to stake a claim once there they have to <UNK> with seductive <UNK> <UNK> ruth roman and ice cold happy go lucky villain james mcintire br br john wayne may get talked about more but his good pal stewart made some excellent hard edged westerns too some with the great director anthony mann frankly i'd take this with it's <UNK> action sequences and fine melodrama over north to <UNK> any day br br the far country features some breathtaking scenery and cinematography that should definitely have been shot in widescreen br br also there's some strong support by the always reliable brennan roman who's great the incredibly cute <UNK> <UNK> and james mcintire who plays one of my favorite types of bad guy the kind that doesn't take himself too seriously br br this would make a great double bill with another highly recommended mann stewart <UNK> set western bend of the river
<START> it's here finally a movie comes out that i can honestly say is worse than larry the cable guy health inspector yet i'm willing to bet the the <UNK> brothers hilarious will make more money than i ever make in my whole life on what is sure to be one of the top five worst films of all time outside of my fifth grade outside the class re <UNK> of romeo and juliet i mean really why would anyone ever ever see this movie unless they were paid to the comedy is weak and all even remotely funny jokes from the flimsy plot were surely revealed in commercials final word is this movie was a terrible letdown for me and the commercials looked so promising
<START> i loved dan in real life a wonderful journey to love story like you've got mail or while you were sleeping but not ridiculously full of sight gags and crude jokes and not so romantic it makes you wanna throw up br br dan burns steven <UNK> is a popular advice <UNK> who can't seem to get things in his own life <UNK> out until one day on a family gathering trip he meets and instantly <UNK> with marie the always beautiful juliette <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> of a woman who seems to be framed in a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> back to the <UNK> of classic cinema chemistry happens over a cup of tea and <UNK> but marie must be off for a previous engagement and they must part ways br br later we are treated to <UNK> tight <UNK> fun loving relatives who not only have big <UNK> together but also enjoy using the intelligent and <UNK> <UNK> dan as the butt of many bachelor jokes what i liked so much was that although the family's characteristics could be seen as obnoxious to some i thought it was a great portrayal of a big family that doesn't venture into parody or crude exaggeration the burns family is simply a close loving group of people who are truly interested in the best for dan there are wonderfully awkward family moments that aren't unrealistic the family is <UNK> but never mean spirited or <UNK> quirky but never outlandish br br and then dan falls in love with his brother's girlfriend he's brought to the family gathering and thus begins a roller coaster of restrained longing and funny love budding br br i could go on but i just thought this movie was simply awesome it's not particularly hip or clever never too <UNK> and obsessed with dry humor or biting wit as many comedies are in modern cinema there is a nice balance of storytelling visuals and funny but real dialogue in fact early in the movie the initial spark of love begins with whimsical discussion in a classic hollywood style conversation where the characters say what they're thinking out loud br br so i've probably <UNK> and repeated myself but i highly recommend dan in real life it's a great date movie trust me you'll laugh and only if you're a geek like me you'll get a bit <UNK> eyed filled with fun and magical love dan in real life won't disappoint br br 3 5 out of 4 stars grade a
<START> there is a really good movie lurking just beneath the surface of the layers upon layers of cheese that is the <UNK> br br i found this out when i watched this again this morning after <UNK> it for years and years i remember hating it with a passion when it first came out but this time i found that the special effects are quite good the plot is just the <UNK> story with a creativity <UNK> but it's an okay little flick for anyone who just wants some really awesome eye candy the animation is amazing and i especially liked how the animators let their characters look and act a bit more <UNK> than the norm i'm giving it a grade of three as i would have given it a two just for parody value if i had ever decided to watch this movie expecting it to absolutely blow my mind story wise
<START> as i saw the movie i was really shocked to see what the 60's was about i know i may be wrong about some things but it seemed like the 60's really had an effect on people of the time some people said they would want to go back to the 60's from what i saw i would say yes for the excitement and no for the outcome but that's my opinion
<START> leonard <UNK> must've been watching some other movie though i find his guide to be quite a valuable <UNK> please disregard his comments on this one he states starts off well then <UNK> when it's really the reverse starts off tepid then catches fire the plot is about as simple as it gets happy mom happy dad and happy son take a vacation at an isolated beach dad <UNK> in accident mom runs off to get help meets up with dangerous escaped convict mom tries to trick convict into helping while dad waits and hangs on for dear life br br good white <UNK> given an electric <UNK> by ralph <UNK> appearing suddenly the director john <UNK> films it in a clever way that will make you gasp around halfway through as the cunning desperate criminal <UNK> is an unusually <UNK> reckless actor at least here and in the classic kiss me deadly and he happily <UNK> the keys to the film's narrative and <UNK> off with the top down his character has a habit of <UNK> <UNK> and saying pretty neat huh when he's especially pleased with his <UNK> there is a funny break in the action when they get a flat tire and he <UNK> <UNK> his hostage barbara stanwyck don't go away she fires back where would i go they're in the middle of nowhere and he realizes sitcom <UNK> yeah that's right the <UNK> between them is a hoot br br there are flaws somewhat ridiculous ones there's one scene where the police who have been chasing after <UNK> for some time stop <UNK> car and to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> rests his head on her shoulder like a loving husband supposedly would and pretends to be asleep as she's being <UNK> a he looks <UNK> un <UNK> in this pose and b i think it's safe to say that any adult who appears to be asleep during an encounter with law <UNK> would certainly <UNK> suspicion br br still a <UNK> thriller which builds to an exciting and <UNK> conclusion br br
<START> i liked <UNK> very much it is a very heart <UNK> story of an italian family moving to germany and it's an story about <UNK> love hope and disappointment and the film is never boring go and see <UNK>
<START> rohmer <UNK> from his usual <UNK> of french middle class to tell this costume drama about the difficulties of an aristocrat lady during the french revolution what's more attractive about la <UNK> apart from the story itself is the fabulous <UNK> that rohmer has achieved the images have been <UNK> <UNK> too make them look like <UNK> pictures in some moments you can't really say whether your watching a movie or a series of pictures in <UNK> <UNK> every shot is like a piece of art br br my rate 7 5 10 br br br br br br br br
<START> the biggest mystery of <UNK> mars is not one that she had to tackle on screen br br rather the mystery is why this <UNK> ratings disappointment is still on the air this week marked a <UNK> for <UNK> mars it <UNK> <UNK> out of <UNK> shows in the big 6 soon to be big 5 yes you read right <UNK> mars was beaten by every show of the now <UNK> wb and every show on <UNK> it was beat by all the shows on fox and of course by all the shows on abc cbs and nbc br br now the hip <UNK> are going to say but this was a re run but everything on tv that week was pretty much a re run it <UNK> the mind why <UNK> would choose this proved ratings disappointment as one of the few shows it saved from <UNK> br br clearly something is going on behind the scenes <UNK> are being <UNK> and influence <UNK> br br sorry to be so cynical but what other explanation is there the <UNK> mars has potential line is clearly dead now that it's had two years to establish itself and failed to do so br br maybe it's joel <UNK> influence and <UNK> but frankly i am at a loss why anyone would choose to spend their <UNK> on a bad show that no audience is watching br br a great mystery and a very <UNK> debut for <UNK>
<START> i last night i had the pleasure of seeing the movie bug at the florida film festival and let me say it was a real treat the directors were there and they did a q a afterwards the movie begins with a young boy <UNK> a roach beneath his foot a man who is nearby parking his car sees the young boy smash it and runs to ask the kid why why did he have to kill that living creature ' in his rush to <UNK> the youth in the error of his ways the man <UNK> to pay his parking <UNK> which starts off a whole chain of events involving people not at all related to him some funny some sad and some ridiculous this movie has a lot of laughs lots and there are many actors which you will recognize the main actors who stood out in the film for me were jamie kennedy from his comedy show the jamie kennedy experiment playing a fortune cookie writer john <UNK> lynch who plays <UNK> cross dressing brother on the drew carey show playing the animal loving guy who just can't get it right brian cox the original <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> playing the <UNK> owner of a <UNK> and chinese food take out joint there is one line where cox tells his chef to wash off some pigs blood that is on the sidewalk by saying clean up that death which is quite funny mostly because of <UNK> obsessed with <UNK> delivery the funniest moment in the movie comes when a young boy <UNK> his father whom he heard earlier in the day yell out <UNK> ' while in the <UNK> another extremely funny and surreal scene is when <UNK> <UNK> mrs <UNK> herself and another actor perform a scene on a cable access show from the film the boy in the plastic bubble the actor who <UNK> the cable access show is just amazing he is so serious and deadpan and his performance as both the doctor and the boy in the plastic bubble is enthralling there are many other fine and funny actors and actresses in this film and having shot it in less than a month with a budget of just about 1 million the directors phil <UNK> and matt <UNK> who are screenwriters by trade having written crazy beautiful and the upcoming <UNK> starring jackie chan have achieved a film that is great funny and endearing
<START> it's great to see <UNK> fox in a role where she gets to smile a lot also loved hearing her sing nice change to see her out of her <UNK> west wing er roles the movie itself was entertaining but it seemed skip some explanation in a lot of parts several of the characters seemed to be miserable one minute and happy the next and it was left up to your imagination to figure out why each character was quirky though and in some cases i couldn't wait to see what they would do next or hear what they would say next this movie wasn't full of <UNK> clean people but rather complicated realistic people who could make mistakes feel bad about them and then find a way to fix them
<START> i must admit i was one of the <UNK> who <UNK> judged this show before relatively any information was <UNK> about it i determined that it was going to be a cheap spin off guided by ronald d moore wielding the <UNK> <UNK> br br i was wrong br br the pilot leaves an excellent impression upon the viewers the <UNK> is marvelous of course seasoned bsg veterans will find themselves immersed in the plot which is focused on the development of the <UNK> before the first war <UNK> years before the events of the bsg pilot the pilot also allows for <UNK> clearly presenting its plot and ideas in the first part of the episode br br don't be mistaken caprica is not bsg we are presented with an <UNK> cerebral drama <UNK> by provocative daring and controversial ideas br br the casting maintains <UNK> standards <UNK> and <UNK> are simply astounding <UNK> portrayal of joseph <UNK> inspired by <UNK> portrayal of william gives a wonderful glimpse of <UNK> heroic father <UNK> portrayal of dr <UNK> <UNK> a lot of thinking and questions br br if the quality of the pilot is any indication of what's yet to come <UNK> and the creative team are set to continue <UNK> legacy of first rate television programming with another masterfully created television masterpiece
<START> the <UNK> is hit man movie <UNK> if you can say that about a hit man movie the violence is never really shown but often introduced at first i was scared i was in for another <UNK> of mid 90s gangster hit man <UNK> dark comedy but was happily surprised when i realized this is just a sweet and humorous story about friendship nothing terribly exciting happens in this film but every bit of it is kept me <UNK> the three leads have the best chemistry the big screen has offered in recent years and it looks like they had a great time making this film together the writing is sharp though at times it felt as if the script had been adapted from a stage play because of the one set dialog scenes this is a good film that i probably won't remember for too long but at the time it was a complete joy good film
<START> i'm giving ten out of ten it's one of the best movies ever absolutely <UNK> stunned and <UNK> by the whole picture marvellous playing of jason <UNK> ray liotta and all the crew amazing plot just look into yourself and <UNK> up your courage to admit it touched your soul because it's strange but there are all the answers you've been ever looking for the very best mr ritchie the very best ever those who were looking for a simple <UNK> and <UNK> keep yelling they are disappointed but there are lots of shallow movies in hollywood nowadays you can't remember what it was about the next day you had seen it on the contrary revolver is unique i could have hardly expected it's possible to portray such a clear and genius picture of myself of everyone who was to watch it absolutely <UNK> astounding dazzling one can get insight watching this i have no doubt about that actually no words can express my admiration i'm still wondering how it was possible to shoot such a movie after years of <UNK> hollywood rubbish we had been watching thank you from all heart it's simply the best
<START> this film was bad bad acting bad directing bad writing but it wasn't bad in a funny way it was bad in a boring way i watched surface to air because i thought it might be a laugh it wasn't don't make the mistake i did there are plenty of more enjoyable ways to spend an hour and a half such as watching paint dry or reading the <UNK> seriously
<START> the <UNK> in this movie is one mean <UNK> and he seems to enjoy what he is doing that is what i guess makes him so mean i don't think most men will like this movie especially if they ever cheated on their wife this is one of those movies that pretty much stays pretty mean to the very end but then there you have it a candy bar ending that makes me look back and say <UNK> as hell a pretty good movie until the end ending is the ending we would like to see but not the ending to such a mean beginning and then there is the aftermath of what happened guess you can make up your own mind about the true ending i'm left feeling that only one character should have survived at the end
<START> of the elements that make this the best at this point i have to say 1 is christine mcintire <UNK> scene when <UNK> and her reaction are truly magnificent i imagine that as one poster suggested christine was trying to hold back laughter during that scene but it actually made her seem even more deliciously evil to be smiling at <UNK> possibly dying br br another character who helps this stand out is the <UNK> his look was a great cross between horrific and comedic goof ball hardly a character i would choose to meet in a dark alley or for that matter anywhere i would have preferred a bit of true <UNK> mystery in this but hey when a short is this good who's going to complain not i
<START> on the way back from <UNK> san jose california all five mind you three of us hardcore kamal fans of us had reached a <UNK> verdict <UNK> was solid crap and thanks to the movie we were going to have a pretty screwed up monday not to mention we <UNK> to stay off the theatres for the next year br br i won't blame kamal here because he sort of dropped a hint in a recent interview with <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> tv he said something like <UNK> <UNK> photography <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> screenplay direction <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cinema has grown in terms of photography and editing but we have hardly improved when it comes to screenplay direction and acting while you're watching <UNK> those words ring very true br br now here are the 10 reasons to hate this movie br br 1 harris <UNK> br br 2 harris <UNK> br br 3 harris <UNK> i'm barely holding myself from using <UNK> here but fact is <UNK> has <UNK> the fine knack of <UNK> up every recent movie of his remember <UNK> <UNK> with the jarring <UNK> he bills as background music the next time i have an <UNK> transplant he's paying for it br br 4 songs neither do the songs help move the movie's narration <UNK> <UNK> nor do they make you sit up and take notice the film feels like it's made of four very long songs with a few scenes thrown in between them br br 5 a short gone too far <UNK> at best is fit to be a short story not a 2 hour plus thriller to use a cliché here like the <UNK> bunny it goes on and on and on only in this case you don't want it to the later part of a movie feels like a big drag br br 6 kamal <UNK> pairing two ice <UNK> <UNK> together could've produced more sparks than this lead pairing there's no reason you would root for them to make it together in fact every time they get together in the second half of the movie they make a good <UNK> to the narration hate to say this but <UNK> <UNK> 10 minute <UNK> does more than what kamal and <UNK> achieve in this movie plus <UNK> br br 7 kamal <UNK> accent kamal has this pretentious accent that nobody speaks either in india or in the us and it isn't new either he's been doing it since <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it's simply gets on the nerve imagine what havoc it can cause when his flair for using this strange accent meets shooting on location in the us he doesn't leave it at the <UNK> either he offers doses of advice to his men <UNK> <UNK> cops from <UNK> <UNK> and beyond in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> we <UNK> here is plain bad police <UNK> of course with nauseating effect br br 8 logic there are a few directors whom you expect to stand up to a certain scale <UNK> fails us badly with some crappy performance in the department of common sense which d c p in his senses would meet his love interest on the streets to discuss such matters as committing himself and life after the scene inside the theatre was so bad towards the climax we could hear people behind us <UNK> challenge the hero's iq is he stupid can't he just use his <UNK> or lights on a busy <UNK> road kamal the cop on a police <UNK> chases a guy on a bike just like any ordinary dude can't he just use his gun the guy on a bike starts on foot and we have a fully <UNK> kamal in hot pursuit for a considerable amount of time i'm not voting in favour of the later but i'm just trying to explain the mood inside br br 9 gore violence if i wanted to watch women being raped their throats getting <UNK> more women getting raped and thrown into the <UNK> with excruciating authenticity i would sit at home and rather watch a police report or <UNK> the use of excessive violence should go in a way to <UNK> the story not <UNK> it somewhere down the line <UNK> seems confused about what the <UNK> rapes murders are and what the <UNK> story is br br 10 even a double shot <UNK> couldn't get the pain out of the head
<START> christopher lee is one of my favorite actors i'm trying to view all of his work he has been known to single <UNK> save movies with his presence unfortunately this is not one of them this movie suffers from a low budget and it's production values are disturbing please for the love of christopher avoid this film
<START> i normally do not take the time to make comments that few people will read about movies few will see however in this case i feel i must warn all those who might consider wasting time on it i just finished watching it only five minutes ago this is quite simply one of the worst movies that i have ever seen in my life the acting is horrible a plot is nonexistent and production values are poverty level at best i know that even a low budget movie can be great but not this one there is only thing that could have saved this movie for any horror <UNK> purposes more on screen gore and <UNK> the grand total of three times that this occurs is off screen while it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens especially the end scene there is simply not enough of it the movie is just too long for it's minimal content too dialogue heavy and consequently almost impossible to watch what happens to put it all in a nutshell with room to spare three teenage girls <UNK> and <UNK> go out driving through an isolated area where over 20 girls have previously been <UNK> and murdered their car of course breaks down and they are taken to an old boring house inhabited by three crazy people one of whom is the psychotic killer all three are eventually murdered one by one off screen after what seems like an eternity of boring slow paced nonsense as i said the only things worth watching even once are the murders please don't buy it or rent it just for that and don't be fooled like i was by the misleading box art and movie description save your money and your time
<START> 'the second <UNK> as it's title explains shows us the beginning of the end for the human race set long before the matrix existed this short anime written by the <UNK> shows us the world that could lay <UNK> of us in the not to distant future set at the turn of the 21st century the second renaissance <UNK> into issues common with human behaviour greed power control vanity etc br br the use of robots or artificial <UNK> as slaves or <UNK> is common among science fiction fantasy stories the second renaissance is no <UNK> to this concept however instead of a simple man vs machine <UNK> this story explains the struggle that the machines put up with the struggle for acceptance in a world ruled by humans where the matrix films show us the human perspective these short animations tell both sides of the story br br the second renaissance part 1 2 answer many questions brought up by the original matrix film such as how the war broke out how the sky was <UNK> what led to the use of humans as <UNK> and it also introduces us to the machine city called <UNK> which may have relevance to the upcoming matrix <UNK> film br br i won't give away too much of the story as i do not want to ruin the experience for perspective viewers however i will recommend it to anybody interested in the world of the matrix or simply anybody interested in japanese animation anime br br 9 10
<START> i really wanted to like this movie but ended up bored and <UNK> the first shot is a camera feed from a robot traveling towards a bomb and is naturally shaky but then the rest of the movie stays in <UNK> mode even during quiet <UNK> moments to the point of <UNK> have the rental houses run out of <UNK> and <UNK> the fact that it was shot on <UNK> doesn't help as the entire movie is grainy as well as shaky br br for all the effort <UNK> put into accurate vehicles and equipment there are enough glaring errors and inconsistencies that they <UNK> the movie's credibility br br a car would not <UNK> in flames after a single shot and once <UNK> would not be <UNK> by a small hand held <UNK> br br a single <UNK> would not be driving around <UNK> in 2004 but would be backed up by other vehicles in case of breakdown or attack it would be exceptionally unlikely to be able to hit a running <UNK> at long range where the bullet is clearly taking over a second to reach the target br br i believe bombs were brought to <UNK> <UNK> areas on or near a base not some random spot in the middle of the desert br br the oil <UNK> attack is stated to have occurred in the green zone a highly secure area that experienced very few attacks from within the zone is mostly <UNK> and <UNK> with few <UNK> yet it is portrayed as a dangerous warren of dark <UNK> and lurking <UNK> oddly james never gets in trouble for the ridiculous <UNK> of <UNK> his two companions to each take an alley by themselves thus setting up the attempted kidnapping br br speaking of which the 3 man team is always depicted <UNK> buildings chasing <UNK> etc on their own even when there are clearly dozens of soldiers right there br br how many hours does the team have to stare at a dead <UNK> hanging out a window to figure out he's not <UNK> it br br there were no establishing shots to show the viewer what the size and <UNK> of the base was or where <UNK> was in relation i had no idea who the <UNK> team reported to nor were any other characters fleshed out these are things the characters would know so we should too br br many of the surprises and scenes are perfectly predictable yes it's obvious that the psychiatrist colonel will get into trouble with the <UNK> he's trying to move along that the choice of <UNK> back home will be overwhelming and that a driver you kidnapped will not wait for you when you leave the vehicle br br finally there was an almost complete lack of character development <UNK> character from the beginning has a troubled relationship at home is reckless and addicted to <UNK> he's exactly the same at the end of the movie what's the point br br if this is indeed the best so far of the <UNK> war movies it's a sorry bunch just based on the half hour i saw of it i'd recommend generation kill on hbo instead
<START> this particular joe <UNK> short subject was obviously inspired by the all star warner brothers spectacular thank your lucky stars one of those all star wartime <UNK> <UNK> of the period in that one eddie <UNK> played both himself and a would be comedian who'd like to break into films except for his resemblance to <UNK> br br george <UNK> who starred in the <UNK> shorts is both himself and <UNK> who's just trying to get a break in film like thank your lucky stars a few warner brothers contract players with a free moment <UNK> through this film br br <UNK> been sent by central casting for a small one line role in a world war i film but <UNK> <UNK> gets the message the poor guy is so nervous about his big moment he starts thinking of ways to deliver his one line maybe sounding like a real movie star would help br br <UNK> takes later to the <UNK> of director ralph <UNK> and the patient clyde cook who plays a british cockney soldier they do find a <UNK> in the film business for poor <UNK> it's worth seeing this very funny short subject which was nominated for an oscar to find out what happens to <UNK> <UNK> br br both of them
<START> everyone is surely familiar with this most famous of stories  a heartless businessman is visited by the ghost of his dead partner on christmas eve and warned that if he continues in his <UNK> ways then he will be doomed to an <UNK> in chains so that he can avoid his <UNK> fate he is visited by three spirits who show him visions of <UNK> past present and yet to come so that he will hopefully see the error of his ways before it is too late a rather morbid tale one might think but it is classic charles dickens and also one of the most famous and popular christmas stories of all time br br to me this is the definitive version of <UNK> timeless story it's the one i always remember watching in school and i remember being absolutely terrified by it the ghost of <UNK> <UNK> the final scene with the ghost of christmas present under the bridge and the ghost of christmas yet to come especially i found very frightening how on earth did the film gain the <UNK> <UNK> for non uk readers <UNK> is the lowest <UNK> it means family friendly and children welcome nothing to scare them etc this is certainly not the case though as some smaller children will undoubtedly find the final segment positively terrifying with the grim <UNK> like <UNK> of christmas future br br be that as it may from the many versions of this classic story i have seen adapted for film this is possibly the most faithful to the book most notably included is a segment rarely seen in film adaptations of the original text that of the ghost of christmas present showing scrooge the two children hidden under his <UNK> you'd never get away with a scene like that nowadays the two children represent ignorance and need although changed to want in this film br br criticisms for me however become apparent having watched it again with more objective and trained eyes the main one of which being that george c scott's portrayal of scrooge seems simply not cold enough he laughs too much i don't want to use the word jolly because of course <UNK> is anything but but he does seem to be merely a grumpy old man rather than the positively <UNK> cold and <UNK> man that he is in the book and other films patrick stewart portrayed him excellently in one of the most recent versions filmed and michael caine despite acting alongside the muppets was positively cold further the development of the character over the course of the film as he learns more about the error of his ways and grows towards redemption is unconvincing and appears inconsistent he appears to have changed little by the time he reaches the third <UNK> final lesson br br but ignoring this one albeit major <UNK> it is still a <UNK> and ultimately heart warming christmas tale as all christmas films should be london of course looks like the perfect <UNK> quaint snow covered english town that many americans probably imagine it still is the truth is that even then that london was grey and <UNK>  and any snow would never have been so white and everyone is so <UNK> dressed too even the poor people look rather <UNK> but of course it's a christmas film so why shouldn't everything look nice perfect holiday season viewing coupled with copies of it's a wonderful life miracle on <UNK> street and the snowman and you've got everything you need
<START> wow so much fun probably a bit much for normal american kids and really it's a stretch to call this a kid's film this movie reminded me a quite a bit of time <UNK> very terry gilliam all the way through while the overall narrative is pretty much straight forward miike still throws in a lot of surreal and <UNK> esquire moments the whole first act violently <UNK> from scene to scene the normal family life of the main kid hero with the spirit world and the evil than is ensuing <UNK> and while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of miike's work the layers of meaning and metaphor particularly the anti war anti revenge message of human <UNK> is pretty damn poignant as manic and <UNK> fun as other great miike films only instead of over the top torture and gore he gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from japanese folk <UNK> <UNK> conceived via cg and <UNK> wrapped into an imaginative multi <UNK> adventure <UNK> <UNK> and one of miike's best
<START> if you are tired of films trying too hard to be fairy tales the pretty woman variety love story here is a beautiful film in which a japanese businessman is pulled free from his robotic <UNK> life when he falls in love with dancing wonderfully drawn characters bring to life a story that is at once deeply funny and <UNK> moving
<START> i mean seriously what group would sing about a crazy car so what if their ten it's way too immature for a little kid to sing about being my women i mean seriously the name is pretty corny too naked brothers just because they take off their pants how creative i don't get why they need a tv show i mean most artist don't really need a tv show about themselves especially the naked brothers band heck how many of them are in the freaking group and seriously whats with the movie <UNK> nick use to be the <UNK> of my years growing up but seriously the naked brother band so many parents would not let their kids watch this especially with the name the naked brother's band its a stupid <UNK> show that should not be aired onto tv
<START> i know technically this isn't the greatest tv show ever i mean it was shot on video and its limitations show in both the audio and visual aspect of it the acting can at time be also a little <UNK> but i love this show so much it scared the hell out of me when it first aired in 1988 of course it would i was 5 years old but i recently purchased the dvd of the first 3 episodes which unfortunately i hear is now deleted and i also heard <UNK> aren't going to release any more due to the first dvd's bad sales also the tv show didn't have the same feel as the movies in fact i thought it had a more sinister tone even though the colour palette is similar to nightmare on elm street 4 both that film and the tv show were made the same year this has more of a serious tone whereas the <UNK> were <UNK> getting more and more <UNK> and <UNK> not a bad thing i like freddy as the clown wise cracker but i think that was the <UNK> of this tv show you didn't have freddy popping up every minutes cracking a joke before and after he kills somebody in fact this has more of a dream feel to it <UNK> by the soft focus of the <UNK> im not sure if its deliberate on the part of the shows creators or just to the limitations of being shot on video i love this show and taken not as a companion piece to the movies can be very enjoyable much better than anything on tv today
<START> the appeal of ancient films like this one is that you get to see an actual moving image of life over 100 years ago here are a lot of people leaving a factory all of them dead by now and none of them even remotely aware of the <UNK> of the invention that they are walking before i was shocked to read one reviewer call this film as boring as home videos today and at least one other <UNK> identified it as the first film ever made it was the first film made at the rate of 16 frames per second rather than the then normal <UNK> frames per second br br sure all you see is a lot of people <UNK> out of a building and passing before the <UNK> on their way home from work but this is a curiosity piece for dozens of reasons not the least of which is that it was the first film made by the <UNK> brothers who probably had a stronger impact on the development of the cinema than any other individual or group of individuals in history
<START> i've just seen this movie for the second time on television it's lovely warm sentimental very very romantic i've rarely seen actors better able to reveal by their movements and gestures love for another <UNK> shepherd ryan <UNK> robert downey jr and especially mary stuart masterson simply <UNK> themselves masterson probably has the hardest role and is just adorable br br the movie is in the vein of both romantic movies such as while you were sleeping when harry met sally <UNK> in seattle and the high gimmick sorts of movies like big back to the future peggy sue got married i hate to say this because this cast was superb and i'd never change any of them but i think it didn't succeed as well as the movies mentioned above because the box office appeal of the cast was just not as great as meg ryan tom hanks michael j fox and kathleen turner at the time the movie was made br br it's not superbly written e g the characters' lines are not particularly memorable yet it's executed to perfection br br the romantic <UNK> are truly <UNK> the feeling of people falling in love is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and all <UNK> <UNK> the feeling of loss and desire to <UNK> that connection are so <UNK> delivered again and again you will find yourself moved actually a comparable movie is made in heaven the same romantic yearning br br do see this it's lovely
<START> ride with the devil like ang lee's later <UNK> mountain is a film of aesthetic and historical importance film lovers ought to see it at minimum twice as its artistic nuance is worthy to be over <UNK> br br a perfect piece of art surprising depth of humanity i really don't recall another war film will so capture you will change your existing conception of history and politics will <UNK> your belief in humanity after seeing so many killings so many <UNK> you don't feel yourself <UNK> instead you treasure the bond between human beings more the actors' performances haunt your heart the music drives your mind some shoots are not just some pictures they <UNK> themselves becoming the seeing of soul such is the true sense of film being a genre of art br br a film like this doesn't need long comments or reviews everything it says by itself <UNK> to the cast which includes <UNK> maguire jeffrey wright and jewel <UNK> the cinematographer and the composer of the beautiful and lyrical music what an achievement
<START> there aren't many good things to say at all about underneath <UNK> untrue <UNK> into neo noir soderbergh remakes robert <UNK> decent noir <UNK> cross <UNK> not <UNK> the plot very much at all however the adaptation <UNK> it of every ounce of its state of the art film noir atmosphere giving it the same story set in the very least appealing places <UNK> and <UNK> soderbergh who would later make wonderful crime films like out of sight and the <UNK> series with great style and atmosphere takes the dangerously obvious route to <UNK> by <UNK> the story with the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> fashions of the early 1990s <UNK> have terrible <UNK> dressed garage bands peter <UNK> uninteresting version of burt <UNK> anti hero is left by his femme fatale girlfriend for <UNK> buying <UNK> lifeless modern <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> and other up to date pieces of equipment that suck the reaction out of the film br br it could've been more entertaining and less boring had it a few saving <UNK> like a good score more flesh to its characters more than just william <UNK> giving performances that aren't wooden a <UNK> pace unfortunately underneath has none of these things soderbergh a fine director does not <UNK> his dry <UNK> to the benefit of his film this time that <UNK> works wonderfully when he's <UNK> a crime movie with more tongue in its cheek like the george clooney pictures previously mentioned or a social or character drama like traffic or sex lies and <UNK> with a movie like underneath it <UNK> the boredom experienced by the viewer
<START> great documentary about the lives of ny <UNK> during the worst terrorist attack of all time that reason alone is why this should be a must see <UNK> item what shocked me was not only the attacks but the high fat <UNK> and physical appearance of some of these <UNK> i think a lot of doctors would agree with me that in the physical shape they were in some of these <UNK> would not of made it to the <UNK> floor carrying over 60 <UNK> of gear having said that i now have a greater respect for <UNK> and i realize becoming a <UNK> is a life <UNK> job the french have a history of making great <UNK> and that is what this is a great documentary
<START> i knew it would be but i gave it a rent for some laughs and maybe some mindless fun anyone whose read a few of my reviews can see that i'm pretty easy to please i really didn't think i'd end up feeling this <UNK> towards it br br the plot is about an ancient army of dragons lead by a huge <UNK> that will destroy the world unless some chosen heroes who inherited the responsibility <UNK> become one <UNK> a good <UNK> or <UNK> i don't know it was so stupid i didn't bother to put much effort into <UNK> it br br it features a really dumb story full of ridiculous moments and goofy concepts so many of the events just felt totally random and sudden br br i assume there was studio <UNK> or something because the biggest problem i have with the movie is the fact that the story seems like it's trying to be so grand and epic yet everything happens so fast and goes by so quickly i feel like i've just been hit with a million plot points and action sequences in one big ball the film is like a punch in the face it doesn't take much time at all to establish characters or drama imagine the lord of the rings trilogy in 90 <UNK> you could have most of the epic battle sequences but there would be absolutely no <UNK> and you'd hardly care about the outcome of those battles that was the case with dragon <UNK> 90 minutes of me not giving a crap waiting for it to be over br br fantastic cgi with some okay directing but horrible acting <UNK> pacing and dumb story made this very hard to enjoy on any grounds i probably would have loved it when i was 6
<START> <UNK> <UNK> the red queen kills seven times 1972 is just about the most perfect example of a giallo that i have ever seen mixing all the requisite elements into one sinister <UNK> indeed first of all and of paramount importance for me it has a complex <UNK> plot that ultimately makes perfect sense and the killer here does not come completely out of left field at the end the story concerning a series of gruesome murders you already know how many from the film's title right that takes place in seeming <UNK> of an ancient prophecy concerning two sisters is an involving one and the murderer a red <UNK> figure with the insane laugh of a <UNK> is both frightening and memorable every great giallo requires some lovely lead actresses and here we have quite an assortment headed by the ridiculously beautiful barbara <UNK> as one of the two sisters and in one of her earlier roles <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> tramp at <UNK> fashion house another necessary <UNK> of a superior giallo is a catchy <UNK> score and bruno <UNK> provides one for this film that should stay with you for days gorgeous scenery check again filmed largely in <UNK> germany the picture is a treat for the eye indeed ok ok but what about those murders after all isn't that what <UNK> are all about well i'm pleased to report that most viewers should be well satisfied with the various <UNK> shootings <UNK> and other carnage that this film <UNK> <UNK> out not to mention the <UNK> freaky dream sequence rats and bats and lots of 'em too the drug references a rape scene the obligatory red herrings and in the person of <UNK> <UNK> a hunky leading man for the female viewers as i said a perfect giallo and even better this dvd is from the fine folks at no shame and you know what that means a gorgeous print and loads of extras to boot thanks guys
<START> kurt russell is at his best as the man who lives off his past <UNK> reno <UNK> robin williams is his polar opposite in a rare low key performance as jack <UNK> he dropped the big pass in more ways than one br br you'll see some of the most <UNK> scenes ever put into one film as jack <UNK> at a rat reno poses and the call of the <UNK> goes out br br don't miss this classic that isn't scared to show football in the mud the way it should be played note to the <UNK>
<START> full marks for the content of this film as a brit i was not aware that there was <UNK> in the us navy during wwii a very brave attempt to bring this fact to the world however the movie is pathetic direction is non existent the acting is wooden and the script is just one cliché after another i can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i sat and <UNK> from the start until the end at the very poor way that this had been put together this could have been a great movie the story for many of us outside of the us was new unique and also interesting the sad fact of the matter is the way that it was put together it is unfortunate that a true story like this which could have changed people's attitudes has been <UNK> on a low budget badly directed movie i only hope that some time in the future one of the major studios will take this theme and do it justice
<START> with a title like this you know not to expect a great horror movie but this was really bad even with low expectations the plot is really insulting and stupid an escaped criminal wears a halloween mask so everyone around him thinks he's someone else this joke might actually work for 5 or 10 minutes but not during the entire movie the actors are not that bad but their characters are rather dumb and the story is boring and downright stupid no suspense no excitement and little gore very cheap <UNK> little <UNK> tries to combine horror with comedy and fails dramatically at that it became so boring towards the end that i actually stopped watching 10 minutes before the end i couldn't care whatever happened amanda plummer was great in pulp fiction but come on that was 13 years ago and she hasn't done anything decent after that so no wonder that she had to sink as low as this piece of crap avoid or be warned
<START> don't get me wrong dan <UNK> was a great speed <UNK> if there was one guy who deserved his gold <UNK> at the <UNK> it was dan br br but how can it be possible that bill <UNK> has made such a bad movie about the incredible dan <UNK> story because the real dan <UNK> story is truly incredible especially when you look at this movie through the eyes of a <UNK> everything is wrong the way matt <UNK> and the other actors <UNK> their technique the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> it is all wrong br br shame on you bill <UNK> dan <UNK> deserves better a lot better br br 1 out of 10
<START> who would think andy <UNK> helen <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> had a steve mcqueen movie in her past but that is only one of several weird and wonderful things about the ultimate 1950s teenagers battle creatures movie which might best be described as rebel without a cause meets god knows what from outer space the rebel is steven mcqueen who would shortly decide that steve sounded less <UNK> a good boy with just enough wild to be interesting the very wholesome yet understanding girlfriend is the aforementioned <UNK> <UNK> it was bad enough when their date was <UNK> by teenage hot <UNK> but they are considerably more <UNK> when they encounter a <UNK> man eating what is it that rides down to earth on its own <UNK> meteor and begins <UNK> up <UNK> right and left but will the grown ups believe them of course not what do they know they're just kids br br the movie is <UNK> <UNK> at its <UNK> <UNK> best the actors take the rather pretentious script very seriously with many a <UNK> look into each other eyes and the adult supporting cast probably says kids very third sentence or so but the real pleasure of the film its creature which is well imagined well executed and often manages to generate a surprising degree of suspense and although clearly on the cheap side check out those <UNK> sets guys the blob is actually a fairly well made film and there's that catchy little theme song thrown in for good measure the 40 plus crowd myself included will enjoy the movie as nostalgia but that won't prevent them from <UNK> right along with the younger set at its whole milk and white bread 1950s sensibility and the film would be a great choice for either family movie night or a more sophisticated grown ups only get together make plenty of <UNK> <UNK> for movie <UNK> gary f taylor aka <UNK> amazon reviewer
<START> a thin story with many fine shots <UNK> here are the three ladies from the d r e a m team and to a lesser extent the guy accompanying them <UNK> <UNK> convincingly acts out the female half of an evil business couple <UNK> to poison the world with <UNK> original in this movie is the <UNK> bomb put on a captured member of the d r e a m team of course she is rescued by a co member three seconds before explosion although clearly <UNK> from james <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> only live <UNK> such a climax always works well all in all a nice watch james bond replaced here by three charlie's angels
<START> <UNK> <UNK> wayans is probably one of the worst directors i swear he has no real knowledge on how to make films he has made one brilliant film and that is scary movie scary movie 2 was ok too but everything else <UNK> has made are real disasters avoid such titles like don't be a menace to south central while drinking your juice in the hood i know what a title obviously this film too just anything that has <UNK> name in the credits br br it was an hour and a half on stupid nonsense that never made me laugh just trust me on this maybe women might like this film a little because of some of things that happen but on a whole this film will never be liked by anyone with a good taste in films 1 10 j d <UNK>
<START> <UNK> made here a very interesting movie it begins with the description of an almost deaf young woman in its working universe as a secretary she is ignored frustrated rejected hiring an <UNK> as an assistant appears to be a way for her to find someone in her life but the guy is just coming out from jail their both being rejected by the society <UNK> them <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> goes into details both start to help each other for she can read on lips which reveals itself to be very useful for him she will <UNK> <UNK> far from what she was at first br br it's beautifully filmed the whole is very convincing even if it turns into a film noir at the end gesture is in particular beautifully observed in <UNK> filming <UNK> <UNK> should be nominated at the best <UNK> <UNK> awards for her <UNK> play action towards the end of the film <UNK> it from being a simple <UNK> de <UNK> it's actually surprisingly entertaining 8 10
<START> this movie has a lot of comedy not dark and gordon liu shines in this one he displays his comical side and it was really weird seeing him get beat up his training is <UNK> and who would've thought <UNK> <UNK> could be so deadly lots of great stunts and choreography very creative br br add johnny wang in the mix and you've got an awesome final showdown don't mess with <UNK> thugs they're ruthless
<START> the <UNK> effect of war is a much studied subject in the movies as is the equally <UNK> but potentially life saving <UNK> effect of military training joel <UNK> <UNK> follows the standard <UNK> we see men treated like dirt but <UNK> as soldiers with a degree of mutual respect for their commanding officers and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained typically as here vietnam but <UNK> has an interesting take by <UNK> its account on a cocky <UNK> named <UNK> played <UNK> well by colin farrell who understands that all power <UNK> ultimately by <UNK> and the lack of awareness among the <UNK> of their own <UNK> around this character a taught gripping plot has been constructed and it's also a plus that the action never leaves america whereas stanley kubrick's <UNK> metal <UNK> to name just one other film of a similar type lost focus once the action <UNK> to asia although this is not a film of <UNK> originality it's <UNK> well done and captivating viewing throughout the best film from this director that i've seen and among the very best of its genre
<START> the screaming skull 1 outta 5 stars this movie boasts some pretty cool opening credits an <UNK> narrator warning that movie <UNK> will be offered a free burial if they die of fright watching this movie a scary shot of a skull <UNK> from a <UNK> pool and the <UNK> scary music but sadly the movie is all downhill from there a widowed man takes his new bride to his secluded mansion <UNK> his servants and friends that the new mrs has a very fragile <UNK> due to a tragedy in her past well in no time at all she begins to see and hear mysterious things that no one else can her husband <UNK> her that it's all merely in her mind and well you can probably see where this all is going you will have figured out what's going on long before our hapless heroine because you have probably seen the exact same plot in hundreds of other movies and tv shows and done better too to add to the movie's <UNK> <UNK> most cuts of this movie on numerous cheap dvd <UNK> seem to be missing a few key scenes you see the heroine slowly walking towards the window she goes to open it you know she is going to see something scary and then suddenly the scene cuts to her <UNK> in her husband's arms so what did she see i guess we'll never know
<START> this <UNK> award winning episode is one of the highlights of the 1st season where a <UNK> <UNK> traps captain <UNK> beverly data and a <UNK> <UNK> named <UNK> within a 1930's san francisco setting this episode is an homage to raymond <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> where patrick stewart assumes the <UNK> bogart role complete with <UNK> and <UNK> the office itself is almost an exact <UNK> of the one featured in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br this episode also briefly introduces us to a mysterious <UNK> race called the <UNK> that communicate with mostly a high pitched <UNK> sound communication with this alien race is difficult and it is up to <UNK> to communicate with this race in their native tongue so that <UNK> and <UNK> can finally begin the best part of this episode though is the appearance of the famous hollywood b actor lawrence tierney in the role of the gangster <UNK> <UNK> he was such a handsome man back in the 1940's oh well
<START> this is a film that makes you say 2 things 1 i can do much better than this acting writing and directing 2 this is so bad i must leave a review and warn others br br looks as if it was shot with my flip video i have too believe my friend who told me to watch this has a <UNK> against me i have noticed that there are some positive <UNK> for this home video must have been left by crew members or people with something to do with this film one of the worst 3 movies i have ever seen hopefully the writers and director leave the business not even talented enough to do commercials
<START> the early to mid 90s were a high point in my opinion for the historical drama last of the <UNK> braveheart rob roy all portrayed a distinctive passion and intensity in their respective time periods br br rob roy was a unique and intriguing taste of a time and place rarely represented by film it really has everything interesting story great acting remarkable dialog and breathtaking scenery i was particularly impressed by the apparently genuine dialog i can imagine this is how early 18th century people spoke and <UNK> br br something else that surprised me was the <UNK> expressed by the characters i found it to be more repulsive and shocking albeit often more subtle than most found in films set in modern times the movie had a very <UNK> and sexually charged edge to it that was unique and most likely very realistic in the context of the era br br the pace was very tight with hardly a dull moment there was much intrigue and political subplots that complicated things a bit but yet did not detract from the main storyline br br the action was also very well done and gripping something that i will forever find remarkable is that during the highlight action piece in the film there is no soundtrack whatsoever it makes for a very tense exciting sequence since we have no musical cue as to the direction and resolution of the scene br br rob roy will always remain high on my list of favorite films i would recommend it to all
<START> i guess its possible that i've seen worse movies but this one is a real stinker the plot is <UNK> but thats not the worst of it the directing is no where close to what you would expect from andy <UNK> he's capable of good work but failed to pull this movie together br br angie <UNK> playing the female lead as a reporter <UNK> into who's behind the assassination of the president truly butchered the role there was no chemistry with gooding her demeanor was flat and wooden and the 5 inch spike heels she wore throughout the movie were absurd this outing for <UNK> places her <UNK> at the bottom of the b list br br and what was cuba gooding thinking he has to his credit a number of outstanding performances but this was far beneath what we've come to expect from him br br poor james woods and burt reynolds poor poor poor poor poor
<START> there are some great philosophical questions what is the purpose of life what happens when we die and why do they make movies this bad the premise is absurd <UNK> acting is one dimensional the special effects are overdone and the movie is one <UNK> gun battle among some of the <UNK> shots hollywood ever produced but then if they had been good shots everybody would have been dead in the first five minutes and there would be no movie too bad it didn't happen that way tempted to turn it off several times i stuck with it to see just how bad it could get glad i did because spoiler the last line is the <UNK> stupidity of the whole dopey dismal scenario it is not even worthy of second feature status at a third rate drive in in off season apart from the general awfulness of the film i worry deeply about its impact on young audiences the americans <UNK> out crap like this and then wonder why events like <UNK> happen this is truly banal cinema on a <UNK> scale
<START> <UNK> little <UNK> is one of the better b horror movies i have seen when i say better i mean the story the film <UNK> a new plot something that's not so cliché in the horror genre something fresh but there are also some ridiculous questions that come along with it questions you will be asking yourself throughout the movie br br the film first caught my attention while i was <UNK> the horror section in <UNK> i was tired of all the so called <UNK> hollywood blockbusters and wanted something different the cover art for <UNK> little <UNK> immediately caught my attention as you can see the image draws you in it's chilling i knew it was a straight to dvd release but i took a chance i mean i just seen <UNK> man the night before so it couldn't get any worse after i watched the movie i was semi satisfied i loved the plot of the movie it was really creepy how the killer was pretending to be the little boys friend so he could kill in some sick deranged way he actually thought he and the little boy would become partners a duo of terror it was a great idea to set the film on halloween night this way no one would think anything of a masked man beside a little kid they would simply think he was his guardian but this is also where the plot holes begin to surface br br if your son came home with a friend he met trick or treating that's fine you wouldn't think anything of it if he was 9 or round about the same age as him if however he appeared with a strange man in a mask you would be <UNK> and protective of your child you would ask the man to remove his mask and identify himself you would ask why he is with your son he doesn't know him you would tell him to please leave he isn't a family friend he's a stranger now we're supposed to teach our child not to talk to strangers in this case the mum is completely fine with it huh they never seem to think it's a tad odd that the man doesn't speak at all <UNK> they think it's the daughters boyfriend but after 10 minutes of not talking you would pull the mask off and ask him why he's not saying a word br br the film goes down hill from there the thing that got me the most was all the mum said was do you want some <UNK> i can't count how many times she says this in the movie it's like oh you're dying we have <UNK> though it's all good the movie started promising and failed to deliver it was more of a horror comedy and even as that it fails to deliver i guess you could call it a dud flop etc br br the best thing about the movie is the cover art though something tells me that's not worth the 12 dollars
<START> this movie has such <UNK> b class <UNK> to all its scenes effects etc as to make you think they spent 80 of their budget on connery it's like watching some wing commander stuff after star wars quite apart from content br br story can be described in one word flat and oh my god i can't remember a villain so uninteresting since long long ago we're given neither a reason he's so wicked an <UNK> <UNK> we're lead to think nor any real <UNK> or flair to his <UNK> br br if you're out for connery rather go rent hunting <UNK>
<START> after you see vertigo then watch bell book and candle made within months of each other br br my second favorite kim novak film with <UNK> coming in as third br br all three performances are great vertigo being the best of all br br they came to my nowhere kansas <UNK> town near by at <UNK> kansas in the 50s to film <UNK> br br bell book and <UNK> musical score i believe is one of alex <UNK> perfect for this bit of comedy br br after vertigo stewart and novak did this comedy how amusing to note the dramatic contrast br br worth your time if you like kim novak the greta garbo of my youth
<START> honestly i am not even joking when i say that this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen this film <UNK> have a single ounce of originality in its flimsy dialog or its blatantly <UNK> story line i can not even begin to count the number of things in this film that are obviously ripped off from the omen and other movies like it for example the <UNK> lucy in this film is actually one of the devil's <UNK> sent to guide and protect the <UNK> of satan does this sound a lot like mrs <UNK> to anyone else another thing is that the <UNK> were they first got the child burned to the ground just a few months after he was adopted just like in the omen however luckily one priest survived the <UNK> and escaped with <UNK> burns all over his body yet another coincidence and to top it all off the burned priest is staying in a hospital room with pictures of jesus all over the walls much like the priest in the omen having pages of the bible <UNK> on the walls like wall paper please don't even get me started drawing comparisons between the ending of this movie and the omen for you because as i've stated above there are far too many to mention here
<START> the film did not do well at the box office br br i saw it in a sneak preview br br i have always enjoyed the film br br i live in 1 of the cities mentioned in the film where past players moved to br br not the best film ever put to screen but enjoyable br br robin did well with his role br br best line of the film at the beginning by <UNK> character jack i was that <UNK> <UNK> up here as not to offend anyone br br was glad when it came to dvd a few years back in the wide screen letter box format br br i am not a football fan or a real sports fan but you do not need to be one to like this film
<START> could not understand why jeremy <UNK> felt it necessary to exhibit a most <UNK> accent spoken through <UNK> teeth and from the back of his throat in fact it rather spoiled the film for me and distracted from what was probably a fine performance by him very irritating no other actor or actress seemed to have such a <UNK> accent and whilst i have always rated jeremy <UNK> as a fine actor i would not class this film as being one of his best the film however has <UNK> my <UNK> as have some of the other comments made re this film which i have found very interesting and intend to now read the book
<START> jay <UNK> plays an orphan raised in a kung fu school but kicked out by the corrupt <UNK> after fighting with a bunch of thugs in the employ of a <UNK> villain he happens upon down on his luck <UNK> eric <UNK> who immediately sees cash potential in the <UNK> skills basketball is the chosen <UNK> for <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> to get him a spot on a university team and to promote him in the media general success leads to a basketball championship and a really nasty rival team managed by the same <UNK> villain of before br br it's all a bit shaolin soccer i guess but not so quirky or ridiculous the plot sticks pretty close to sports movie conventions and delivers all the elements the crowd expects from the set up you've seen it all before but it's the kind of stuff it never hurts to see again when it's done well luckily it really is done well here some might say <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the director's chair i expect he had good <UNK> the script delivers and the presentation is slick and stylish jay <UNK> remains pretty much <UNK> throughout but such is his style and when he does let an emotion <UNK> across it can be to quite good comic effect eric <UNK> <UNK> with a larger than life character that he's played many times before in real life for instance who gets many of the films most emotional moments br br since the film revolves around basketball it's good that the scenes of basketball matches are suitably rousing the cast show some real skill including <UNK> and some well done <UNK> and cgi add that element of hyper real kung fu skill that make the scenes even more entertaining assuming you like that sort of thing and justify the movie's plot existence br br there's only one significant fight scene in the movie but it's a <UNK> in the one against many style jay <UNK> appears to do a lot of his own moves and is quite impressive he's clearly pretty strong and fast for real and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> choreography makes him look like a real martial artist i wish <UNK> been more but at least it's a lengthy fight br br very much the kind of chinese new year blockbuster i hoped it would be from the trailer and recommended viewing
<START> i'm sure deep in the <UNK> of jack blacks mind the character of <UNK> <UNK> is absolutely hilarious but no it isn't you can tell <UNK> <UNK> having a whale of a time <UNK> it up playing a smarmy slimy mexican <UNK> with dreams of becoming a wrestler but this movie is a total misfire in just about every single department br br i just sat there through most of the movie thinking is this supposed to be funny and this is the guy from <UNK> d right the truth is this film has nothing to offer at all it's a lousy script with crappy characters and really <UNK> acting and direction you'll watch endless moments where you think something funny is surely about to happen but it just doesn't i was bored stupid about 10 minutes in but though it would surely pick up it didn't 90 minutes later i'd barely managed to <UNK> off an <UNK> it was that painful br br it's like remember years ago when you'd see anything with your <UNK> actor in it even some of their really early <UNK> from before they were famous and you'd be really embarrassed that said actor was actually in such a load of <UNK> yeah it's like that br br i've enjoyed some of jack <UNK> earlier movies like shallow hall and i'm really looking forward to seeing pick of destiny but come on man if you do this to us again jack i'm gonna have to come round there and hammer your <UNK> or something at the least give you a serious talking to br br i know it's a cliché but this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen and for so many reasons
<START> seriously what the hell was this movie about simply stupid i'd give it 0 but 1 awful is the lowest you can go seriously this movie is not worth watching waste of time i don't know what the hell is wrong with you guys voting this movie 7 out of 10 i seriously can make a better movie than this hire some other unemployed people <UNK> i promise i'll make a movie better than this this movie was so bad that i'll never watch a movie starring steve <UNK> again bottom line don't waste your time to <UNK> it off the net or rent it i'd <UNK> this movie for the worst movie of the century i mean the worst is something gotta give but after that this is the second
<START> for the first couple of seasons i thought the apprentice was a highly engaging and exciting show the combination between reality tv and a 16 week job interview was innovative and the producers of the show managed to keep the show relevant and not too out there br br the new season 6 is nothing more than a big joke and it has absolutely nothing to do with business at all in the earlier seasons they used to put a lot more emphasis on the business related tasks now the focus is mostly in the <UNK> where the contestants are expected to do everything to keep them on the show that means lying trash talking <UNK> etc the <UNK> can be entertaining to watch but it's entertainment at it's low point sometimes you wonder if you are watching a repeat of an old jerry springer episode the tasks on the show are at most boring and mostly a showcase for the companies who are dumb enough to pay nbc for the publicity and what is the deal about half of the contestants living in <UNK> in season 6 that is just plain stupid and has nothing to do with business in real life br br i have absolutely no respect for any of the contestants this season they all seem like idiots to me in earlier seasons at least some of the contestants had a bit of integrity now it seems like the contestants would kill their own mother to keep them on the show it also seems like donald <UNK> massive ego becomes bigger and bigger for every season that pass by and to be honest i can't see why anyone with a common sense would want to work for him his <UNK> in the <UNK> mostly doesn't make any sense at all and sometimes it seems he just like to trash people for what it's worth br br r i p the apprentice please nbc for god's sake get the show off the air as soon as possible it's just too embarrassing to watch the apprentice was once a great tv show but now it's just a big fat joke
<START> the film largely focuses on a bullying robert taylor as a ruthless buffalo hunter and the people who have to put up with him set amidst a hunt for <UNK> numbers of buffalo it portrays the end of a tragic era of senseless slaughter and is full of drama and <UNK> for both the buffalo and the native americans taylor is <UNK> by his hatred of indians and his <UNK> that the buffalo <UNK> will never disappear in one scene he shoots animal after animal while in another he murders indians and then eats the food they had cooking on their fire under this ruthless exterior lies an insecure person who is reduced to begging his <UNK> stewart granger lloyd nolan and russ <UNK> not to leave him it's not the most pleasant of films and is <UNK> down by the drama it creates leading to a dismal and very fitting conclusion in a <UNK>
<START> insignificant and low <UNK> haha 80's horror like there are thirteen in a dozen yet it can be considered amusing if you watch it in the right state of mind the special effects are tacky the acting atrocious and the screenplay seems to miss a couple of essential <UNK> the brain takes place in a typical quiet american town setting where every adolescent works in the same diner and where the cool kid in high school <UNK> <UNK> bombs down the toilet it is here that a tv guru named dr blake and his adorable pet brain begin their quest for nation wide mind controlling under the label of independent <UNK> a giant cheesy brain sends out waves through television sets and forces innocent viewers to kill how cool is that now it's up to the <UNK> teen rebel to save the world the funniest thing about the plot is that it never explains where dr blake and his monstrous brain actually come from there are obvious references towards <UNK> life but that's about it <UNK> who needs a background in a movie like this really there's not that much bloodshed unfortunately and the evil brain looks like an over sized <UNK> puppet the only more or less interesting element for horror buffs is taking a look at the cast and crew who made this movie director ed hunt and writer barry <UNK> are the same men who made bloody birthday guilty pleasure of mine and plague both those are much better movies and they wisely decided to <UNK> the film industry the most familiar face in the cast <UNK> is the great david <UNK> whom horror fans will worship forever for his role in re animator a girl named christine <UNK> provides the nudity factor and she's obviously a great <UNK> she has exactly 3 movies on her <UNK> of which this is her masterpiece in her debut she was credited as <UNK> <UNK> and in 3 men and a baby her character is referred to as <UNK> of jack's girls' i really wonder how she feels about her career as an <UNK>
<START> high school friends andre <UNK> and cal gabriel <UNK> war on their classmates and plan a terrifying assault on their high school as they begin the deadly <UNK> to their final act of revenge the two start a video diary to explain their feelings and <UNK> their mission br br there is another similar movie like this called elephant why do i bring this up to compare the two films of course i have to say even though i liked elephant this is a much better film what's the difference you ask well for starters this is shot differently much along the lines of <UNK> blair witch project and diary of the dead this makes the movie all the better because it's much more painfully realistic br br but what won me over was how the movie was willing to show the other side of the story you get to know these two <UNK> unlike elephant i actually cared for one of the <UNK> and could understand their actions and why they did what they did this movie actually makes you feel sympathetic to these people and that's a good thing because it's not always black and white br br to be honest this is why i almost cried in this movie the characters are real human beings with logic and reasons behind their actions you get to understand them it's not like they want to kill people for attention overall this film is emotionally gripping and very haunting and much better than elephant
<START> oh man this thing scared the heck out of me when i first watched it and i was sixteen br br that creepy animated <UNK> is scary as hell i want to stop talking about her now
<START> almost from the word go this film is poor and lacking conviction but then again most people would struggle to show commitment to a script as uninspiring as this the dialogue really does not flow and sometimes as in this case more is less or should have been this is also backed up by odd scenes e g the <UNK> slow motion walk that you think might lead somewhere but only seem to waste a few more seconds of your life br br the plot is a strange combination of gangster situation comedy which i am sure seemed a good idea at the time but if ever there was a case for someone needing to be honest with the scriptwriter then here was it br br martin freeman is okay but then he seems to have one character which always plays so i am beginning to wonder if he was given a script or just filmed and told to react as normal br br finally humour this reminds me of the <UNK> i think quote about <UNK> of his <UNK> if he had meant it to be humorous he would have put a joke in it well i didn't see one br br don't waste your time i did because i was watching it with a friend and kept hoping that it was going to get better br br it didn't
<START> i recently saw this at the 2009 palm springs international film this is the feature length directorial debut of veteran dutch actress <UNK> van de <UNK> and based on my observation it should be her last i hate movies that are so implausible that you are picking apart practically every scene this film immediately leaves you scratching your head as it begins a young photographer and his girlfriend who works for an international aid organization are having a <UNK> drive through the <UNK> controlled mountains afghanistan having a conversation about their love when a rocket stops a truck in front of them they get out of their vehicle to watch as <UNK> fighters <UNK> with rocket <UNK> machine guns <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> all five people in the truck bob <UNK> <UNK> starts taking pictures of all this when he is spotted by one of the <UNK> who <UNK> a hand <UNK> at them that kills his girlfriend since they are with hand throwing distance they can't be more than 50 <UNK> away yet he somehow gets away his girlfriend is blown up and he takes a picture of the moment of the <UNK> impact that kills her and wins a prize as photographer of the year for the photo every scene and situation in this film as as ridiculous as it's opening the following year bob finds himself on assignment for national <UNK> on a dutch resort island where he meets kathleen sophie <UNK> and <UNK> himself into her seedy underworld of international drug <UNK> avoid this film i would give it a 4 0 out of 10
<START> in cold blood adapted by director richard brooks from truman <UNK> famous novel deals with the brutal and senseless murder of a family of four by a pair of hapless criminals the film excels as a character study of the killers particularly trigger man perry smith robert blake br br the cast includes few recognizable names but they nevertheless bring the story to life with ease robert blake and scott wilson are excellent together as two criminals with <UNK> personalities they play off of each other effortlessly while blake also gets plenty of opportunities to explore his character's <UNK> the rest of the cast is merely average and isn't worth <UNK> on br br richard brooks received oscar nominations for both his script and his direction in my opinion both were excellent though the script does <UNK> with some ill advised narration in the late stages the oscar nominated cinematography by conrad hall is also top notch as is the editing also worthy of note is the <UNK> score by <UNK> jones which <UNK> the last of the film's four oscar nominations br br unlike so many other crime films this one doesn't <UNK> violence brooks turns the killers into <UNK> characters rather than <UNK> <UNK> them whether or not you agree with that sentiment the film does present an interesting alternative to the usual hollywood approach i recommend the film for this reason and also for the expertise with which the technical aspects are handled
<START> ice t stars as mason a homeless african american who finds himself hunted by wealthy hunters <UNK> <UNK> gary busey charles s <UNK> f murray abraham william <UNK> and john c <UNK> however mason proves to be much harder prey then the usual targets in this ridiculous and slow paced <UNK> which takes too long setting up <UNK> and then totally <UNK> them
<START> this is a hilarious film burt reynolds is a <UNK> star who signs a <UNK> contract with ned <UNK> chicken pit <UNK> the contract has all sorts of <UNK> <UNK> in it such as forcing burt to wear a chicken suit during the race jim <UNK> is his not quite convincing chief mechanic <UNK> anderson oh yeah is assigned by beatty to keep reynolds honest and strictly <UNK> to the contract this is a funny film in which burt proves that he ain't too proud i like it
<START> the 3rd and in my view the best of the <UNK> series br br the only downside is that there is no lord <UNK> who was the funniest character from the previous series but hugh <UNK> prince <UNK> is suitably <UNK> laugh a line br br as a package it's quality through and through with convincing <UNK> sets superb cutting sarcasm and little bits of the wacky the <UNK> actors standing out and prince georges <UNK> <UNK> chicken impression and the missing words from dr <UNK> <UNK> br br few comedies have been quite as both clever as they are funny okay the odd lame observation or line gets in but mostly it's a scream
<START> the ultimate homage to a great film actress the film is a masterpiece of poetry on the screen like great poetry it is timeless direction cast screenplay music lyrics in fact all the <UNK> for movie making are perfectly chosen to suit the message of the film the muslim society in india has never been presented with such respect <UNK> and reality the script is memorable in the hands of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kumar <UNK> etc to name a few personally i was most impressed by the regal looking kamal kapoor the master movie maker kamal <UNK> lasting legacy to the sub continent a very beautiful film on a controversial theme that makes humanity look up and face the reality of the <UNK> in the world <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> such acting is <UNK> of in this age of sex dance and pornography
<START> unless you are mentally ill or the most die hard segal fan you will tire of this horrendous excuse for a film in under 5 minutes br br the plot even for a seagal film the plot is just stupid i mean its not just bad its barely coherent br br the acting unbelievably wooden literally seen better acting in <UNK> ironically this film tries to cash in on this audience which a <UNK> love <UNK> which is utterly cringe worthy br br special effects wouldn't look out of place in a 60's sword and <UNK> flick br br unless you suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other <UNK> don't make the same mistake as i did and buy this dvd as you will be asking for that hour and a half of your life back
<START> this low budget digital video film has strengths in the right places writing and acting in addition the digital photography is the best of the lot so far in low light conditions the characteristic video <UNK> tone <UNK> but surprising it rivals film stock for <UNK> clarity and <UNK> in <UNK> lit situations this is grass roots film making at its best with snappy dialogue carrying a midnight cowboy kind of story about <UNK> doing whatever it takes to survive in urban san francisco
<START> spectacular horror movie that will give you the chills once you get settled with it the atmosphere is very creepy and stylish the score is chilling but the best about the movie is it's performances it's rare to get scared by performances and this movie's solid acting plays an important part in the scare factor br br the story is very interesting and gets your attention since the first minutes though the woman in black does not have much screen time she makes the necessary appearances to chill the audience in some brilliant scenes the dialogs are very <UNK> and make your imagination work and that's when it becomes really scary br br if you have the chance watch this on theater it's a totally different experience but as scary as this movie br br this is one of the best ghost movies ever and it's directed for people that want to get scared
<START> this very peculiar setting of <UNK> last opera definitely grew on me when i first saw it i was somewhat annoyed by many of the films <UNK> images and felt that far too much was <UNK> upon the story however if you can put up with a fair amount of rather <UNK> gimmicks i think you will find that the film does manage to capture the very strange other <UNK> atmosphere of the opera and that there are moments which are particularly fine br br personally i never really understood the role of <UNK> until i saw how edith clever portrayed her her performance a lip <UNK> <UNK> of the singing voice of <UNK> <UNK> is nothing short of dazzling from end to end and alone <UNK> the hours it takes to <UNK> the film br br another reason to delight in this film is that it captures the spectacular interpretation of robert lloyd of the crucial role of <UNK> one which lloyd has performed to a crisp at opera houses throughout the world i have been <UNK> to enjoy him in the role of <UNK> on the stage of the <UNK> opera several times and the <UNK> of his voice and the warm <UNK> of his interpretation of this noble character really needed to be <UNK> as did his performance in the character's two major monologues the <UNK> scene and the <UNK> of the prophecy in act 1 br br the version i have seen was a <UNK> made for america and so there were subtitles which alas could not be done away with this is especially unfortunate because the translation used is very inaccurate and forces an extremely christian interpretation on a film which is already forcing layers of interpretation on the opera this seemed to me to be quite contrary both to <UNK> clear <UNK> of christianity and his very deliberate attempt to <UNK> the christian elements of the story see <UNK> with spoiler at the end of this review i find it nearly impossible when viewing a film with subtitles to keep from absorbing them and strongly recommend that if in the dvd versions you have the ability to turn the subtitles off you do so and instead if the opera is unfamiliar to you that you read the <UNK> carefully beforehand br br the bottom line is that there is much in the film which i dislike and would just as soon have seen done differently but it has <UNK> <UNK> in my <UNK> over the years since i first saw it and i find myself drawn to enjoy it again and again br br br br <UNK> containing a spoiler a good example would be <UNK> famous line i saw him him and laughed this gets translated in the subtitles for reasons which escape me as i saw the <UNK> face it is especially irritating to me because throughout the <UNK> wagner very deliberately and carefully refers to this unseen character who need not be the biblical jesus as der <UNK> i e the german for the <UNK> a reference to the wound of <UNK> and to all wounds and <UNK> and the need for healing
<START> this is a really nice and sweet movie that the entire family can enjoy it's about two dogs and a cat who are taken away to live with someone else for a little while but the animals don't understand and they escape and go to find the family on their own the cat is named sassy and she lives up to her name chance is the younger dog who knows a lot about life on the inside of the pound shadow is the older and <UNK> dog who senses things put those three together on an adventure and it makes for a happy and fun filled time there are no special effects of the mouths moving so it isn't cheesy at all it's the best talking animal movie that i've seen so far it's a really good movie for families
<START> this movie is just another average action flick but it could have been so much better when the guns come out they really needed some choreography help someone like andy <UNK> who made that brilliant action sequence in heat as they move up the street from the robbery would have turned the dull action sequences into something special because the rest of the film was alright predictable but watchable better than you would expect from this type of movie then came the final scene the show down the one we had been waiting for but was like watching something from the a team in the 80s they shoot wildly nothing hits and they run around a house trying to kill each other same old same old
<START> what horrible writing and acting no personality what you can't make a good movie with a single character hmm it was done in <UNK> with self dialog br br so this kid goes on a trip to see his father the kid jason takes a plane and the pilot has a heart attack and dies mid flight so the kid crashes in a lake and survives then he runs around surviving in the wilderness until he gets rescued br br during that time he fights a bear twice the first time he fights it off in the lake the second time he makes a <UNK> out of a branch and spears the bear two shots of fake blood <UNK> out of the <UNK> chest reminded me of monty <UNK> the holy grail br br also the kid decides to kick a <UNK> with predictable results br br gag
