<START> i suppose it's nice and trendy to see wonderful things in the absolute <UNK> of a film like this with the sometimes pointless <UNK> of many hollywood films we can relax and enjoy a scene devoid of explosions foul language and corny one liners <UNK> has its place and can be very effective when employed properly however this film is not one of those cases br br take the long scenes with no dialogue and dreary sparse scenery i'm sure that they must hold some great meaning and insight because the implied message in <UNK> in <UNK> the acting is poor bland and pedestrian and features one of the worst crying scenes in history at the end of the film if you can sit through it to the end the scenery is drab and the ridiculously long ending sequence of the girl walking through the <UNK> park is as <UNK> as having a tooth pulled i would call this <UNK> but as the film didn't build to any sort of climax whatsoever not even in the erotic scenes it would be untrue i'm sure that there was a script employed during the filming but with the amount of dialogue i think it might have been written on a cocktail <UNK> basically this film offers nothing to interest or <UNK> no great story no stunning insights no visual drama no excitement apart from two or three amusing moments this film is a waste of two hours a <UNK> boring and dreary film
<START> you ever sit through a movie and after it's all over it's like one big wtf br br welcome to <UNK> br br another straight to video action fodder flick you can immediately forget about having watched or better yet don't watch it at all peter <UNK> and robert patrick star and are quickly wasted in this going <UNK> fast <UNK> for hire action dud where the story is pretty darn bad and the action sucks and what's the point of watching an action flick if the action blows robert patrick in particular hits a new low in an action sequence that has him firing a machine gun while standing on the hood of a moving school bus co stars the <UNK> charlotte lewis and <UNK> own scott <UNK> of tv's night heat fame
<START> this movie had potential but what makes it really bad is lindsay <UNK> acting i've never seen her before in anything else and maybe there are some <UNK> fans out there that like her in something else but her performance in this movie is bad br br her delivery is robotic when she delivered her lines it appeared that she was trying to make sure she had the lines right and was simply reading off the list in her head so her voice has very little <UNK> i can't believe someone that bad at acting was given a lead role in a movie she has to know somebody in the <UNK> br br now i hate to be this mean about her but the comment has to be this long and her performance is what sticks out more than anything else br br however i liked where the story was going so i continued to watch it the first part of the script has the <UNK> of a good movie but the end was disappointing as well maybe if her acting had been better i would have liked it
<START> spoiler for anyone who is lucky enough to ever see this film so not really spoiler after all saw this film when it was released and can still remember parts of it it's all set in a small town in the west or what is left of that town it more resembles a ghost town with few inhabitants among them a couple where the wife is especially wicked she lets her man die in the end of the film and leaves the town but has to cross the desert we never know what happens to her next but just before she left her dying man shoots after her and deliberately does not hit her and instead the water supply she is not aware of that soon she will be very <UNK> mark damon kills a couple of bad guys in a funny <UNK> but that's another story which i don't remember too good the remaining impression of the film was that it was one of the first times i saw a really wicked woman on film who pretends to be anything but wicked can't be compared with the witch in <UNK> who in comparison is easy to find out very tight western with few main characters and still absorbing
<START> i have never seen such a movie before i was on the edge of my seat and constantly laughing throughout the entire movie i never thought such horrible acting existed it was all just too funny the story behind the movie is decent but the movies scenes fail to portray them i have never seen such a stupid movie in my life which is why it i think its worth watching i give this movie 10 out of 10 for being the most pathetic movie ever created this movie seems like it was solely created to become trash i mean the scenes seem so fake and the actors act like the camera is in front of them you will get a kick just watching how lame this movie is me and my friend could not stop making jokes during the movie the <UNK> guy who tries to get the girl got ran over not once but twice and the second time he got ran over it sounded like he said sh although he doesn't speak english lol if you watch this movie you will think to yourself that all those other movies you didn't like you took for granted they are way better than this this movie should be seen out of curiosity as well as what kind of movie <UNK> lame the evil <UNK> encountered the girl so many times it was ridiculous the evil <UNK> just <UNK> and <UNK> and let her get away every time the evil <UNK> had so many chances it was like god was trying to say hurry up and eat the girl how many <UNK> do you want the transition between scenes leaves you wondering did i miss something so many plot holes from scene to scene i was laughing like crazy when they decided to escape to mexico to get away from the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the border will save you from a <UNK> from korea interesting very interesting i guess <UNK> the border <UNK> all problems another scene that completely <UNK> me they met for the first time and had a romantic scene at the beach they <UNK> and didn't even know each other the scene was so clichéd and the was no substance at least in other movies it might seem logical <UNK> but i mean they just met even though they are <UNK> there feelings were like they instantly loved each other instead of it rather developing anyways this movie is worth watching for the sake of opening your eyes and seeing the light bad hollywood movies will seem like heaven when compared to this in the end its worth watching you wont get bored you will be occupied <UNK> every moment every scene in your head
<START> this is an absolute great show jessica alba besides being the most beautiful women in the world is a great actress she does a great job of portraying max and i could never see anyone else doing that role she is definitely one of a kind and absolutely gorgeous
<START> mighty <UNK> power rangers has got to be the worst television show ever made there is no plot just a bunch of silly <UNK> kids using martial arts while dressed up in second class <UNK> outfits br br the special effects look like they are from the <UNK> the costumes look like something out of a bad comedy and the show is just plain awful br br the only thing worse than the television show are the toys just second rate plastic garbage fed to our kids br br there are far better shows for your kids to watch br br try giving your kids something like <UNK> those shows actually have some intelligence behind them unlike power rangers
<START> the cinematic interests in the british <UNK> continues with the young victoria <UNK> to <UNK> after having seen in recent years the efforts with <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> elizabeth films and scarlett johansson and natalie <UNK> take on the <UNK> sisters with the other <UNK> girl more contemporary stories would include helen <UNK> award winning portrayal of the queen on the current reign of queen elizabeth ii at the turn of princess <UNK> death br br each of the films mentioned featured stunning actresses with acting <UNK> ok so some may <UNK> johansson or were the <UNK> of their moment and each film had a definitive moment in their historical character's legacy that it becomes a no <UNK> to have those events featured and in fact elizabeth had enough to span two films however the young victoria as the title already suggests is a <UNK> version of the young <UNK> life and if you're looking for that definitive event or the <UNK> political intrigue that plague all royal <UNK> and their <UNK> with shady self serving politicians unfortunately there's nothing of depth here br br that's not to say the young victoria is without directed by canadian jean marc <UNK> best known for crazy and written by julian <UNK> this film chronicles in very plain terms the life and times of victoria emily blunt soon becoming the new it girl when she was a child the troubles she faced before <UNK> such as the <UNK> of her mom the <UNK> of kent miranda richardson and her <UNK> sir john <UNK> mark strong to <UNK> themselves as joint <UNK> to her throne as already planned for by <UNK> king william jim <UNK> as if that wasn't enough the political power play enters the picture with lord melbourne paul <UNK> being a prime minister in waiting trying to gain the trust of the new queen and subtly plants his own trusted allies into positions within the palace on one hand you'd understand the need for a young and new queen to have trusted people in key positions but on the other are they really acting in her interests or in the interests of others br br even this angle of intrigue creeps into her romantic story with prince albert rupert friend where their relationship forms the bulk of the second half of the film and pretty much everything already included in the trailers for both they've been brought up under the influence of others and told each step of the way exactly what to do even their union may seem like a firm <UNK> of an alliance if not for both lovers <UNK> their common need to establish their own <UNK> and to do so with the help of each other instead of being <UNK> there's this constant search and <UNK> of opportunities to break out of <UNK> and at times absurd rules and <UNK> trust also becomes a much <UNK> <UNK> and loyalty too can be <UNK> for wanting to set the <UNK> clean br br however all these themes become but a <UNK> through the narrative from childhood to romance marriage and children in fact there's so much fast <UNK> here especially the last few minutes filled with inter titles that it actually leaves the audience wanting for more and room of course for another movie which i suspect would probably not see the light of day but perhaps a television series might pick up on the film's response and come out with a mini series or such it's a pity that all the effort here in <UNK> the gorgeous costumes sets and art direction would be confined to a film that's quite lightweight in theme and brief mention of issues that they don't really challenge the protagonists in order to allow for some <UNK> of character defining <UNK> br br with its star <UNK> cast one would expect more but one would be left wanting more instead recommended for those who are ever curious about kings and queens in the british <UNK> only as a <UNK> to other more engaging stories available in the other films already mentioned
<START> i actually went to see this film in a theater but what a complete waste of time and money bad acting i'm sorry to say did not help to enjoy this rather <UNK> screenplay br br some friends told me to go and see this film since james <UNK> the author of the book was very heavily involved in the screenplay they had really enjoyed the book so the movie just had to be perfect well maybe i had my hopes up a bit too high but i absolutely hated this movie it was predictable too <UNK> to a point that i actually left i had to vomit and worst of all there is going to be a sequel do the world a favor and stop this <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i have to say when pushing daisies came out i was immediately won out by the fairy tale like setting of such <UNK> the narrator made a cake out of the whole ordeal by making death seem as routine as well ned lee pace <UNK> <UNK> and that bringing them back to life was just as routine br br the trio of ned <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and charlotte chuck charles anna <UNK> plus sometimes sidekick <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who made the musical wicked such a delight made for some fantastic dialogue and silliness it definitely deserves the title of a romantic comedy drama br br ned and chuck made for a shy and not quite ready for love couple who are still exploring their feelings even though they cannot touch an <UNK> that seems to be truly no <UNK> with aids such as <UNK> <UNK> and quirky <UNK> around the apartment but despite the <UNK> presented as they work their feelings around a strange secret which only a few know they still manage to show their on screen chemistry in touching scenes like when ned gives chuck the <UNK> the presence of <UNK> though makes for some break out in song moments in the pie shop and <UNK> complications for the couple br br second season <UNK> <UNK> putting a <UNK> on a show that had real potential on some of the episodes the plot line was rushed and awkward making you ask what just happened in both the overall dead person of the week plot and in the <UNK> plot line the addition of <UNK> father plus two half brothers for ned didn't help and at least one of the plot lines felt almost recycled didn't the episode comfort food feel like the episode bitter <UNK> in the fact that the dead person of the week died in food a few touching moments the <UNK> happened to help advance the relationship between chuck and ned but every time they got close the writers decided to throw in another monkey <UNK> rather than let the relation develop oliver comes back from the monastery <UNK> dead father comes back to life and doesn't go back you get the picture br br shame it didn't work out but the concept was good and seemed surreal in a good way just enough <UNK> color happy <UNK> going on and implausible scenarios to remind you that it's not dead like me then again it's in pushing daisies time according to creator bryan fuller so it makes it plausible again br br it should have lasted longer but it's merely <UNK> thinking at this point kudos to whatever new show attempts to replace this short lived gem
<START> i work at a blockbuster store and every week we have movies that come in with just a few copies these are the kind of movies that the sci fi channel shows the kind of movie that nobody ever wants and only that idiots rent when they bring it back i ask them was it any good they say no we turned it off after 15 minutes movies with terrible computer generated super <UNK> monsters and such like very unappealing br br this is the same type of movie that grendel is and absolute waste of time if you want a reasonably and only reasonably good beowulf based movie then try beowulf grendel starring gerard butler who is also starring in the eagerly anticipated 300 as king <UNK> of <UNK> br br plus later this year we have another beowulf movie with a star <UNK> cast ranging from anthony hopkins and brendan <UNK> to angelina jolie and john <UNK> br br but don't let that get your hopes up like we all did with <UNK> or we are all in for another big disappointment br br and regarding <UNK> here is my rule of thumb if there is only one or two copies don't rent it because its a load of crap this is true 99 9 of the time usually not true if the title is foreign or a documentary
<START> <UNK> <UNK> makes <UNK> images and samantha <UNK> can <UNK> feeling with a gesture so what a drag to discover their talents wasted on this mannered pretentious <UNK> br br <UNK> can't bring <UNK> to life her attempts are too arty and <UNK> repeatedly her camera <UNK> on long silent shots of the <UNK> actress as if <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> alone could supply character we are in a blank <UNK> hell of self <UNK> for a film that has minutes to spare on bugs <UNK> across the floor you might think it could get round to <UNK> out its protagonist but how will it do so if she rarely speaks without the <UNK> interior monologue the celluloid <UNK> <UNK> is nobody small wonder <UNK> has <UNK> <UNK> often br br that said the first ten minutes were so <UNK> acted shot and edited that my hopes were <UNK> give the film that much it knows how to make promises if not how to keep any
<START> if you're looking to be either offended or amused or both you'll probably have to look elsewhere <UNK> really isn't even very thought provoking beyond <UNK> the usual silly clichés at the end of the second episode i felt a little embarrassed that i actually sat through the contrived mess br br beyond the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> premise thats attracted all the initial attention to it in the first place it's just another lame <UNK> and anti <UNK> attempt at commentary and entertainment that the cbc typically excels at producing and once the <UNK> muslims in rural canada <UNK> hype wears out its welcome the show is likely to follow into the <UNK> of <UNK> because it's so shallow when judged on its merits alone br br unless you're obsessed with muslim culture in the west and or are easily amused by the most minute <UNK> on the subject i really don't see how <UNK> is enjoyable beyond satisfying the curiosity that <UNK> from the hype other shows have better addressed the issue of cultural ethnic <UNK> in western multi ethnic societies <UNK> will never rank among them in entertainment or insight
<START> after having watched guinea pig two questions come in mind besides <UNK> i really a psychopath to watch that ' <UNK> it a snuff ' the answer is no although it's the closest thing to a snuff movie i've ever seen and then <UNK> the hell have they found that girl ' because she gets tortured for <UNK> min without any reasons given in fact there is nothing else in this movie <UNK> <UNK> off beaten with hands feet tools <UNK> by <UNK> and many more until the final scene i'm still not sure how they did that because it belongs to the <UNK> underground <UNK> it's obvious she didn't get a lot of money so what were her their motivations br br i saw it in <UNK> without subtitles but it's not a problem no real dialogues the boys are just insulting her in a few scenes i haven't seen yet all the serial but the first guinea pig is not known for being the best one still i've rated 8 because if the purpose was making people believe this a snuff the issue is quite good ask charlie sheen the actor but i think they could have gone further which they did in the following ones br br another movie i'm hiding from my parents br br 8 10
<START> i had hoped this movie was going to be mildly entertaining like other sorts of its genre however it was lame and i didn't find myself laughing very much watch it on hbo maybe or if you've got a free rental to waste and you need a movie to pass the time but i don't recommend paying to see it br br the plot is simple and straightforward and it could have been funny maybe if the script was better jason lee can be hilarious and he gets a few laughs here and there but the movie falls flat just don't go see this one the directing is lackluster but for what it is directing isn't that important i guess its main <UNK> is that it is just not very funny see something else don't waste your time here
<START> since musicals have both gone out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to make without all the talent needed to make one under contract to a studio i doubt we will ever get a real life story of <UNK> caruso br br but if everything else was in place it was no accident that no hollywood studio attempted the task until <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> had mario lanza under contract no one else could have done it i doubt whether it will ever be tried again br br and why should it i think <UNK> caruso himself would have been satisfied as to how his singing was portrayed on screen for his <UNK> voice was his life his reason for being on the earth br br to say that liberties were taken with his life is to be modest caruso like the man who portrayed him was a man of large <UNK> although with a lot more self discipline he had numerous relationships with several women and <UNK> two out of <UNK> sons who are not in this film br br his contribution to the recording industry is treated as almost an <UNK> he's shown in a recording studio once late in his life actually he started recording right around the turn of the last century and together with irish <UNK> john <UNK> for <UNK> victor made the recording industry what it became br br when caruso and <UNK> were at their heights you had to practically <UNK> a ticket to see either of them perform live but a lot of immigrant italian and irish families had a <UNK> and a record or three of either of these men it's why both became the legends that they are br br what the film does have is some beautifully staged operatic <UNK> done by mario lanza a taste of what he might have become had he the discipline of a caruso to stick to opera the great caruso won an oscar for sound recording and received nominations for costume and set design br br mario himself helped <UNK> the film with an <UNK> red seal album of songs from the great caruso unfortunately due to <UNK> <UNK> we couldn't get an actual cast album with ann <UNK> dorothy kirsten and <UNK> <UNK> also br br though <UNK> sang it in the film lanza had a big hit recording of the <UNK> night of the year further helping to <UNK> the great caruso br br if you're looking for a life of <UNK> caruso this ain't it if you are looking for a great artist singing at the height of his career than you should not miss the great caruso
<START> spoilers spoilers this is without a doubt the best film rainer <UNK> fassbinder ever made and even with the marvelous script the film is enhanced by a great performance by <UNK> <UNK> film starts out with maria <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> just getting married as the bombs continue to fall and <UNK> is <UNK> out towards the <UNK> days of the war and now maria and her mother and sister must <UNK> by to survive maria decides to get a job as a dancer prostitute in a club that <UNK> to american <UNK> and she meets a black army soldier named bill greg <UNK> and they start to see one another on a steady basis maria hears that her husband <UNK> has died in the war so she gets very serious with bill but one day while getting intimate with bill they see <UNK> at the door he hasn't died and when he enters the room a <UNK> occurs and maria breaks a bottle over <UNK> head and he dies <UNK> takes the blame and he is sentenced to a long term in jail so maria tells him that she will succeed at something and get him out the war has ended and germany must <UNK> and one day on a train maria meets karl <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who is a successful businessman in <UNK> and she uses her charms to get a job maria is determined to do well and climbs the corporate ladder and becomes <UNK> mistress she tells him that she will never marry him but he is in love with her <UNK> gets out of jail but goes to canada to try and get over everything that maria has done since he has been locked up br br spoiler alert br br one day karl dies and leaves maria just about everything in his will and maria buys her own house then <UNK> finally comes home to his wife and they are both ready to start they're marriage even though they have been married for some time now but maria leaves the gas on the <UNK> and the house explodes with both of them still in it br br there are so many interesting things in this film that its one of those movies that can be studied and talked about to great <UNK> like in all fassbinder films the use of color is used in a very interesting way as the film begins the tones are brown and gray to represent war torn germany but as maria starts to become successful they change to bright rich colors like red and white the <UNK> of germany with all the sounds of construction are used as only backdrop and the film stays focused on the exploits of maria fassbinder did want the sounds of <UNK> to remind us of what was going on in germany at that time <UNK> <UNK> was never better and her performance is the key to the success of this film with a lesser actress this would have been just another interesting film but <UNK> is so strong that her performance <UNK> this film to an elite status <UNK> shows maria as very determined and smart but at the same time she uses her beauty and <UNK> to get what she wants she's not embarrassed nor does she feel guilty about this and fassbinder wanted to show maria as a woman who practically sells her soul to survive <UNK> wasn't nominated for an academy award but she gave a great performance that will stand the test of time fassbinder himself appears in the film as a <UNK> and his own mother <UNK> <UNK> plays <UNK> <UNK> i have heard many things about the ending of the film and it has to do with whether maria <UNK> left the gas on later in the bathroom she is running water over her <UNK> and she appears to be sad this is only <UNK> and if you think i'm wrong please e mail me i think she was overly excited by <UNK> being home and left it on by accident remember her putting on a dress for no reason then when the will is being read to her its at that point that she learns that <UNK> and karl had become friendly without her knowledge and i think she felt that everything she had done was for nothing thats the reason for the bathroom scene so when the house explodes its by accident but i think the reason for fassbinder having an ending like that is to show that anyone who would sell their soul has no business living fassbinder was fascinated by survivors but he was also incredibly passionate in his view maria can't have it both ways a fascinating film
<START> as you may know the subject here was to ask eleven directors from all over the world to make each a short movie of 11 minutes 9 seconds and one frame we have here <UNK> <UNK> iran what <UNK> <UNK> kids can understand to the towers <UNK> well nothing a great lesson claude <UNK> france a weak plot with a great cinematography just imagine a deaf woman living by the <UNK> who sees without understanding it that her dog <UNK> well just see it <UNK> <UNK> egypt the greatest oriental movie maker has compassion for everyone for an us soldier who died ten years ago for the people in the <UNK> but also for a palestinian suicide terrorist maybe the less tender movie towards the us <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> good images makes us travel for sure not a very good plot <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from one of the <UNK> country in the world a tender and funny story about five boys who want to capture <UNK> bin laden and they could have done it but nobody believes them when they tell they know where he is ken <UNK> uk september 11 1973 the <UNK> entered in a twenty years long bloody <UNK> thousands of death <UNK> all that was offered to <UNK> by henry <UNK> and the cia and knowing this changes very much your point of view i guess that is because of that particular short that no american movie distribution company accepted to release the movie in us theaters <UNK> forgot to point that 1973 is also the year when the <UNK> was built <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mexico <UNK> images that we all know too well and a lot of black screens i didn't get this one very much it is more an artist video to show in an <UNK> than a movie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> an absurd ballet of policemen <UNK> etc around a burning car in <UNK> very well done mira <UNK> india about the anti <UNK> feeling that followed september the <UNK> very good <UNK> sean penn us a funny little story that reminds us a fact <UNK> forgotten the <UNK> did have a huge shadow and some places now have a daylight they never had <UNK> <UNK> japan a different one here there is not even one word about the <UNK> and the action takes place at the end of wwii it has only one message no war is holy this short movie gives very deep feelings but the director <UNK> would have done better with more than 11 minutes so a great movie a great attempt to take the world's <UNK> i love it
<START> you will marvel at the incredibly sophisticated computer animation and the novelty probably won't wear off on the first second or third viewing but you ll be drawn in by the characters which are so simple yet intriguing that you may find yourself actually caring for them in an unexpected way which may or may not make you feel a little childish due to the medium br br disney continues to firmly hold the title of greatest animation in the world with a bug s life standing as one of their greatest achievements one of the innovative <UNK> being the delightful out takes added to the end of the film the dvd has two sets of these out takes where as i m told the vhs <UNK> has one <UNK> version per tape the dvd also features <UNK> s game which is a delightful little pixar short that was also shown prior to the film in theaters br br this is by far the superior <UNK> film in comparison to <UNK> <UNK> which in all fairness is pretty good but lacks something in the animation and in the story development and characters if you look at the star voices of both films <UNK> is largely cast with big name movie stars with a few familiar tv star voices where a bug s life is just the opposite loaded with tv stars with kevin spacey as the only stand out exception but the difference in quality is distinct and obvious br br <UNK> can t be blamed or surprised though when you go head to head with disney you have your work cut out for you this is the kind of film that almost makes me wish i had children to share it with don t think for a second that this is just a movie for kids though
<START> those 2 points are dedicated the reasonable performance from akshay kumar i know bollywood films do not really <UNK> to be realistic but please a walt disney production is more realistic than this plot the father is dying and does what any good parent does kick his son out the son with his pregnant wife a few things that were too hard to swallow 1 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> swimming pool in the <UNK> and to go from that to living hungry in her in laws garden shed 2 akshay suddenly got the job as a stunt man gets bitten by <UNK> dogs to then just walk off this film is an insult to our intelligence i really cant believe i contributed <UNK> to the <UNK> who made this film by taking my family to see it we left the cinema with a <UNK> please do not subject yourself to this mess to watching this take my advice and do not waste your <UNK>
<START> while i suppose this film could get the rap as being anti vietnam while watching it i didn't feel that such was the case as much as the film was simply an honest look into the perspective of the young guys being trained for a war that the public didn't support it showed their fear their desperation their drive all of it out in the open naked as a soldier myself alot of the themes <UNK> true to me in my experience in the military especially boot camp on the whole this movie although it was shot on a very small budget looks great is very well put together and features excellent acting and directing i highly recommend this film to anyone looking for another excellent colin farrell film 10 10
<START> simply put oliver is one of the greatest musicals of all time it is filled with memorable songs food glorious food oliver consider yourself and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to name just a few and equally memorable characters br br the film is a musical adaptation of charles <UNK> classic novel and much like the story of oliver twist itself it is a perfect family film there are some frightening moments the villain bill sykes played by oliver reed is scary enough on his own but overall the film will appeal to children of all ages as well as adults br br the story which almost everyone is surely familiar with by now revolves around a little orphan boy named oliver and his life growing up in london at first he lives in the <UNK> with the rest of his fellow <UNK> but after daring to question mr <UNK> the <UNK> he is sold to a family as a servant br br after a series of <UNK> and close <UNK> he meets the <UNK> <UNK> superbly played by a young jack wild who gives his all in the role and through him the greedy fagin ron moody who trains young boys to pick pocket <UNK> which he keeps for himself br br the film was shot solely in studios and on <UNK> at <UNK> film studios but this does not translate at all to film the sets perfectly <UNK> victorian london as do the costumes worn by the characters a multi oscar winner and a massive success on its release oliver is a worthy <UNK> for the best musical all of time and will delight anyone who loves film
<START> this movie shows a clip of live animal <UNK> of an animal getting <UNK> by a <UNK> and getting its skin ripped off i know these horrible things happen in the world but im watching movies based on the fact that what im watching is not actually happening on the screen these live animal clips are not meant to be in movies they are meant to show people that belong to certain <UNK> to help the horrible things that humans to do other species br br this should be banned and destroyed i have also <UNK> netflix and other resources to <UNK> getting this movie off the market br br this movie should be removed from the public the person who made this movie needs psychological help
<START> i doubt jigsaw was hip even at the time the whole <UNK> theme married to a murder mystery being a <UNK> obvious attempt to grab a young audience of the era without in the least truly showing any understanding of the sixties <UNK> the dated aspect aside jigsaw suffers from many problems including overwrought acting silly and stilted dialogue <UNK> flashbacks that go on <UNK> long even after the point has been <UNK> home in the first 60 seconds a failure to create any true suspense even though the actual plot is on paper a great vehicle to do just that and an ending that is so trite and predictable not to mention reminiscent of a lot of bad television shows that the climax is actually an anti climax if it was a better movie we might be able to suspend disbelief on a few things where it would help enjoyment but the weaknesses are so glaring they only serve to highlight the <UNK> viewers might otherwise overlook i saw jigsaw on television and it is definitely late night tv fare meant to fill <UNK> and pass the time to kill <UNK> insomnia rather than anything anybody ought to <UNK> seek out at very best a three out of 10
<START> after seeing the low budget <UNK> versions of the universal soldier franchise i hoped and <UNK> that van damme <UNK> his role as luc <UNK> in a second <UNK> movie well it seemed this <UNK> was answered but not the way i hoped <UNK> soldier 2 is just intense as poetry reading at your local library no even that would be more intriguing the fight sequences are top notch bruce lee quality which is the only redeeming factor in this entire pathetic excuse for a motion picture that and having former <UNK> tough guy legend goldberg playing the villain however placing goldberg as <UNK> sidekick lieutenant would've been better br br we offended me the most was the setting of the movie itself it's like some film school students slapped it together the plot holes are that bigger than <UNK> <UNK> ego is what really did this movie in for example <UNK> daughter <UNK> looks like she's at least 11 13 years old and the first movie was filmed only seven years ago how is that possible tell me that the part in which <UNK> partner was killed off and turned into a <UNK> is just re <UNK> <UNK> you mean to tell me that there was an experimental <UNK> exposed naked in the basement of the research complex at the beginning of the movie c'mon the director could've spent more time with this movie like the first one and <UNK> all the plot holes shut but <UNK> <UNK> br br speaking of the plot it sucks compared to the first movie universal soldier <UNK> plot watered down and worthless where's the gritty thrills in which a <UNK> goes <UNK> an re <UNK> his last memories in a supermarket rampage thinking its desert storm or something this was the dawn of the millennium you would attracted more of an audience if this had taken place in a <UNK> <UNK> type of future <UNK> corny is the correct <UNK> to describe this sad sad sad sequel br br from what i seen double impact under siege 2 <UNK> 3 and hell even the cheap ass no class terminator knock off class of 1999 is more entertaining than this
<START> for those of you who are not aware with the theme that kusturica continues to explore <UNK> in his films the western assault on traditional serbian values it will be impossible for you to understand his <UNK> this continuous theme expressed through fantasy and outrageous comedy as its vehicle is one that kusturica has elected to <UNK> since his fantastic work and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cat white <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> and recently with <UNK> me <UNK> his slapstick <UNK> style <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> culture its <UNK> arrival and assault on the traditional <UNK> in the case of <UNK> me <UNK> the <UNK> world of city urban space and village traditional <UNK> space are <UNK> the world of the city reflects western attributes that have <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> setting organized crime sexual exploitation a <UNK> sense of identity and <UNK> disregard for traditional values as expressed toward the young kid <UNK> the end of the film further <UNK> this notion as we observe a funeral mass and wedding on a one way dirt road they are on a <UNK> coarse appropriately the wedding which represents the <UNK> and pulse of the village i e traditional values are about to <UNK> with the funeral <UNK> <UNK> the death of tradition within this context yet kusturica brilliantly <UNK> this theme through his own unique <UNK> <UNK> with his outrageous and flamboyant style serving as a vehicle in its portrayal
<START> this is what the musical genre was made of humor talent romance and action all rolled into one br br frank sinatra was wonderful nothing else needs to be said marlon brando although not a singer did a great job winning the hearts of many with his portrayal of sky masterson the fact that he couldn't sing added to his character the ladies in the film were alright but the men in the movie definitely stole the show br br it is a true classic that can be appreciated at any age it <UNK> with all audiences and makes you smile and laugh br br definitely a movie to be watched and enjoyed
<START> i've now seen this film twice and i must say i enjoyed it both times it's fast paced and fun but ultimately <UNK> having said that it deserves to be <UNK> because of <UNK> up what could have been a good follow up to the <UNK> original it is clear for those who have seen the awful <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that the films massive shortcomings can be <UNK> to bruno mattei and that the little that is commendable about it can be <UNK> to fulci this is not <UNK> fulci <UNK> the directors styles are <UNK> <UNK> throughout and you can tell who directed what particularly in <UNK> case br br the film is centered around the <UNK> of a virus oddly referred to as <UNK> <UNK> by a scientist it's <UNK> apparently being more noteworthy than its potentially apocalyptic effect on mankind somewhere in south east asia the virus causes zombie like behaviour in those affected and the virus quickly <UNK> across a seemingly <UNK> area of land our protagonists <UNK> wander into the danger zone and have to fight for their lives against <UNK> of infected <UNK> br br the film seems to be stuck half way between being a zombie gore flick and an out and out action adventure and this confusion is captured most clearly by the zombies themselves they do not appear to have a set of characteristics common to all some are of the regular soulless <UNK> variety so well rendered in the original and probably <UNK> creation here the other main group consist of those who in being infected with the virus lost all sense of themselves but <UNK> a savage <UNK> and a desire to earn a black belt in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> around unsure of whether to continue <UNK> their upper <UNK> technique or engage with their <UNK> in what looks like a mass <UNK> fest on their hapless victims martial arts skills aren't their only talents either they are well <UNK> in <UNK> tactics hiding on <UNK> and under <UNK> of <UNK> and sometimes inexplicably falling from nowhere but the heavens themselves this is all definitely the work of mattei br br there is a third more <UNK> variety of zombie this type apparently retain a sense of irony as well <UNK> really <UNK> for your <UNK> the ridiculous twist at the end in which the dj turns zombie but continues to <UNK> ad <UNK> <UNK> about the fate of mankind only serves to enhance the wtf factor and <UNK> any hope of a serious resolution br br then there's the infamous zombie head which slowly <UNK> itself through the air a <UNK> <UNK> grin <UNK> across its face as if to say <UNK> we know how bad this <UNK> br br the characters are all utterly one dimensional as you would expect but its the pseudo comical dialogue and dubbing that really <UNK> us from taking their plight seriously having said that the first soldier to die does put up an <UNK> <UNK> display against an <UNK> zombie menace indeed this is the first and perhaps only time we hit real zombie <UNK> and one of the only effective scenes in the film br br the guy who played the chief scientist has heart but no talent <UNK> pauses in his lines entirely at random so he ends up sounding like a confused <UNK> the <UNK> on screen attempts at finding an <UNK> are totally unconvincing <UNK> lets put these two <UNK> together ' br br there are a few moments that stick out as genuinely effective however in an early scene a female protagonist explores an abandoned garage upon entering a room we are confronted with a <UNK> view of a shifting figure in the corner and a <UNK> mass on the floor all shot in an atmospheric <UNK> light the silence is interrupted by the appearance of a <UNK> <UNK> wielding zombie who <UNK> everything in his wake in his <UNK> desperation to have her his sheer <UNK> is one of the few moments of real horror in the film the before and after theme conveyed through the hotel that plays host to the happenings of the earliest stage of the <UNK> and later as a <UNK> to our protagonists is <UNK> with an thick <UNK> ambiance there is a scene in which one of the soldiers <UNK> approaches a <UNK> up room that clearly houses <UNK> of the undead and this is quite tense things become more dramatic when they board themselves in the hotel <UNK> to what <UNK> upstairs but this is <UNK> handled and not nearly as effective as it could have been br br all in all i would say this film may just about deserve to be called a royal screw up of a potentially effective <UNK> zombie fest rather than simply a through and through bad film if nothing else it has plenty of the unintentional laughs that i've come to expect from just about anything italian and gory from the eighties

<START> the premise is simple this movies starts out looking like your average lame chick flick about two attractive young people meeting each other in an airport then things take a <UNK> degree turn br br i for one really dislike the kind of mind numbing love story nonsense that <UNK> the average movie theater and it is my humble opinion that wes craven based on his previous <UNK> horror films <UNK> does too br br following this logic it's not surprising to find that craven <UNK> takes his time to built up a <UNK> sweet <UNK> <UNK> story only to have an awesome cillian murphy wreck that whole sugar <UNK> <UNK> br br the scope of his character jackson <UNK> jack the <UNK> get it lame right in this film is impressive he goes from being utterly charming to being a twisted <UNK> <UNK> which is a plus in my book as he proceeds to freak out his victim jennifer garner <UNK> rachel mcadams who i found pretty annoying by the way you can't help but sympathize with the guy br br this is wes craven <UNK> in jackson <UNK> through cillian murphy bashing all brainless chick flicks br br mr craven i <UNK> you br br best quote br br jackson <UNK> after beating the <UNK> out of rachel mcadams in the airplane toilet thanks for the <UNK>

<START> enter the fat dragon is one of the funniest martial art movies i had the opportunity to see sammo hung portrays a chinese farm boy that comes to visit a city friend just like <UNK> lung of way of the dragon wherever sammo goes trouble starts therefore he has to rely on his martial art skills to solve the differences luckily <UNK> character learns martial arts by imitating and <UNK> his idol bruce lee he even <UNK> his nose with his thumb exactly the way bruce lee does and also releases his <UNK> yell he also uses <UNK> in a scene it was like watching a fat bruce lee there's a great showdown near the end of the movie which consists of foreign fighters sammo has to encounter each <UNK> one by one sort of like the game of death where each fighter possesses a different martial art discipline from one another br br this is one of the films i really enjoyed watching and also the very first sammo hung movies i've seen excellent fight scenes and a lot of laughs a rare classic sammo hung film i highly recommend for all you martial art fans out there 8 5 10
<START> based on ray <UNK> dark <UNK> this john watcher in the woods <UNK> directed bust has little going for it br br though it does not lack gory violence it lack narrative sensibility and characters br br the <UNK> of the title is a demon <UNK> with a <UNK> penis that shoots red <UNK> into <UNK> during <UNK> or to be more precise rape br br john cassavetes <UNK> from his successful directing career is convincing as a doctor who questions the circumstances of the bizarre attacks on young women br br horrific possibilities of the victims <UNK> demonic <UNK> are not considered and neither is the audience's tolerance for slow moving garbage br br the <UNK> <UNK> to explore the dramatic <UNK> of a <UNK> premise <UNK> the major problems with this vapid big <UNK> on the loose exercise
<START> when i remember seeing the previews for this movie and not really thinking much about it it was almost one of those movies that when you see the preview its stunning and then when it comes out you hear nothing and totally miss it and your memory totally doesn't correct the mistake of missing it man on fire was one of those movies i was curious on a rental one time and i decided to take it home with me my precious blockbuster rental in my hands i watched it and witnessed such a beautiful movie it is like none other drama and action combined to create something amazingly spectacular the cinematography done by tony scott is extremely well done and unique unlike another movie the subtitles can explain something without even listening to the actual voices and the music is very intriguing for the setting i got into this movie and ended up buying it as soon as i could <UNK> out of the household and head over to best buy i've watched it several times now denzel washington creasy does an amazing job with becoming this lost minded ex special forces man with no reason to live <UNK> fanning pita puts life back into him with her <UNK> love for him right from the start they bond and become good friends until she is kidnapped by notorious gangsters part of the <UNK> la <UNK> creasy denzel tells the mother of <UNK> fanning that he will hunt down the killers <UNK> that pita is dead this is where creasy really shows the person he can become he uses his contacts from <UNK> kidnapping and <UNK> <UNK> to find one of the men and he begins his pursuit my favorite line of all is in this movie when christopher walken tells the <UNK> agent that a man is a work of art in anything that he does cooking whatever <UNK> art is death he's about to paint his masterpiece he plays a very unique roll of <UNK> old partner and friend after finally pursuing the brother of the voice leader of la <UNK> creasy <UNK> a meeting to trade pita for himself and the <UNK> brother in the end creasy dies from being shot earlier and his wound getting infected and massive blood loss it is a very sincere and sad ending but a great one i love this movie and recommend it to anyone that is looking for a memorable flick the story is in depth everything is explained from beginning to end and nothing corny at all in any way or manner
<START> scarecrow is set in the small american town of <UNK> <UNK> where high school student lester <UNK> tim young is considered the local nerdy geek by teachers fellow students alike the poor kid suffers daily <UNK> bullying <UNK> general <UNK> destroying abuse at the hands of his peers unfortunately he doesn't find much support at home since his mom is a slut after lester <UNK> one of her <UNK> he chases him into a corn field <UNK> the poor kid however something magical happens no the film doesn't suddenly become good <UNK> spirit gets <UNK> into the corn fields scarecrow which he then uses as a body to gain revenge on those who tormented him made his life hell br br co written co produced directed by <UNK> <UNK> who according to the imdb credit list also has a role in the film as someone called mr <UNK> although i don't remember any character of this name i suppose anyone who ends up looking at the imdb pages for scarecrow will probably already be aware of it's terrible reputation i have to say it pretty much well deserved since it's terrible the script by <UNK> bill cunningham jason white uses the often told story of one of life's losers who gets picked upon tormented for no good reason getting their revenge by supernatural means in a relatively straight forward teen slasher flick we've seen it all before we've seen killer scarecrows before we've seen <UNK> teens being killed off one by one before we've seen one of life's losers get his revenge before we've seen wise cracking villains who make jokes as they kill before we've seen incompetent small town <UNK> make matters even worse before the only real question to answer about scarecrow is whether it's any fun to watch on a dumb teen slasher type level the answer is a <UNK> no to be honest the film has terrible character's awful dialogue an inconsistent predictable story it has some cheesy one liners like when the scarecrow kills someone with a <UNK> he <UNK> <UNK> you dig it ' the so called twist ending which is <UNK> towards leaving things open for a sequel is just lame the film moves along at a reasonable pace but it isn't that exciting the kills are forgettable you know i'm still trying to work out how someone can be stabbed killed with a stick of corn br br director <UNK> doesn't do a particularly good job here the kill scenes are poorly handled with no build up whatsoever which means there's never any tension as within two seconds of a character being introduced they are killed off also i'm not happy with the killer scarecrow dude doing all these back <UNK> <UNK> through the air in scenes which feel like they belong in the matrix 1999 or some japanese kung fu flick to give it some credit the actual scarecrow mask looks really good he looks pretty cool but he is given little to do except <UNK> bad one liners <UNK> around a bit don't you think that being tied to a wooden stake in the middle of a corn <UNK> all day would have been boring i know he's a killer scarecrow but i still say he would have been bored just hanging around on a wooden stick all day there's no nudity the gore isn't anything to write home about there's a <UNK> <UNK> face is burnt someone is killed with a stick of corn someone gets a <UNK> stuck in their throat some <UNK> are stuck in people's heads someone has their heart ripped out someone has a metal thing stuck through the back of their head which comes out of their mouth br br with a supposed budget of about 250 000 this was apparently shot in 8 days well at least they didn't waste any time on <UNK> things like story character development technically this is pretty much point shoot hope for the best stuff if you look at the guy on the floor who has just had his heart ripped out you can clearly see him still breathing the acting sucks the guy who played <UNK> <UNK> bloke is wearing the most stupid looking wig fake <UNK> ever because he played two roles in the film the makers needed to disguise him but they just ended up making him look ridiculous don't get me started on his accent br br scarecrow has a few fun moments the actual scarecrow himself is a nice creation with good special make up effects but as a whole the film is poorly made badly acted silly too predictable very cheesy if you want to see a great killer scarecrow flick then check out scarecrows 1988 not to be confused with the gene hackman al pacino film scarecrow 1973 or the upcoming horror flick scarecrow 2008 which is currently in production scarecrow proved popular enough on home video to <UNK> two more straight to video sequels scarecrow <UNK> 2003 scarecrow gone wild 2004
<START> i am proud to say i own an uncut copy of this choice <UNK> of 70's crown international drive in <UNK> comedy cheese on dvd it's a really goofy and <UNK> <UNK> flick with a nicely <UNK> 70's vibe to it it does attempt to make a sincere point about true love and friendship being more important in life than a cool set of <UNK> and a quick piece of tail sure it's essentially a blatant adolescent male fantasy <UNK> the main teen <UNK> character bobby hamilton gets the girls the respect of his friends and a chance to show up a local van racing bully but it's way too dopey and good natured to hate stuart <UNK> as our <UNK> protagonist makes for an <UNK> <UNK> lead deborah white as the main object of <UNK> affection is a definite <UNK> connie lisa marie is likewise quite <UNK> as a <UNK> blonde babe and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> oliver a 60's biker movie <UNK> is wonderfully hateful as the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a pre stardom danny <UNK> in particular is an absolute riot as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> owner boss andy a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> do well <UNK> who wears very ugly loud <UNK> shirts and suffers from a severe gambling habit i especially love the scene where two thugs brutally beat danny up one holds his arms behind his back while the other guy works over <UNK> <UNK> and sammy <UNK> <UNK> catchy <UNK> hit theme song will be <UNK> around your skull for at least a week in short it's great <UNK> retro 70's fun
<START> i was one of those few americans that grew up with all of <UNK> <UNK> marvelous creations thunderbirds was a great series for the time and would have made a great action adventure movie if only the writers could have figured out where to target it br br i expected it to be a romp but i did not expect it to aim at such a low age group like lost in space this could have been both visually stunning and exciting it should have focused on more action adventure and the goal of the original series saving people in trouble br br instead it focused on alan saving the day instead of his brothers who were cast too young anyway vs the original the <UNK> part was lady penelope and parker i didn't care too much for the characters in the original but i was grateful for them in the movie they stole the show br br i always enjoyed thunderbirds more for the high tech than the stories and even that did not get enough screen time as far as i was concerned i would have enjoyed seeing more of the cool <UNK> br br but then i'm just a big kid
<START> <UNK> is a serious movie about the cultural <UNK> between an <UNK> population and the <UNK> white man although filmed in a documentary style seemingly with non professionals <UNK> is a skilled production that contains a believable story the audience will want to see through to the final shot br br the native <UNK> simply has different beliefs and <UNK> about women and life than do the <UNK> that <UNK> his landscape when an <UNK> man loses his mate it is natural that other men share their women with their friend it is also usual for their women to want to take the place of the missing <UNK> all of this seems natural in the context of the desolate foreboding <UNK> setting the <UNK> <UNK> falls prey to <UNK> white <UNK> with heavy european accents that do not view these natives as their equals <UNK> drunken <UNK> rape and death occur after the <UNK> men <UNK> for work on the icy cold <UNK> eventually the lead <UNK> <UNK> realizes that he has been <UNK> and he takes his revenge the audience would have <UNK> in the 1930's theaters br br enter the royal canadian <UNK> police and the moral dilemma of whether to bring back <UNK> for trial the <UNK> are played as feeling policemen that know this is not a cut and dry case will the <UNK> get their man is it fair to hold <UNK> to a code of behavior outside of his traditional society is there a way out that does not <UNK> <UNK> is it inevitable that the white man's law must <UNK> is there no hope for innocence br br this is not a great movie but one that you will enjoy for the depth of the issue addressed in a very different setting i suspect that the filming of the sequences with animals was done before today's <UNK> that none were injured in the making of the film so beware of the raw nature sequences highly recommended
<START> a must see film with great dialogues great music great acting and a superb atmosphere br br in the film you will follow 8 people for one day in the city of <UNK> they are all individuals and sometimes plain weird that's how i love them br br i'm not going to say anything else just go see and enjoy it
<START> there's nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you off the streets it's just that some are better than others this is very poor the acting is awful the script dire and the special effects overrated br br why does hollywood treat it's audience with such contempt and why have they made a sequel
<START> this movie has several things going for it it is a feel good story the characters and actors are likable realistic and present fine performances most important i believe is that dennis quaid knows how to grip and throw a baseball robert redford looked good both throwing and swinging a bat in the natural and so did kevin <UNK> in for love of the game and bull <UNK> in major league tom berenger and charlie sheen looked like they knew what they were doing but many of the others did not and that picture was pure silliness and not very funny br br so many earlier baseball movies even where the stories might be interesting presented such a lack of baseball ability on the part of the leads they were ludicrous in this respect in the <UNK> story and <UNK> air command jimmy stewart looked about as believable as a professional baseball player as your overweight non athletic elderly uncle in the <UNK> game at the family reunion other <UNK> and physically <UNK> stars e g gary cooper as lou <UNK> <UNK> reagan as <UNK> cleveland alexander and dan <UNK> as <UNK> dean also <UNK> a degree of baseball ability that would put them in the late rounds while choosing up for a game at the sunday <UNK> even if <UNK> and even if your uncle were involved br br the scenes of <UNK> high school team he <UNK> the ones where he <UNK> his <UNK> with the devil <UNK> and those with him playing in two minor <UNK> and in the american league all ring true the participants are believable and capable in addition he is an engaging actor who always delivers a talented and appropriate characterization except to a degree some of his over the top scenes and his forced accent in his portrayal of jerry lee lewis but he's definitely on target here and this movie is a 9 as good or better as any others of this genre except for the natural
<START> i found this film to be a fascinating study of a family in crisis when leo the oldest <UNK> that he is hiv the reactions of the family members alone and with each other was touching and yet strange br br i have never seen a family that was as physically <UNK> as this one nor one as likely to shout at each other i didn't understand why the family felt that youngest couldn't deal with the news but once past that difficult i found this a thoroughly moving film br br
<START> <UNK> is truly a marvelous film i write this to <UNK> a review from someone called <UNK> that has appeared on this site first of all the idea that either <UNK> first film 'the <UNK> is somehow tv is an extraordinary statement here is a film that has been significantly praised around the world as is simply one of the best australian films ever made it fully deserved to win best picture <UNK> is a brave bold and courageous departure for me it works on every level and i have now seen it twice <UNK> is a filmmaker who is <UNK> great skill and incredible sensitivity for <UNK> to make the comment that it is another tv movie etc and that hugo <UNK> is no good simply does not <UNK> the film or more particularly does not want to get it frankly it is the sort of comment that one expects from either another filmmaker who is jealous or bitter or both or someone from inside the industry either distribution <UNK> or <UNK> your average <UNK> i have found just does not write comments like that i have noticed other comments on the site and reference to the film <UNK> one has to wonder what people think they are looking at unfortunately in australia at the time ss was released the push was if you did not like it then there was something wrong with you not the film this manipulation of the media is pretty common down under the reality is the only similarity between the two films are that they are rights of passage films unfortunately for me ss is a film about nothing that could have been told in 15 minutes i see it as a one dimensional film about anxiety <UNK> in comparison is a master piece personally i cannot wait to what <UNK> does next as he is clearly way ahead of any of his <UNK> when it comes to cinema in conclusion if the film does not win all at this years <UNK> and if awards then it is a <UNK> game as for <UNK> please find something more <UNK> do with your time
<START> me my boyfriend and our friend watched this movie if thats what u wanna call it and we agree with the last person but we were stupid and bought the damn thing we thought it really was about <UNK> so we bought it br br we hate it really <UNK> so beware do not buy this thing they call a movie br br we would return it but don't no if anybody would want this stupid movie br br oh and another thing the shouldn't call it the legend of <UNK> they should of called it legend of <UNK> br br and this movie is rated r this should not of even been not rated br br we think that <UNK> would be crying his eyes out laughing at this stupid movie br br this is a movie that would have been done by a church br br <UNK> actors are never gonna become nothing because this movie
<START> <UNK> set the <UNK> machine for 1986 the united states was just climbing out of its worst <UNK> <UNK> while japan was enjoying an <UNK> industrial boom <UNK> <UNK> were still a significant part of the us economy and factory workers were a good example of the average american the word <UNK> hadn't entered the general <UNK> yet but everyone knew the phenomenon bruce could be heard on the radio singing <UNK> says these jobs are going boy and they ain't coming back to your hometown <UNK> had just been <UNK> out by uncle sam <UNK> <UNK> could be seen saying buy american the job you save may be your own br br <UNK> ho does a better job of capturing the mood of the american industrial <UNK> than just about any other popular movie made during that period certainly the movie has its flaws some loose plot threads and mediocre acting jobs by everyone except michael keaton and <UNK> <UNK> but the story really is about the meeting of east and west keaton's hunt stevenson <UNK> america <UNK> and confident on the outside yet insecure underneath <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> japan on top of the heap with a successful system but wondering if there is more to be learned from their western rivals the movie's plot flawed as it is simply provides a <UNK> for the conflict and eventually <UNK> of their two personalities br br keaton's acting <UNK> everyone else's and practically makes the movie by itself i've always admired keaton for his ability to deliver lines that feel improvised no matter what script he's following his character hunt stevenson is a likable <UNK> <UNK> a natural leader with a wise ass streak but he has a fatal flaw common to many of us he doesn't want to disappoint anyone he'll distract the crowd with inspirational <UNK> and even lie rather than point out the ugly truth br br <UNK> is the mirror image of stevenson shy and <UNK> but also because of his japanese upbringing reluctant to be the <UNK> of bad news the scene in which stevenson first comes to <UNK> with the <UNK> <UNK> captures perfectly the japanese approach to <UNK> conflict <UNK> replies to <UNK> complaints with i understand what you are saying but won't refuse his <UNK> out loud stevenson <UNK> this as <UNK> and goes away saying okay we've got that settled this is still a problem in japanese american business relations in the 21st century br br ultimately <UNK> and stevenson have the same problem get the factory working smoothly meet production goals and fulfill their responsibility to the workers under them in working towards this goal they each have to take a page from the <UNK> book <UNK> family becoming more <UNK> is an obvious example also note that stevenson thinks it's odd when <UNK> explains how he had to make a public <UNK> to his workers for failing them and yet later in the movie stevenson does exactly that himself br br the plot and its resolution are a little <UNK> but hey this is a comedy if you can overlook the movie's flaws there is a great story about self realization and open <UNK> here
<START> right at this moment i am watching this movie for the second time on television and for the second time i fell into it when it was running for an hour already i think i saw 2 minutes more this time this movie is really <UNK> the way goldsworthy looks at nature changes nature in a way that you yourself would never think of really is amazing this whole movie gives you a warm feeling seeing him play with the world around him with such love or only seeing his hands covered in dirt and with broken <UNK> it just touches you
<START> i will never forget the night i saw this movie we were on a submarine on <UNK> in the north atlantic and this was the <UNK> movie of the evening we all gave up after the second reel they did not even try to show it at the mid night showing <UNK> for a <UNK> instead this is all i really have to say but they have this stupid rule that my comment must contain ten lines i'm not supposed to pad the comment with random words so i will just continue to <UNK> until i get my ten lines of <UNK> i could not find george <UNK> listed in the credits but i remember him in the movie the <UNK> was terrible and the songs even worse
<START> the truth is that a film based on a harold robbins novel is not going to win any awards this is no exception the lonely lady is a pure b picture in budget cast and execution technically it looks like a made for tv film the acting is very uneven joseph <UNK> is especially terrible anthony holland is an embarrassment as one reviewer said of a certain <UNK> hepburn performance her range goes from a to b ms <UNK> manages to get to g the rest of the cast is solid and wasted in their respective roles lloyd <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> deserved better still the whole thing can be a great deal of fun in a trashy sort of way as <UNK> robbins everything revolves around sex and nudity if you're looking for some fun and you're not too sober this could be for you
<START> freddy's dead the final nightmare starts as dream demon freddy krueger robert englund leaves a teenager <UNK> <UNK> on the <UNK> of <UNK> with no memory of himself who he is or why he is there the local police pick him up take him to a youth centre where child psychiatrist maggie <UNK> lisa zane interviews him she finds a newspaper cutting in his pocket which leads the two to elm street in <UNK> where they discover that no children live there therefore no victims for freddy kill anyone it all turns out that it's an elaborate plan by freddy to find his daughter use her to escape <UNK> when maggie realises what freddy is up to her some kids decide they have to kill freddy once for all br br directed by rachel <UNK> this was made with the intention of being the final a nightmare on elm street film which by this time had reached five of course as any horror film fan <UNK> if there's still money to be made from a franchise or a character then there's no way in hell freddy's dead the final nightmare was going to be the last one which of course it wasn't the a nightmare on elm street series has been a franchise of <UNK> returns as the films dropped in quality as the series progressed until we got here freddy's dead the final nightmare which for my money is probably the worst out of the lot of them the film moves at a reasonable pace it's rarely boring but it's so silly childish feels like some sort of live action cartoon with some awful set piece horror scenes that seem a million miles from wes craven's suspenseful effective early 80's original the sequence where <UNK> spencer is trapped inside a video game being played by freddy is terrible on it's own but then we are treated to shots of his body back in reality <UNK> around the house from wall to wall floor to ceiling which is quite the most ridiculous thing i've seen in a while or maybe the early scenes when the john <UNK> kid falls from a plane down to the ground just like the <UNK> cartoon character in the road runner cartoons or the absurd sight of freddy threatening the deaf carlos with <UNK> that he <UNK> to drop to the floor to make a loud noise or when he eventually kills him by <UNK> his knives across a <UNK> you can't take this seriously i was just sitting there not quite believing what i was seeing when they do finally try to kill freddy the hero is given a secret powerful special weapon yeah that's right a pair of cardboard 3 d glasses the character's are poor the dialogue is poor the plot is confusing it doesn't really stick to the elm street continuity overall the film is a bit of a mess the best thing i can say about it is that it has quite a bit of unintentional humour you can certainly laugh at it br br the film has major <UNK> problems as it tries to be dark scary sinister yet it's so silly simply looks ridiculous at times that any attempt at being serious falls completely flat there's not much gore in this one there's some cut off fingers some <UNK> someone falls on a bed of nails that's about it the body count is extremely low here with only three <UNK> the final twenty or so minutes of freddy's dead the final nightmare was in fact shot in 3 d although the version i saw presented this part as normal so i can't comment on how well this does or doesn't work but you can definitely see shots which are meant to be seen in 3 d which take advantage of the process the special effects <UNK> some are quite good actually while other's are terrible freddy's burnt make up this time looks quite poor br br this apparently had a budget of about 5 000 000 it had an opening weekend box office take of 12 000 000 the film has a few nice visual touches gags which makes the thing feel even more <UNK> than it already is the acting is really poor from the main leads although there are a few odd cameos including tom arnold <UNK> johnny <UNK> rocker alice cooper br br freddy's dead the final nightmare is probably the worst of the entire series apart from some unintentional laugh value there's not much here to recommend or enjoy fans of the series will probably like it defend it but for me this is about as far from wes craven's original classic shocker as it gets followed by new nightmare 1994 which tried to take freddy krueger the series in a new different direction
<START> <UNK> louise brooks works as a <UNK> and is missing something in her life she enters a miss france contest against the wishes of her boyfriend andre georges <UNK> and she wins she sets off for the miss europe title leaving her boyfriend behind she wins again but returns home to andre because he has asked her to once back together her life becomes mundane again so one night she writes a note to him and leaves to experience the fame that is waiting for her as miss europe andre follows her br br this film is a silent film with a piano music track all the way through it is also <UNK> up so everything seems fast limited dialogue has been added on afterwards and it is very phony the cast are alright bearing in mind that it is a silent film the best part of the film comes at the end but the story goes on a little too long after watching this i'm not really sure what the big deal was over the looks of louise brooks she has a terrible <UNK> that makes her face look fat i don't need to watch it again
<START> let me get the bad out of the way first james <UNK> is absolutely terrible trying to act his <UNK> of what was going on with the rookie training and events of the day really it is in stark contract to the other fire fighters without acting aspirations who are natural in their delivery br br that said it is an amazing film that is impossible to watch without tears in my eyes i am an english guy from london but i love new york and have visited many many times before and after september <UNK> it is a second home to me and i can't help but feel <UNK> at the loss of life but also the destruction of part of such an amazing beautiful city this is the real deal in with the fire fighters with everything <UNK> around them i am so glad the footage exists to show people how it was on the day it is a shame that they didn't use any footage of people jumping from the buildings because friends who were there tell me this is such a major part of their memory it should be included to show future generations just how terrible it really was br br conspiracy <UNK> can go to hell by the way
<START> okay just by reading the title you would think that it would be a good movie well at least i did it started out good but became so boring after the first half hour spoiler br br it tells a story about a mother that is so desperate for her daughter to become a <UNK> that she will go to any <UNK> to get what she wants the only problem is that her daughter's friend is the girl in the way she always wins the <UNK> therefore pushing the mother further towards <UNK> her after talking to a <UNK> the mother decides that the girl needs to be <UNK> up a bit so actions are taken but she eventually gets caught br br the cast is awful and the movie drags on too long with nothing happening don't waste your time watching this br br
<START> a flying <UNK> <UNK> literally by a crew of about 20 male space <UNK> travels hundreds of millions of light years from earth to check in on a colony <UNK> some 25 years ago on a <UNK> planet ' what they find is a robot more advanced than anything imaginable on earth a beautiful and totally socially inept young woman and her father a <UNK> <UNK> haunted by more than the demons of the ancient civilization he has immersed himself in br br on the surface this story is a pulp scifi murder mystery some compare it to shakespeare's <UNK> but this is a stretch and in some ways an insult to the scifi genre stripped of what makes it a scifi film sure its the <UNK> but how many hundreds of films can you say something similar about br br underneath this is a <UNK> tale about progress and technology and the social evolution necessary for its appropriate and safe use yet the film still proceeds with all the <UNK> for our future that we have come to expect from shows like star trek br br anne francis is not the only reason why this film is best described as beautiful the special effects and even the <UNK> of the backdrops are powerful enough to make the uninspired directing and uneven acting almost <UNK> if it were not for the goofy retro art <UNK> <UNK> of 1950s sci fi props you might think you were watching a 1960s piece br br this is a classic of that very special sub genre of sci fi i like to call 1950s sci fi and though not in my opinion the best it is certainly a must see for anybody interested in sci fi film and special effects the clever plot now rendered trite by its <UNK> in six or seven episodes of star trek lost in space and even <UNK> is worth paying attention to and will sustain the interest of most scifi fans <UNK> will be particularly interested in the various aspects of the film which seem to have inspired themes of star <UNK> original series aired about 12 years later though they may find themselves disappointed by the relatively mild 1950s <UNK> and the lack of any kind of racial <UNK> while i do not mean to <UNK> the lack of social progress <UNK> in this film was the one major problem i had with it br br some will probably see this film simply to catch a glimpse of young good looking leslie <UNK> in one of his first starring roles unfortunately <UNK> performance is only average and at times down right poor especially at the climax of the film walter <UNK> though quite excellent in other films over acts his role as well ms francis earl <UNK> and the amazing <UNK> the robot are the stand out actors in this crowd though on the whole the character actors filling in the ensemble do a good job the problems with the featured performances i think are as much the fault of the director and the editor as anything though they certainly got most of the film quite right
<START> i have two very major complaints regarding this film br br 1 that my local rental store <UNK> what is very clearly a soft core porn in the suspense category had i known what it was i would not have wasted my time renting it in the first place and yes this movie is a soft core porn br br 2 the title has nothing to do with the movie no one in this movie does anything that is either <UNK> or obsessive let alone a combination of the two br br actually make that three major complaints br br 3 that i for some reason watched the movie long enough to discover point number two on this list boy do i regret that stay away from this movie learn from my mistake this movie is <UNK> on virtually every level
<START> i have to <UNK> the genius who <UNK> this one edward <UNK> you're not as good as you think mate you can't grab on every piece of low cost amateur crap which sole intention has to be to get some bucks br br the filming is bad and i mean bad anyone with a camera would get the same result or better br br the acting lets just say don't go to the supermarket looking for actors the good ones usually come with a degree or at least have some damn experience the director mr jon <UNK> please find your purpose in life as a director you simply suck your directing is poor the angles are all messed up not in a good way the lines seem as if they're being read out of toilet paper and the damn music it always comes up when it shouldn't and goes out for no apparent reason and don't go for writer either by the way making movies isn't like serving on a <UNK> it requires art and skill things i really doubt you'll ever have br br instead of making a <UNK> shootout movie you should've shot this one back to oblivion and wait <UNK> something good came up or just go find a job on a <UNK> you'll have less stress and you'll save movie goers some money and a bad night br br vote 1 10 my first one
<START> i have just read the lead comment for this film that is on the front page with the voting results and cast run down br br why is it that some people can not take a film for what it is supposed to be br br this film is supposed to be a light hearted <UNK> in cheek family comedy things to make the kids laugh and things for the adults and that is exactly what this film does br br i laughed my nuts off at this film i thought carey put in a great performance and the whole film if watched at christmas really give you a bit of <UNK> cheer br br so to all of you film reviewers stop trying to sound like film students and knock every film because it is not taxi driver or the godfather and take films for what they are supposed to be entertainment
<START> this movie <UNK> to be a character study of <UNK> some reviewers have been <UNK> into assuming that because <UNK> is depicted the film is psychologically deep actually considering the <UNK> material it is surprisingly tedious and shallow with no <UNK> substance why is the main character the way she is you won't find out from the script for a better treatment of the same theme and a more entertaining movie try <UNK> belle de <UNK>
<START> normally when i go on a raid of the local hollywood video i head towards the b horror movies to me the basic principals behind a b horror movie is it's camp value heavy gore lots of needless nudity and special effects that anyone can put together with a pack of corn <UNK> and <UNK> i rented cradle of fear strictly because i've been a fan of the band since they released they're first <UNK> in 1995 the movie started off on an interesting note and then when i saw dani filth <UNK> on an extremely obvious <UNK> mask i laughed when i saw the lesbian sex scene for the sake of a lesbian sex scene i laughed even harder i spent pretty much the entire movie laughing and when i wasn't laughing i was shaking my head thinking about how a multi million dollar rock star would want to make a movie that seemed like it was on a budget of multi hundreds of dollars the whole point of this movie to me seemed to attract the hardcore <UNK> kids who think death destruction sex blood and satan are the greatest things invented since <UNK> <UNK> that was really it to me this movie seemed like 80 5 of the things that happened in this movie just happened for the sake of being satanic this movie had a lot of potential and really could have been a real good movie but in the end this movie really is just an extended cradle of filth video
<START> how many <UNK> times do we have to see a <UNK> walking by in the background <UNK> through a <UNK> reflection it's been done in two dozen movies in recent memory four dozen times in this choppy poorly done film there were only two freaky moments to appreciate when the ghosts <UNK> the personal spaces of two characters speaking of characters the acting was as flat as the <UNK> coke in the 64 oz cup i was drawing it from the side characters could have been pulled from various scooby doo cartoons there was the friendly aged sheriff there was the <UNK> weirdo living in the backwoods with the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with no development the most disturbing image was that of a murdered child in the beginning but rather than explore the child's murder which would have been interesting they just let us know that she was dead her parents had a hard time <UNK> her death with the community each other when they reach the cabin the scenes rarely <UNK> together with flashing images of the dead daughter <UNK> here there oh and the eerie sounds were also overdone you know what i mean <UNK> doors that open by themselves <UNK> in the forest <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> haven't seen that before again you'll see the amazing self opening door in the movie over and over an over again note to director a scary scene is only scary if it's not repeated every 5 minutes in the same film think these things out before calling out it's a wrap
<START> this complicated story begins fairly simply with an english journalist accepting a <UNK> from edgar allen poe and his friend lord <UNK> that he cannot spend a night in the haunted <UNK> castle once there the writer wanders around the dusty rooms and corridors until music and a glimpse of a <UNK> couple lead him into an empty room he sits at the <UNK> and starts to play the tune he has heard and is surprised to be <UNK> on the shoulder by the stunningly beautiful elizabeth <UNK> she informs him with an ambiguous charming eerie manner that she has prepared his room upstairs and that someone is always expected on this night the night of the dead thus begins a startling series of supernatural events that <UNK> the journalist all the rest of the night spoiler ahead it probably won't surprise too many viewers to learn that the lovely elizabeth is actually a ghost this doesn't prevent her from falling in love with the journalist but it does make things more complicated for them than for the average couple this is a fun movie with absolutely everything ghosts the spooky castle repeated visions of past events sex and violence though both have been toned down in the version most americans have seen over the years the <UNK> captivating barbara steele is the main reason to see it she has a strange charisma unlike anyone else you've ever seen in the movies recommended
<START> the notorious bettie page 2006 1 2 gretchen mol <UNK> taylor chris bauer jared harris sarah <UNK> david <UNK> austin <UNK> norman <UNK> dallas roberts br br mol shines as legendary pin up queen bettie page in a fine biopic br br gretchen mol is probably best known for being <UNK> as the next it girl a few years ago when no one knew who she was despite an infamous cover story by vanity fair among other media <UNK> but despite a few co starring roles here and there her predicted stardom seemed to <UNK> less <UNK> until now here as the famous pin up queen bettie page gretchen mol is indeed a shining star on the rise br br bettie page was <UNK> born raised as a god <UNK> and family oriented proper girl who seemed to find herself the <UNK> object of lust and affection as she grew older a gang rape that is <UNK> is wisely not <UNK> depicted nor is the subtle showing of her own father having less than decent designs for his own <UNK> which is important to understand how page managed to escape the possible nightmarish life for a career as an actress by heading to new york city in the 1950s when in fact that was the time and place to be to catch lighting in a bottle what page didn't realize is that in fact she would be just that when she arrived br br a beautiful <UNK> haired sweetheart with a divine figure page is spotted on <UNK> island one summer day by a black policeman asking to take her photograph which leads to her posing in his basement and eventually to the studios of irving <UNK> bauer and his sister paula taylor who <UNK> their <UNK> but considered pornographic stills to a unique <UNK> fetish types br br although page is rather <UNK> she is undeniably smart and knows that her body is not a sin and can see the forest for the trees in the sense that she is in control or at least <UNK> in what is offered her as work in that it is not <UNK> and she is having fun in her increasingly less <UNK> <UNK> until a <UNK> witch hunt seeks out a few <UNK> to make pornographic images a crime br br talented filmmaker mary harron and her screen writing partner <UNK> turner an american psycho and i shot andy <UNK> <UNK> the biopic <UNK> rather neatly and maybe a bit too <UNK> in getting at who really was bettie page although they do justice in depicting an era of <UNK> at its <UNK> large thanks to gifted cinematographer <UNK> <UNK> for his <UNK> gorgeous black and white images and also the <UNK> color segments that recall douglas sirk films of the era for its melodramatic <UNK> part feminist <UNK> and part american dream <UNK> the story <UNK> along nicely with fine performances by its ensemble including the comical bauer and taylor as siblings in <UNK> and harris having a field day as a fellow <UNK> with a taste for wine and <UNK> it's amusing to see <UNK> in a bit of stunt casting as a senator on a campaign for <UNK> after portraying news <UNK> edward r <UNK> in his last outing good night and good luck as an opposite the table role br br but hats off to the truly fine talents of mol as the <UNK> yet deeply <UNK> and most importantly intelligent bettie page who lets her child like innocence <UNK> through her bold nudity and now considered tame and quaint borderline <UNK> poses that caught the male fancy for decades and is still a <UNK> for human sexuality in this country and perhaps the world overall mol is perfect and <UNK> resembles her <UNK> subject down to her knowing <UNK> smile the real bettie page was reportedly not involved with the project but apparently gave her <UNK> and continues to live a somewhat secluded life that is <UNK> to in the final moments as to having found jesus and <UNK> her <UNK> image once and for all a shame since this film oddly <UNK> the <UNK> decency <UNK> within its subject <UNK> for all to see in its naked <UNK>
<START> this is one of those movies that appears on cable at like two in the afternoon to entertain bored <UNK> while they iron the acting is second rate poor <UNK> <UNK> seems to <UNK> through the whole film and god help gina <UNK> her accent is too over the top it sounds nothing like an true english woman it sounds forced and phony much like her acting she should stick to what she does best lesbian <UNK> con artist who plays in a rock roll band and has a drug problem the other characters are no better they are two dimensional empty vapid and silly how are we to supposed to care about these people at one point christy scott <UNK> <UNK> lost in central park really it's not that hard to <UNK> central park just follow any path out not only did i not care about any of the characters i downright hated them the only reason i even stayed with this train wreck of a film was fisher stevens even his brilliant humor couldn't save this dying fish each scene is typical romantic comedy fare and nothing is left to surprise us the script was awful as was the acting if you catch this fish throw it back
<START> this movie is a real gem the arc of the the plot is defined in the first 3 minutes the characters are sympathetic and clearly drawn their motives completely believable the dialogue is fresh and oh so real the situations are unique to the characters and not at all cliched or hackneyed until the climax that is then it's as if the movie went off the <UNK> a bit and it got a bit hokey and unbelievable but i don't want to <UNK> people from watching this film the first 3 <UNK> of it are truly remarkable i gave it an 8 there are some remarkable performances here check out this movie
<START> this film definitely gets a thumbs up from me it's witty jokes and even it's occasional stereotypical and <UNK> views on eastern european people had me in <UNK> throughout most of the film it's plot is clever and 100 original and will have you guessing throughout the entire film the one person i was most impressed with in this film was <UNK> duff it's plain and simple to see that she has taken a leap of faith stepped outside of the <UNK> <UNK> genre she's used to her accent is excellent and her acting performance was surprisingly crisp and well executed it is the best performance i have ever seen from <UNK> and i have seen most of her films her character <UNK> <UNK> is described as 'the britney spears of eastern <UNK> and this is seen in some of her mannerisms and the song 'i want to blow you <UNK> you also feel sorry for her as her performance really <UNK> you <UNK> is a very complex and confused character joan cusack had me laughing throughout the whole film with her sometimes slapstick humour but also her facial expressions and so on john <UNK> witty dialogue will probably make you chuckle throughout i strongly recommend this film
<START> taken in the context of the time it was made i found this a worthwhile movie while the details may be <UNK> the overall history was a nice <UNK> in addition i found <UNK> actors i knew a real pleasure who would imagine ben <UNK> as a <UNK> <UNK> i'll leave the rest of the star <UNK> to you as to the secondary casting this movie as one would expect from a movie made in the late thirties has many an enjoyable character actor but top <UNK> to andrew jackson's right hand man <UNK> the perfect touch of comedy well shot with beautiful ships and competent acting throughout out i recommend this for anyone with a taste for the slightly camp or an eye for a double period piece set at the dawn of america and made in a period when great names and top notch character actors were a real pleasure to enjoy
<START> i don't know what movie some of these other people watched but they must have seen a different joseph smith prophet of the <UNK> than the one i saw br br i think the movie was both well done and inspiring i think it's definitely worth watching it's apparent from the outset that a lot of care went into the making of this film the background scenery is beautiful br br i think the film does a good job of portraying joseph smith both as a man and as a prophet <UNK> spiritual experiences are portrayed with taste and <UNK> br br i would definitely recommend watching this movie
<START> i don't know why this conduct was ever <UNK> in the movie business this movie short is gross to say the least it is a bunch of 5 7 year old children wearing <UNK> with big bobby <UNK> acting like adults and too much so however it is interesting because it is a good example of how the good old days may not have been so good after all thank god we have laws against this kind of material now br br this is one short from the shirley temple festival
<START> apparently this is what happens when a director allows his 14 year old nephew to rewrite the dialogue on the set while he <UNK> himself <UNK> in the meantime as i said earlier although i've always wanted to catch one of paul <UNK> werewolf pictures this atrocity served as my introduction and as awful as it most certainly is i still intend to pursue other entries in the series albeit very gradually br br despite some high profile <UNK> like joe <UNK> the howling 1981 i love werewolf pictures in general but to be honest i quickly lost interest in this film's plot and just stood there <UNK> at my tv screen counting its <UNK> as it were there were far too many to mention them here but i have to say two which struck me as particularly hilarious were the <UNK> nature of the werewolf persona i e going from a raging beast in one shot to a <UNK> zombie like state in the very next one as if he's on a casual midnight <UNK> in the countryside and sporting an entirely different wardrobe to boot and yes i did know the reasons for this beforehand as well as the phantom of the opera look of the <UNK> character but what do i know perhaps the <UNK> full length version of this mess could very well have been a <UNK> <UNK> horror classic
<START> i love killer insects movies they are great fun to watch i had to watch this movie as it was one of my favourite horror books by shaun <UNK> br br i have met him and i wish i did listen to him as this movie was terrible like he said it was after he said that i was still dying to see how bad it was br br the plot people are dying mysteriously and <UNK> and nobody has a clue what the cause is br br only health worker mike brady has a possible solution but his theory of killer slugs is laughed at by the authorities br br only when the body count begins to rise and a slug expert from england begins <UNK> around does it begin to look like mike had the right idea after all br br this movie as the most overacting you ever see a movie slugs in this movie are fast then normal and it looks like they fast <UNK> the scenes br br this movie is nothing like the book at all the book was ten times scarier ten times gory and had a lot more story to it br br i didn't like this movie at all as i am huge fan of slugs the book and second book called <UNK> ground both of books are great br br read the book then watch the movie you may like more then i did give this 2 out 10
<START> some of the acknowledged altman masterpieces seem <UNK> to me now maybe it's me like the last reviewer i even like this lesser altman shown recently on <UNK> although i don't think he was aiming at a wide audience organization politics as a <UNK> for public <UNK> some of this satirical <UNK> is now dated like dick <UNK> watching the tonight show but i found much of the dialog funny and insightful e g you are for real that means you're no threat to anyone the story isn't profound but i liked it and the performances are funny especially <UNK> as himself lauren bacall as an aging conservative <UNK> glenda jackson who actually became a member of <UNK> as a left wing <UNK> in the opening scene <UNK> someone dressed as a <UNK> on the <UNK> of politics and carol <UNK> as a basket case all in the <UNK> altman style although maybe not quite as <UNK> as usual but pretty <UNK>
<START> i know slashers are always supposed to be bad but come on what the hell is this it's like a bunch of 10 year olds saved their lunch money and started filming this by the end of their week br br anyway six young people all go to the same house to get killed off screen we have the <UNK> one the slut the other slut the black guy the killer stereotypes like that after one gets eaten by a shaking boat the others all get stalked by some guy who wears a mask the people at the poor box rejected there's one pretty decent murder somewhere in the middle but then it's back to even more boredom and especially more false scares seriously we actually know it can't be the killer when a person gets attacked because the guy sure loves to take his sweet time for everything br br after every character you expected to die dies the standard ugly blonde chick and her soon to be boyfriend eventually get captured by the killer they get like pushed down and then faint and the killer reveals himself i think the writers of this movie just took a <UNK> and a pen and put it somewhere on the list of characters the motive is just lame and don't even get me started on the damn secret the killer then of course takes way too much time to explain everything and then about ten minutes extra in which he <UNK> up his own arm for some reason and eventually gets <UNK> by a guy with a gun hey no fair br br really one of the most awful movies i've ever seen i could enjoy myself more by watching a lindsay <UNK> movie i swear i mean sure most 80's slashers sucked as well but at least they threw in some t a this movie just has nothing going for it
<START> two films are useful for <UNK> people to god this and <UNK> <UNK> one has a significant and poignant message the other is as one dimensional as a religious movie can get too bad paul anderson went on to the <UNK> resident evil movies he really had something going br br thief in the night is <UNK> by many obvious independent film attributes acting storytelling dialog and <UNK> and it's obvious what the film's intentions are from the start the christian film industry hasn't learned from the failures of this so we are stuck with the <UNK> code left behind and the other <UNK> movies their underlying element is that they are so concerned with selling their message get saved folks that everything else becomes second to <UNK> the audience over the head with a bible br br overall i can't believe i'm even writing this much about a movie this <UNK> skip it entirely and go back to sam neil <UNK> out his <UNK> 1 out of 5
<START> i am not sure who is writing these br br glowing reviews for this movie but trust me it <UNK> i have seen hundreds of horror films and slasher flicks and this one is lame it is only about <UNK> long and believe me that is all i could take plot is terrible acting is even worse and there is no development at all br br even the david <UNK> films are better than this run away from jigsaw i expected to hate the acting which can be forgiven in direct to video movies if the plot is good br br this had no scares very little gore br br and a truly unattractive cast br br i watched this with three other friends br br who i hope are still talking to me br br they wanted me to <UNK> the disc out the window i can not believe anyone could have br br given this tripe a good review
<START> rather annoying that reviewers keep comparing this to planet earth of course planet earth is better it has much much more of the same earth is like an extended trailer for the planet earth series and as such is inevitably inferior and <UNK> but that is not comparing like with like br br as a feature length documentary or actually as a feature length anything it surpasses pretty much anything you will see in your entire life unless you choose to <UNK> the earth in <UNK> with long range cameras for years on end and wait for months in the most extreme <UNK> to catch a glimpse of the most extraordinary beings on earth which lets face it is unlikely br br on the narration yes everyone in the uk very much including me <UNK> david attenborough and there's little excuse for him not to be <UNK> here but that hardly deserves knocking down a star or three he wasn't a <UNK> on planet earth just a narrator and i'm sure he's modest and <UNK> enough to realise that anything that gets more viewers in is a good thing br br anyone who sees this will be overwhelmed by its awe <UNK> and glory all reviewers agree on that those who love it ie everyone will should go on to see an buy planet earth so three cheers for its cinematic release and a big <UNK> for anyone cheap enough to buy this on dvd rather than the planet earth box set but as works of art they're not in competition here people br br the earth is big enough for both
<START> i was really really disappointed with this movie it started really well and built up some great atmosphere and suspense but when it finally got round to revealing the monster it turned out to be just some psycho with skin problems again <UNK> de do yet another <UNK> movie like we don't already have enough of them br br to be fair the creep is genuinely unsettling to look at and the way he moves and the strange sounds he makes are pretty creepy but i'm sick of renting film like this only to discover that the monster is human albeit a twisted demented <UNK> one when i saw all the tell tale rats early on i was hoping for some kind of freaky rat monster hybrid thing it was such a let down when the creep was revealed br br on top of this some of the stuff in this movie makes no sense spoiler br br why the hell does the creep kill the security guard whats the point apart from sticking a great <UNK> sign up that says hi i'm a psycho and i live down here its stupid and only seems to happen to prevent <UNK> <UNK> character from getting help br br what the <UNK> he been eating down there i got the impression he was effectively <UNK> in and only the unexpected opening into that tunnel section let him loose so has he been <UNK> rats all that time and if so why do they hang around him so much why is he so damn hard to kill he's thin <UNK> and not exactly at peak performance but seems to keep going despite <UNK> that are equivalent to those that <UNK> the non psycho characters in the film br br the dvd commentary says we are intended to <UNK> with creep but i just find him <UNK> its an effective enough movie but it wasted so many opportunities that it makes me sick
<START> this movie is unbelievably ridiculous i love horror movies but this is the worst one i've ever seen i am a huge fan of gore but most of the deaths in this movie aren't shown it just shows us the already dead bodies and the only death scenes that they actually show in this movie are terrible the graphics look so obviously fake the actors are awful as well there is no real emotion from any of them not only did i waste my time watching this piece of sh t movie but i had to subject myself to actual footage of animals being beaten during the beginning of it if i could rate this a 10 i would f <UNK> this movie it's crap br br don't watch it
<START> i got this film about a month ago and i am now a fanatic fan of drew <UNK> i love a happy ending and this film gives a brilliant one with the truths of red sox <UNK> in it's about a <UNK> teacher who takes some promising kids on a <UNK> trip to a company where the successful lindsey drew shows them some information this then leads in the ben teacher and lindsey dating but it isn't all simple when he <UNK> he is a massive red sox fan br br first of all things are fine but then his baseball gets in the way of <UNK> life it's all fine in the end and it took one shot to get drew running across the field i got it for two <UNK> in blockbusters so i was happy if you like films like this i suggest you see some more of <UNK> work like charlie's angels and 50 first dates or even her new film with hugh grant in called music and lyrics
<START> <UNK> <UNK> who played the blind <UNK> zatoichi in a total of 27 movies ends the hanzo trilogy with this excellent film in which he gets to make love to a ghost <UNK> <UNK> blind beast br br the big stick used often in the pursuit of justice is retired forever br br <UNK> was his usual <UNK> self as he pursued those who would steal from the <UNK> to lend at <UNK> amounts to those who could not afford to pay br br the usual amazing <UNK> and skill of the big guy was present along with the blood br br i'm going to miss him
<START> this movie is difficult to watch in our fast paced culture of the 21st century but it is worth it for the messages that it conveys <UNK> the consequences and <UNK> of technology upon society specifically when that technology is used for <UNK> br br this movie presents a full circle cycle of <UNK> and <UNK> as influenced by the <UNK> of technology and the subsequent <UNK> of civilization and therefore serves as a <UNK> tale against the <UNK> of technology but as the circle <UNK> itself familiar themes and sentiments pop up again to present self serving rather than self destructive ways that humanity may <UNK> technology br br brilliant for it's time the picture and sound quality may pose a challenge for some but as a landmark in the history development and evolution of the sci fi genre it is a must in the end free will and free choice are once again <UNK> to humanity as a means for controlling our own destiny rather than having it served to us by someone else or indeed the state of br br society itself as shaped by world events br br those who are <UNK> by what life throws their way sometimes tend to remain so but yet there is always a <UNK> of hope and continuity that remains as this film <UNK> br br as far as <UNK> as sci fi one of the biggest common <UNK> of that genre is it's <UNK> nature it asks us the questions what if these events happened this way and what effect would it have on society or the individuals within it how would we react br br as far as influence this film projects those <UNK> <UNK> that make sci fi as unique as it is and keeps us asking those important questions
<START> this was a very good film i didn't go into it with very high expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the acting the script and the scenery miranda richardson was fantastic and so was joan <UNK> they stole the show but the other actors played their parts wonderfully also very enjoyable film
<START> i absolutely hate this programme what kind of people sit and watch this garbage ok my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure i'm well out of the room before it comes on its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i cant stand all detective <UNK> such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless what happened to detective <UNK> with real mystery i mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over 20 years ago i wish the bbc would put more comedy on <UNK> <UNK> now with the <UNK> of <UNK> finished there is more room for crap like this
<START> a warning to you not to be <UNK> by the names <UNK> and red <UNK> is pointless and <UNK> and made me think often of a phrase by <UNK> about wishing all the characters would be drowned together when someone brings up the category of worst films ever made it's not the likes of plan 9 or attack of the killer <UNK> that i think of it's the likes of this what a complete waste of time my own and everyone who was involved with this flick
<START> 2005 toronto film festival report it is official takashi miike is whacked br br the <UNK> midnight screening of the new takashi miike film the big <UNK> war or the great yokai war or <UNK> <UNK> call it what you will this is a <UNK> ride br br colin <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> stated this film was originally <UNK> towards children in japan think of lord of the rings or <UNK> story for japan after the screening i can understand where they were going with that but damn this is takashi miike after all he directed the <UNK> film <UNK> the killer when it screening at the festival <UNK> <UNK> were handed out at the screening and no that wasn't just a marketing <UNK> br br plot summary a young boy with a troubled home life becomes chosen and he stumbles into the middle of a great spirit war where he meets a group of friendly spirits who become his companions through his journey br br this is not really for kids well not <UNK> young certainly see them getting scared <UNK> with some of these spirits even the friendly ones on display this is unlike anything i've seen in the movie theater before a fantasy naturally some very funny but dark material you will not be bored can guarantee that will this ever hit north america <UNK> br br my rating b
<START> every once in a while in the wonderful world of horror <UNK> are crafted and one becomes completely <UNK> by its sheer brilliance this is no less than a diamond this is a film <UNK> of <UNK> chilling anticipation and dark atmosphere and i think it's safe to say one of my favourite horror films of all time and of course it contains probably the single most flat out scary sequence in the whole of history of horror every time i see the film and it gets up to the point where you know the inevitably will happen i try to remember exactly when i will be frightened out of my wits but it never fails to happen i never get it right and i find myself as <UNK> as the first time i saw it now it must be said to scare a jaded horror fan like that that is nothing short of pure perfection unlike the americans the brits know their subtleties they take pride in the art of acting they do not need any special effect in order to convey atmosphere they rely on the power of the potent story and the creepiness in this case of suggestion and anticipation every single element is impeccable from the set pieces the acting the story to the menacing atmosphere pauline <UNK> surely could make the devil <UNK> that's for sure as an end note if you for some demented reason don't like this piece of insanity then you honestly don't know what horror is all about and frankly do not deserve to know it either thank you
<START> now i like sci fi cartoons however when <UNK> appeared in canada in late 2006 i watched the premiere and was inevitably appalled the characters are generic and stereotypical do they really need to make an african american man wear tiger <UNK> print clothing and speak in a <UNK> accent why are all the asian characters vibrant yellow and <UNK> does the mother have to have big <UNK> and chest and constantly complain to the point where things become unrealistic predictable gross and sometimes disturbing there are heavy similarities to even stabs at <UNK> boy allow me to explain dub names for the young <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shadow gus <UNK> tommy <UNK> lola <UNK> kennedy <UNK> <UNK> and it so on brief <UNK> to my life as a teenage robot star wars teenage mutant ninja <UNK> <UNK> riders sailor moon and co are <UNK> not to mention the <UNK> racial gender stereotyping don't even get me started on the <UNK> i'll just say they're hidden and quite dirty but seriously don't even try watching this especially if you like <UNK> boy
<START> chris <UNK> is a great sketch actor on saturday night live but he should probably leave the movie industry alone unless he gets some sort of creative control he plays an annoyingly <UNK> character who basically comes off as mildly retarded and on speed wanna know the only funny parts the stuff they showed in the previews yes his rendition of take on me is funny nothing else is especially when you can tell he's trying very hard to be a physical comedian which he shouldn't have to try at because he is one and yet his <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> bit comes off as <UNK> bad this movie made me develop an eye <UNK> avoid it at all costs and keep watching snl
<START> what an appalling film don't get me wrong gene hackman and denzel washington are good actors but aside from a few interesting set pieces the film is mostly taken up with hysterical <UNK> shouting crying <UNK> and generally freaking out when anything goes wrong br br take that with simplistic <UNK> to make sure the audience still understand what's going on the scene where denzel washington explains to a radio <UNK> how he must be like <UNK> in star trek is nothing more than a joke and you have a <UNK> down thriller not worthy of the acting br br let us just hope that the real nuclear us navy is not in the hands of such a script br br
<START> let's see here are the highlights of the brain machine 15 establishing shots of a pool and a house 15 establishing shots of a <UNK> office building 5 <UNK> by a bland <UNK> 7 close ups of a menacing guard and a <UNK> of technical <UNK> to show us this is a high tech experiment br br various posters have commented on the <UNK> between the <UNK> date of 1972 and the release date given on the dvd box of 1977 that's an easy one to explain this dog simply sat on the shelf <UNK> for five years until someone <UNK> it off thinking it fit in perfectly with the post <UNK> mood of <UNK> in government after seeing the brain machine now my only wonder is that it ever got released at all
<START> look this is quite possibly one of the best movies america has to offer the rest of the world to hate this movie is to hate freedom itself i remember that the early 80's were a time of <UNK> the economy was weak communism threatened us all and nuclear destruction was almost a <UNK> out of that confusion came a hero <UNK> ace ned <UNK> performance in this movie showed he was never again to be type cast as a one dimensional victim in the wilderness his triumph is an inspiration to all the on screen chemistry between burt and <UNK> draws obvious comparisons to brad and jennifer jim <UNK> is a poet go see this movie tonight
<START> i was rooting for this film as it's a remake of a 1970s children's tv series escape into night which though chaotic and stilted at times was definitely odd fascinating and disturbing the acting in paperhouse is wooden unintentionally a joke the <UNK> didn't add tension they only <UNK> that i was sat watching a <UNK> casting <UNK> the dreary dialogue which resulted in relationships lacking warmth chemistry or conviction as in most <UNK> films there are a few good supporting acts these people should be <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> that they will not be held responsible out of all the possible endings the most unexpected was chosen <UNK> than i could have <UNK> br br escape into night deserves a proper remake written by someone with life experience and directed with a subtle mind
<START> my <UNK> i found this movie to be very <UNK> it started out good but quickly got unbelievable ridiculous most of the acting was poor with the exception of the little girl <UNK> who really was terrific in addition the dialog was predictable lame especially <UNK> the <UNK> also without giving away anything when one of the characters has a tragedy she almost appears <UNK> at first we thought it was <UNK> but then we realized that it was just a terrible script we love almost all of the hallmark movies their heart warming stories but this movie doesn't rise to the occasion of being one there are so many great ones don't waste your time with this horrible movie
<START> i have to admit that i liked the first half of <UNK> it looked good the acting was even better the story of childhood pain and revenge was interesting and moving a superior hollywood film but no one mentioned this so far at least in the latest 20 comments when it came to the courtroom scenes and brat <UNK> character followed his plan to rescue his two friends who are rightly accused of murder i felt cheated this movie insulted my intelligence br br warning spoilers br br why did anyone accept their false <UNK> witnessed by the priest if these two guys had been with him why <UNK> they tell this during the investigation <UNK> if you were the judge or member of the jury would you believe it is it wise to give the <UNK> of the murderers away br br i am sorry but in the end the story is very weak and this <UNK> me this movie had great potential 4 10
<START> this movie is very good the screenplay is enchanting but meryl streep is most impressive her performance is excellent she brings me to go into the heart of her role
<START> a sweet natured young mountain man with a sad past henry thomas comes upon an abandoned baby girl in the woods and instantly falls in love with her the town <UNK> generally support him in keeping the child though a local <UNK> <UNK> seymour thinks little of the new family a determined little girl on a long walk and a sinister travelling salesman david <UNK> at his <UNK> have parallel stories which <UNK> in a <UNK> way this is a charming slice of life in the <UNK> in the same vein as where the <UNK> bloom the <UNK> all three were shot on location in those beautiful hills and cover the lives of simple living but not simple minded american folk a minimum of strong language and brief but pointed violence make this fairly safe family viewing
<START> i grew up during the time that the music in this movie was popular what a wonderful time for music and dancing my only complaint was that i was a little too young to go to the <UNK> and <UNK> guess it sounds like i'm living in the past i do have wonderful memories so what's wrong with that world war 2 was a terrible time except where music was concerned glenn <UNK> death was a terrible sadness to us this movie will be a favorite of mine <UNK> <UNK> was excellent what a voice i don't know how i ever missed this movie my main reason for this commentary is to alert the modern generation to an alternative to rap and new age music which is offensive to me please watch this movie and give it a chance
<START> although the notorious bettie page is well acted and shot is is at best a <UNK> notes version of <UNK> biography the film mainly centers on her work with irving and paula <UNK> the brother and sister team who produced the bulk of her most famous photos it does not detail her life after posing aside from her religious <UNK> it <UNK> the real bettie page by richard foster as a source but it ignores <UNK> later years of mental illness and <UNK> in a mental hospital the narrow focus of the biography can be <UNK> but the majority of <UNK> fans and the civilians would probably be more interested in her <UNK> career which is what they get br br the film is well acted with gretchen mol <UNK> <UNK> the look of bettie as well as conveying the <UNK> that her photos <UNK> the character is played as rather naive a <UNK> <UNK> of interviews given by bettie in recent years it is more likely that bettie was aware of the nature of her photos but <UNK> it as acting and costumes br br the supporting cast is also outstanding with chris bauer and <UNK> taylor playing irving and paula <UNK> and david <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> the film <UNK> with the character of john willie played by jared harris john willie never met bettie page and was not involved in photo shoots with the <UNK> harris plays willie a bit like peter o'toole in his more <UNK> state br br despite the quality of acting the film is a bit of a disappointment in terms of depth the story is rather <UNK> and we never feel that we truly get to know bettie much like her photos it's just an image it does tend to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> her photos were mainly seen in and around new york in a very narrow market of underground and <UNK> <UNK> her real fame came after her photos were <UNK> in the late 70's and 80's and the cult of betty page as her name was usually spelled grew <UNK> greatest exposure <UNK> the pun was in playboy appearing in the january 1955 issue the christmas photo which is staged in reverse in the film br br the film is well done if rather shallow it is able to sustain interest until the end and showcases many fine performances it hits the high points of <UNK> life but ignores many details which would have given it far greater depth the ending is rather a let down it feels rather abrupt still the movie is definitely worth viewing by anyone interested in bettie or even the time period the soundtrack is great really pulling the viewer into the 1950's if nothing else the film stands as a showcase for america's <UNK> sexuality and the clash with its <UNK> past it's also a <UNK> at an icon for both men and women
<START> i've watched almost all of the gundam <UNK> anime that have showed in the us and this by far has the best story the way its plot twists and turns has u <UNK> gundam wing is a series that mainly focuses on politics and war the series follows a group of five 15 year old boys who have been trained to pilot state of the art mobile suits known as <UNK> the gundam pilots were trained to battle a powerful <UNK> known as oz as things begin to heat up between oz and the gundam pilots new political groups will form and old ones will <UNK> old conflicts will end and new ones will <UNK> to obtain peace the gundam pilots must come to grips with the events taking place in their world and put an end to all the fighting but how far are people willing to go to obtain their goal i recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a show that has a deep plot
<START> this movie was a fantastic comedy it had a lot of comedians star in it like akshay kumar <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and john abraham br br <UNK> <UNK> was good at playing akshay <UNK> wife and so were all the air <UNK> mr hot as mac akshay kumar and mr cool as sam john abraham are two fashion <UNK> who like the same girl maggie <UNK> <UNK> when john abraham <UNK> on his work he becomes akshay <UNK> senior and akshay kumar gets really jealous because his flat has to be given to john abraham and <UNK> <UNK> starts liking john more akshay kumar wants to be better than john abraham so he finds a flat and he is going out with three different girls <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> daisy <UNK>
<START> now i've always been a fan of full <UNK> puppet work but i have to say that robot <UNK> is one of there better projects yes you heard me the story works wonderful the atmosphere really works and the actors do a first rate job gary graham who really makes his mark on tv in shows like alien nation the series and star trek enterprise shows that he can be an action star who kicks ass and takes name the stop motion effects could have been a tiny bit better the color was wrong they look plastic to me instead of the metal they were suppose to be but that is a minor complaint compared to the whole that is the robot <UNK> if you like gary graham or other full moon movies then you will like this movie 9 stars out of 10
<START> this movie was probably about as silly as the naked gun which was supposed to be case in point br br 1 in order to fake her drowning roberts is secretly taking swimming lessons at the <UNK> after her death the <UNK> calls her husband at work to give their <UNK> hello how did they get his work number br br 2 before she leaves town she drops her wedding ring in the toilet days or even weeks later her <UNK> finds it in the john does this mean the toilet was never <UNK> br br 3 no explanation is given on how she is paying for her mothers care in the retirement home since she did it behind her rich husbands back br br 4 towards the end of this tiresome film roberts suspects her husband is in the house instead of running for her life she runs to the kitchen instead to see if the <UNK> are <UNK> neatly
<START> well here we have yet another role <UNK> movie there were many worth watching despite the tired plot of gender <UNK> however this one is not in previous reviews i think i've made my point about the general decline of enjoyment for <UNK> movies that followed the late 80s this is one of them br br <UNK> one of the girls' is about a high school kid corey <UNK> who tries to avoid his bullies by dressing up as a girl and attending another school he joins the <UNK> squad and makes friends with fellow <UNK> marie nicole <UNK> obviously he can't keep up the <UNK> for too much longer br br i thought this movie was utter crap and it wasn't even funny but judging by a majority of reviews it looks like fans of <UNK> <UNK> or teen sex queen nicole <UNK> are the only ones who'd want to watch this if you're looking for a good <UNK> feature or role switching comedy look no further than 1989 this is about the point that <UNK> career <UNK>
<START> had this movie been made a few years later i would have given it a lower score however for <UNK> this was a dandy little movie and still stands up pretty well today just don't try to compare this silent film to later <UNK> the industry changed so <UNK> that the shorts of the first decade of the 20th century don't look at all like movies made in the <UNK> and beyond br br this movie is 11 minutes long about average for most films back then and is a variation of the edgar allen poe story the <UNK> of <UNK> while many are familiar with the story i won't elaborate further as i don't want to ruin the film just suffice to say that it's very creepy
<START> one of the greatest film i have seen this year last maybe before sun rise which is also seen late at night alone in the lab i like the idea of the film which suggest free will of man and our weakness against fate with time past by james and kathryn are destined to fail and an <UNK> sorrow comes i do like the end but a big question also comes the virus shall not be released again should it br br in the last scene in the airport jose is sent back to meet james again by future scientists when he tell him that scientists had already got his message and know someone else would spread the virus and they two together meet kathryn when kathryn tell james the true man is dr <UNK> assistant so it is clearly jose also get the true information about the virus james keep an eye on him at the time remember and he has teeth so why everything is still happen why future scientists don't do anything after the truth is revealed my biggest question after the film
<START> there isn't more i can say that saying this film was awful the whole <UNK> is <UNK> in your being because of the <UNK> was a hard sell but telling the audience that every chinese knows chinese history without even studying it just laughable that is like saying every american knows american history without studying or every <UNK> etc etc it just isn't believable br br the story is flat out hideous it talked about shin being from a monastery in china later <UNK> it from <UNK> however the early sequences of the film show the map focusing in on <UNK> i know the current chinese regime wants to claim areas like <UNK> for its own granted but its a distinct nation and it even <UNK> <UNK> on the map did disney studios fail <UNK> grade <UNK> br br the relationship between wendy and shin is superficial at best and yet she somehow feels connected to him her training is just cheesy as well and lets cut to the chase everything about this film is bad its bad enough to laugh at and cry over the <UNK> action was over played and unrealistic in many instances br br the evil eyes thing was cheesy however the left out ending would have been the only descent thing about it they should have left the evil eyes ending in it but instead somehow evil is defeated <UNK> br br overall not worth the time of the dog in the film brenda song should get on with another studio f
<START> ok first of all let me say that i'm still amazed of how the plot sucks br br but than again its a movie that sequels a steven segal movie only with no steven segal <UNK> br br just random low budget action scenes really no point i <UNK> still amazed i burned 90 min on this crap really br br just rent a <UNK> chan movie or go see <UNK> more fun and has no and presume not to have and plot <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> avoid it btw the best actor playing there is bill goldberg and that says a lot br br and no he doesn't play very well like i said <UNK> avoid it <UNK> i still cant believe i wasted 90 min and spent 10 min more writing this
<START> bo <UNK> beauty and john <UNK> revolutionary direction make this film worthwhile br br bo looking more gorgeous than ever is a recently widowed woman who is experiencing <UNK> from her <UNK> husband anthony quinn he has a plan bo must <UNK> the body of a young man so that her ghost of a husband can make his transformation from <UNK> back to <UNK> life can she find a fitting candidate how will she do him in so tony can do his thing br br with <UNK> attributes john's unique direction <UNK> film presence and thanks to john a very pretty exotic look to the entire film this movie is pleasant viewing
<START> this movie is sort of a carrie meets heavy metal it's about a <UNK> guy who gets picked on alot and he totally gets revenge with the help of a heavy metal ghost it is such a classic the soundtrack is a you've got living legends of metal in it and marc price was great in this film this is a must have for metal fans
<START> i saw this film recently in a film festival it's the romance of an ex alcoholic unemployed man who just came out of a big depression and a single middle aged woman who works in an <UNK> office <UNK> i found the story very simple and full of clichés taking the <UNK> theme of the movie and turn it in to a romance comedy the lead actor did a good job he definitely looks like an alcoholic man but <UNK> <UNK> is not believable as a working class woman she looks acts and talks very much like a <UNK> <UNK> woman what i mean is that <UNK> <UNK> plays herself she does it in all her movies anyway the whole <UNK> en scene of the film was very poor the photography is ugly not using well at all the <UNK> aspect ratio the dialogue sounds totally scripted and dull most of the times the comic situations are typical from <UNK> <UNK> but in this case they are not funny at all and are resolved poorly in my opinion this film is not worth watching only if you really love <UNK> previous films you might enjoy this one a little bit anyway i walked out of the theater because i felt i was wasting my time the film maker was by the door i wonder what a director feels like when he sees someone walking out of one of his films specially one that is made to please everybody
<START> chris rock apparently desperate for a <UNK> star vehicle which would cross his appeal over to white and mainstream black audiences <UNK> the hit 1978 comedy heaven can wait with an urban agenda he plays a struggling comedian involved in a car accident who has his soul removed too soon from his body consequently his angels must find another body to place him in and can only come up with that of a white businessman <UNK> a movie as bland and sentimental as heaven can wait only shows that <UNK> eye was on the box office this was strictly a corporate move organized by the most <UNK> of hollywood players why not <UNK> for something <UNK> or more memorable than a silly reincarnation comedy that <UNK> with an evening at the apollo terrific supporting cast including the usually reliable <UNK> king the wonderful mark <UNK> <UNK> sykes eugene levy and terrific frankie <UNK> do what they can but rock seems awkward and unsure of himself throughout 1 2 from
<START> for a first film in a <UNK> series it achieves the right balance it is done with style and class showing <UNK> early days as a <UNK> and the start of her rise to power in the criminal world i think it is a very honest true portrayal of her character exactly as the writer peter <UNK> intended alexandra <UNK> as modesty is stunningly beautiful and an excellent choice she acts very convincingly as the tough survivor with an exterior of cool intelligent innocence and full marks to tarantino for choosing an unknown actress for the role much more <UNK> to have a new face creating the part i'm looking forward to the next film
<START> when my wife and i decided to watch this movie we thought it couldn't fail i love billy crystal my wife loves julia roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved it br br we were <UNK> in <UNK> br br on my part i felt billy <UNK> character was extremely one dimensional and did very little for the film sure he <UNK> a couple of good jokes but as a character he did nothing but take up space br br and poor julia roberts in past shows she plays well as a strong <UNK> self determined lady in this flick she seems completely repressed and had very little fire this is not the julia roberts that my wife enjoys watching br br ok if i were to find one good thing it would have to be christopher walken now that's entertainment but just like billy crystal hardly anything is shown of his character br br if you're looking for a night of mindless laughs with very little redeeming value go see it but if you're looking for a smart romantic comedy this is not your film it's none of the above
<START> thanks to kevin smith a bunch of <UNK> are running around saying that return of the jedi isn't any good because it's actually fun to watch and oh no muppets are involved that makes it bad everyone liked return of the jedi until someone in a kevin smith movie made a negative comment about it now all of a sudden people people look at you like you have some kind of disease if you mention how much you like it this movie is so much better than anything kevin smith ever even considered creating that it <UNK> my mind that the man would even think of <UNK> it this movie is good fun it's just as awesome as i remember it being when i was six enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing kevin smith's opinions his aren't correct br br and that <UNK> song at the end ruled i bet you people don't even enjoy ewoks battle for <UNK> i'm going to set you all on fire
<START> there are people out there who will <UNK> anything that is the only explanation i can offer as to why the house of the dead movie exists and that's only scary part to the whole movie it's so bad you'll go off movies forever i seriously wanted to switch this off and turn the tv over to the paint <UNK> channel but i was bound by my word to suffer the whole thing i don't know why i do these bad things to myself br br as if it matters here's the basic <UNK> of the <UNK> a group of twenty somethings are so desperate to go out to some island in the pacific <UNK> canada actually because it's cheap for the <UNK> of the <UNK> which consists of about 8 people and un raving music that they pay some <UNK> old <UNK> 1000 to take them there after they miss the main ferry that's gotta be some rave to be worth all that <UNK> the <UNK> warns them that the island is also known as the island of the dead hang on i thought this was house of the dead and that they are all doomed <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br first faults here why would a tiny little rave of the century my foot be held on some remote island why would anyone willingly pay loads of money to get it why pay even more to the <UNK> old <UNK> to take them back when they could just come back with the others br br once they arrive they discover that the rave which consists of about 2 <UNK> a small stage and a <UNK> a john has been <UNK> there's blood everywhere and no one is around what would any <UNK> thinking person do run for their lives of course but no these clueless obviously blind people decide to go look for them soon enough they discover an old <UNK> house that's 50 times as big on the inside as it is on the outside another half hour of stumbling around in the forest follows as an excuse to kill of some of the lesser characters and after much tedium they arrive back at the house again the characters like the movie go nowhere br br <UNK> into this ghastly disaster is a <UNK> of <UNK> dialogue <UNK> acting <UNK> <UNK> exposition and <UNK> of clips from the once popular <UNK> game of the same name why this was universally accepted as a good idea with the filmmakers i'll never know the clips have no reference to any of the scenes and only <UNK> this trash even further if that is at all possible br br it has nothing to do with the game save for some cheap throwaway line at the end it makes resident evil look like cinematic glory hell even the double dragon movie seems multi oscar worthy in comparison to this junk the only one who comes out of this with his dignity still intact is <UNK> <UNK> he could have just taken his money and ran but he tries his best with the awful script and brings a tiny bit of pathos to his character the rest of the cast suck i'm afraid the characters are idiots and deserve to die br br plus if you cut out the swearing and pointless nudity i see no reason why this film cannot be shown on saturday morning tv it's not frightening in the slightest pirates of the <UNK> is more scary than the <UNK> bad guys in this film and where did all those bad guys come from anyway there were only a few people on the island to begin with i guess this <UNK> the reason they chose to <UNK> footage over and over i kid you not you'll see the same zombie die a dozen times br br who's ultimately to blame for that <UNK> waste of celluloid none other than director uwe boll his control over the movie is non existent you can clearly the see actors have no idea what they should be doing and that the zombies aren't really taking it all seriously the actors seem like they're reading off cue cards as they constantly pause in the middle of long sentences and carry on talking as soon as they see the next card it all feels very unnatural br br plus the film is shot like a two part mini series i have indeed seen better tv productions and don't get me started on the editing the film is an incoherent <UNK> with thousands upon thousands of pointless shots and dozens of meaningless camera pans no real skill or talent was put into making this at all it truly <UNK> and <UNK> the mind how movies this <UNK> bad can get made and george a romero can't even get anyone to take his calls house of the dead makes some idiotic reference to romero in a lazy attempt to be <UNK> <UNK> but it only <UNK> that they think this is in the same league as a real zombie movie br br for what it's worth the 1 85 1 <UNK> picture looks great and the <UNK> 5 1 soundtrack is clean but very unimpressive and only serves to <UNK> the heavily over used <UNK> even more the dvd comes with extras but why torture yourself isn't this review warning enough stay away you are all doomed i tell you doomed doomed
<START> based on neil <UNK> play of the same the odd couple tells the story of best friends felix <UNK> jack lemmon and oscar madison walter matthau who end up sharing oscars massive bachelor pad after felix tries to kill himself br br he had a big row with his wife over his obsessive <UNK> cleaning <UNK> and weird <UNK> and sends her a suicide <UNK> she calls oscar and lets him know what happened felix turns up at <UNK> during his weekly poker game with their friends <UNK> john <UNK> murray the policeman herbert <UNK> roy david <UNK> and speed larry haines after some side splitting <UNK> it's agreed felix will stay with oscar br br the rest of the film <UNK> on how these two are such completely different characters as well as looking at if oscar can stand <UNK> truly weird and unique <UNK> and <UNK> and if felix can stand oscar being such a <UNK> and his laid back attitude to everything really a film about two complete <UNK> living together and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and necessity of the gift that is friendship with great acting an intelligent and very funny script and the great monica evans and carole shelley as the british <UNK> sisters who oscar invites over for a double date br br this one is guaranteed to make you laugh every line is priceless and jack and walter are fantastic with a great chemistry also made into a successful and equally funny tv series with jack <UNK> as oscar and tony randall as felix
<START> i'll try to use words to describe this on br br i saw the original which was good in its own way but back then i should have feared a sequel br br and i was <UNK> when i picked this one up but now that i've seen it i have to say it's even worse then i thought why these movies still get money still makes my mind spin br br let's start with the actors they aren't all that good but it has to be said some make heads turn by being just plain awful but what can an actor do with a script like this one it's trying to be a copy of the original only this time the places have changed any form of story is gone and any attempt of actually coming up with something that hasn't been done before fails miserably in a <UNK> attempt to get it up to date they try to make it exciting by making use of the whole <UNK> <UNK> theme but that has been worn out ages ago and offers nothing but a filler for between the beginning and the end an attempt was made to try to save the movie by making a ton of references to the <UNK> original but it just ended up being plain funny and sometimes a bit sad in conclusion if you have nothing and i mean nothing to do go watch it or play <UNK> with the dvd by yourself it'll offer you the same amount of fun i promise
<START> i've seen this film on sky cinema not too long ago i must admit it was a really good western which features 2 of the big names on one side there's charlton heston playing the infamous and retired <UNK> samuel <UNK> on the other the late james coburn playing the villainous <UNK> <UNK> seeking revenge on <UNK> no matter what the cost br br the good thing about this film was there was some really good characters most of the actors played it out really well especially james coburn who i find that he was really mean in this film but that how it was br br christopher mitchum who i've seen everywhere in other films playing hal <UNK> i felt his character was left out in the cold but he manage to get himself back in by <UNK> up with <UNK> to bring down <UNK> <UNK> br br all in all it was a great film very good to watch great score from the late jerry <UNK> br br wonderful piece of western persona 8 out of 10
<START> i've seen this movie about 6 times now and each time i view it i'm more impressed by the story and the acting its like watching a train wreck being set in motion its subtle in its approach but very effective in reaching its goal br br spoilers at the center of the story is a very nice <UNK> on the one hand we have deputy major eddy <UNK> cusack <UNK> <UNK> at the old boys network that forms the hart of major of new <UNK> administration and on the other hand we have the mob boss <UNK> who's deliberately trying to maintain the status <UNK> through all means necessary this situation nicely <UNK> in the end when <UNK> orders <UNK> to make it easy on himself by killing himself and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to do the same politically speaking br br the movie also contains some really great one liners such as a personal weakness of mine you don't sum up a man's life in one moment the only thing new in this world is the history you don't know br br all in all a great movie that deserves a much higher rating
<START> this movie took my breath away at some points i simply loved it br br i admit that the character dialogs and storyline could have been done a bit better but hey this is just a simple short story of a couple of guys trying to <UNK> a dragon there's nothing more to it br br the overall design atmosphere the beautiful landscapes it's all just magical br br they've put a lot of love in this movie character designs were great and funny a bit tim burton ish if you like i can recommend this movie to anyone interested in great design displayed in a simple small but lovely story
<START> this movie's heart was in the right place no matter where its brain was br br attack is basically a spoof a la airplane two years before the fact nice going of what happens when <UNK> or in this case <UNK> attack br br through all manner of film magic stop motion <UNK> <UNK> tomatoes on <UNK> reverse filming people watching off screen tomatoes people throwing basketball sized tomatoes at the on screen actors the tomatoes do indeed attack everyone in their <UNK> grasp br br then it's up to mason dixon miller and a group of spies i wouldn't wish on any <UNK> side to save the day of course there's a <UNK> reporter taylor who pops in at the worst times dancing and singing army soldiers japanese scientists with dubbed in voices some guy dragging around a <UNK> and a samurai sword and oh yeah the san diego chicken before he made it big br br the gags here aren't all that great in fact you could probably make up better yourself after watching these some of the dialogue is <UNK> bad please pass the <UNK> not something to say in front of tomatoes and as far as <UNK> love goes well i can't blame the tomatoes for <UNK> up on hearing it br br what's good about it well i liked the theme song and the beginning credits and there was a scene with four people on the phone at once that was pretty well executed that's about it br br three stars not a killer comedy but it tries br br rock on peace
<START> film critics of the world i apologize it is your job to give advice to the <UNK> public so that they can wisely choose what to spend money on but i ignored your advice and i have been deeply hurt however my decision to see the cat in the hat wasn't made <UNK> you see three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the <UNK> known as how the grinch stole christmas then some friends of mine took me to see it and it turned out to be a colorful funny and almost hypnotic <UNK> treat so when the critics unleashed their fury against the cat in the hat another big budget seuss update with a big name star in the title role i thought that it must be the same old song how wrong i was br br for five whole minutes i thought i was in the clear the opening credits are clever the kids are charming and the production values are top notch then the cat showed up there are many problems from this point on but the biggest one was the <UNK> <UNK> of mike myers where the grinch was saved by the inspired casting of jim carrey the cat was destroyed by myers he can be very funny when his <UNK> are applied where they belong comic sketches every movie he's made that was truly funny was really just a feature length comedy sketch from wayne's world to austin powers so he tries to do the same thing here it's just that these comedy sketches are more like the stuff that they stick at the end of snl not funny just painful not that the writers helped him out any after the charming prologue the movie turns into an hour of repulsive <UNK> humor gags poorly timed <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> attempts at hip humor this movie was the most <UNK> cinematic experience i have ever had period so much talent and work went into something so vile i know that the adult stars of this movie will be relatively <UNK> by this mess i just hope that the wonderful spencer <UNK> and <UNK> fanning will get more chances to show their charms in far better movies if you are a parent please avoid this like the plague with movies like <UNK> and brother bear currently in theaters you have far better choices
<START> i must admit i burst out laughing when i saw one reviewer compare this to lotr well yes if you <UNK> the <UNK> the cast of thousands the great special effects the big battles the strong characterization the decent plot the good acting the classy direction and everything else which leaves you with the walking and boy does this film do walking if mr piano had his way this would probably be an <UNK> three hours of hardcore walking through the <UNK> countryside but every 40 minutes or so these <UNK> martians pop up for a few seconds to <UNK> him before he goes for another bit of a <UNK> you've never seen so much walking in a movie if this really had a <UNK> budget most of it must have gone on mr <UNK> shoes because he had to get through plenty of <UNK> with all the walking he does which explains why there's no money left for decent effects a decent video camera or proper actors honestly it's like watching some bizarre fetish video for people with a thing about going for long walks in period costumes even on fast forward this is a <UNK> walk br br as for the sci fi stuff i think it was a mistake to put martians in the film they only get in the way of the walking which is clearly much more interesting to the director than the story br br i wonder how much mr piano charges to walk dogs
<START> the <UNK> revenge is an unusual short not because of the subject matter adultery or because it's animated <UNK> <UNK> had introduced little <UNK> on film by this time but because it depicts bugs to tell the story <UNK> <UNK> had originally wanted to film actual bugs fighting but couldn't get them to do it on camera because of the hot lights they suffered through so he took dead ones and started using stop motion techniques to manipulate movements to his satisfaction this short does a good job of putting human characteristics on little creatures such as riding <UNK> painting filming kissing and dancing <UNK> would also make <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> 1933 but his first notable work would be this one if you're interested in this and the other shorts mentioned check your local library to borrow the dvd the <UNK> revenge and other fantastic tales from image entertainment
<START> after 7 years of watching that dreadful nonsense called star trek voyager i was feeling pretty <UNK> next gen and <UNK> were bloody good stuff and voyager ruined tv trek this opened with probably the best pilot to a trek show the crew were really good as were the choice of actors for the parts scott <UNK> played a typical first time captain in deep space and his <UNK> way of doing things was a refreshing change to the already know everything <UNK> from before the rest of the crew were really likable in their roles and i think they got off to a good first season when the show was <UNK> canceled i was really disappointed in a mirror darkly showed us what the cast were capable of pity a film or tv movie was never considered so much back story and <UNK> of the <UNK> left to tell including the <UNK> of <UNK> with the <UNK>
<START> seeing as the world <UNK> championship final finished in a <UNK> and disappointing manner with <UNK> o sullivan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by 18 frames to 8 bbc 2 found a gap in their schedule and so decided to broadcast a walk on the moon a movie i had absolutely no knowledge off br br i missed a few seconds of the title credits so had no idea viggo <UNK> starred in it and thought possibly it might be a cheap <UNK> certainly the opening with the <UNK> pearl and marty taking their kids to a summer camp has that sort of made for tv feel though the <UNK> lit too <UNK> lit cinematography seemed to suggest this was a cinematic film and it <UNK> t until the <UNK> of viggo <UNK> as <UNK> guy walker that i realised this was a cinema release after all someone of <UNK> s stature <UNK> t star in a <UNK> i mean that s like a legend like robert deniro appearing in a straight to video film wait a minute <UNK> t bob br br some people on this site have mentioned that pearl and marty are an unconvincing on screen couple and i agree i can understand why pearl would be attracted to exciting <UNK> guy but have no idea why walker would be attracted to plain house wife pearl the sixties was before my time but surely if you <UNK> got the choice between <UNK> chicks and bored house wives it s not really a choice at all mind you a lot of people took <UNK> in those days so i guess that explains it br br i feel the major problem of a walk on the moon comes down to the fact it s a romantic drama at heart just like you d expect in a <UNK> with several <UNK> coming of age scenes so why include a fairly explicit sex scene it <UNK> with the rest of the movie and is possibly off putting to the <UNK> women who were 20 something in 1969 i say possibly because the movie also seems to aim at a <UNK> market with the coming of age scenes and those teenagers will probably be bored with the historical and social context of man walking on the moon and <UNK> in other words a walk on the moon tries to attract many types of audience but will probably appeal to none of them
<START> suffice to say that despite the odd ludicrous <UNK> to his <UNK> <UNK> abilities posted here the director of this inept <UNK> <UNK> hasn't made a film since well that is excellent news as far as i'm concerned br br dead babies has all of the <UNK> of its creator but lacks the wit and technical <UNK> that make martin <UNK> the novelist <UNK> br br when will the british film industry wake up and realise that if it wants to regain the status it once had it should stop producing rubbish like this and make something real people will actually want to watch br br avoid like the plague
<START> before i start let me say that my experience of this movie might have been influenced by the dubbing which i gather from other comments was the original one which is considered inferior by some so it is entirely possible that subtitles or the apparently new dvd version would make a difference i have also not read the <UNK> book i'm only familiar with one other japanese manga and might be lacking cultural context br br potential minor spoilers ahead br br i usually like darkly <UNK> science fiction stories the likes of blade runner 12 monkeys etc but i did not enjoy this movie at all while it started out mildly intriguing it became tedious by the time it was only half way finished there are all sorts of problems let's start with what is probably the most severe the dialogue the characters seem unable to <UNK> complete sentences if they aren't shouting each other's names for the n <UNK> time they are usually <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> huh <UNK> etc this leaves most of the characters entirely underdeveloped and two dimensional it doesn't help in the least that a lot of them get only a few minutes of screen time without anything interesting to say that would develop them away from the stereotypes suggested by the visuals br br the <UNK> is <UNK> by some random pseudo philosophical <UNK> that sounds vague and uninspired even by star trek standards there is nothing deep and meaningful here it all seems <UNK> thrown together at random from various bits and pieces of stock sci fi ideas with no <UNK> whatsoever br br what little there is of an <UNK> plot is no more than an excuse to begin the overlong final sequence which consists of <UNK> scenes of mayhem and destruction not that there's anything wrong with a nice bit of mayhem and destruction of course but in this case you'll find yourself asking what's the point of it all and how long until it's over character development in the last 30 minutes or so consists of little more than <UNK> turning into pizza the <UNK> for no readily apparent reason br br the ending resembles the one in 2001 a bizarre string of images that far from <UNK> or explaining anything leave the viewer feeling he's just been looking into a <UNK> for two hours i'm sure some will claim that this sort of thing is art but to me it was just a lot of admittedly imaginative use of colour and <UNK> some of the music was also quite interesting unfortunately it's all style and no substance br br tired of disney want to watch animated movies dealing intelligently with adult themes i'm sad to say you're more likely to find that sort of thing in south park
<START> don't expect much from this film in many ways this film resembles a film that doris day starred in in 1956 title julie in this film doris who was a flight attendant <UNK> in those days landed the air craft after her <UNK> husband played by louis jordan shot the captain she did a far better job more convincing than kim <UNK> who took control of a <UNK> and manage to land it without much help from the control tower i know a little about <UNK> aircraft i use to be a flight attendant myself like i said do not expect much from this film it was done on a cheap budget the producers were to cheap to use a plane with the name of a <UNK> on it <UNK> is one name that several movies have used the only writing on this plane was the name of the company that made the aircraft
<START> difficult film to comment on how do you say it's bad well it isn't but then it's equally difficult to say it is good what it is is compelling viewing it is as close as you will get to utter <UNK> without being there it is the photographs of the <UNK> approaching the coast of thailand brought to life you know you want to turn away but you have to watch br br the <UNK> brothers handle the commentary very well even in the most tragic of circumstances there view on something which is happening in another country neither <UNK> nor insults the facts are on the <UNK> and little is needed for the viewer to understand or comprehend what is going on br br you can't change history and you should not want this film stands as a testament to humanity in its darkest hour
<START> twelve monkeys is odd and disturbing yet being so clever and intelligent at the same time it cleverly jumps between future and the past and the story it tells is about a man named james cole a convict who is sent back to the past to gather information about a man made virus that wiped out 5 billion of the human population on the planet back in 1996 at first cole is sent back to the year 1990 by accident and by misfortune he is taken to a mental institution where he tries to explain his purpose and where he meets a psychiatrist dr kathryn <UNK> who tries to help him and a patient named jeffrey <UNK> the insane son of a famous scientist being provocative and somehow so sensible dealing with and between reason and madness the movie is a definite masterpiece in the history of science fiction films br br the story is just fantastic it's so original and so entertaining the screenplay itself written by david and janet peoples is inspired by a movie named la <UNK> <UNK> which i haven't seen but i must thank the director and writer of the movie chris <UNK> for giving such an inspiration for the writers of twelve monkeys i read a little about la <UNK> it's not the same story but it has the same idea so this is not just a copy of it david and janet peoples have transformed this great deal of inspiration to a <UNK> story which tells about this <UNK> need for people to find a solution for maintaining human existence and it does it in a so beautiful and a realistic way that it's a guaranteed thrill ride from the beginning till the end the music used in the film is odd and somehow so funny and amusing it doesn't really fit until you really get it and when you do you realise that it's so compelling composed by paul <UNK> br br terry gilliam who we remember from monty python as the director of the movie was a real surprise for me as i really never thought him as a director type of a person i know he has directed movies before but i really couldn't believe that he could make something this magnificent it shouldn't be a surprise though as he does an amazing job you can still sense that same weirdness as in the <UNK> but for me the directing is pretty much flawless though in its odd way of describing things it also makes some scenes strangely disturbing yes it is indeed odd weird bizarre and disturbing so it also makes the movie a bit heavy too so the weak minded viewers will probably find it hard to watch the movie all the way through it's not as heavy as you could imagine but it just has these certain things which in their own purpose are sometimes pretty severe to watch despite that the movie holds this pure intelligence inside it and through flashbacks dreams jumps between the past and the future it mixes up the whole story in a very clever way and it doesn't even make the plot messy in any part though it does need concentration from the viewer after all br br what comes to acting well the movie doesn't even go wrong there the role of james cole is played by the mighty bruce willis who probably does his best role performance yet to date now people may disagree with me as he did some fine job in for example the sixth sense as well but for me the role of james cole was so ideal for willis and he performs it incredibly well the character is very well written too yet performed even better cole starts to question his own existence and he deals with himself starting to question his actual time of living trying to survive and find the crucial missing piece of the puzzle by <UNK> he starts to loose his faith questioning if he can even trust or believe himself other role performances worth mentioning are the performances of madeleine <UNK> and brad pitt <UNK> plays the role of kathryn <UNK> the psychiatrist of james cole who sees something strangely familiar in cole and decides to help him to deal with his madness she somehow starts to believe <UNK> story but as a believer of science she tries to find <UNK> through it and tries to deal with reason when it comes to unbelievable things brad pitt is so good in the role of jeffrey <UNK> and he also does one of his best role performances yet to date the insane yet hilarious personality of the character brought pitt even an oscar nomination for it so i guess i'm not <UNK> the honestly fabulous performance for nothing br br all in all twelve monkeys is a great science fiction experience and it will surely be a recommendation for everyone especially for the sci fi fans it includes brilliant characters and superb role performances especially from willis and pitt and an original and an entertaining story which forms a plot that's so intelligent and clever yet being that already mentioned weird and disturbing it definitely captures the viewer's attention by making it interesting and witty it's also an explosive thriller and it has romance in it too so it's all that in same package and that makes it one of the best sci fi motion pictures i've ever seen through the odd yet terrific vision of terry gilliam it manages to keep itself in balance despite the somewhat <UNK> yet somehow stable ride hard to explain really but that's how it is it's mind blowing
<START> lauren bacall was living through husband <UNK> <UNK> illness death when she did this film rock hudson was near the top of his 1950's stardom dorothy malone is in excellent form and wins an oscar for support robert stack is nominated falls just short for his role br br the story is a little <UNK> from another time but just as worthwhile as most dramas amazing how well <UNK> can drive in this film also how quickly stack <UNK> up in a couple of the films early sequences br br you can see why the cast is so good actually production wise this film is very good you can tell bacall is distracted during this film as while her acting is fine she looks emotionally <UNK> in some sequences br br the sexual references in this film are so mild that many of today's young viewers would not realize what they are film does a good job telling a story actually leaves a sequel to be made at the end though none ever was made though written beyond the wind would be a good title
<START> spoilers ahead br br this is one of the worst movies ever made it's that simple there is not one redeeming quality about this movie the first 10 minutes are quite <UNK> they actually lead you to believe that this film will be shocking and will have you on the edge of your seat instead you will spend <UNK> minutes <UNK> yourself while watching stolen and poorly made scenes run without any organization the lake was ridiculous looked like an <UNK> and had the same plant in different parts of the lake bed characters show their advanced <UNK> powers for example alex thomas who falls into the lake drunk and then ends up on his boat in an impossible position angie <UNK> put up a pitiful performance as kate made worse by the space time <UNK> <UNK> dialog that appears to have been written at the last minute by a fifth <UNK> an example of this would be when she said <UNK> in such a stupid manner that it shows the <UNK> of how much a human body can cringe before it <UNK> in half finally the editing of this movie was by far the most bizarre and horrific that i have ever seen it was like the <UNK> were a bunch of <UNK> who had been given <UNK> by scientists an example of this would be when we suddenly get a <UNK> of the <UNK> on <UNK> car i would bet that there was little to no time spent editing this movie the ending was absolutely pathetic the writers were obviously trying to create some sort of mysterious plot line that made the viewer say oh yeah instead we're left to view some dumb painting of a spider that somehow fits into the story line unfortunately there is not one perspective in the millions out there that could save this movie from being a <UNK> piece of crap br br i give this a 5 out of 10 the 5 being from the fact that this movie was recorded on film instead of becoming a picture book
<START> when carol vanessa <UNK> starts looking into her brother's death she begins to suspect something more sinister than natural causes the closer she gets to the truth the more of a threat she becomes to her sister in law <UNK> <UNK> line and the rest of the local <UNK> they'll do whatever is necessary to put a stop her <UNK> ways br br if you're into sleazy satanic themed movies black <UNK> has a lot to offer the movie is filled with plenty of nudity and <UNK> soft core sex one scene in particular involving a young woman and a goat must be seen to be believed unfortunately all the sleaze in the world can't save black <UNK> most of the movie is a total bore other than the one scene i've already mentioned the numerous sex scenes aren't shocking and certainly aren't sexy the acting is <UNK> at best even genre favorite <UNK> line gives a disappointing performance the plot really doesn't matter its main function seems to be to hold the string of dull sex scenes together i'm only familiar with one other movie directed by jose <UNK> <UNK> compared with his daughters of darkness that masterfully mixes <UNK> and horror black <UNK> comes off as amateurish 3 10 is about the best i can do
<START> <UNK> my <UNK> <UNK> well it certainly does after this <UNK> test of a film how on earth i managed to keep going without hitting the fast forward button lord only knows br br maybe it's me maybe i don't get the premise of the film or maybe i don't appreciate it's alleged mystical atmosphere in my humble opinion though the film has about as much mystical atmosphere as a trip to <UNK> br br in addition the characters were all dreadful and there is more character development in a tom jerry cartoon <UNK> why do i do it why do i watch such tripe it's enough to make one run away and join a monastery or the foreign legion <UNK> an <UNK> dreadful film in just about every respect apart from that it's not to bad
<START> considering how much money was budgeted for this film you would expect more from the story as a whole this could be quite possibly the most worthless movie i have ever watched there was no real <UNK> of anything character development minimal plot <UNK> maybe enjoyment none i'm not sure what points were even trying to be made if you want to see a movie where terrorists are kinda good guys american cia bombs everything that doesn't agree with our opinions all <UNK> are corrupt and you like to see anything resembling a <UNK> <UNK> accompanied by a death have at for those of us who realize that it doesn't take killing off a good guy to make a point we'll stick to other movies in summary this was a horrible attempt at an <UNK> <UNK> style hide the plot so person has to think movie because not only do you not know what's going on nobody who made the movie did either home alone 3 was a better cinematic piece
<START> i don't normally feel much of an <UNK> to comment on films i don't like but in a case like this one i just have to say something this movie is terrible illogical and stupid there are so many flaws in the storytelling that i don't even feel <UNK> to elaborate on because it's time for me to move on from this experience the most annoying point is however that at no point in the film does anyone explain whether the motivations for <UNK> character's madness are due to a power trip or a <UNK> reaction to his condition br br granted the special effects are impressive and in the past paul verhoeven has done some good stuff the director's cut of <UNK> on dvd is great however this movie is stupid and generally doesn't come near to explaining the point or technical aspect of the subject matter and instead <UNK> for predictable action without any enjoyment br br in short as many other reviews here say wish i had read them before stay away from this film
<START> chris <UNK> took care not to simply give us a jack the <UNK> type of list of murdered people he <UNK> into the psychological characterization with convincing results perhaps mostly due to stephen <UNK> excellent performance playing off against donald sutherland with good empathy by both it was the playing of these two parts  above all  which made the film something more than just a morbid account of the history of the butcher of <UNK> supporting actors especially max von <UNK> carried out their parts really well good directing the photography was good too needless to say the fact that the film was shot in <UNK> was bound to produce a couple of <UNK> but frankly given the depth of the story telling and interpretations we can completely forget these little <UNK> br br for once a made for tv film from hbo has come up <UNK> recommended especially if you like to <UNK> <UNK> and forget some of the morbid scenes  which i <UNK> to add are never exaggerated
<START> perhaps one of the worst teenage slasher films i ever did see i'll start with the bad points of t he movie which pretty much covers the entire film first of all something no one can avoid terrible acting i swear they picked up some random kids off the street based on how they looked secondly bad unconvincing character work development you hardly even know half the kids who are killed in here all you figure is that they deserved it one way or another the <UNK> character was overdone and a cheap rip off of the other great fantasy killers such as freddy or <UNK> next bad dialog the scarecrow was full of horrid one liners that would make you laugh only because it was so terrible lines like let's go find some small animals to torture really just leaves you with an <UNK> raised last but not least next off bad casting how old was the guy who played lester like 30 the back of his head was <UNK> for god's sake there is much more i could say about this film like it's cheap special effects it's high school film class effort but the point is understood it's just bad film making at it's worst as for what i found to be good in the movie entertaining for those with low low low standards would help put <UNK> to sleep a very cheap laugh or even a giggle
<START> hint number one read the title as the time of the mad dog or perhaps dogs this is a pretty good ensemble piece look at the cast and rent it you know you're curious already and first time director bishop gives them their chance taking his time letting the characters interact and chew the scenery as they wait not <UNK> for the return of the big boss and whatever revenge ensues br br for some of us the highlight is seeing christopher jones after his self <UNK> <UNK> from films he remains a commanding film presence and yes with christopher jones larry bishop and richard <UNK> involved this is the wild in the streets reunion party
<START> don't bother to watch this film would be better advice if you like marilyn monroe in her other roles this was a huge disappointment considering the great cast not just marilyn br br the story was just nothing certainly nothing like described on the vhs box of course there simply was no suspense precious little excitement and too many dull spots most of them trying to show why <UNK> monroe was so messed up this was not a good role for monroe even though i didn't need to see this character to know she could act some like it hot alone was good enough evidence for me but this role just didn't fit her and it's no surprise it wasn't one of her more popular films br br it's also too bad a film had the waste of the talents of actors like richard widmark anne <UNK> elisha cook jr <UNK> cagney donna <UNK> and others br br summary it's not entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game
<START> <UNK> shah has done some really impressive work as a filmmaker in the past <UNK> the race against <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> were entertaining and interesting to watch <UNK> is <UNK> was fun which he produced his latest outing as a filmmaker <UNK> <UNK> comes up as his careers weakest fare br br <UNK> <UNK> has a mediocre storyline it's about how success turns friendship into hatred agreed it has the potential but when you watch <UNK> <UNK> you wonder what's happening this film has maybe the worst climax in recent times <UNK> shah the writer puts <UNK> shah the director down br br the first hour is boring the second hour is better but again the climax is horrendous how can anyone forgive a person who decided to destroy you i won't ajay <UNK> suddenly decides to go to india and ask forgiveness to his <UNK> buddy thanks to his uncle <UNK> <UNK> when he reaches india rather than <UNK> or <UNK> him salman <UNK> him with band <UNK> and says he was the reason behind the entire fiasco was <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to show <UNK> character as a god if yes than you've failed completely the only question i want to ask <UNK> shah is that would you welcome a person who destroyed you with such a great reception write what you feel don't fool us the audience we are sensible enough to understand what's good or not br br this is a musical but the music by <UNK> <UNK> loy is terrible not a single song stays in your mind br br salman is superb though he carries the film on his shoulders and does really really well in the emotional scenes but again his character is shown as a god which makes him look like a <UNK> in the end ajay is equally good but salman has over <UNK> him completely <UNK> is wasted and what is a great talent like <UNK> <UNK> doing in this film <UNK> <UNK> though <UNK> roy kapoor excels <UNK> <UNK> is alright as the <UNK> br br on the whole this dream remains a dream
<START> yeah i saw the rough cuts the <UNK> sex scenes the dire cut scenes almost on a par with the film 'the <UNK> for awful acting this movie is as bad as bad films get the bad script bad acting bad effects bad locations bad stunts bad everything the best <UNK> in the film were the lap dancers they hired for the vampire extras br br sean harry the <UNK> <UNK> as someone else put it makes a <UNK> look talented here his amazing ability to badly drive a car when it is obviously being <UNK> by people on the <UNK> check out the reflection in the <UNK> his inability to turn left which is class oh and don't forget the sex scene plus his noteworthy use of a toy gun which the props guys couldn't even be bothered to disguise as a real gun the other actors on screen could barely deliver their lines it was as if half the time they were waiting for a line that wasn't there br br the <UNK> <UNK> were <UNK> good to the point that the guys who did it took their real names off the credits br br if you want a laugh at a party then rent this movie then again there are plenty of good comedies that are just as funny and don't give money to people who don't deserve it
<START> one of the last great musicals of the 60s i was 7 years old the first time i saw this movie and it's always been a favorite since then the musical numbers are all memorable in the 60s the people who were cast in musicals actually had musical talent unlike a certain academy award nominated current musical based in a large <UNK> city all of the main roles were beautifully cast ron moody shines as fagin as does <UNK> <UNK> as nancy oliver reed was a menacing bill <UNK> who thankfully has no musical numbers lol and mark lester as oliver and jack wild as the <UNK> were great too mark lester comes across as an innocent <UNK> which was what dickens intended when he wrote the book then of course there are the dozens of dancers who perform in consider yourself i'd do anything who will buy and be back soon many who were children this is a great show for the whole family
<START> in what would be his first screenplay based on his own short story turn about william <UNK> delivers a bizarre story of loyalty sacrifice and really strange relationships the story originally was about only the tone young and cooper characters but mgm needed to put joan crawford in another picture to fulfill her contract and <UNK> <UNK> by creating a female role crawford insisted that her lines be written in the same <UNK> style as her co <UNK> young and tone leading to much unintentional hilarity as these three communicate in a <UNK> like <UNK> that sounds like a monty python sketch <UNK> heights performed in <UNK> seriously the almost entirely <UNK> less sentences make ernest <UNK> read like henry james br br the film also reflects some familiar <UNK> themes with an almost <UNK> close relationship between brother and sister as may be found in his <UNK> and elsewhere when young <UNK> to crawford in <UNK> presence in <UNK> of an engagement ring all three exchange their childhood <UNK> rings with one another the <UNK> of tone and young is also noticeable especially as they go off to their thelma louise fate frankly it's creepy br br not as creepy to this new <UNK> however as the recurring theme of the massive <UNK> <UNK> which crawford <UNK> catches and which is shown <UNK> over her hands i had to turn away and young turns into a gladiator <UNK> br br that being said there are some nice performances young is particularly engaging in a scene where he's taken up in <UNK> fighter plane and <UNK> <UNK> is delightful as <UNK> flying buddy tone despite his inability to express himself through realistic dialogue has a nice moment dashing away his own <UNK> tears over his buddy <UNK> fate crawford stripped of meaningful dialogue as well mostly comes across as either wooden or melodramatic which is quite a <UNK> act for one role br br the battle scenes not surprisingly for a howard <UNK> film are the most exciting part of the entire picture but not enough as far as i'm concerned this is 75 minutes of my life i'm never going to get back
<START> first this movie was not that bad it was entertaining at least to me for probably all the wrong reasons i have never seen the original so can't compare the two br br this movie reminded me of that weird christopher reeve movie village of the damned the two movies have different plots but that creepy disgusted feeling and <UNK> comedy exist in both br br the wicker man is suppose to be a mystery thriller men please don't anger the women movie i don't know the whole <UNK> thing and sacrifice was a little off br br nicholas cage his glorious bad self goes to a secluded island called <UNK> when he receives a letter in <UNK> from his long lost fiancée who claims her daughter has been taken and hidden by fellow <UNK> br br cage is a police officer and being the weary policeman he is he goes to the semi <UNK> island leaving no word of his <UNK> to anyone who is located in the real world stupid br br things get <UNK> when the large <UNK> esquire women who <UNK> the island <UNK> at him and lie about the <UNK> of the missing girl his fiancée is no help who seems to be <UNK> and weary the whole time cage stays on the island when he learns that the missing girl is his daughter and he is the lucky man tricked to come to this island as a <UNK> victim during the islands sick <UNK> festival br br in this movie males do not fare so well a sick twisted display of <UNK> br br i found the movie laughable at times particularly when cage punches some women and runs around in a bear suit i think there were too many <UNK> in this movie i find the whole concept of angry women <UNK> themselves on an island without any care for males quite entertaining but the way it was portrayed in this movie was just weird while most women have had some jerk hurt and anger them this is clearly a form of <UNK> i would have turned the movie off in disgust if the roles were <UNK> this movie is something to watch maybe just once or twice it is not a thriller it should be <UNK> as just strange
<START> whipped is <UNK> minutes long this review is <UNK> words long three unlikable new york <UNK> ruthless <UNK> end up <UNK> the same woman played by amanda <UNK> with disastrous results that applies to the story and the film too <UNK> to be misogynistic <UNK> and ridiculous whipped mixes the <UNK> of shock jock tom <UNK> with <UNK> letter fantasies though technically <UNK> it's dated grating poorly written mean and obvious people don't act like this people don't talk like this really
<START> well i do <UNK> with the other comment posted <UNK> is much much better them <UNK> or any of the other films that were mentioned br br specially about non real characters i think that someone just wrote that only because he never lived in the spanish society like i did and i'm not spanish is a very real film with real characters very well done by one of the best spanish actress <UNK> san juan br br about be a european film in contrast with an american film well we different societies personally i dislike american modern films a lot i like the classics and some of the andy american films but they are very few br br is a film about the continuous <UNK> of a person liked or not we all make mistakes but some can learn about the mistakes
<START> six different couples six different love stories six different love angles <UNK> numbers of audience in the movie theater looking at the <UNK> different parts of the silver screen br br i am sitting in somewhere between them looking at the center of the screen to find out what's going on in the movie all stories have got no link with each other but somewhere down the line <UNK> <UNK> trying to show some relation between them i tried to find out a few lines i could write as review but at the end of 3 hours 15 minutes found nothing to write the movie is a poor copy of hollywood blockbuster love actually br br my suggestion don't watch the movie if you really want to watch a nice movie
<START> this might be the <UNK> example of amateur propaganda ever made the writers and producers should study the german films of the thirties and forties they knew how to sell even soviet style clunky leader as god like father figure were better done disappointing the loss of faith <UNK> in church at last second just in time for daddy to be saved by the hoover god was not too bad unfortunately it seemed rushed and not nearly melodramatic enough a few misty <UNK> shots of the <UNK> hoover up in the corner of the screen <UNK> and <UNK> would have added a lot the best aspect is hoover only saving the deserving family and children who had <UNK> their worth unfortunately other poor homeless were portrayed as likable and even good yet the hoover god doesn't help them a better approach would have been shots of them drinking spirits to show the justice of their condition finally bright and cheerful scenes of <UNK> after hoover saved the country from the depression should have rolled at the end we could see then how hoover god had saved not just this deserving family but all the truly deserving <UNK> at best
<START> i love horses and admire hand drawn animation so i expected nothing short of <UNK> from <UNK> new animated picture spirit <UNK> of the <UNK> i guess you could say i was a little bit disappointed you have wonderful animation and at first what seems like a perfect story a story about absolutely nothing but a horse in nature the animals don't sing cute songs or even talk a major plus sadly the film has an <UNK> for narration by matt damon a sappy soundtrack by bryan adams and enough action scenes to compare it to a jerry bruckheimer production if the film makers would have just stayed with simplicity we'd have a masterpiece here this is not a great film but it is good entertainment for small children i would recommend this film to families because it has its heart in the right place and its the only thing out there right now that isn't offensive to small children not bad but could have been much better very pretty visuals though
<START> the brain or head that wouldn't die is one of the more thoughtful low budget exploitation films of the early 1960s it is very difficult to imagine how a script this <UNK> sexist could have been written without the intention of self parody and the themes that are expressed repeatedly by the female lead <UNK> <UNK> a detached head kept alive by machines i vs and <UNK> seem to confirm that the film was meant to simultaneously exploit and critique gender stereotypes shades of the under rated boxing helena br br the <UNK> are <UNK> and about as irritating as an army of angry ants the dialog is <UNK> over dramatic and unbelievable and the acting is merely ok but not consistent why have i given this film a 4 because some thought clearly went into it i am really not sure what point the film was really trying to make but it seems clear that it <UNK> for an unusually edgy and raw sort of horror without the blood and guts today's audiences expect br br another unique and interesting aspect of the brain is that there really are not any heroes in this film and none of the characters are particularly likable br br all considered this is a fairly painful and disturbing look at early 1960s american pop sexuality from the viewpoint of a woman kept alive despite her missing body after what should have been a fatal car crash her lover is threatening to <UNK> a fresh high quality body onto her and force her to continue living with him she is understandably non <UNK> by all of this and forced to <UNK> a creature who is almost as monstrous as her boyfriend oh there are also some vague references to the 1950s 60s cliché about the <UNK> of science run amok br br recommended for b sci fi buffs and graduate students in gender studies o w not recommended
<START> the secret of kells is one of the most unique beautiful and eye popping animated films i have ever seen before watching this film i was convinced that nothing could give up a run for its money and that it was a <UNK> in to win in this category but i found in kells a serious <UNK> br br the secret of kells tell the story of a young orphan named brendan who lives with his uncle the <UNK> of <UNK> the <UNK> is a loving guardian but perhaps a bit too strict and much more concerned with <UNK> the wall around the town from a coming attack by <UNK> than he is at <UNK> the boy's imagination when the legendary brother <UNK> who looks surprisingly like willie nelson shows up and takes the boy under his wing brendan goes on a journey into the woods and meets a lovely forest <UNK> named <UNK> who takes a liking to him and saves his life more than once with <UNK> help he attempts to save the town and help brother <UNK> complete the mystical book <UNK> has <UNK> turn dark into light br br see my full review of the secret of kells at http <UNK> <UNK> com <UNK> <UNK> movie review secret of kells <UNK>
<START> this movie is well done on so many levels that i am in awe that the score is as low as it is 5 9 10 <UNK> votes as of this writing this movie has incredible special effects a true epic storyline complex great character interaction and mind blowing battles they have to be seen to be believed the only complaint i have is the subtitles on the hk dvd version i got some lines were not translated br br i just don't understand when i read hear from various sources it has a confusing plot i couldn't follow the story or characters came from nowhere from the very 1st time i watched this movie i understood it followed it knew why characters were there and i absolutely loved it i've watched it about 8 times already and each time it is pure enjoyment oh and this is not just my opinion because i've shown this movie to many fellow americans people who have never seen an hk film before who feel the same way not one of them failed to follow the storyline and each person <UNK> their love for this movie oh man why can't we have stuff like this coming out of hollywood at least lord of the rings had a nice marriage of special effects character development and storyline br br this is not coming from a asian film lover <UNK> either i own an extensive library of asian films and i must say that this movie is one of my greatest dvds when you watch it you will be blown away by the amazing special effects and epic feel of this movie you will be drawn into this fantasy world and you won't want to leave i've seen both the 1983 version and the 2001 both done by tsui <UNK> and the 2001 is far better in comparison imo br br besides the subtitles i have one additional complaint about this movie i didn't want it to end i'm begging you mr <UNK> can we please have a sequel
<START> i saw this movie a few months ago on cable and it was fantastic william h macy is one of my favorite actors and his performance was just amazing he makes you care for his character even when he is clearly doing the wrong thing and <UNK> campbell gives a performance that is with out a doubt the best performance i have seen by an actress this year she is fantastic as a wild young woman who is wise beyond her years br br donald sutherland is just plain creepy as <UNK> father and john ritter is fine as a shrink stuck in the middle of everything that is happening br br i wish that this was in the theater because i feel that it's a movie that should be view by a wider audience that's a shame because it's a hell of <UNK> better that most of the new movies coming into the theater now br br
<START> i was disappointed the film was a bit predictable and did not live up to the hype <UNK> all over the box having said that the characters were well developed the <UNK> myth was used in a unique premise and the house was pretty spooky but it just missed for me i kept waiting for that big <UNK> or boo but it never came br br furthermore the movie was plagued with poor filming of poor special effects thus showing to much of a bad thing and not using atmosphere and viewer imagination to create the horror and suspense try movies like session 9 or the cube if your looking for a low budget but well conceived horror movie
<START> even if this film was allegedly a joke in response to critics it's still an awful film if one is going to commit to that sort of thing at least make it a good joke first off <UNK> <UNK> is i guess the poor man's gerard depardieu naturally i hate gerard depardieu even though he was very funny in the <UNK> <UNK> three <UNK> one otherwise to me he is box office poison and <UNK> <UNK> is worse than that the poor man's box office poison really that is not being fair to the <UNK> <UNK> if the <UNK> man' is supposed to be some sort of critique of the <UNK> what am i saying it isn't let's just say <UNK> if it was supposed to be it wasn't sharp enough satire is a <UNK> thing if it isn't sharp enough the viewer becomes the butt of the joke instead i think that is what happened the story just ends up as a bunch of miserable disgusting characters doing nothing that anyone would care about and not in an interesting way either for a more interesting and worthwhile <UNK> see any luis <UNK> film very sharp satire br br potential spoiler alert br br really the blow job in the cemetery that <UNK> <UNK> character works so so hard to <UNK> do you even care is it funny since mr <UNK> is supposed to be a good film maker i will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume it was some <UNK> joke that got out of control though i'm guessing he didn't cast <UNK> <UNK> because he's the worst actor and every character he's played has been a pretentious <UNK> ass except he's incompetent at it so it becomes like a weird caricature do you think mr <UNK> did that on purpose and <UNK> <UNK> is the butt of the joke as well i just don't see it so you understand the dilemma i'm faced with here right it is the worst film ever because he's supposed to be a good director so there is some kind of <UNK> involved i knew <UNK> <UNK> was horrible without even seeing it do not be <UNK> by 'the 4th man s <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or mr <UNK> reputation as a good director etc etc
<START> i was bored one night and red eye was on and thought why not br br red eye is one of the best movies in a long time br br i mean i just got into the movie cause it was just so brilliant br br the story is new and different br br the movie also has two great leads in the movie with rachel mcadams as lisa <UNK> and cillian murphy as jackson <UNK> br br the acting is just brilliant and you get the feel for the people in the movie br br the music is just excellent it give you chills and can also make you feel relax br br i just love how the movie was just so well done and it never gets boring br br red eye is just phenomenal nothing more and nothing less br br it's a excellent thriller br br overall i enjoy red eye so much that i can watch it over and over again br br if you like red eye then i recommend <UNK> and cry wolf br br i give red eye 9 out of 10 br br great movie
<START> look i'm sorry if half the world takes offense at this but life is confusing enough i don't need to watch it that way i dig anthony hopkins big time i even watched <UNK> and i knew that would be a steaming pile of quentin but this thing is not well shot and it's not daring even if it is artsy well produced films have reasons for cuts and fast edits not this oh but it's a realistic interpretation excuse this <UNK> make your head hurt it's the <UNK> moving picture ever to take you nowhere at all i still love ah and i'll always give him another chance but if you aren't made of time to watch bad ideas on screen skip this
<START> i expected something different more passion drama again another failed attempt of originality i'm sorry to say that the film falls into the old cliché of <UNK> 15 year old teens may appreciate it though the acting was not very convincing and the lines common lacking any wit still the soundtrack was good and well adapted i can't say that this movie is a total flop because people do watch it but it didn't meet the <UNK> expectations and sunk into mediocrity so to conclude the production keeps you in front of the tv for almost an hour and a half which is an <UNK> thing thus i guess its worth seeing if you don't get annoyed
<START> after 16 years tim burton finally disappoints me whatever happened to the old burton who read the dark knight returns by frank miller as research for his <UNK> to direct batman back in 1988 <UNK> by the looks of it burton didn't research the book nor the movie cause he got everything wrong this movie sucks it's not as good as the original and it doesn't deal with the same subject as the original if you want a good ape movie watch the original br br out of stars
<START> i have had the pleasure of reading martin <UNK> book can't find my way home which is chock full of info on the drug culture of america <UNK> the years 1945 2000 this guy knows his stuff i found him to be an excellent <UNK> for this documentary i particularly enjoyed watching the film clips from the hippie era and the 70's <UNK> culture the soundtrack was excellent whoever <UNK> it definitely was in touch with the tunes of each era hopefully they will package them and sell them as a cd set i would highly recommend this to anyone interested in how the 1960's experiments with <UNK> forever changed american culture as we know it one thing that was missing was any mention of george <UNK> played by johnny <UNK> in the movie blow who was supposedly responsible for much of the marijuana and cocaine coming into this country in the 60's 80's
<START> panic is a captivating <UNK> genre film about a brooding and conflicted middle aged <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> with a younger <UNK> <UNK> his love of wife and son his duty to his <UNK> father with his own identity although the film has a <UNK> purpose and an ambiguous ending it is a superb production in almost all aspects the characters' clarity and sincerity in such an improbable story may both <UNK> and annoy audiences
<START> did anyone stop to realise what sort of movie they were producing here now let s a former marine officer becomes <UNK> to a group of kids at a <UNK> school so this should be a family comedy right wrong this is just a gross comedy aimed at teenagers with many bad taste moments it might have been watchable in an extremely dumb way at this point but i found damon wayans voice to be irritating beyond belief does he speak like that in real life if he does then he has my sympathy but he won t be getting any of my money from watching his movies
<START> the major fault in this film is that it is impossible to believe any of these people would ever be cast in a professional production of <UNK> hearing david <UNK> soft voice struggling <UNK> with the famous tomorrow tomorrow and tomorrow speech made it impossible to believe anyone would ever consider him for the role i kept believing therefore that he didn't get the part because he was a lousy actor not because a bigger name was available then when we see portions of the play in rehearsal it is difficult to believe the director is not <UNK> things with a hopelessly miscast <UNK> travesty of actors who are unable to <UNK> or even understand the <UNK> and directors who see the play through their own screwball interpretations sometimes directors are so anxious to have their films done and writers think they have the ability to direct their own works that they settle for less this appears to be such an example
<START> have you ever heard the saying that people <UNK> their intentions well in this movie the characters' actions do more than <UNK> future plans they show up at your house drunk and <UNK> you about the head this could be forgiven if the setting had been used better or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced <UNK> <UNK> character is not mysterious just wooden and kenneth branagh doesn't succeed in conveying the <UNK> charm his character probably was written to have br br the bottom line obvious plot one note performances unlikeable characters and grotesque southern accents employed by british actors
<START> ok this movie was really unique shall we say carrie fisher was by far the most talented in the movie even though it is said she had a coke problem during the movie but she said that she can't remember to much of it well thats her excuse but whats everyone else's i can't imagine they all had a coke problem whatever it wasn't all that bad i mean i guess the plot was ok and it had some pretty funny moments although the part where the guy gets that thing shoved in his head was a little too violent for my taste oh well i guess i was disappointed cause carrie fisher is like so awesome and this movie did nothing for her
<START> i think this movie was supposed to be shocking but the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly it's been made and simply is it's one and a half hour of torment even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie the five girls br br sure the main characters get their bloody piece in a bad way which is basically fine since it's a horror movie and i usually like horror movies i've no problem with violence in these type of movies per se however all the violence in this film serves no end whatsoever it's no spectacle other than that it's simply grotesque it's so lame it even gets boring and really quick too br br the worst thing if the above wasn't bad enough for ya about this movie is that they've tried to copy the blair <UNK> project by filming with cheap hand held cameras but again this too serves no end whatsoever in the blair which sure enough there's an explanation namely they are their with a camera looking for the blair witch in this film there's no other explanation than hey <UNK> we wanted this to look like the blair <UNK> the sound in the movie is also something to get depressed about the girls are screaming so hysterically that many a time you can't make out what they're saying also no effort has been made to make anything any better sound wise or other wise br br than finally there's the soundtrack which is just as bad as the rest and <UNK> from cheap euro house to the worst <UNK> hard rock br br my advise don't watch this under any circumstances
<START> a classic is something that everybody wants to have read but nobody wants to read a classic is also something that everyone <UNK> but no one has read mark <UNK> br br <UNK> seems to be the word used to describe scarface brian <UNK> 1983 film about <UNK> self surrender greed and danger among <UNK> drug ring people and critics and <UNK> for that matter <UNK> this film <UNK> epic gangster <UNK> or <UNK> of gangster films ' when it is anything but it is praised for all the wrong reasons scarface is a terrific film that deserves praise from all over but not all the praise it gets from audiences today and <UNK> the fine points it so <UNK> makes are missed by the general public br br first off the film is about a cuban <UNK> with a past of wanting to escape communism grasp and find happiness simple yes but the layers of de palma's directing genius and the great story written by oliver stone yes i know he actually wrote a real good one here play into all of it the characters are all looking for an escape as escape is a natural element dealt with in the film by all each character has something to offer that makes them likable by everyone who could appreciate this film they are <UNK> in a world of <UNK> and money but all that has a price as they all learn each character thinks they are getting better chances in life when in true dramatic irony they are actually getting worse <UNK> would be a better word to describe this movie all those who praise the film for it's drug usage it's violence it's dialog totally missed the point there is nothing really positive about the film besides the characters positive expectations of themselves and that is why the film works so well the <UNK> through out the film serves to deliver the message of the film not to look cool or attract viewers brian de palma doesn't make movies for cult gangsters or brainless action fans br br next on the film is an adult drama it is not a <UNK> <UNK> it has it's share of action but the action is plotted very carefully so it has a point it's not like aliens an example of a big dumb action film and most audiences perceive this film as a big dumb action gangster film about doing drugs and shooting people ridiculous <UNK> if this film is about that then it is about how bad it is not a promotion of it br br this being said the film is indeed a great film it has great cinematography that pulls you into the story it has a very dramatic score in true <UNK> <UNK> style which simply could give you chills or bring you to tears the film is rather lengthy but it is a story and each moment counts the acting is terrific al pacino enough said he can do any role that he puts his mind to and this was no exception pretty boy steven bauer as <UNK> i didn't think much of him in other films he did but he actually makes you like him when he goes under <UNK> de palma's direction michelle pfeiffer is a true gem as elvira <UNK> fresh off the heels of a sort of embarrassment in grease 2 she got her ticket to ride performing a no holds <UNK> performance of a beauty that is more than meets the eye but the three true <UNK> in this rough are mary elizabeth <UNK> as tony's sister gina who when she smiles or cries we see her soul and her fresh way of living and watch it <UNK> paul <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> a drug lord who runs deeper than a river and <UNK> portrays him as so and <UNK> <UNK> as tony and <UNK> torn mother these three dig the film as deep as it can go br br this reviewer learned one main thing when watching scarface for the first time always go into a film unsuspecting all the hype and talk of this film cannot possibly prepare you for what you really see only knowing de palma like i do can give you even a glimpse of what this film holds so ignore the rap crap ignore the mindless violence supporters and fix yourself a glass of <UNK> on the rocks and <UNK> yourself in an emotional viewing of a great film the real scarface
<START> in the winter of 1931 supposedly 12 year old tyler <UNK> as michael sullivan jr wonders what his mobster father tom hanks michael mike sullivan does for a living young <UNK> follows mr hanks to work one evening and witnesses him <UNK> away some rival gangsters this leads in a very <UNK> way to godfather type paul newman as john rooney hiring independent hit man jude law as <UNK> maguire to track down <UNK> and hanks who are off to cool their heels in chicago hanks thinks they will be safe with a relative which is puzzling when you consider the characters' line of work br br looking <UNK> like paul peterson the donna reed show <UNK> does a terrific job for director sam <UNK> and getting to work with this cast makes him the <UNK> young actor of 2002 but the most striking thing about road to <UNK> is the stunning cinematography of conrad l hall which deservedly won a career <UNK> academy award for the late photographer mr <UNK> work is truly <UNK> this helps make up for the overall impression of a <UNK> contrived <UNK> to both the narrative and visuals the <UNK> end is abruptly uplifting the unrelated dog is an example of the aforementioned <UNK> br br road to <UNK> 7 12 <UNK> sam <UNK> tom hanks tyler <UNK> paul newman jude law
<START> sam <UNK> peter falk comes to his son's place unexpectedly his son ben <UNK> paul reiser is quite surprised to hear that his mother muriel <UNK> olympia dukakis has left his father ben's wife rachel elizabeth <UNK> and his three sisters try to find muriel while ben and his father go see a <UNK> that's for sale but that's not the end of their journey their road trip turns into a long therapy session between ben and his father raymond de <UNK> is the director of the thing about my folks 2005 paul reiser is behind the screenplay and he has done a remarkable job the dialogue between ben and sam is just amazing and he did work with the script for twenty years so no wonder it's this good who would be better man to play the father than peter falk nobody i can tell you that and i really love the story on why paul wanted peter falk for the part peter was an actor who made his own father laugh and peter certainly made me laugh in this movie it's just hilarious when they go fishing and how the old guy beats the younger one in the game of pool and then beats him with the stick the movie is often very funny and i found myself laughing several times but it can also be touching from time to time you couldn't tell a story any better than it is told here
<START> why aren't more films especially american more like <UNK> machine br br this is my first official on line review and i am charged with <UNK> ecstasy after having chosen <UNK> machine as my first <UNK> this is a review so i'll try to stick to mere reflection and gut emotion br br i mean this is one creative piece of work even though it is clearly inspired by the now classic <UNK> so what if it's not all original i own both of these films and though <UNK> is one strange son of a bitch <UNK> machine is far superior and can be sat through without the strong desire to <UNK> in a dose of mind <UNK> drugs to <UNK> film significance <UNK> machine is as elaborate in it's story as it is in its high <UNK> of blood and gore thank you jesus for japanese cinema br br simply put the last time my dreams were <UNK> by visions of horror happened after watching nightmare on elm street when i was 7 or so i could picture in my dreams a tongue coming out of a <UNK> for weeks on end this time at <UNK> my dreams were pleasantly awe inspiring br br in this film human bodies are host to aliens whose sole purpose is to try and fulfill their never ending <UNK> for human flesh and blood humans become flesh eating <UNK> there's more fight scenes great music great point of view shots decent acting by the woman cyborg at least better than her male counterpart the fight seen in the end is worth watching ten or twenty times br br oh and did i forget to mention it's a love story wow i hate love stories but this takes the cake br br i can't wait to have friends over to watch this film once more just to see the reaction on their faces sadly i took time to write this review because i'm afraid most friends and family wont understand <UNK> machine the truth is america as a whole is not prepared for <UNK> machine br br lastly my wife walked in while i was watching the climactic fight scene at the end and she was speechless normally she says something like why are you watching that junk this time she had nothing to say i was glad br br this is not junk this isn't just splatter splatter for the sake of splatter is also great this is art my friends art br br <UNK>
<START> i love <UNK> <UNK> and thoroughly enjoyed this movie i thought everyone was very good i was not familiar with richard lewis i thought he made his character julian peters very <UNK> funny and attractive sean young was very good as the <UNK> rejected girl with a heart of gold george hamilton was charming and the perfect italian <UNK> john candy has a field day as the bon <UNK> james belushi is hysterical as a total jerk <UNK> shepard gave a very sweet performance as a nice vulnerable ignored housewife delightful ensemble cast lots of talent clever script lots going on and beautiful locations just a nice pick me up for a dreary day especially in the winter when a trip to europe is not anywhere on your horizon
<START> ludicrous <UNK> 9 year old <UNK> turns into whiny brat 19 year old <UNK> who somehow seems appealing to <UNK> 5 years his senior now 22 year old jedi warrior hero <UNK> has a couple of bad dreams and so takes to <UNK> children his friends and the entire <UNK> of his existence because a crazy old man convinced him a his precious wife might really die and b only he can prevent this <UNK> <UNK> br br i think the people who like this movie are not paying attention the story is ridiculous the characters are unbelievable literally not the perverted sense of fantastic wonderful etc br br <UNK> wan <UNK> was the wise and kind anchor for the entire series but in the climax he <UNK> off <UNK> legs lets him burn in the <UNK> and leaves him to suffer doesn't anyone think that's a little out of character not to mention it was pretty stupid to take a chance on him living as it turns out br br i was expecting at least a story that showed consistent characters with plausible motivations none of that here the story could have been written by a 10 year old br br oh yeah the cgi is pretty cool
<START> <UNK> tells of a convict lowe who thinks the prison staff is out to kill him this very ordinary film is an action drama with a weak plot stereotypical poorly developed characters and a one dimensional performance by lowe a forgettable film not worthy of further commentary
<START> i admired rob marshall for chicago but <UNK> of geisha turns out to be yet another failure of <UNK> western and asian arts overall the scene is beautiful but after restless emphasis on <UNK> oriented scenes some might just find himself fed up with them the excessive <UNK> <UNK> was frankly overdone it's probably the cultural difference of perception here the ultimate beauty is not the <UNK> type as truly beautiful geisha would not be the over <UNK> <UNK> in the movie br br some other comments have rightly mentioned the biggest flaws as a <UNK> i have no doubt the actress are great an actor actress can play any kind of role when he she can look like it <UNK> li is great but the power of emotions that she showed in this movie had not been translated into japanese style all i saw was a bittersweet and jealous chinese woman <UNK> <UNK> one of my <UNK> actress did not even look like a japanese some comment has mentioned the peculiar delicate feminine characteristics of japanese women with which i can't agree more these are so delicate that i assume not even all modern japanese actresses are <UNK> for the roles in geisha let alone the two chinese and one <UNK> actress who grew up in different cultures and probably did not know japanese culture that much br br geisha is a good shot for <UNK> the curiosity of american audiences but it would be an insult for the movie itself and for art alike if the movie wins the oscar for best costume best director or best picture

<START> this is a very entertaining movie a few of the reviews that i have read on this forum have been written by people who apparently think that the film was an effort at serious drama it was not made that way it is an extremely enjoyable film performed in a tongue in cheek manner all of the actors are obviously having fun while entertaining us the fight sequences are lively <UNK> and above all not gratuitous the so called green death <UNK> on a couple of occasions is not as i read in one review gruesome a couple of reviewers were very critical of the martial arts fight between doc and <UNK> near the end of the film hey <UNK> up again i remind one and all that this is a fun film each phase of this fight was <UNK> which added to the fun aspect the actors were not trying to <UNK> bruce lee or jackie chan this is not one of those martial arts films ron <UNK> looks great in this film and is the perfect choice to play doc another nice touch is the unique manner in which the ultimate fate of the bad guy <UNK> is dealt with i promise you that if you don't try to take this film very seriously and simply watch it for the entertainment value you will spend 100 minutes in a most enjoyable manner
<START> green eyes is a great movie in todays context of supporting our troops it is interesting this movie showed the lack of respect soldiers received from doing their duty during this period from a historical view the end of the vietnam war left all of us with something to remember and learn from gene was very proud of this movie and he deserved the credits he received from writing green eyes i agree i do not understand why this movie is not shown more often or at all this movie is the kind of movie that should be shown on tv every year much like the wizard of oz the dedication of one man towards his lost son is entirely moving i was a friend of gene <UNK> and i was proud to know him rocky
<START> i found the film quite <UNK> the way the main character was lost but at the same much more clear about certain things in life than people who <UNK> him his <UNK> for example br br he was tortured and you loved to watch him being tortured it had this perverted side which was frightening but we were all happy to see him come out of the misery again br br it was like a game character or pan man through a mine land or to enemy and we love to watch him under sniper attack or fire but then at the end we are happy to see him survive br br
<START> very good drama about a young girl who attempts to unravel a series of horrible crimes she <UNK> the aid of a police <UNK> and they begin running down a series of clues which lead to a traveling <UNK> worker with a long police record an ending which is guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat
<START> down to earth is the best movie it is so funny and it's really sweet too it has a good plot and it's unique it isn't like those movies that are all the same with the similar story lines and it's not all comedy and no story this movie also has a very good ending
<START> this show comes up with interesting locations as fast as the travel channel it is billed as reality but in <UNK> it is pure prime time soap opera it's tries to use exotic locales as a <UNK> to bring people into a phony contest then proceeds to hook viewers on the contestants soap opera style br br it also borrows from an early cbs game show <UNK> beat the clock by <UNK> situations for its contestants to try overcome then it <UNK> the winner money if they can spice it up with a little interaction between the characters even better while the game format is in slow motion versus beat the clock the real accomplishment of this series is to escape reality br br this show has elements of several types of successful past programs reality television hardly but if your hooked on the contestants locale or contest this is your cup of tea if your not this entire series is as i say drivel dripping with <UNK> it is another show hiding behind the reality label which is the trend it started in 2000 br br it is slick well produced so it might last a while yet after all so do re runs of <UNK> island green <UNK> the beverly <UNK> the brady bunch this just doesn't employ professional actors the intelligence level is about the same
<START> this is simply the funniest movie i've seen in a long time the bad acting bad script bad scenery bad costumes bad camera work and bad special effects are so stupid that you find yourself <UNK> with laughter br br so it's not gonna win an oscar but if you've got beer and friends round then you can't go wrong
<START> thats my bush is first of all a very entertaining show by parker and stone i thought its often very very funny and its quite <UNK> and crazy south park fans would surely get something here br br another surprise is the production value here a lot of money must have been put into this and it shows a lot of expensive little details its not a little show and comedy central is not an extremely rich channel but they put a lot into this show obviously in a way i understand that was the death of the show as well though too <UNK> it surely could have been done cheaper and went on the will was there br br the critics liked it and it had its little <UNK> but it failed gaining a big audience as we know the show stopped after 8 episodes which i guess is almost 1 season br br as i really liked the show it has its faults the problem of the show is kind of that it doesn't know what it wants to be really its like it tries to be a sitcom and a parody of a sitcom at the same time the actors do a good job and some of them are well casted but in my opinion they seem to not always get 100 the bizarre humor they're supposed to present br br i personally think that the show needed some characters that were more down to earth for the show to work in south park you have kyle and stan that are kind of a realistic touch in the more looney universe i think thats kind of what makes south park work you need some sane characters that you can relate to in a realistic way and that makes the insane stuff so much more interesting too because that forces you to take them seriously at some level if everything is <UNK> and stereotypes its difficult to get emotionally included in the show which really is thats my bush biggest problem kyle and stan is characters in south park that makes sense of the insanity in the show we have nothing like that here and this show suffers from it br br another <UNK> is parker and stones <UNK> with <UNK> its the only thing about them i don't really get what they're trying to do not portraying bush as nothing else than a dumb homer simpsons lovable kind of character is kind of <UNK> in a world where a lot of people that can't stand him and think he's the worst president since <UNK> and a parallel comedy world of <UNK> and so on that only <UNK> his every move but its difficult to understand if parker and stone actually means anything by it its like the joke is on us but somehow it doesn't hit the mark it seems awkward because it doesn't remind you of the real bush at all br br besides that i actually thought the show was very enjoyable some of the jokes in here are hilarious the pro life <UNK> who was a surviving <UNK> <UNK> is probably one of my favorite jokes by them in any show and the show is packed with great material and is sometimes insanely funny if you use your head a little while watching it
<START> <UNK> clock is a gripping suspense thriller that's a cross between a virus movie and a disaster film this movie which aired in two parts on nbc in its debut showing in 1996 is about an airplane flight that becomes infected with a virus when one of the passengers just happens to be carrying this disease the u s government <UNK> on whether the plane should be destroyed or not while the pilot richard dean anderson and a virus expert daphne <UNK> try to figure something out to avoid disaster i'm not really a big fan of tv movies and miniseries but i liked <UNK> clock it's one heck of a thrill ride jane <UNK> tv's <UNK> robert <UNK> and edward <UNK> as the president also star br br out of four

<START> ingrid bergman is a <UNK> <UNK> polish <UNK> in <UNK> paris who finds herself pursued by <UNK> most popular general and a glamorous count and that's on top of being engaged to a shoe <UNK> such is the <UNK> premise that <UNK> one of the most delirious plots in movie history there are <UNK> political <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> day <UNK> but the heart of this <UNK> photographed film is the frantic upstairs <UNK> <UNK> involving randy servants and only slightly more restrained <UNK> yes it's rules of the game <UNK> before it's all over even <UNK> <UNK> the jealous <UNK> in rules puts in an appearance as a gypsy <UNK> no less things happen a little too thick and fast toward the end resulting in some confusion for this non french <UNK> but what the heck <UNK> and her men is another deeply <UNK> <UNK> masterpiece
<START> while this was a better movie than 101 <UNK> live action not animated version i think it still fell a little short of what disney could do it was well filmed the music was more suited to the action and the effects were better done compared to 101 the acting was perhaps better but then the human characters were given far more appropriate roles in this sequel and glenn close is really not to be missed as in the first movie she makes it shine her poor <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are wonderful characters to play off of and they add to the spectacle disney has given us this is a great family film with little or no <UNK> material and yet it remains fun and interesting for adults and children alike it's bound to be a classic as so many disney films are here's to hoping the third will be even better still because you know they probably want to make one
<START> in the days before gore and sex took over real horror films were made castle of blood is in my <UNK> one of the finest although other reviewers have given it mixed ratings in an odd sort of way it reminds of the more recent the others which was in the theaters a couple of years ago br br director antonio <UNK> remade his own picture in 1970 <UNK> it this time web of the spider aka <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> del <UNK> why he did this i do not understand although the remake starred anthony <UNK> and <UNK> kinski and was very good in its own right perhaps he saw a good story and wished to <UNK> it more to american audiences i do not really know it is interesting that he did the original in black and white and the remake in color br br castle of blood is excellent italian gothic la <UNK> <UNK> is said to be an <UNK> work of edgar allen poe who appears in this film poe and lord <UNK> owner of a haunted castle bet american writer alan foster george <UNK> that he cannot spend all souls night in said castle and survive foster eagerly accepts the bet but soon regrets it for he is witness to a series of murders committed by ghosts it seems that the ghosts come back to life once every few years but are doomed to re <UNK> the crimes they committed in life lord <UNK> conveniently forgot to tell foster that his blood is needed for them to <UNK> themselves on the next all souls night br br it does not take foster and the beautiful <UNK> <UNK> portrayed by the <UNK> barbara steele long to fall in love even though their romance is doomed because <UNK> is one of the ghosts i will not give the ending away but will just say that castle of blood is every bit a romantic tragedy as it is a horror story br br comments this film is greatly atmospheric even by the excellent standards of the italians my personal opinion is they do true horror better than anybody and the somewhat dim black and white filming only enhances this in fairness web of the spider was fine in its own right even with color and greater <UNK> i loved the lingering shots something most modern day directors do not have the patience for indeed when alan first enters the doomed castle we are treated to several minutes of him doing nothing but <UNK> around from room to room the dread <UNK> <UNK> building in his face and mannerisms by the time the first ghost appears the audience is thoroughly <UNK> and ready there is wonderful dialogue between alan and the ghosts something else not often done in standard ghost stories there are also memorable scenes very visual for this type of film <UNK> murder and the dance scene reminds somewhat of the similar dance of the <UNK> in <UNK> carnival of souls were particularly good br br sadly few general interest viewers will ever hear of much less see this film that is a shame for this one is a cut above the rest i got my copy from sinister cinema and am not certain if it can be purchased anywhere else for persons interested in this genre it is a must see
<START> i can't believe it imdb really does have every tv show known to man i have not seen this show in over 20 years i only remember two episodes and i barely remember those i remember that tony may not been on from the start because one of the episodes i remember is the one in which everybody trying to get tony to join but he rejects them but typically at the end of the show he becomes a member of power house with everybody cheering br br the other one i remember is the one where <UNK> for some reason pretends to be dead complete with funeral and <UNK> i don't remember why he plays dead or how the show ends br br this is one of those shows that i convinced myself that i must have <UNK> up since no one else had ever heard of it
<START> monty <UNK> and dennis <UNK> followed up 'the <UNK> with this a fantasy series about three <UNK> spies which <UNK> 'the six million dollar man' it was a favourite of mine when i was a <UNK> and i enjoy watching it still stuart damon and william <UNK> had an <UNK> on screen chemistry as craig <UNK> and richard <UNK> while the <UNK> alexandra <UNK> <UNK> her way through her role as <UNK> <UNK> the late anthony <UNK> made a wonderfully gruff <UNK> by far the best episodes were those written by tony <UNK> terry nation and brian <UNK> while <UNK> own 'the <UNK> compared <UNK> with 'the <UNK> i regret that there was never a second series the concept had so much life left in it would craig and richard have been <UNK> for <UNK> affections what if <UNK> had learned of the <UNK> powers did the <UNK> have any other abilities other than those we saw we never found out alas
<START> the original thunderbirds earned a place in tv history it was and still is much beloved indeed the entire first 10 minutes of the wallace and <UNK> movie the <UNK> is a direct lift of thunderbirds down to a direct replay of the original <UNK> 2 <UNK> sequence if you don't believe me get the movie and then get a copy of the original episode where <UNK> 2 is launched br br this movie was a crass attempt at making a kids' movie when the original was loved and enjoyed by kids and adults alike in the original the thunderbirds spent all of their time <UNK> people who were often trapped when mother nature or technology went horrible wrong yes there was also the occasional criminal act the thunderbirds put their own lives and resources at risk for no reward the very essence of <UNK> and <UNK> there was little physical violence the thunderbirds challenged the imagination to a degree how many of us would dream of someday building a <UNK> 2 and don't <UNK> the power of entertainment to do this many japanese <UNK> their fascination with <UNK> robots to the old <UNK> cartoon br br but this movie was a poor re image of the original this movie came across as a <UNK> between thunderbirds and loony tunes i mean we have anthony <UNK> as brain imitating <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> much of the action consists of kung fu power rangers type fighting indeed there were funny sound effects when someone got nailed on the head with a <UNK> pan the tech that fired our imagination was absent instead we have these kids running around using a plot device that was never in the original series having the entire team take off at once leaving the base occupied by the kids and brain then there was a dose of use the force luke <UNK> thrown in when <UNK> would <UNK> something or another coupled with the the hood using <UNK> that looked like they were lifted from <UNK> tiger hidden dragon about the only thing missing was for the hood to go <UNK> i am your uncle with a breath mask voice the heart that made thunderbirds unique was gone br br the only bright point was ron <UNK> portrayal of parker he caught it perfectly but the actress playing lady penelope came across as a child huh br br and this is why we hate this movie when someone puts out something that was popular to a fan base and expects the fans to shell out money to watch and then delivers something than wasn't even close to what the fans expect well i am sorry that is just plain wrong ok so if they were making a kids' movie fine next time <UNK> it straight to video where many of these belong but don't package something up in a familiar <UNK> and change the <UNK>
<START> what are people on here talking about i must have seen a different movie than you guys i was so bored that i walked out of the theater what is up with this stuff i only laughed once and not even that hard whoever <UNK> this movie should be taken out into the street and beaten i usually always find something i like in a movie but this is crazy <UNK> makes not another teen movie look like a classic it ranks up there with such trash as body shots con air and conspiracy theory as one of the worst of all time avoid at all costs i thought the studio would be <UNK> out money to people as they left the theater as a sign of their apologies but to my <UNK> that wasn't happening looks like i will never see that money again or the two hours
<START> this excellent series narrated by laurence olivier brilliantly it should be said <UNK> the beginning to the end of world war 2 the origins are not entirely examined fully from <UNK> fall at the hands of the <UNK> <UNK> which helped <UNK> hitler's demonic rise but as one reviewer says that must be hard to do in a 26 part series with so much to <UNK> in br br apart from the expected combat photography action there are plenty of personal emotional and human <UNK> that are told giving the viewer an amazing insight especially if you're not necessarily a world war 2 buff fan episodes showing <UNK> and what life was like on the home front of the main allies <UNK> britain germany japan russia and the u s a were quite eye opening showing the extreme <UNK> of the war on the <UNK> and of course the <UNK> of civilians the death camps etc were very well handled and exposed i'd fully recommend this in any history class for the younger generation of which it could be said i am one at <UNK> br br certain things are quite strangely left out like the <UNK> of the new jet era beginning with frank <UNK> experimental <UNK> jet and the <UNK> <UNK> combat debut as well as that of the german <UNK> me <UNK> especially as the v 1 was seen making its debut and there was surprisingly smaller mention of the <UNK> this is probably a small <UNK> not referring to the more sensational secret and fantastic weapons which ww2 brought forward from a more <UNK> old science but a great series that made its mark and has done so ever since when thankfully repeated br br a series to own as a box set in history terms on dvd for anyone especially who happens to be a military fan jeremy <UNK> and <UNK> tv should be well proud
<START> i must warn you there are some spoilers in it but to start it off i got spanish judges on <UNK> i think it was mention it was the last copy but as i see it wasn't back ordered but either way i have it i thought it was good i wanted to see this mainly because of the great actor matthew <UNK> i'm surprised no one on the reviews mention the <UNK> although it is kind of low budget getting enough money to make this film would be worth spending man what a good actor br br the story it about a con artist known as jack matthew <UNK> who claims to have <UNK> called the spanish judges if you don't know what spanish judges are or haven't seen the trailer for this and this is the first review you have read i won't even say what they are i figure it would be a big twist of no one knew what it was he needs protection so he hires a couple who are also crooks max and jamie vincent <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as well as a crook that goes by the name of piece mark <UNK> junior he has a girlfriend who won't even tell anyone her name because she's from mars as she said so they mainly jack call her mars girl everything starts out fine but then it turns to one big game a game that involves some lust lies and betrayal br br there was some over acting in it matt and <UNK> as well as <UNK> were not one of them there were some scenes they could've done better and the score could've been a little better as well some of the score was actually good the theme they used for the beginning and the end before the credits was a good song choice that's my opinion the fight scene in the end could've been a little longer and a little more violent but what can you do one more comment on matt damn he plays a smooth slick con man br br i know this is a review but i need to make a <UNK> towards <UNK> one of the reviewers <UNK> <UNK> is not a newcomer according to this site she has been acting since 1983 to me and hopefully to others she is well known as charlie <UNK> italian love interest in both the hot shots movies but good review br br although i think it's one of the rare films i've seen and it's really good which is why i gave it 10 stars above i will give the grade of what i thought when i first saw it br br 8 10
<START> a boy and a girl is chased by a local warrior because the boy killed by accident the warriors father or whoever he was and they travel through the nature of <UNK> most <UNK> areas br br the acting in this movie isn't that good except for that elephant kid but it's a very good adventure and it's not very <UNK> there is some blood flesh and nudity which <UNK> up the movie a bit br br i give this movie a 7 because of it's picture of the african nature and it's action
<START> 1st watched 11 7 2002 2 out of 10 <UNK> john <UNK> pretty lame gangster movie about a godfather like family in brooklyn who like to say four letter words a lot and kill people the only thing of interest here was their attempt to show the <UNK> being a lot like the gang this is the only attempt at good film making the rest of the movie was predictable and cheaply made the quality of the photography on some of the scenes inside bars and <UNK> <UNK> almost made you think there was a problem with your dvd player because of the bad <UNK> and some of the actors were hard to hear at times because of the bad sound the acting was pretty much <UNK> of all your favorite gangsters from better movies with corny names like <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and the plot pretty much followed those <UNK> as well so go see a better gangster movie before you put your money out for this one
<START> well what can i say this movie really got to me it's not so bad as many say i really loved it although the idea seems so simple and rather boring it isn't first of all i enjoyed the soundtrack bryan adams it really goes with the movie second the simple story and the drama of spirit gets your attention one thing i like the most is that they didn't give the <UNK> a human voice to interact with the other horses it makes the movie more realistic not many animations seem realistic now do they but i don't know making animals talk is just so lame br br one of the most beautiful animations of 2002 in my opinion i recommend it to everyone not just the kids because it is very relaxing
<START> what ever happened to michael keaton what a great actor and he proves it in this movie this movie is actually funny and the reason why this movie is funny is for two reasons an excellent script and michael keaton this movie is one of the funniest comedies in the history of hollywood this movie is the ultimate spoof of gangster movies in this movie hollywood actually <UNK> fun at itself by using the the gangster movie genre as the basis for a truly original comedy the rest of the cast is funny too especially the supporting cast if you like to laugh and want to watch a movie that contains <UNK> humor then this movie is for you
<START> looked forward to viewing this film and seeing these great actors perform however i was sadly disappointed in the script and the entire plot of the story david duchovny dr eugene <UNK> connie carla <UNK> was the doctor in the story who uses drugs and <UNK> his license to practice medicine dr <UNK> was visiting a night club and was able to use his medical experience to help a wounded <UNK> and was <UNK> by angelina jolie claire taking lives <UNK> who immediately becomes attracted to dr david <UNK> timothy <UNK> raymond <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> plays the big shot gangster and a man with all kinds of money and connections timothy <UNK> seems to over act in most of the scenes and goes completely out of his mind trying to keep his gang members from being killed gary <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> vegas tv series plays a great supporting role and portrays a real cool dude who is a so called body guard for raymond <UNK> angelina jolie looks beautiful and sexy with her ruby red lips which draws a great deal of attention from all the men this film is not the greatest but it does entertain
<START> i saw this movie as a kid on creature feature when i lived in new york it was a pretty creepy movie though not as good as horror hotel i just bought this movie on dvd and it is different from what i remember because in the dvd that i bought there are several scenes where the actors speak in french and or italian and no subtitles are provided then the other actors respond in english to what was being said kind of weird also on the dvd box the names of some of the actors are spelled differently than on imdb br br aside from that this movie is different in that the character of <UNK> takes her clothes off and provides a nude shot in one scene and in another scene julia tries to force elizabeth barbara steele to make out with her by pushing her down on the bed and kissing her while steele <UNK> that scene existed in the tv version but it was very edited i wonder if there is any extra footage that could be <UNK> into a <UNK> ultra edition it seems sad that some of these old low budget classics have been spliced to bits and sold in all kinds of edited versions where are the master tapes and all the <UNK> footage br br aside from the first boring twenty minutes before allen is delivered to the castle the rest of the movie is pretty good there aren't too many special effects but <UNK> face after julia <UNK> him is a good one the creepy atmosphere and the strange exotic and seductive look of barbara steele make the movie a lot better than it should be i can honestly say that if barbara steele had not been in this film it would be a big zero she makes the movie a ten
<START> this is a typical example of technically highly skilled directors of video clips commercials trying to do their first full feature length movie on one hand the imagery camera lighting cgi and even the sound are highly polished and have a truly expensive look and feel even the actors show a certain amount of potential <UNK> the point where even the best acting could not hide a bad plot br br in this case it is not a bad plot but hardly a plot at all br br so 50 of the dialog consists of what the hell was that what was that and what the hell was that in none of the cases any of the characters nor the audience is provided with the slightest hint of an answer though in most of the other dialogues one gets the feeling that there never was any form of dialogue book and the actors had to <UNK> <UNK> to a plot that wasn't ever explained to them br br the only reason why <UNK> <UNK> performance could be so good is that her character as an <UNK> girl didn't allow giving her these <UNK> horrible dialogue lines the other actors had to deal with that way she was able to just show her acting talent which the rest of the cast couldn't even get close to i mean there's not one actor in the world that could make up for a dialogue like this br br ben is this real huh emily stop it ben a mass <UNK> huh jon somebody has to take control of this situation ben this situation can't be controlled not by you not by anybody emily not by you either ben no br br got me <UNK> but not for horror more for the horrible attempt in some moments i felt ashamed for the actors to have added this to their <UNK> br br 2 stars for the excellent technical work
<START> the romance of the movie which is also its main theme is good and nicely presented however the surrounding of the love story is too <UNK> <UNK> and unrealistic even worse the psychology of the main character is weird and incomprehensible exactly like the end of the movie don't hesitate to watch this movie if it attracted your interest but don't expect too much of it either
<START> one of my favorite shows back in the '70s as i recall it went to air on friday or possibly saturday night on the nine network here in australia darren <UNK> and simon <UNK> were great together br br each episode usually reached a climax with <UNK> having to engage in hand to hand combat with some sort of supernatural <UNK> to their credit the writers made a <UNK> effort to get away from the usual round of vampires and ghosts as much as possible br br i remember one episode in which the <UNK> was the spirit of an ancient indian chief which who <UNK> <UNK> as a massive <UNK> current which started to kill people in a city hospital the final showdown saw <UNK> trying to short circuit the <UNK> <UNK> amidst an explosion of sparks and <UNK> flames oh well you had to be there at the time but it was an interesting idea br br <UNK> always packed a lot of energy and enthusiasm into his roles and this was one of his best br br definitely deserves a place in tv's hall of fame to quote tony vincenzo <UNK> you are on it ' or in the case of the hall of fame <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the <UNK> were a golden age of los angeles with its film industry and great potential of various other possibilities to become rich and famous and happy people were arriving there hoping to fulfill their dreams expecting open arms and <UNK> offers there were only a few who managed to succeed and find their way to stardom majority then condemned to live starving <UNK> and <UNK> searching for a bit of respect in dirty bars and nasty hotel rooms br br young italian american writer <UNK> <UNK> arrives to la on a similar quest to spread his charms around to get one of those beautiful wealthy women and to write an excellent novel that would set him on a career path having so far written a single short story published in an obscure anthology wishing to create a romantic masterpiece he seems to be unable to produce anything without experiencing it himself though occasionally he sends pieces of magazine stories to a local editor that helps him survive he is proud to present himself as an italian but deep in his heart he truly feels his italian origin as a burden the little money and the courage to <UNK> the world he once had are all long gone and watching his dream turning into a <UNK> he holds a last single <UNK> to spend br br the coffee she brought him was cold and sour and spitting a curse on her <UNK> a never ending relationship of insults <UNK> excuses and a love <UNK> beneath <UNK> being an <UNK> girl trying to receive us <UNK> through a marriage also carries her heavy cross of a non perspective racial <UNK> though she is much of a stronger and life experienced person her situation as a beautiful mexican woman is much harder to deal with than <UNK> is able to realize br br is it obvious that <UNK> eventually finds his inspiration to work on the novel is it possible that their love finally finds its place in the sun is it likely that their romance takes an unlucky turn br br it is very surprising to find out that the chemistry between the two main characters performed by <UNK> <UNK> and colin farrell does not work the relationship lacks the raw and authentic feelings <UNK> though <UNK> a character compared to <UNK> forgot to arm <UNK> with the passion and strength of her once brilliant character <UNK> also it is hard to have faith in a character which being intelligent but <UNK> and illiterate uses quite difficult <UNK> and complicated sentences a <UNK> character of a phil <UNK> sort would definitely suit farrell better though he looks stunning in a period costume he seems very lost trying to find the fragile world of a twenty year old <UNK> <UNK> between a hidden love and desire to be true to himself br br feeling embarrassed watching the two on the screen is not right their relationship might have been wild but it is more likely what a thunder and a lightning are without a storm far from real passion feelings just described not felt inside it is very sad that such a potential of an interesting script and good actors was wasted turned into a grey average of soon to be forgotten
<START> i think i laughed twice the line where the main character says something about being from the streets and then i forget the other time i laughed it was probably in the beginning br br this has to be one of the <UNK> movies ever doesn't hollywood realize that this kind of humor is <UNK> and sad really you can only insult yourself so many times br br 2 10
<START> okay the film festival crowd probably loved it but your average popcorn <UNK> movie goer who has <UNK> to <UNK> the ten or fifteen bucks it costs to see a movie these days will probably wonder why he or she made this choice if it's <UNK> <UNK> it's automatically great stuff right wrong it's a neat spoof of <UNK> <UNK> but it's terribly in i worry when film makers are more concerned about entertaining themselves rather than the public it's interesting as a cinematic <UNK> and it does have a chuckle or two in it but once it's run its course in the movies and on tv the dust will grow thick on the film <UNK> and tape boxes holding it hardly either <UNK> or an epic
<START> this is an excellent show i had a us history teacher in high school that was much like this there are many facts in history that are not quite true and mr <UNK> points them out very well in a way that is unforgettable br br mr <UNK> is teaching a class of film students but history students and even the general public will appreciate the witty way that he <UNK> some very well known <UNK> in the history of the world and <UNK> to impress them upon that brains of his students use of live actors performing skits is also very entertaining br br i highly recommend this series to anyone interested in having the history they learned as a child turned upside down
<START> i found the characters mediocre and the story uninteresting i never had to read this book thankfully or it would have been a painful experience i got the tickets to the preview for free but it still wasn't worth my time or my friend's i think this story is not worth telling it's like saying that old people have a past before they got old no kidding the lives of the main characters were painful to watch one generation no better than the next at avoiding stupid mistakes however i think the actors did the best they could with a lame story i've always been a big fan of ellen <UNK> i'm writing this review to <UNK> the positive reviews given which unfortunately convinced me to give this movie a try
<START> a bugs life is a great film that is not just for kids but for adults too the story is set around a colony of ants and their struggle against the evil <UNK> who come back every year and steal their food a mirror of the <UNK> seven there is some <UNK> computer animation and the voices are great too you will love it 8 out of 10
<START> this miserable film is a remake of a <UNK> film they should have let it remain that way br br what a <UNK> bomb douglas fairbanks displays absolutely no charisma here <UNK> romero is subjected to a role as a real jerk and bette <UNK> sings with a chorus what i'll do to that hungarian br br the ridiculous plot deals with a picture of a woman in a castle in <UNK> rome that saved the day by killing a <UNK> fairbanks now let's fast forward to 300 years later where <UNK> just married to the count romero faces a similar situation when on her wedding night there is an invasion by hungarian soldiers br br romero acts cowardly and <UNK> before the army arrives he <UNK> himself as a gypsy and is made to remain at the castle when his <UNK> playing <UNK> fairbanks the ending is worse than the entire wretched film when <UNK> meets fairbanks to tell him the good news an <UNK> romero has <UNK> the marriage br br this poor imitation of a movie was made in 1948 as harry <UNK> a veteran supporting player who is in it died in 1949 this must have been his last film what a bomb to go out with after such a distinguished career br br walter <UNK> co stars but he can do little with such poor writing the costumes look more like those that would come out of the stone age i can't <UNK> what fairbanks was wearing
<START> okay like most steven seagal fans i know i not going expect a masterpiece every time he makes a film but i do expect the film to at least have some <UNK> budget the main problem with the copy i watched was the terrible over dubbing i know that in some films this has to be done and i accept that but when they <UNK> with a totally different actors voice and keep doing this thru out the film it does take the magic of <UNK> away also the sets seem to be built with no care as in one scene the <UNK> glass top in a top secret lab has a massive crack going thru it i was truly disappointed with this film and only hope stevens next project will be more finished off before sending the film out for buying renting the story of this film had me wondering if i was watching a sci fi film or not some parts seemed alien like but they never fully explained what was going on i found it very confusing
<START> i can't believe that so many are comparing this movie to <UNK> his work is far more imaginative and vicious and a lot more fun br br the director simply lacks the ability to build real tension the murder scenes and let's face it that's what this genre is all about aren't interesting it was not hard to guess who the murderer was and i really didn't care when it was revealed the cinematography isn't memorable and the much praised 19th century gothic atmosphere just didn't draw me in several of the actors are quite good especially the <UNK> and the sadistic girl who <UNK> it over the younger students but they're given very little to do br br yes there are undertones of incest <UNK> and <UNK> but amazingly they add very little spice or suspense br br if you're looking for a good horror movie look elsewhere
<START> liked stanley <UNK> very much acting was very good story had a unique and interesting <UNK> the absence of violence and sex was refreshing characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings very enjoyable movie
<START> i really liked this movie even though it wasn't anything like any of the books it still the that classic nancy drew style i had been seeing a lot of <UNK> for this movie and since i was really into the nancy drew books i had really high expectations for this movie and they most definitely met those expectations pretty much all of the characters were exactly how i <UNK> them from reading the books i am really happy that i saw this movie all of the actors and actresses really acted like they acted like in the book series ever since i saw this movie i have wanted to read every single nancy drew book there is out there all of the actors and actresses really got into their characters and it definitely showed when the aired this movie on the big screen it definitely seemed like all of the actors and actresses were really in the positions that the characters were in i most definitely give this movie a 10 out of 10
<START> i really enjoyed this documentary about kenny and <UNK> attempt to pitch the dawn was a great look at how <UNK> try to get to the inside to make it big br br the story was put together well and organized in an interesting manner that made the film flow well certainly worth a watch my only complaint is that their appeared to be no closure perhaps that is part of the point we expect it but in reality that is not what happened or usually happens br br the film is also a great way to see the personality of kenny and spencer outside of their canadian television show you can see a bit of what is yet to come br br i look forward to a chance to see the <UNK> chase
<START> this cowardly and offensive film had me intrigued to begin with the characters are the familiar <UNK> young males frequently to be seen hanging around bored in a sea side town robert is an <UNK> but he has his music which could have been his soul instead clay makes robert into a freak who <UNK> on a journey into <UNK> and ecstasy and getting in with the wrong crowd clay seems to believe in <UNK> madness and robert ends the film as a homicidal rapist one wonders how much experience of real life this young director has no one can save poor robert clay leaves us with the message that young british men are out of control a very <UNK> link is made to the <UNK> <UNK> during the needlessly graphic rape we are subjected to explosions and images of war the film shows male <UNK> group <UNK> pushed to it's limits the young <UNK> in london draw a parallel with <UNK> hateful depiction of modern male clay implies that men simply cannot help themselves from <UNK> terrible acts of violence it is a wonder the british film industry allows money to be invested in films which <UNK> such <UNK> propaganda when in london we are still <UNK> from the recent attacks this is <UNK> first film i would be delighted if it is his last
<START> while channel surfing we found this movie with its promising synopsis we were <UNK> at the flat acting and formulaic storyline we found amusing the exploding car scenes unbelievable shoot outs and sets that crash down with the weight of <UNK> <UNK> and cardboard what was even more hilarious was seeing all the recycled scenes from <UNK> peak where the church front falls on the school bus the store <UNK> break away from the main street the <UNK> <UNK> and the red truck <UNK> down the alley way as the <UNK> fall down on it it was a good laugh although <UNK> and leaves the viewer wondering if it was not originally intended as a low budget spoof of disaster films
<START> as far as parody films go there are few that are worth time and energy but with a recent <UNK> of horrid parodies such as date movie and the <UNK> it is a breath of fresh air to come back and <UNK> a truly funny farce like johnny dangerously br br after his mother has no end of medical problems little johnny goes to work for the mob what <UNK> is a series of gags most of which work there are however the occasional <UNK> but a foreign gangster who can't master the american language profanity wise at least a rival gangster with a <UNK> for shooting his mouth off once a younger brother with the d a who is out to get <UNK> dangerously and a hot young <UNK> hot for his affections have johnny busy br br and the viewer will be busy laughing for the most part as every gangster movie cliché is <UNK> by a talented cast and decent writing br br not perfect by a long shot but definitely good for a smile on a bad day
<START> rating 10 10 master piece br br some years ago i heard spielberg comment that he would <UNK> the movie here and there if he had a chance well mr spielberg i guess nothing is perfect but this movie together with <UNK> list is your best even oprah acts well in this one br br what got me most is the realism of the story and drama stuff like this happened and is still happening in the world
<START> i admit that the majority of this film was uninspired but i was still entertained it has a wonderful sense of frenetic energy above average music and the women in the film <UNK> defend themselves there's no <UNK> here i can think of dozens of other films that were way worse at least this one had an intriguing <UNK> along with some social commentary they <UNK> to how the military deals with <UNK> <UNK> destroy everything in sight even if it means the people you're supposed to be saving also how dangerous martial law can be since at that point democracy <UNK> to exist fulci seemed to attempt to combine his earlier work zombie beyond gates of hell in an effort to somehow improve on them he failed but definitely not miserably like a number of people would have you think i have a soft spot for zombie films so i admit that i'm somewhat biased when it comes to reviewing them all i'm saying is that this movie is good for one time around if there wasn't so much <UNK> in the making of this film fulci quit and bruno i can hack with the best of them mattei took over it could have been much better and more focused it's going to stay in my collection as <UNK> zombie <UNK> song one surprising note is that there is a scene in zombie 3 that cemetery man actually ripped off i couldn't believe it myself check it out you'll be surprised
<START> so many wonderful actresses in one film serve as a practical <UNK> to the local movie house so i <UNK> <UNK> here are some remarks br br vanessa redgrave is great even while lying in bed she also looks very old and i don't think this is achieved with much make up which is a good thing for the film but a sad thing for us cinema goers i think her aging got a bit harsh in recent years claire danes continues her welcome return to the movies and exudes a definite warmth <UNK> <UNK> resemblance to her mother <UNK> streep both in terms of physical appearance and acting style is so striking that i lost my concentration to the film for a couple of minutes after her entrance she is surprisingly good however such a resemblance has the danger of working against her favor i agree with a previous comment natasha richardson definitely had some plastic job done to her face she certainly does not look like how i remember her from previous films <UNK> for example both she and toni collette sadly do not make much impression partly because they do not look convincing as sisters their interplay is weak toni collette additionally is way too old for her character glenn close and meryl streep had to have more screen time <UNK> performance actually is little more than a cameo her scenes on the other hand have bigger emotional <UNK> than the rest of the film <UNK> <UNK> provides some welcome dry wit especially in her second role as an imaginary <UNK> companion to <UNK> character as for the men hugh <UNK> <UNK> the film considerably even though he gives a <UNK> performance than needed as a matter of fact as soon as he <UNK> the story it starts to drag it is also to his credit that he manages to create the exact necessary sense of <UNK> charm in the viewer patrick wilson on the other hand is a complete void at the center of the film he also has the misfortune that the script is <UNK> in explaining why three people one of them a man are so much smitten by this man the <UNK> to this should have been developed more br br the cinematography is excellent as expected however the main summer house set failed to convince me it does not look natural on the top of that rocky hill particularly with its grass <UNK> in the front a bit too cardboard like br br overall the film is a classy production but a seen it all before cried at it all before feeling took over me during most of its duration and consequently it failed to make the kind of impact on me that i expected from a <UNK> however it still managed to make me thoughtful about the passing of time about one's expectations from life and the extent to which these are <UNK> or not worth trying at least on dvd if not at the movies
<START> this title seems more like a filming exercise than a film that should have been released to be seen by the public for dafoe and his wife it must have been fun working together in a film for the first time without taking into consideration that people might actually watch it i felt like it was <UNK> wasted as i waited <UNK> for a plot to develop or even begin br br try to fit this film into a genre and you won't because it lacks a beginning middle or ending i've seen <UNK> movies before and this doesn't even come close to being arty abstract or original it just seems to me to be completely pointless br br i think it speaks for itself when the only persons that rated this film a 10 were the under 18 age group no doubt for the constant pointless erotic scenes that the film was <UNK> on throwing at us that is if you can call it erotic it certainly didn't have taste
<START> when it comes to movies i am generally easily entertained and not very critical but must say that this movie was one big flop from the start i gave it 30 minutes and then <UNK> it what a waste of some great talent i was very disappointed with this movie as it was not what i expected
<START> i looked at this movie with my child eyes and i wasn't disappointed the story is well known some abandoned orphan has to be brought to his parents by an improbable trio <UNK> <UNK> tiger and a lazy animal and i don't want to forget to mention the incredible small fury animal with his <UNK> this one really made me laugh a lot during the whole picture br br briefly it works it is funny and it is a must see with your children they'll like it
<START> i'm a big fan of pacino movies he's one of if not the best actors of this genre however this movie could've been a whole lot better even though it had a poor cast all they had to do was tell the story of carlito <UNK> up until he went to jail instead it seemed like this was just one of many stories that could be told of carlito all or even some of the questions about his past that we wondered about in the original could've been answered as far as i'm concerned thats the only way you can make this movie instead we get this prequel that has almost none of the original characters in it a character that plays a different part from the original horrible move and a totally different love interest for carlito don't even get me started with <UNK> no way can i take that cat seriously as a <UNK> after watching him dance in all his artists videos <UNK> that dude opened his mouth i was waiting for him to start dancing he made me laugh if anything mario van <UNK> surprised me with his role i thought he was gonna give a lackluster performance due to his recent history he did rather well he was probably the most believable out of the entire cast in my opinion jay <UNK> did his best but doesn't have the skills right now in his career to take on this role i appreciated his energy and his efforts though hard to follow up pacino the only way you could even have a clue about what kind of person carlito was is to watch the original otherwise carlito looks like a cold blooded killer in one scene then a <UNK> <UNK> in another he was one of the <UNK> <UNK> of his time but you would only see flashes of that in this movie maybe this is a pitiful way for hollywood to try and make a 2nd prequel to cash in on this failure wouldn't surprise me br br overall in my opinion this movie fell well short or what it could've been the only reason i gave it a 3 was because i laughed a lot and mario van <UNK> earned some respect back with me a serious director should've taken this movie and actually put time into the story and turned it into an actual prequel i'm extremely disappointed that this movie wasn't taken seriously they would've been better off making this into a mini series on hbo and actually telling the story like the original suggests at the end of the movie they had the nerve to suggest that carlito would have to come back to the city <UNK> thats the part everyone wants to see then again this is all just my opinion i can't tell you how to waste your money
<START> have you ever seen a movie made up entirely of long wide shots no me neither well i've finally seen one in spring in my hometown and i must confess now i know why people don't do this the technique is arty to be sure but it's definitely not <UNK> for public <UNK> the technique is heavily flawed simply because the viewer has no emotional <UNK> to the characters and perhaps that might be the director's whole intentions i don't know i can't read minds and i certainly don't know enough about the director to make a judgement br br but one thing about this movie that is painfully obvious is its ridiculous anti american sentiments as an american i'm well aware of my country's participation in the korean war and i'm very well aware that we weren't always angels but i'll be damn if i'll take this guy's version of how things happened according to this blind fool americans were not only at the root of the war we were the cause of the war and we almost <UNK> destroyed the country whatever mister director and i suppose you'd still be making this film in communist korea if we hadn't <UNK> right talk about forgetting your history this is almost akin to making the nazis the good guys while turning the allied forces into the bad guys this movie is so historically naive and so <UNK> inaccurate that it's almost embarrassing to watch for a man who comes from a country that owes its very existence to american <UNK> he sure comes off as high and mighty and <UNK>
<START> witty funny intelligent awesome i was flipping channels late one night years ago came across this and a <UNK> started i was staying up late every night and <UNK> it for everyone i know a few like 3 people out of the almost 100 people i made watch this didn't think it was as awesome as i did the others were laughing out loud so hard they were crying and <UNK> me at the same time please do yourself a favor run don't walk watch this and enjoy intelligence and humor it's a win win situation i wish i could have afternoon tea with him and meet the truly rare comedian that we as a society need more of <UNK>
<START> you can call it a mystery perhaps a small thriller or an intelligent film br br the story takes you through the life of one person who has lost his life and is looking to regain it br br i have to say i was quite surprised that i truly did enjoy this film it is not usually the genre i care for however the characters quickly became people to me and i wanted to know what they were about and what was going to happen to them br br just like many french films over english made we are able to learn much more about the character and the affect of their surroundings on their person this film is character driven and will not disappoint
<START> american playwright howard w campbell jr played with a <UNK> <UNK> by nick nolte lives happily in germany with his actress wife <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lee before the beginning of world war ii at the peak of his life howard is <UNK> by an american agent john goodman to become a spy on behalf of the allies <UNK> of the risks the job holds howard has everything to lose but finds the offer irresistible following the death of his wife and the end of the war campbell <UNK> himself with the <UNK> of a <UNK> life in new york city which <UNK> his <UNK> even further the central question indeed a question that has frustrated many critics of the movie and kurt <UNK> source novel is is campbell a hero or a <UNK> director keith gordon and screenwriter robert b <UNK> offer us clues but no answer and this <UNK> not <UNK> what keeps mother night fresh and interesting throughout at the beginning of the film nolte portrays campbell as intelligent and confident by the end he's either scared and uncertain or scared and completely certain of his contribution debt to humanity for the role he played in the war gordon applies a certain icy sheen to the images of the film's first half which <UNK> his portrait of the nazi <UNK> and captures <UNK> dramatic side on the flip side when campbell is confined to his lonely new york apartment which he <UNK> calls <UNK> only to be discovered by a group of nazis the humor produced also is purely distinctive of the author and provides a temporary <UNK> from the dramatic tension that unfolds the moral even spiritual <UNK> mother night presents doesn't lend itself to simple resolution and to a degree should be left <UNK> black and white scenes of campbell staring <UNK> into space as he is imprisoned in israel suggest an <UNK> <UNK> we are not made <UNK> <UNK> campbell is a character whose inner <UNK> we wind up knowing very little about the war changes him coming back to america changes him and meeting up with the nazis in new york <UNK> him to <UNK> the <UNK> of his act even further to the point where he can only stare <UNK> at an image of himself projected on a wall <UNK> anti <UNK> <UNK> perhaps that's the best reaction we could hope for
<START> this movie blew me away if you can see only one of the animated bug movies this year see this one instead of <UNK> the plot characters and jokes are better in a bugs life also when you go stay in your seat until the end of the credits it's the best part of the movie rating 9
<START> without a doubt this is one of the worst pictures i ever actually paid money to see the kind of flick you choose out of desperation at the mall cinema during a christmas holiday when you have missed the start times for anything good but still are dead set on seeing a movie and that is exactly how i came to see this stink bomb br br at the distance of the better part of three decades i can still smell the rotting fish that <UNK> this story line unbelievable plot that a killer whale carries a grudge against an individual not of the sea is laughable and that's about all except for a completely out of place love theme that plays over the finish of a film devoid of a love story at least charlotte <UNK> is lovely in a two dimensional role but richard harris just <UNK> up the scenery he was no captain <UNK> robert shaw and this is no jaws mercifully i have put most of it out of mind and when i run across it on television air casts i move on immediately danger will robinson see the current t v commercial showing a husband and wife whale watching <UNK> i love <UNK> at least it is over in sixty seconds this flick represents <UNK> minutes of my life that i will never get back
<START> <UNK> is a brilliant <UNK> epic of a group of thoroughly modern men who <UNK> on a <UNK> trip to briefly <UNK> with nature and instead have to fight for their sanity their lives and perhaps even their souls the film has aged well despite being made in the early seventies it certainly doesn't look particularly dated it still possesses a visceral punch and iconic status as a dramatic post <UNK> of the <UNK> philosophical and cultural shock vehicle there are very few films with similar <UNK> that can compare <UNK> to it although the legendary sam <UNK> stuff would have to be up there yes there has been considerable debate and discussion about the film's most confronting scene which i won't expand upon here and undoubtedly one of the most confronting scenes in the entire history of the cinematic medium but what surprises about this film is how <UNK> beautiful it is at times this seems to be generally overlooked yet in retrospect quite understandably so the cinematography that captures the essence of the <UNK> fragile river wilderness is often absolutely stunning and it <UNK> the film as in a moment of brief madness we the viewers along with the characters themselves are <UNK> into <UNK> nightmare <UNK> narrative is <UNK> lean and <UNK> and it is surprising how quickly events unfold from point of establishment through to crisis and aftermath it all takes place very quickly which lends a sense of very real urgency to the film the setting is established effectively through the opening credits the characters are all well drawn despite limited time spent on back story we know just enough about them to know them for the kind of man they are like them and ultimately fear for them when all goes to hell the conflict and violence within the movie seems to <UNK> out of nowhere with a frightening lack of logic this is author james <UNK> theme that any <UNK> <UNK> about the nature of man's perceived inherent <UNK> can only <UNK> and die when his barely <UNK> animal instincts come to the <UNK> there are no demons or <UNK> here the <UNK> <UNK> as the film's central villains are merely crude <UNK> amoral cousins of our protagonists they shock because their evil is petty and <UNK> the film has no <UNK> characters all reflect something about the weaknesses and <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the latter 20th century and all are very real and <UNK> burt reynolds is wonderful in this movie as the <UNK> ho and almost <UNK> over confident <UNK> lewis and it is a shame to think that he really couldn't <UNK> his brief moment of dramatic glory throughout the rest of his still <UNK> up and down career <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> perhaps trust me if your are not a reynolds fan you will be impressed with his performance here john voight is his usual effortlessly accomplished self and ned beatty and <UNK> cox both make significant <UNK> this is simply a great <UNK> of actors to conclude i must <UNK> as to if and when <UNK> author james <UNK> <UNK> the white <UNK> will be made for those that enjoyed this film <UNK> is a similarly harrowing tale of an american air force <UNK> struggle for survival after being shot down over the japanese <UNK> during ww2 it's more of the typically bleak <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> that is <UNK> trademark but it has all the <UNK> of a truly spectacular poetic cinematic experience there was the suggestion a few years ago that the <UNK> brothers might be producing it but that eventually came to nothing being an avid <UNK> o <UNK> it disappoints me to think what might have been had they gotten the green light on <UNK> rather than their last couple of relatively <UNK> efforts returning to <UNK> it's impossible to imagine a movie of such honest unnerving brutality being made in these times and that is pretty shameful we the cinema going public are all the <UNK> for this
<START> 1st watched 2 16 2002 4 out of 10 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mystery thriller with too many ridiculous plot twists despite the very talented cast this movie is way too predictable and just downright under <UNK> it's audience the movie going public is not stupid and i hope will not keep filling certain stars <UNK> again and again despite what they are involved with we think that this movie is going to be about something with <UNK> conviction against <UNK> punishment in the beginning but it turns out to be nothing but a standard contrived for the audience's sake run of the mill let's never get it over with thriller we are pulled into every silly switch in character as they are portrayed to us when it's needed in the story and we're ready for this thing to be over way before it ends yes there is some good acting here especially from blair <UNK> fishburne and ed harris in a psycho supporting role but the story does not work from almost the beginning to the very long <UNK> end
<START> a long time ago in a galaxy far far away there was a boy who was only two years old when the original star wars film was released he doesn't remember first seeing the movie but he also doesn't remember life before it he does remember the first star wars themed gift he got a <UNK> full of action figures from the original set he was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be but years later he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received another box full of action figures ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection it's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed <UNK> skywalker stopped being produced and carried in stores and how this boy went for about ten years until he got into college trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his <UNK> floor for a bag of beer <UNK> don't ask it's a northern <UNK> university thing br br i can't review star wars as a movie it represents absolutely everything good fun and magical about my childhood there's no <UNK> it in my mind from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and winters growing up in the winter my friends and i would build snow <UNK> and pretend we were on <UNK> i was always han solo my <UNK> dad built them a kick ass tree house and that served as the <UNK> village they also had a huge <UNK> tree whose bottom <UNK> were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it and this made a great spot to pretend we were in <UNK> home i am <UNK> <UNK> when it comes to star wars and i think people either just understand that or they don't i don't get the appeal of lord of the rings or star trek but i understand the <UNK> <UNK> of fans that follow them because i am a <UNK> fan of george <UNK> films br br i feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time every time i put them in the dvd player i feel like i'm eight years old again when life was simple and the biggest problem i had was <UNK> out how i was going to track down a figure of <UNK> skywalker br br grade for the entire trilogy a
<START> okay this film probably deserves 7 out of 10 stars but i've voted for 10 to help <UNK> the misleading rating from the handful of <UNK> who gave this film zero or 1 star reviews each of the segments for this anthology shows great potential and promise for the talented filmmakers three of whom have gone on to achieve notable success in big time hollywood productions performances range from rough all the way up to completely impressive with notable turns by bill paxton james karen vivian <UNK> and <UNK> james martin <UNK> may be a big melodramatic as the psychotic <UNK> with the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and lance august seems intentionally <UNK> as an unsuspecting lab victim but overall it's got some great laughs and some genuinely scary moments definitely worth seeing so judge for yourself
<START> hard to describe this one if you were a fan of russ meyer films back in the day you will surely be pleased to see that <UNK> is still looking really hot though <UNK> <UNK> has not <UNK> so well what is he doing still making these movies anyway if i go up to him with a camera will he be in my movie it was a pretty fun premise a superhero whose giant <UNK> are her secret weapon but sometimes it did not pan out for the whole length and the jokes were on a level with your average joe e brown comedy or <UNK> and <UNK> if that's your thing basically just bad <UNK> still i found this movie fascinating to watch and for more than 2 reasons good job but still a <UNK> flimsy production
<START> fantastic documentary of <UNK> this early 20th century <UNK> of today's iraq was powerful watch this and tell me if cecil b demille didn't take notes before making his the ten <UNK> <UNK> c cooper the photographer later created <UNK> an idea that probably <UNK> while filming the remarkable landscapes in this film fans of <UNK> <UNK> will find this film to be a treasure with heartbreaking tales of struggle <UNK> by the land around them never has the human capacity to endure been so evident the fact that this was made when it was shows not only the will of the subjects but of the filmmakers themselves
<START> i've seen the original english version on video disney's choice of voice actors looks very promising i can't believe i'm saying that the story is about a young boy who meets a girl with a history that is <UNK> with his own the two are thrown into one of the most fun and intriguing <UNK> in any animated film the animation quality is excellent if you've seen disney's job of <UNK> delivery service you can see the quality in their production it almost <UNK> them for stealing the story of <UNK> the white lion but not quite finally miyazaki's films are being released properly i can't wait to see an uncut english version of <UNK>
<START> when a man who doesn't have <UNK> can't remember how many films he's made he probably is the world's most prolific director after all that man is jesus franco the king of so called <UNK> his 1980 flick devil hunter is as rushed <UNK> stupid lazy and exploitative in the <UNK> sense of the word the film's title is misleading for starters as any other franco film i've seen that makes it sound pretty awful and it is yet franco does have some kind of <UNK> sensibility a generous way with the <UNK> outrageous with nudity and sleaze and violence and even with his stupid cheap editing which tries to <UNK> over the extreme <UNK> with which all his films were made the mix of all these elements causes you to ride his films out even while you're mostly waiting for them to end because they're so very tedious br br devil hunter is <UNK> on incomprehensible for the first half an hour the kidnap by strangers of a white woman who seems to be a model or film star is <UNK> with a bunch of native action in south america there's lots of naked <UNK> dancing and endless repeated zoom ins on an ugly <UNK> pole you need to get used to the repetitive zoom ins and the technique of cutting back to the same shot about three times in a row right away as these are <UNK> main methods of <UNK> a film out to feature length br br the monster who looks like the <UNK> pole is actually kind of scary he has raw bug eyes and his presence is always <UNK> on the soundtrack by <UNK> <UNK> apparently recorded in an echo chamber early in the piece he <UNK> on a native lady <UNK> to a tree and it's hard to know what really happens here but i think he ate her stomach or her <UNK> sweet jesus br br anyway the adventure begins properly when a <UNK> guy and his freaked out vietnam vet pal are sent to the island to recover the white girl from the <UNK> the <UNK> guy has an accent which as dubbed is half brooklyn american half english <UNK> and all retarded all of the dialogue and dubbing is ridiculous and laughable making for another <UNK> of the film which can somehow hold your interest br br not too much really happens from here on in and it happens pretty <UNK> <UNK> with the odd bit of outrage like a rape the <UNK> action is fleshed out haha by <UNK> of <UNK> degree nudity from the natives and the two female leads and even from the monster himself that he walks around with his penis exposed makes wrestling him an <UNK> <UNK> for the tough guy hero but it's gotta be done at some point and it's nice to note that the director will show anyone's <UNK> on camera br br the best feature of devil hunter is the location filming franco can be extremely cheap with the <UNK> and story aspects of film making but he doesn't <UNK> around with sets you get real islands <UNK> <UNK> and mountains all in widescreen this is something that is really cool to experience in these days of crappy cgi sets and backdrops ad <UNK> br br ultimately issues of recommendation where this film is concerned seem <UNK> if you're trying to see all the video <UNK> you will have to watch this at some point and you'll be made as restless as i was if you like franco you'll watch this anyway if you fall into neither of the above categories the odds are you'll never come across this film copies of it aren't just lying around and i could hardly recommend the seeking out of it it's franco lazy crazy franco
<START> okay first off <UNK> voice is dubbed over for like 50 of the film why because apparently there were <UNK> the script and story as they were shooting and they need to change his dialogue for story continuity as they have multiple versions from the very beginning you just scratch your head because the <UNK> are not only distracting but they make no sense br br that said the story still sucked and doesn't make any sense at all when i got the the end i was just scratching my head cause the movie was so pointless and the ending didn't even make sense br br avoid like the plague this movie made me stop watching seagal straight to video movies cause they just get worse and worse
<START> <UNK> adaptation of g b <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> screenplay by graham greene received one of the worst critical reactions in it's day it was <UNK> by the pseudo elite the <UNK> and the audiences was <UNK> to a film that lacked the <UNK> and <UNK> expected of a historical <UNK> as in <UNK> <UNK> the reaction was <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> adaptation of <UNK> intellectual exploration of the effects and actions surrounding joan of arc her actual name in her own language is <UNK> <UNK> but this film is in english is totally faithful to the spirit of the original play not only on the literal emotional level but <UNK> too his film is a <UNK> examination of the <UNK> of <UNK> the division within and without of various <UNK> all wanting to <UNK> power as such we are not allowed to identify on an emotional level with any of the characters including joan herself br br as played by jean <UNK> whose subsequent life offers a eerie parallel to her role here she is presented as an innocent a figure of <UNK> whose very actions and presence reveals the corruption and <UNK> in everyone as such <UNK> plays her as both saint and <UNK> her own lack of experience as an actress when she made this film which does show up in spots conveys the <UNK> and youth of <UNK> revealing both the fact that <UNK> la <UNK> is a humble illiterate <UNK> girl who <UNK> out to protect her village and her natural intelligence by no means did she deserve the harsh criticism that she got on the film's first release it's a performance far beyond the ken and call of any first time actress with no prior acting experience shaw and preminger took a <UNK> view towards joan seeing her as a medieval era feminist not content with being a <UNK> daughter who's fate is to be married away or a whore picked up by soldiers to and away from <UNK> her faith her voices her visions which she <UNK> with words such as imagination and common sense leads her to wear the <UNK> of her fellow soldiers to lead them to battle to chase the <UNK> <UNK> out of france br br and yet it can be said that the film is more interested in the court of the <UNK> richard widmark the office of the <UNK> who try joan led by pierre <UNK> anton <UNK> <UNK> cast and the actions of the earl of <UNK> john gielgud then in joan herself the superb ensemble cast all male portray figures of scheming <UNK> although the story <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who treat religion as a childish toy to be used and manipulated for their own ends the sharp <UNK> dialogue gives the actors great fun to let loose john gielgud as the <UNK> rational earl whose intelligence albeit accompanied by corruption allows him to <UNK> the precise manner in which he can ensure joan gets burnt at the stake and anton <UNK> pierre <UNK> brings a three dimensional portrait to this intelligent <UNK> who will give joan the fair trial that will certainly find her guilty richard widmark as the <UNK> is a real revelation as against type a casting choice you'll ever find widmark portrays the weak future <UNK> of france in a <UNK> comic caricature that's as close as this film comes to comic relief a comic performance that feels like an imitation of jerry lewis far more than an <UNK> future <UNK> of france br br preminger shot <UNK> <UNK> in black and white the cinematographer is georges <UNK> who worked with <UNK> <UNK> and who did <UNK> life and death of colonel <UNK> in colour it's perfectly restrained to emphasize the rational intellectual atmosphere for this film <UNK> <UNK> for tracking shots of long <UNK> takes is key to the <UNK> of the film there's no sense of a wasted movement anywhere in his <UNK> en scene br br it also marks the direction of <UNK> most mature and most neglected period his focus is on the conflict between individuals and the <UNK> in which they work how the institution function and how the individual acts as per his principles these themes get their most direct treatment in his film and as always he keeps things unpredictable and finds no black and white answers this is one of his very best and most effective films
<START> steven rea plays a <UNK> scientist thrust on the job in <UNK> russia in 1982 in the very first hours of his job a body of a murdered girl is brought in he has his workers go back to look for evidence and they bring back five more bodies this starts the story of the hunt for one of the worst serial killers in modern day history it is a stark depressing dark movie that explores how the <UNK> of the old soviet union <UNK> contributed or caused the deaths of many of the killers victims it also explores in donald <UNK> character how the proper usage of <UNK> in a communist <UNK> can help achieve the ultimate goal of finding a monster a gripping movie not for all but for those who like a good detective story that will hold your interest this is definitely a must see on a scale of one to ten 9
<START> if the writer director is reading this and i imagine you are since you should now be out of work then i must tell you i have seen some bad movies in my time but this one gets the distinction of having the worst premise i've ever heard br br spoilers nothing happens br br a total waste of time i laughed out loud at the end br br side note if the whole movie was her in a coma then does the scene where she sleeps with that guy mean someone raped her while she was knocked out br br utter rubbish
<START> someone had a great idea let's have misty <UNK> do her own r rated version of lara <UNK> firing two guns not only in skimpy outfits but topless as well it was indeed a great idea the problem is that the people who had it couldn't come up with any sort of script or budget to support it therefore we get a film that barely reaches medium length by <UNK> many of its parts often in slow motion and was apparently shot entirely inside a garage the appeal of misty <UNK> is still evident she is unbelievably cute and has a natural girl next door beauty however her two female co stars here with whom she shares a lengthy lesbian scene are nowhere near her league if mummy <UNK> was presented as a youtube video i'd rate it higher but as a film destined for dvd <UNK> it cannot get more than 1 2 a out of 4
<START> but this just isn't working and i am surprised to see how many people consider it good on what grounds there are some loose hints here and there but the whole material is self indulgent and unconvincing lynch's movies are generally intriguing because they generate a sense of confusion and yet are very playful when doing that there is some visual sense there are some subplots characters ideas etc but this is dull and yes pointless because whatever there is to explore is either to small either too far fetched or simply told before in a superior manner it's just lynch exploring <UNK> nothing more so it should be treated like this 1 10
<START> after reading tons of good reviews about this movie i decided to take it for a spin i bought it on dvd hence the spin pun i'm a <UNK> the beginning was everything i hoped for a perfect set up along with some quotes that i've heard on various wu <UNK> albums to what should have been a good movie but the plot i heard was so great was so predictable every time i saw a character except for the lizard i guessed which <UNK> he was plus the only cool character gets killed off in the middle of the movie ok so the plot wasn't very good but at least there was some good kung fu right wrong the fights were very short and few and far between granted the different styles were all pretty cool but i wish the fights were longer i kept hoping to see the lizard run and do some crazy ish on the walls but it never happened i was hoping to see the <UNK> do some tight <UNK> ish but it never happened i was hoping to see the <UNK> in the movie for more than 7 total minutes but it never happened in short not much happens the fighting is all pretty routine don't be fooled just <UNK> this movie has a plot it does not mean it's a good one
<START> batman and superman iconic the better part of a century old who doesn't know of these two there must be countless of fans who would die to make a film about them sandy <UNK> went ahead and put together a trailer for such a film which does not exist and is not being created much less by this team perhaps what this has most going for it is how polished it is throughout the cinematography is solid the editing is spot on the production values even with the costumes looking more like their comic counterparts than the ones of the feature films featuring these character are quite high it looks quite hollywood this trailer the physical types fit for as far as i can tell every single character the lines are reasonably written the shots are well thought up nicely achieved and fairly effective however this does have problems and in spite of looking good it doesn't quite match the energy and skill of grayson which only had the problem of <UNK> <UNK> too much back and forth between a short and a trailer as well as <UNK> passion leading to the inclusion of too many characters and ideas the acting is perhaps the most evident it's not good even some of those who only have one line and or hardly appear on screen at all manage to fail at delivering a good performance the actors cast in the parts seem to have been chosen more for how much they look like the characters they're playing than their talent then there is the writing really the plot well what <UNK> amount there is this and this character team up something about some evil plot is fine there is a problem in the characterization while most characters seem to fit two face is well about as much as a <UNK> lunatic which is quite simply as far as i've understood not what the character is as he was in batman forever and having your work on portraying any element of the batman universe compared to joel <UNK> efforts can be considered the greatest insult to a fan also putting that character in this is going to cause comparisons between this trailer and that film honestly <UNK> is practically begging for it with such a similar initial reveal to be made and let's face it this loses in every respect michael <UNK> most definitely does not possess the screen presence that tommy lee jones does and the make up which in aforementioned reveal is essential isn't as strong as that of the film whether or not it was good in the film is another matter the sad thing is that while <UNK> john who created grayson seems to be far more into the comics and get them the depth of them better not to mention <UNK> more of an ability to come up with compelling plot grayson had enough material for half a dozen feature films or more <UNK> seems to be the one with access to <UNK> and the one who's more likely to have contacts on account of having non indie credits on his filmography to actually have a shot at making an actual feature out of his trailer i intend to watch other of <UNK> work but <UNK> is the one of the two whose work i will most definitely be most interested in i recommend this to fans of the characters 7 10
<START> i saw this gem of a film at cannes where it was part of the directors <UNK> br br welcome to <UNK> is nothing short of superb great fun throughout with all members of a strong cast acting their <UNK> off it's a sometimes laugh out loud comedy about a petty crook <UNK> played by luis <UNK> who gets caught trying to steal a car and sent to prison while in prison he meets a <UNK> who tells him of the ultimate <UNK>  which to you and me  is a sure fire get rich quick scheme it turns out that there is a way through from a deserted building into the towns <UNK> shop  which could net millions sounds simple  well throw in all kinds of wacky characters and incidents along the way and you have got the ingredients for a one wild ride  word passes from one low life loser to the next and soon a team of them are assembled to try and cash in on <UNK> <UNK> lead by failed boxer <UNK> superbly played by sam <UNK>  surely a star in the making and reluctant crook <UNK> william h macy who is forced to bring his baby along with him as his wife was locked up for fraud br br based on the italian film i <UNK> <UNK> big deal on madonna street which also inspired a similar film to <UNK>  <UNK> this knocks spots of the latter effort and although its written and directed by the russo brothers it definitely has shades of the <UNK> brothers about it produced by steven soderbergh and george clooney who has a small yet hilarious part as a crippled safe <UNK>
<START> this film is about a group of five friends who rent a cabin in the woods one of the friends catches a horrifying flesh eating virus suddenly the friends turn on one another in a desperate attempt to keep from <UNK> the disease themselves br br cabin fever is a horrible film for one it tries to be many genres at once is it supposed to be a homage a slasher a black comedy or a scary movie with unintentional comedy nobody can tell there's a serious scene at first and a second alter it turns funny when the film tries to be funny the humor is quite bland <UNK> the ending i liked the ending a lot br br but apart from the ending i was pretty disappointed and disgusted the violence is cringe worthy more looking away from the screen than being scared the tone changes within each scene sometimes funny sometimes scary and sometimes quite random in fact you see a girl doing karate in <UNK> motion what are we supposed to get from that this same girl would bite one of the characters was that supposed to be funny i don't know br br some of the performances were decent and many were quite amateurish i didn't care for most of the characters i liked the plot but the execution was done horribly as a horror film i didn't know what it was trying to be i didn't find it funny tense nor scary by the end you're left indifferent thinking what have i just been through unfortunately you'll never know the answer to that question
<START> i'd never heard of this then found out it's the man with the deadly lens which i'd heard of but not seen <UNK> presence drove me to buy it and it's not good it wants to be a sort of cross between dr <UNK> and mash but it just isn't that funny unless you find the name general <UNK> funny it comes across as a flat 70s thriller until the last ten minutes when it springs to life there are many many flat scenes in the <UNK> between the president and his <UNK> which don't work it's almost as if the initial cut was too long and the first half was edited down to get to the whole nuclear bomb <UNK> storyline and the suicide <UNK> attacks which i think are meant to be played for laughs but again aren't that funny the location filming is excellent but the studio stuff looks like cheap tv i could not believe the man responsible for key <UNK> <UNK> and elmer <UNK> did this only laugh connery throws away his wig before putting on his helmet and jumping out of a plane it makes never say never again look like genius
<START> i thought that the sentinel was going to be a mediocre movie when i finally saw it i took a good surprise the movie isn't great thing but it's very fun and the action scenes are very well done this movie reminded me tv series like 24 or <UNK> it's very similar to that series and it reminded me too to the <UNK> <UNK> thriller in the line of fire if you're going to expect one of the most original and and one of the greatest thrillers in the history of movies you will be disappointed but if you go with little expectations you will enjoy the sentinel br br rating 7
<START> what a sad sight these tv <UNK> make running out the clock on their careers stumbling about a little <UNK> hulk of a ship boat might be more appropriate the whole production feels cheap and <UNK> and it's not helped by a big name star who is barely capable of spitting out the few lines that he's given in a credible fashion br br at no time do the supporting cast rise above the material they're clearly watching the clock here bang out the scenes get the pay <UNK> go home and try to forget all about it br br it's not particularly badly scripted or filmed there are no real <UNK> it's just utterly <UNK> and shot in a very limited number of <UNK> sets with a small cast of extras the pacing is a little bizarre an embarrassingly <UNK> romantic sub plot is only begun after the main action starts which makes it feel irrelevant br br maiden voyage scores a couple of points for being competently scored and for being a fun game of spot the <UNK> bit <UNK> most of the cast are <UNK> of <UNK> street or <UNK> warrior princess the saddest thing about this production is that this film probably <UNK> their big break
<START> although i had no <UNK> idea on what to expect from this movie this sure as hell wasn't what i would have had in mind had anything actually come to mind once i heard of its existence all i knew was that i had to own a movie called please don't eat the babies unfortunately i could only find a copy under its alternate title island fury looking back i guess i could call it a lose lose situation on one hand i still don't get to be known as the guy who owns a movie called please don't eat the babies and on the other hand island fury would ultimately reveal itself to be an awful pointless boring unwatchable piece of garbage yeah definitely lose lose br br i'm not even sure what genre they're going for here just early 80's badness with a flashback that might actually be longer than the non flashback first up two teenage girls are being chased by two bad guys once caught the bad guys bring to our attention that one of the girls have a <UNK> on a string around her neck and somehow these bad guys know of a lot more of these <UNK> hidden on an island somewhere and this is where things start to get weird somehow these guys know of a trip the girls took to some island years earlier when they were only 10 i guess this is supposed to mean that the girls should know exactly where this alleged treasure is so now we're in the past while the girls try to <UNK> their steps so these bad guys don't kill them although i wouldn't have minded if they had in the flashback the 10 year old counterparts are on a boat trip with their sisters and the sisters boyfriends eventually stopping by an island for some air they get mixed up with some kid and his killer grandparents any potential suspense or reasons to keep on watching never shows up but the flashback was undeniably better than the present which still isn't saying much br br for a while there i had forgotten about the original story at one point i <UNK> maybe the director had too and when the flashback ended that would be the end which would have worked for me considering this disappointment would have been a half hour shorter this pointless movie within a pointless movie does eventually end and real stuff does happen but it's stupid i guess i didn't exactly expect a movie filled with <UNK> being <UNK> or anything like that but i did expect some form of outlandish b entertainment mostly just a confusing inept storyline unsure of its genre my advice would be to seek out something worthwhile like attack of the beast creatures if anyone i would only recommend this one to serious b movie <UNK> who must have them all anyone else interested probably has brain damage what really gets me is that i still have no idea why they called it please don't eat the babies 3 10
<START> somewhere i'd read that this film is supposed to be a comedy after seeing it i'd call it anything but the point of this movie <UNK> me the dialogue is all extremely superficial and absurd many of the sets seemed to be <UNK> and despite all the nudity and implied sexual content there's nothing erotic about this film all leaving me to wonder just what the heck this thing is about the title premise could have been the basis for a fun if politically incorrect comedy instead we're treated to cheap amateurish unfinished sketches and <UNK> and weirdness for its own sake if i want that i'll go buy a grace jones cd
<START> just finished watching american pie <UNK> house and i gotta say this was such a garbage pile of crap the first 3 american <UNK> were hilarious the last 3 were a joke and should not have been called american pie br br as you figured out from the title of the movie <UNK> house is about a <UNK> <UNK> girls and the most original part of them all falling in love of course the guy that has his way with the chicks is <UNK> who along with his mates tries to complete another apparently impossible task it was unrealistic and super fake its just really predictable and the plot is so weak both sides of the college battle to see who gets the whole thing something like that to sum it up awful acting dull script wrong use of the american pie franchise total waste of time this movie is unbearable i give it a two out of ten although most of it sucked there were lots of nudity and pretty girls like 2 funny scenes
<START> i wrote a review of this movie further down after buying it on dvd and being sorely <UNK> br br i tried watching it again after reading a few of the comments made since then being a film student and making similar budgeted movies myself ie no budget shot on <UNK> <UNK> i stand by my original comments this is a no budget student project and not a particularly good one released on video dvd to look like an award winning film if you read the cover so <UNK> the public into thinking it's something it's not i want my money back under the <UNK> description act complete rubbish
<START> this episode introduced the <UNK> to the <UNK> world the <UNK> have to be <UNK> and a precise <UNK> must be delivered or it would greatly insult them a tired <UNK> decides to take a trip into the <UNK> and a wonderful adventure begins the settings are superb and almost movie like alas the <UNK> <UNK> sent shortly thereafter <UNK> the <UNK> and all it's safety devices stop working <UNK> and now guests must <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> 40s america and return to the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> correctly and a new day <UNK> between humanity and the <UNK> this gem of a first season episode set the <UNK> for many interesting and unusual adventures to be had there
<START> inspector dirty harry callahan once again <UNK> his superiors with his maverick approach to police work <UNK> to take a vacation he is given a simple case which takes him outside of san francisco however he soon discovers a link between a recent murder in the city and a murder outside of the city which leads him to the trail of a revenge killer br br as an entry in the dirty harry franchise the film starts with some very promising moments including the legendary go ahead make my day line that eastwood delivers wonderfully through <UNK> teeth before single <UNK> <UNK> a robbery very <UNK> and it just what fans can expect from him however the film soon shifts <UNK> and focuses on the mysterious revenge killer the problem is that this killer isn't all that mysterious as she is <UNK> as much as harry is this really <UNK> from the presence of the main character who ruled all of his previous film appearances with <UNK> the pun <UNK> force br br on the bright side this new storyline does draw several parallels to harry's own <UNK> methods and gives his character dramatic depth that was not there before but fans that were looking for another <UNK> harry outing will more than likely be somewhat disappointed however a tense climax ends the film on an exciting note so if you don't mind something a little different it is a good movie for fans 7 10 br br rated r for violence and a rape scene
<START> neatly skipping over everything from the coup in cuba to his undercover entry into bolivia part two of <UNK> portrayal of che guevara is that of the tragic hero as with che  part one this rather rambling <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> through the colourful mountains of bolivia is probably destined to disappoint more people than it will satisfy so why was the film and particularly <UNK> del <UNK> performance so <UNK> praised at cannes br br james <UNK> for instance called it a work of art that's not just the story of a revolutionary but a revolution in and of itself the <UNK> peter <UNK> called it a flawed masterpiece i return to my original <UNK> for part one  that the value lies particularly in depiction of a hero figure and in an age when there is a <UNK> of poor hero role models could it not be <UNK> to see a strongly <UNK> one even if stripped of some of the less endearing episodes of his life this is the psychological hero <UNK> by the great scottish <UNK> thomas <UNK> in his <UNK> book heroes and hero worship heroes can be real or imaginary or somewhere in between but should genuinely inspire us to higher goals a higher purpose compare this with the unrealistic <UNK> of standard western storytelling where a person <UNK> trials and <UNK> before <UNK> a barely believable reward  usually <UNK> love or material wealth  as if by divine studio <UNK> real heroes have an excess of moral courage  not lost <UNK> dare <UNK> or james bond super toys they rise and <UNK> others to rise to be the best that they can be in part one che succeeds in part two he fails it is not for want of moral courage but since a not all good plans can succeed and b being human mistakes are inevitable br br <UNK> intellectual clarity is flawed when he <UNK> conditions that justify armed struggle with conditions that make that armed struggle able to succeed it is a serious <UNK> br br high in the mountains from la paz the colours are breathtaking there is an air of <UNK> en scene authenticity that was occasionally lacking in che part one the u s would not allow soderbergh to film in cuba visual treats are <UNK> by <UNK> natural light and the extreme <UNK> and realism offered with groundbreaking red cameras this is a high performance digital <UNK> camera with the quality of <UNK> film and the <UNK> of pure digital designed for <UNK> and <UNK> the package <UNK> a mere 9 <UNK> shooting with red is like hearing the beatles for the first time says soderbergh red sees the way i see so <UNK> so beautifully <UNK> to that most natural of <UNK>  light if che had stopped with the successful cuban revolution it would have <UNK> him with an almost mystical <UNK> that he fails in bolivia shows not only that he has human limitations but that it is his moral virtues that are remembered not the political triumph critics will say  and with some justification that his armed struggle inspired much less noble characters to achieve tin pot <UNK> his development of <UNK> fighting tactics are not good or bad in themselves and have since been used for both br br but for all its <UNK> the film often seems to lack dramatic and narrative tension we stumble from one <UNK> to another knowing that he will eventually meet his death i found myself <UNK> at my watch and thinking it could have been shorter but the work that has gone into this  interviews with people from all sides and even getting one of <UNK> ex <UNK> to coach actors on the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK>  make the film a commendable achievement it might not be top flight entertainment but it demonstrates integrity in <UNK> a significant slice of history br br there is also another very important point in the che <UNK> figure here it's about failure that if you try your <UNK> even if you fail your effort will not have been in vain because it may give others hope and moral courage one could <UNK> call it a <UNK> complex and it is found of course in many religious figures as well but che does not <UNK> himself he does what he does best to the best of his not <UNK> ability and so provides an example success or failure in any particular instance become mere details br br with the u s 's <UNK> and illegal <UNK> of cuba all in the name of <UNK> i am tempted to write that che parts 1 2 are too good to be wasted on the u s but that would be to invite a <UNK> that the film has sought so <UNK> to avoid one must hope that many viewers will have the skill to view che without politics and the bias that inevitably <UNK> whatever its faults it <UNK> soderbergh from the <UNK> nonsense of <UNK> 11 br br but if you haven't heard of che guevara or seen part one or if you can't get past the phrase <UNK> <UNK> without <UNK> at the mouth i might struggle to imagine what you would get from this film the same can be said for many who have and can
<START> personally this is one of my favorites of all time no i'm not 10 i'm 30 i own an old original vhs of this that i bought from a rental store i've watched it countless times br br while it's an amusing movie for kids it's an intriguing movie for adults i once saw this movie <UNK> i was not sober my eyes were opened to things i had never noticed before i saw morals being strongly encouraged both overtly and somewhat <UNK> i wish i could remember all the things i noticed in particular but it's been a very long time since then rest assured there are tons of things that are <UNK> to throughout the movie if you get the chance to view it not sober do so you won't be disappointed as a matter of fact you will probably feel rather happy and warm br br unique and wonderful
<START> <UNK> comes from conservative indian family that isn't exactly into girls playing <UNK> soccer but our attractive young star can play some serious soccer rhys meyers <UNK> <UNK> and encourages her to perform while knightley is supportive <UNK> and friend when <UNK> wedding is <UNK> for the same day as the ultimate soccer match what's a girl to do similar in its own unique way to <UNK> as <UNK> tries to push the <UNK> on traditional family ways here it's dad well played by <UNK> who can see both sides of the issue <UNK> an entire point for a hokey late sexual <UNK> non crisis if they needed filler they could have gone elsewhere nice final wrap up to the whole deal
<START> disney's done it again the company that made mr <UNK> and george of the jungle has made another movie that barely resembles the cartoon on which it is based and keeps none of the spirit of the original br br inspector gadget was one of my favorite cartoons when i was a young one and for a movie of it to exist may have been a dream come true back then now that that movie does exist i was severely disappointed even <UNK> br br first we have the characters br br gadget himself has the <UNK> that made him such a fun character in the original cartoon with well done special effects accompanying them and he even has some of the <UNK> of the original gadget but he is now more competent and is expected to solve the crime himself while penny and brain just watch br br penny has little to do while she played a major role in the cartoon discovering the crime and <UNK> it and occasionally getting captured by the mad agents now she is simply introduced and then forgotten although she does at least sneak into <UNK> base br br claw is the movie's version of dr claw who was a rather sinister <UNK> voiced man who wore <UNK> <UNK> and sat in his chair his face hidden from view as he <UNK> his cat and <UNK> various crimes now he is simply a man with a claw for a hand with no mystery behind the character br br brain and mad cat exist in the movie but are rather insignificant to it br br even small parts of the cartoon aren't <UNK> in this <UNK> the famous expression <UNK> was mysteriously changed to <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> now looks different and talks br br there is even product <UNK> everywhere why is <UNK> advertised on a sign why does the <UNK> have buttons for m <UNK> or <UNK> br br fans of the cartoon will hate it others might will likely find the movie below par and when all is said and done this movie is another attempt to make some quick bucks off another old show
<START> this is a great film br br i agreed to watch a chick flick and some how ended up with this i had never heard of it or anyone in it <UNK> mike from friends br br but it is great eva lake and paul give amazing performances the humour is consistently dry and witty br br paul rudd pretty much plays the mike character from friends which works great the other characters are stereotypes and the plot is formulaic i mean we are not talking <UNK> <UNK> here but the characters are likable the story is engaging the soundtrack production and direction all work well br br in all a great feel good film that really deserves a lot more credit than it gets br br everyone has their own tastes but i really don't understand the one star reviews for this
<START> maria <UNK> doesn't seem to care what people think of her choices in movie roles again she chooses a very difficult and not popular movie to star in maybe she needs those movies to get off the sugar <UNK> aka hollywood ones she does here and then <UNK> ugly and of course mummy 3 br br while i think fails to achieve what it sets out to do i won't spoil that maria <UNK> is as great as in her other independent small movies she stars in it's her performance that <UNK> this movie this combined with the strange subject matter almost did the trick for me but in the end and even if i try to overlook some flaws like bad pacing and <UNK> the movie is still too long
<START> so what's the reason is there some sort of <UNK> against this awesome show or somebody involved <UNK> why would the best show i've seen in years be canceled i'm addicted i saw this show on randomly last fall and immediately loved it and watched it every week then it went away and i tried to <UNK> it but it wasn't being aired so i forgot about it for awhile until i found the episodes on <UNK> website now i want more i agree with everybody else with the rest of the junk on tv today it was refreshing to see something as well rounded and developed as this i watch boston legal for my eccentric comedic fix and house for my intellectual mystery jackass fix my wife loves <UNK> <UNK> for its realism and i do love hate the show but it could not be <UNK> from real for me way too much drama everything that can go wrong does but for once there's a drama that's really real real people real problems sure there are some extremes like a former gangster turned good girl running from the mob etc but these people especially in nyc are really out there and i relate to each and every one of them i can't seem to get enough i just hope that abc will get their heads out of their bean counting <UNK> and continue this show get some respect for having a quality drama out there this could be one of the best shows of all time if somebody will just let it
<START> if an auteur gives himself 2 credits before the main title and about 15 more credits before the movie starts and the first shot shows the auteur rolling around on a bed in <UNK> bike shorts it won't be a surprise to observe that said auteur has the kind of body that should never be seen in <UNK> the kind of look that might be useful to a homosexual <UNK> <UNK> br br others have given this thing the <UNK> it deserves for me the most <UNK> moment came when the trip from la was <UNK> by a plane landing at what appeared to be <UNK> and the return was <UNK> by a shot of a <UNK> <UNK> plane
<START> disappointing musical version of margaret <UNK> anna and the king of <UNK> itself filmed in 1946 with irene dunne and rex harrison has deborah kerr cast as a widowed <UNK> and mother who travels from england to <UNK> in <UNK> to accept job as <UNK> to the king's many children and perhaps teach the royal one a thing or two in the process <UNK> picture begins well but quickly loses energy and focus <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his stage triumph as the king is a commanding presence but is used per the <UNK> story as a <UNK> kerr keeps her cool dignity and <UNK> better despite having to lip <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> perhaps having already played this part to death <UNK> looks like he had nothing <UNK> for the screen translation except <UNK> second half with anna and the <UNK> staging a musical version of uncle <UNK> cabin is quite ridiculous and the <UNK> and <UNK> songs are mostly <UNK> <UNK> won a best actor oscar but it is <UNK> kerr who keeps this <UNK> above water overlong heavy and <UNK> <UNK> in the worst sense of the term from

<START> yesterday i watched this movie for the third time it was recommended to me by a fried several weeks ago i never watched or even noticed it before because it falls so typically in the category swedish movie and those who rose up like me with hollywood productions tend to be <UNK> of any foreign movies hell what a <UNK> shift the film touches me because it just keeps up my hope that mankind can change to a better way the swedish village is just a pattern for all areas on earth where people live together controlled by religion <UNK> lack of courage <UNK> disguised brutality but also the ability to have fun to meet to sing it takes a trigger from outside to rip off the masks of everyone who keeps one and to let them feel that we all are just human beings with the desire to live our own lives i can never stop to see stories like this because that keeps up my hope as described above the five minutes containing the story of <UNK> song including her performance is one of my movie highlights ever thank you kay <UNK> just for these 5 minutes which made me happy
<START> quite one of the worst films i have ever seen terrible acting laughable <UNK> it's clear that the cars are travelling slowly atrocious script <UNK> unsatisfying ending and incompetent direction make a <UNK> of a movie we know judge <UNK> is a fine actor but he should be ashamed of this <UNK> there is no great tension within the car and when the characters stumble upon moments of hope they laugh like inane <UNK> for some reason even <UNK> five <UNK> when they see the bridge <UNK> br br also the chain of events that lead these people to share the same car <UNK> credibility apparently based on true events though if that's the case truth is evidently stranger than fiction unfortunate then that it was portrayed in such an inept manner
<START> a sweet and totally charming film shall we <UNK> made me laugh and cry at first appearance <UNK> san was not terribly appealing an uptight <UNK> seemingly devoted to his family but all too easily captivated by a face in a window the object of his obsession is distant and cold but by the end of the movie i was in love with him her his wife and daughter all the dance <UNK> and dance students this <UNK> story of transformation and <UNK> is a little jewel that i would enjoy seeing again
<START> i want to start by stating i am a <UNK> even though i don't agree with a lot of the things bush has done in office and i love the daily show and <UNK> report they have to be two of my favorite shows on tv i enjoy the bush jokes on conan <UNK> leno because i admit that w is not the <UNK> guy to ever walk the earth i do believe he's not the dumbest either but it comes to a point when enough is enough and it's not really that funny anymore i see where it can be funny and it is hey he's making fun of our authority figure he's hilarious comedy central though is just trying to hard to poke fun at him i mean maybe one special episode but an entire series is just dumb it seems <UNK> is just saying the same bush jokes that we've heard way to many times i really cannot see this show going past 1 season

<START> at least during its first half if it had started out with the three buddies in the navy and concentrated on the naval action scenes it would have been a much better and <UNK> film the second half of the film is worth it especially for the action sequences and close up shots of early 20th century ships but it's like a dull <UNK> getting there also don't watch this film just because ginger rogers is in it she has an important role but it's a small one br br the film starts out showing three new york city buddies working the tourist trade and also in good natured competition for the hand of sally ginger rogers a singing candy <UNK> along the <UNK> world war i breaks out the three buddies seem completely indifferent to the struggle yet <UNK> in the navy anyways the one of the three with the least industry as a <UNK> bill <UNK> as <UNK> winds up the commanding officer to the other two robert armstrong as dutch and james <UNK> as <UNK> to make matters more complex sally has fallen in love with one of the three but doesn't have the chance to tell him before the three <UNK> off to war br br the film is a little more interesting on board ship mainly because of the close shots we have of the ship itself and also because the chemistry among the three buddies is believable however james <UNK> at age <UNK> looks a bit long in the tooth to be a <UNK> especially when the sign at the <UNK> office said you had to be between 17 and 35 to be <UNK> br br one real obvious flaw in the film that made me believe that everything outside the naval scenes was slapped together with minimum care is the costume design or i should say the lack of it in the scenes in new york just prior to wwi we have everyone dressed in the fashions of 1931 and everyone driving the cars of 1931 no effort was taken to bring this film into period br br in conclusion if you watch the few scenes with ginger rogers in them and the last 45 minutes involving the naval suicide mission you've seen everything here worth seeing the rest is padding
<START> the man in the attic is a movie set in the <UNK> it is inspired by a true story unfortunately it's a story that really didn't need to be told br br looking at the box the people responsible for <UNK> the movie tried their best to make this film appear steamy and erotic they use terms such as <UNK> passion forbidden affair and <UNK> pleasures they even show a picture of neil patrick harris little <UNK> <UNK> m d holding a gun br br the story involves <UNK> played by anne archer she is <UNK> married to a gentleman who owns his own business edward harris is an employee of her husband's company <UNK> and edward end up falling in love with each other br br the supposedly shocking part of the movie is this <UNK> husband finds out about the affair and <UNK> them from ever seeing each other again so what do they decide to do <UNK> ends up having edward live up in their attic wow <UNK> ends up seeing someone else and edward gets extremely jealous so on and so on and so on br br the man in the attic doesn't cover any new territory it's a showtime original picture which explains why the stars are a couple of b list actors and both appear briefly in the buff br br
<START> before this little black and <UNK> the <UNK> topic of criminal rape never made it onto the american screen there were lots of these topics that hollywood and the production code kept hidden until the rebellious 1960's so it's not surprising that it would take a little independent company like <UNK> <UNK> filmmakers to raise the subject the result is well meaning but somewhat <UNK> which is not surprising since director <UNK> had to work with code demands to get the movie released br br interestingly ann <UNK> <UNK> powers main problem following the assault is not how others might see her but how she sees herself and it's a heavy load she's carrying will she ever be able to relate to men again will they look at her as spoiled goods after all this is 1950 small wonder she runs away rather than face these <UNK> at home and at work even though family and friends are generally supportive overall this first part is earnest and well done the chase is hyped to <UNK> some action into the plot but then this is a movie notice how the <UNK> neighbor fails to respond to the <UNK> horn near <UNK> end had those been screams of alarm from powers instead the <UNK> lack of response would have raised an interesting albeit <UNK> issue br br the second half is pretty much given over to the production code in the <UNK> person of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> andrews it's he to quote a phrase who gives her courage to face life again there's some effort at <UNK> him is it ann or her dilemma that he's most interested in still his gentle and understanding presence comes across as a little too <UNK> and a little too hollywood fortunately the ending avoids the usual hollywood cop out by <UNK> only the hope of a happy resolution for ann rather than its <UNK> br br give <UNK> a ton of credit for dealing with the topic in the first place given the overall results i expect she dealt as honestly with the topic as she was allowed to i also expect today's audiences find the treatment mildly interesting mainly because of <UNK> excellent performance that brings out the purely human drama however the film works best now as a document of its time and what the cultural <UNK> of that day thought was appropriate for adult viewing
<START> i thought it was an original story very nicely told i think all you people are expecting too much i mean it's just a made for television movie what are you expecting some great wonderful <UNK> piece i thought it was a really great story for a made for television movie and that's my opinion
<START> gentleman jim not really a boxing film it is a vehicle for errol flynn as jim corbett but having said that the boxing scenes are a real eye opener to the modern viewer there are no 12 round points decisions here br br errol flynn plays the irish bank clerk who gets a shot at the <UNK> world title flynn is well suited to the role of suave but unpredictable corbett his <UNK> john sullivan is still better however a <UNK> of the old school played by ward bond br br the theme of the film is a man pushing for his big chance corbett leaves his mundane life behind and builds a new persona as gentleman jim jim is a <UNK> who can adapt to any social environment he is a liar and an <UNK> sullivan the <UNK> boxing champion is portrayed as a simple <UNK> but his honesty and <UNK> gives a certain contrast to the main character br br there is action and excitement <UNK> and a wonderful ending with the requisite redemption for all and errol flynn gets the girl
<START> once when i was in college and we had an international fair the russian section had a soviet era poster saying <UNK> <UNK> meaning don't <UNK> i translated it for the generation of tv <UNK> as don't be <UNK> <UNK> in reference to the <UNK> neighbor on <UNK> br br however when you see the result of <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> short rumors you see that it's not quite a laughing matter in this case the <UNK> witless soldier <UNK> something about bombing and immediately assumes that the <UNK> powers have attacked the united states so he tells it to someone who tells someone else who tells someone else and it continues as in the russians are coming the russians are coming the story gets blown more and more out of <UNK> each time so that when it gets back to <UNK> well you know what i mean yes it's mostly wwii propaganda complete with a <UNK> term for the japanese but i have to say that the <UNK> <UNK> shorts were actually quite funny of course since they had dr seuss writing and mel <UNK> providing the voices it's no surprise that these came out rather cool worth seeing
<START> before <UNK> there was similarity between tim burton and kusturica artistic vision they find their own poetic style and then they cowardly become prisoners of it burton has and still have <UNK> kusturica has <UNK> <UNK> and somehow they got critical praise for repeating same formula over and over again however there are persons like me who find joke funny only when they heard it first time that's main reason why <UNK> worst movies are <UNK> cat white <UNK> and <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> is something completely different you may like it you may hate it but this is not just another kusturica poetic  <UNK> <UNK> stuff of course if you want to be praised you have to play safe it was very easy for kusturica to make just another flying <UNK> movie and get award fortunately as a brave person he chooses to make movie that will be ironic look to his previous works <UNK> can be described as a strong and very harsh parody on previous kusturica movies directed by kusturica himself it is beautiful to see one big movie director to not take himself too seriously this is quality that kusturica have and even the biggest like bergman or kubrick didn't have this movie is so meaningless that becomes absurd so absurd that becomes deep and so unfunny that becomes hilarious same stuff that make <UNK> 9 from outer <UNK> cult would made this masterpiece to people who knows how to watch it average western viewer would not get few references most notable tire shop owner is <UNK> and this refers to <UNK> <UNK> famous serbian dramatic writer politically she is very active as left oriented liberal and she <UNK> <UNK> political views and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but not <UNK> take to her work was to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> shop second reference is made to <UNK> <UNK>  previous <UNK> composer he formed <UNK> and wedding <UNK> and start performing around europe although he is praised as big composer <UNK> is just performer and most of his songs if not all are poor covers of traditional serbian songs <UNK> take on <UNK> was to confront one wedding and one funeral with funeral mocking the wedding also music is covering western classics as <UNK> bridge is falling <UNK> or french <UNK> you find this unfunny now you see how we feel in <UNK> when listening <UNK> horrible covers i really liked this movie because it is not pretending to be deep it is so <UNK> with symbols that it becomes parody and it is beautifully directed as all of his works are if you like previous <UNK> movies there is a big chance that you will hate this if you don't like couple of his last movies you may find this as pleasant surprise because this is like fellini directing <UNK> <UNK> on purpose i have massive respect for this guy after <UNK> next tim burton movie would surely have main character with pale faces next kusturica movies can easily be about aliens <UNK> earth that's the reason why he is most interesting director on earth whether you like it or not
<START> joe don baker is thomas <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> murderous <UNK> in a stupid cowboy suit that roy rogers would have laughed at somehow he still has a <UNK> probably because he lives in texas and they'll let anything be law <UNK> there br br this <UNK> loser is a deputy sheriff near the texas border not surprisingly he was once a texas ranger but got kicked out because he seemed to think that the law was his own personal <UNK> ball to be played with at his <UNK> this includes shooting suspects who are over the international border into mexico beating up on suspects cheating in gun fights threatening women starting <UNK> that could have been avoided and managing to get the life of a child threatened in the process letting women he promised he would help and protect get killed just so that he could get out of jail etc etc this guy makes l a cops look like saints in comparison br br when his partner is killed by a pair of wandering italian <UNK> joe <UNK> character <UNK> them down and kills one of them then he takes the other to italy at the <UNK> of a mr wilson who rightly thinks that joe don will screw up big time in record time he loses the italian and gets a <UNK> <UNK> blown up in the process this is just the first of the many deaths and major destruction that joe don leaves in a trail behind him as he <UNK> across <UNK> looking for <UNK> the italian assassin br br thus begins the <UNK> strip part of the movie in which our hero gets arrested <UNK> by the <UNK> chief of police goes out and causes more trouble gets arrested gets <UNK> by the chief of police and so on and so on until you want to blow your brains out with joe <UNK> <UNK> handled pistol and be done with the horror br br joe don proves his <UNK> not just in the first time <UNK> escapes but in the subsequent boat chase in which he goes down in just one punch then he gets taken by <UNK> after he threatens a woman with a coat <UNK> you hope that <UNK> will actually get to torture him in the basement cell he's put in but no the stripper he threatened came and got him out because he promised to protect her her throat promptly gets cut big surprise and joe don escapes into the night br br and here you hope he might have been drowned in the yet another boat chase but even the ocean doesn't want him and <UNK> him up on a shore where he's <UNK> by a poor <UNK> family what did they ever do to deserve that he returns to the city where he's arrested by the police <UNK> by the police chief <UNK> the female police officer who's been <UNK> him around <UNK> him so that they can go get <UNK> why she would do anything so brain dead as to destroy her career for this great <UNK> is beyond me it's just head <UNK> puzzling br br they go out to the villa where <UNK> is hiding and start a shoot out joe don <UNK> <UNK> and kills <UNK> he then <UNK> the great and dazzling last line of the movie the big one has my <UNK> can you go get it for me thank you for that immortal line mr baker that will go down in the <UNK> of movie history as the most <UNK> amazing wondrous last line ever <UNK> by a character in a film it certainly falls into line with everything else about the character bravo
<START> as someone who's never been into sports it seems like it would be hard for me to get into the football or as we americans inexplicably call it soccer themed bend it like beckham but i gotta say this was one cool movie <UNK> indian <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and her <UNK> friend juliette paxton <UNK> knightley love to play football yes i'm going to say it the british and international way and just adore football player david beckham but <UNK> traditional <UNK> parents don't <UNK> her mother offers a really whacked out description of football early in the movie okay so maybe it was sort of a cliché in that sense but you gotta love this movie and if like me you go to this movie not knowing the definition of bend in football don't worry the movie explains it i'd also never heard of david beckham prior to this movie and we all know that <UNK> knightley hit it big a few months after <UNK> came out in the states she starred in the equally cool pirates of the <UNK> the curse of the black pearl
<START> eddie murphy delirious is by far the funniest thing you will ever see in your life you can compare it to any movie and i <UNK> you will decide that delirious is the funniest movie ever this movie is about <UNK> 45 mins and throughout that time there was barely a moment where i wasn't laughing you will laugh for hours after it is over <UNK> the punch lines over and over and over in your head eddie murphy has given so many funny performances over his career 48 <UNK> <UNK> places beverly hills cop raw coming to america the nutty professor shrek etc but this is by far his most hilarious moment i have seen this movie so many times and it is funnier every time it never loses its edge from this day forward every great stand up performance will be <UNK> from delirious and two thumbs up
<START> being a fan of cheesy horror movies i saw this in my video shop and thought i would give it a try now that i've seen it i wish it upon no living soul on the planet i get my movie <UNK> for free and i feel that i didn't get my <UNK> worth i've seen some bad cheesy horror movies in my time hell i'm a fan of them but this was just an insult
<START> at first glance this gives the impression that it is going to be a laughable <UNK> flick and it does contain moments where it <UNK> in that direction however the basic story idea is much stronger than might be expected and is a respectable effort at portraying racial issues in the world war ii era army the recognizable cast is hit and miss with <UNK> <UNK> richard <UNK> and the underused billy dee williams <UNK> best stephen <UNK> however stops just short of <UNK> his <UNK> mustache in an <UNK> star turn br br the obviously low budget leads to <UNK> in the production values the locations are great the effects and action are weak imagine if saving private ryan had consisted of half the platoon getting killed exactly the same way <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> had except we do get to see the shot because they effects can't handle it then hanks damon and burns drove around in a <UNK> and shot five germans for the climax yet the denouement with the heroic soldiers receiving no respect for their accomplishment because they are black and <UNK> racist captain being <UNK> by this is compelling as are the sequences of of <UNK> character writing in a <UNK> of his imagined exploits if the soldiers were allowed to fight instead of digging <UNK> br br in short black <UNK> <UNK> army doesn't quite succeed but it's a respectable failure not a bad joke it could be remade as a very good film and as it stands is an interesting effort
<START> i have seen this film many times and i like all bad teachers want to give it ten out of ten but feel that it would be unfair to other good films however i do think that this is one of those rare gems a perfect comedy it is i would venture one of the greatest comic films of all times matthau and lemmon are perfectly matched and <UNK> the script is so sharp that you need to <UNK> the bleeding the story is well known and has already been described in other comments the two leads give extraordinary performances the girls are superb and the situations are side <UNK> funny not one swear word in sight mark that hollywood you don't have to swear to be funny you have to be witty and the move from stage to film is <UNK> they don't <UNK> like this any more timeless
<START> this has to be one of the most sincere and touching boy meets girl movies ever made while rebel without a cause and say anything deliver nice portrayals this movies <UNK> down useless subplots and hollywood <UNK> this movie focuses purely on watching the budding of a beautiful romance you never doubt for a second that the film will lead towards the romantic pairing of these two people you almost immediately sense the <UNK> and the chemistry between jesse and celine and it is simply pure joy to watch them find it this movie is mostly all dialogue based but every conversation between these too is greatly intriguing what makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is how in all that conversation while often having no real bearing on anything critical you can sense the nuances as these two become more fond and <UNK> of each other this is exactly they way you would dream that you meet that special someone and what makes it so true is that it is not even too fantastic to believe this could be what would happen if you had been confident enough to strike up a conversation with that person you noticed somewhere random and what puts the <UNK> on this film is the magnificent backdrop of vienna in which this film takes place it just adds to the feeling of romantic <UNK> that the film suggests and no matter how many times i watch this film i don't think i will ever tire of that
<START> on the 1998 summer blockbuster hit baseketball 1998 this is one of those movies that is usually seen on the big <UNK> <UNK> screen in a sports bar during the day when everyone is quite drunk unfortunately i was sober when i saw this movie br br so <UNK> the late gene <UNK> for this lame <UNK> supposed <UNK> that came out two weeks after the far superior there's something about mary in a one <UNK> game during july of 1998 mary was a gross out fest but in addition to the many gags it had a lot of heart which is why it was the highest <UNK> comedy of that memorable summer br br baseketball tried to <UNK> mary but it <UNK> in more ways that one you take the creators of south park <UNK> parker and matt stone who are fortunately not behind the movie but in front of the camera the only member of <UNK> david <UNK> <UNK> the picture in desperate need of a paycheck and the other two jim <UNK> and jerry <UNK> clearly stayed out or probably warned him against the picture a small bit by now 90 years young ernest <UNK> wasting his precious time in his distinguished career dying on a <UNK> and singing i'm too sexy as he <UNK> his will jenny mccarthy who has little screen time as <UNK> not too <UNK> <UNK> widow young enough to be his <UNK> a bigger female part by <UNK> <UNK> as a dedicated social worker whose charges are <UNK> youngsters and the only interesting and meaningful player in this turkey robert vaughn as a corrupt <UNK> and pointless cameos by airplane <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the late robert stack who seemed nostalgic for the 1980 masterpiece and it's much <UNK> humor created by the <UNK> family what do all these people make up a desperate cast and crew trying to <UNK> airplane humor and mixing it up with the <UNK> of south park but failing in every way br br to make this long 100 minute movie short baseketball a real game invented by david <UNK> and his friends in his hometown of <UNK> is about two lazy losers parker and stone and their <UNK> sized mutual friend who <UNK> baseball and basketball hence the title together on the <UNK> of one's house after <UNK> dies he <UNK> the <UNK> of his baseketball team the <UNK> beers to parker and stone sure enough the game goes national and <UNK> vaughn and mccarthy want to take away <UNK> of the beers team from them but <UNK> is in love with both men particularly parker and one poor sick charge in need of a <UNK> transplant goes <UNK> <UNK> over them those are the characters not strongly developed br br now witless gags ensue blood <UNK> hair egg throwing and screaming are among them parker and stone nearly kill the <UNK> in the hospital but he pulls through the <UNK> transplant <UNK> sings and <UNK> <UNK> on his chest in the <UNK> will mccarthy who seemed to get over <UNK> death by <UNK> on a frank right away quickly <UNK> vaughn in the next scene <UNK> dance in skimpy outfits there is plenty of music on the soundtrack that is played for the hard of hearing and david <UNK> forces the parodies of <UNK> and titanic parody forcing is nothing new to <UNK> post airplane and the naked gun series br br and like <UNK> i was sober as well but i was also getting sleepy this movie should be played over and over to coarse mannered <UNK> <UNK> who enjoy it as they <UNK> down beers but will they remain alert and awake or pass out during the unfunny parts if they pass out then they won't realize that they are luckily missing stupidity and absurdity hats off to them
<START> why is it that a woman cannot be a strong character in a movie without sleeping with the leading man the campaign manager in this movie dreams of leading tom <UNK> to the white house it's all she can think about so why on earth must she have had an affair with him it added nothing to the plot and served only to <UNK> successful women the only value of that <UNK> was the cute we've all slept with your husband scene br br also couldn't the people who made this movie have watched the national conventions they were <UNK> airing between the two major political conventions only served to highlight their total ignorance of the nomination and selection process
<START> i have grown up with scooby doo all my life my dad grew up with scooby doo we have just watched the first episode of the travesty that calls itself shaggy and scooby get a clue what planet are warner bros on allowing this <UNK> to air the characters could have been drawn better by my younger sister the story could have been better written by my 3 year old twin cousins who are scooby doo fans too scooby and shaggy just aren't if anyone but <UNK> <UNK> does the voice of shaggy it just isn't gonna work folks trust me br br this program was <UNK> what's new scooby doo is much better why change a winning format bin this piece of garbage and go back to the true scooby
<START> a community pool in <UNK> is the setting for this under the radar film which is charming funny entertaining and appealing although it won <UNK> in major film festivals the big bad swim was not released to <UNK> of theaters across america but was distributed in dvd form and shown in theaters <UNK> br br it is unfortunate that the big bad swim never had the marketing hype of a hollywood release considering how many <UNK> hollywood has released this year such as i know who killed me the big bad swim a genuinely good independent film has had to swim <UNK> on its own br br nevertheless in the big bad swim actress <UNK> <UNK> is endearing and believable as amy the <UNK> to breaking point <UNK> teacher who not only is being dumped by her husband but also is about to lose her job and ends up taking a <UNK> on a new life tv soap actor jeff <UNK> who is hot plays <UNK> the earnest vulnerable swim teacher who goes the extra pool length to help his students overcome their fears and discovers he can learn from his students pretty sexy jess <UNK> did i just see her in a bank commercial <UNK> plays jordan the <UNK> to be who works two jobs one as a pole dancer the other as a <UNK> dealer her character provides the <UNK> for change amongst the ensemble but is the least understandable of the characters because of a lack of a back story or motivation as to why she does what she does jordan is young enough to still live at home with a <UNK> video camera <UNK> younger brother who spies on her however her parents are not shown to be involved with her life in any way which seems odd there's no drunken mother or abusive father here to explain why a normal attractive girl from a <UNK> <UNK> would choose to be a self <UNK> pole dancer who <UNK> herself for <UNK> bachelor parties br br despite this <UNK> the big bad swim succeeds in large part because it is a happy feel good film br br as one might expect learning to swim is the metaphor for life ultimately it's better to jump in with both feet and get in the swim rather than sit on the deck because life happens to you anyway br br the big bad swim is a great date movie a great <UNK> movie a great what haven't i seen movie and men like it as well as women
<START> this show is a perfect example of how the cbc should stick to either news sports or satirical sketch comedy as a <UNK> of situation comedy cbc has shown it can combine the <UNK> of king of <UNK> with the belly laughs of the <UNK> it is an embarrassment to great shows like kids in the hall and second city that they have to share their comedic roots with this lame production br br i have to admit that i didn't give this show much of a chance right from when i first heard of its concept to start half of the concept is a direct attempt to rip off one of the few sitcom <UNK> in english canadian history corner gas the rest of the concept the cultural clash is far from being original and is too often used as a <UNK> for screen writing <UNK> the selection of the muslim religion as the basis for the fish out of water characters seems to be a desperate attempt to be edgy and <UNK> but comes off as forced some of the jokes that are based around the <UNK> reaction to the <UNK> are cringe inducing and thoroughly insulting to the intelligence of everyone involved especially the audience br br this show is a perfect example of how cbc just doesn't get it when it comes to creating canadian content especially when presenting canada as a <UNK> environment cultural diversity in canada does not have to be presented in such a heavy handed and forced way it would be a refreshing change to see cbc introduce diversity into a television show without making the show all about said diversity i doubt that cbc has sufficient sitcom talent to pull off something so subtle a comparison could be made to the way diversity is depicted in corner gas i e the <UNK> characters are not set apart by their <UNK> nor is their <UNK> used to generate story lines more realistically their lives and the other characters lives <UNK> in a way that makes <UNK> no more significant than any of their other personal characteristics br br that being said even as a formulaic fish out of water comedy this show fails the acting is weak the comic pacing all over the map and the story premises that i saw were too far beyond the suspension of belief even for a comedy the only saving grace is the talented derek <UNK> who is horribly wasted here i doubt that even the addition of guest stars colin <UNK> for example as an <UNK> <UNK> can save this dog i decided to give the show a chance once the <UNK> <UNK> had died down but two episodes were all i could stand i could almost feel my <UNK> <UNK> themselves down with each failed punchline the time <UNK> would be better served by airing more <UNK> street air farce re runs or dr who even an <UNK> would be an improvement
<START> this is one of the best movie i have ever seen my parents comes from rural india and to some <UNK> i have seen the life of the villagers peoples are really poor and have financial and social problems br br the movie just reflects exactly the same full credit to the director and the actor they have done an excellent job i just wonder how can movies like <UNK> and <UNK> can go for oscar and not <UNK> i don't understand the <UNK> on which the movies are selected is the money that makes the difference or having some big names in the movie makes the difference br br hope to see more movies like this in the future
<START> as i am no fan of almost any post desperate living john waters films i <UNK> to pecker after he emerged from the underground waters produced trash <UNK> versions of his earlier works cry baby <UNK> <UNK> that to die hard fans looked and <UNK> like watered down <UNK> pecker which doesn't attempt to <UNK> early <UNK> is a slight quiet humble commentary on the <UNK> of celebrity and the <UNK> of the art world waters clearly knows this subject well because he has also <UNK> and sold at ridiculous <UNK> some of the most amateurish pop art ever created that you couldn't imagine anyone being able to give away if it wasn't <UNK> with the waters name edward <UNK> is fine as pecker and <UNK> non <UNK> style is at ease with the subject
<START> the problem with family dramas is that outside of tv movies on channels like lifetime most people don't want to watch them and the ones that do get watched tend to be <UNK> and about current or <UNK> problems or issues in the news or recent news movies that explain or explore the human condition aren't popular particularly with the young crowd that would be miss <UNK> fan base or the younger crowd that tends to make movies not simply popular but <UNK> successful for studios br br the specific problems i had with this movie is the <UNK> of some of the characterizations it was a bit much to blame all of the <UNK> character's acting out <UNK> the car drug use etc on what her step father did to her while not improbable it's just a bit much to expect the audience to swallow additionally other aspects such as her giving the young <UNK> boy <UNK> sex or that she would actually make a good assistant to the vet who <UNK> happens to have a thing for her mother etc all these elements just did not really help this movie along it placed it more in the element of a situation comedy trying one of their special dramatic episodes then it did for a fully realized well written feature film br br when you watch the dvd and listen to the commentary particularly for the various alternate endings you can really see all of this is sharp focus
<START> this <UNK> doesn't <UNK> the <UNK> that badly it's still a horrible <UNK> production <UNK> dutch uncle is inexplicably dubbed by a <UNK> whether it's <UNK> <UNK> or not is subject to debate and <UNK> <UNK> overacts like never before most of the dialogue makes it through <UNK> and the fact that the mst3k version feels <UNK> to point out repeatedly that the speeches are long duh doesn't strike me as incredibly humorous mostly it's just bad acting though
<START> what is really sad shows like six <UNK> and brothers sisters are the true reality tv not that garbage that are nothing more than <UNK> game shows i think the ground <UNK> of <UNK> has been there for the past few years with very <UNK> <UNK> of numerous shows with a cult following but with the more vocal <UNK> the fans of <UNK> which i also enjoy and other shows networks may start to reverse this trend i am like others i will not support any new shows until they have been given a second season i'll then possibly make a decision to watch and catch up via dvd's and online viewing until then abc you have lost me as a viewer to any new show
<START> watched this film having really enjoyed <UNK> girl many years ago this was drivel the plot was vaguely <UNK> with the teacher and his friend <UNK> over 14 15 year old girls in very short <UNK> previous <UNK> seem to think that this doesn't matter but i found it rather nasty if you have children at school then the last thing you want is to think that every <UNK> teacher is <UNK> after his <UNK> we were surprised that the <UNK> let that through apart from that the film was just a waste of time the script was poor and john gordon <UNK> trying too hard to recreate his <UNK> image slightly wacky and off the wall why anyone would want to lust after him in this performance is incredible this film failed on all counts for me dreadful please don't waste your time watching it life's too short
<START> <UNK> this is a rather silly little <UNK> <UNK> as a period drama biopic br br however the only reason i wanted to see it in the first place was because i was curious about what the great henry fonda was really like at his peak i wasn't disappointed he produces a truly warm and charismatic performance br br in addition i can honestly say that i was never really bored at any stage during the film so a strong 1 2 out of
<START> there is no way on earth you are going to care about any of these characters a bunch of <UNK> middle class <UNK> kids take some drugs at a party and get off with each other and argue i've just seen this on tv and i didn't think it was a <UNK> as such more a post <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that really has no <UNK> or proper drama to it stuff like this will get <UNK> for time <UNK> unfortunately irrelevant middle class lifestyle crap that takes itself far too seriously it's got david <UNK> in it and that bird out of cold feet you know what to expect there was a lot of this stuff about in 2000 it was a particularly british <UNK> they're educated and doing drugs friends but kinda dysfunctional and with incestuous relationships sounds great this kind of nonsense and post guy ritchie comedy gangster stuff dark days if you have taste this will annoy you to the point of violence
<START> what can i say about cruel intentions 2 well i can say in all honesty i will only watch this film again if i am <UNK> to a chair and have my eyes opened clockwork orange style br br the film <UNK> robin dunne no i never heard of him either whose awful impression of ryan <UNK> made me cringe throughout in a case of terrible casting dunne attempts and fails to carry off playing a handsome charismatic <UNK> since the actor is not handsome nor charismatic nor charming the character is left wholly unbelievable amy adams she was in an episode of buffy one time tries to pick up where sarah michelle <UNK> left off and bring scheming <UNK> to life however adams is not that good a an actress and her performance was flat and lacking in any real emotion often she looked like she was reading cue cards just off camera there were two good actors in the film however barry <UNK> saw 2 saw 3 and <UNK> rogers mrs <UNK> in <UNK> powers made very good and entertaining performances as the parents of sebastian and <UNK> and are the only reason why i rated the film as a 2 not a 1 br br the film itself is a poor version of the original with such <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> of dialogue and <UNK> scenes which lacked the originality of the previous film br br i think that as a tv show it might have worked but if it had been <UNK> with people who could actually act in the main parts
<START> to those who say that this movie deserves anything below the <UNK> grace that it showed i disagree this is an amazing documentary about a shocking day br br imdb asks us to rate this movie i beg you to consider the fact that the documentary was made the courage that it took to shoot this film is most notable we find that the two brothers are split up when that moment happened they continue to document the <UNK> of the brave without knowing about their own and <UNK> safety to judge whether it's <UNK> to shoot a video of that tragedy or to save the lives as those amazing amazing <UNK> did is not mine to answer i just know that in 30 years a class full of children will not know one without the other br br i submit a <UNK> 10 this is why the art of filming was created to capture the natural emotion that real life offers you can keep your kung fu junk romance is cute action will never reach this level this movie 9 11 will be timeless in that it did not <UNK> itself it didn't have a sneak <UNK> it didn't have all of the blatant <UNK> that a <UNK> share of the many movies on the many screens <UNK> it had class <UNK> substance and it had a record of the day that changed the modern face of america and even the world it spoke of things <UNK> to the eye of the camera please consider this movie as it itself <UNK> a stirring tribute to all of those who fell because of the free beautiful name of america br br how can you give anything less to a movie that shows not <UNK> the natural bravery of real people acting in unreal times i love the godfather but 9 11 is forever a different kind of movie as this is now a different kind of world it is art without question or questions br br <UNK>
<START> this is an extremely long movie which means you may become very bored before it becomes interesting but its length provides opportunity for its characters to find permanent <UNK> in your <UNK> br br if you are moved by the guilt of the <UNK> you will find it particularly heart wrenching because it is a story that finds its heroes among the evil and the weak if you can love a monster you'll cry for <UNK> <UNK> the spy who betrays everyone notably his country his friends and family a man who has also been manipulated and <UNK> since childhood by those same people br br there isn't one truly likeable character in the entire story not one loyal <UNK> personality to <UNK> with but watching the whole thing without the help of a <UNK> would be quite remarkable br br i really enjoyed it in the end well worth it for people who like <UNK> movies about <UNK> human character
<START> the story line has been <UNK> a number of times a breath of life in the retirement home several plays movies novels short stories <UNK> and news <UNK> have beat the subject to no end but it's still an excellent platform for character studies br br if <UNK> was crafted more <UNK> it could be brilliant but the dialogue is painfully boring and the story is absolutely <UNK> with cliches even the <UNK> and summary of <UNK> simple wisdom almost made me laugh in its <UNK> mostly indifferent acting is the final straw for this weak film but the rest of it is bland enough to make the actors' lack of focus almost irrelevant
<START> and that goes especially for lawyers cops puerto rico which boasts of a small but potent film production firm brings this multi layered tale of corruption due to the on going drug <UNK> that starts in south america makes a pit stop on the island <UNK> and then <UNK> into north america steven bauer the most recognizable face on screen here leads a cast of top notch actors in a story of can you spot the only respectable face in the crowd <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> moves up from directing mainly action adventure fare for american television in a screenplay written by <UNK> along with <UNK> <UNK> the rest of the cast <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jose <UNK> <UNK> maria <UNK> to mention a few turn in oh so fine roles in a film that will keep you wondering is there any respectable characters here spoken in spanish with english subtitles rated <UNK> by the mpaa this film contains <UNK> of vulgar language brief flashes of nudity adult content violence some of which is quite lurid
<START> when you look back at another bad nightmare sequel like freddy's revenge you have to at least give it some credit for trying something new and although the dream child is more enjoyable it offers absolutely nothing new to the series yes there's the creative deaths as usual like a kid becoming part of a comic book and facing super freddy but even scenes like that aren't used to their full potential and the parts without freddy are just boring br br this marked the official death of <UNK> to the series freddy seems to be the comedic relief now but to what br br my rating 4 10
<START> what people fail to understand about this movie is that it isn't a beginning middle and end it is just the conclusion of a 26 episode long tv series so remember that when you all talk about how the world wasn't explored enough that was all done in the tv show br br as great and stunning as the visuals are i think the spoilers argument between <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> near the end of the film was what really made me love this movie seeing characters i had followed through 26 episodes fight like that was <UNK> and seeing <UNK> walking sadly off by himself amidst the floating ruins while <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his blade was almost tear <UNK> br br then we got a total contrast with <UNK> <UNK> fighting these insanely awesome dragons which had been featured before in the series while <UNK> is <UNK> insanely and <UNK> threatening to kill <UNK> <UNK> i'm surprised that this particular scene hasn't been mentioned more in the <UNK> any kid that has a <UNK> of sense will be able to see that <UNK> wasn't himself and was fully intent on <UNK> that little girl it was enough to bother me and i'm 15 br br the world is amazing the plot is a lot better than most multi million blockbusters and it was a nice way to see some of my favorite characters go check it out
<START> my first impression would be this is beowulf only with all the good bits of fighting grendel and dragons intact making it one thrill ride from start to end written by <UNK> <UNK> and arthur <UNK> the two of them had created a <UNK> landscape that becomes a character in itself within their story with its ever changing environment made up of small <UNK> of land floating around which can either be <UNK> or <UNK> of <UNK> br br the story's a simple one which tells of a land which is <UNK> in the expectation of a mighty <UNK> <UNK> visit to <UNK> and destroy and the resident knights have all but been <UNK> enter the king's <UNK> <UNK> marie <UNK> who <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> vincent <UNK> a huge <UNK> with immense strength but truly a gentle giant and his partner in arms <UNK> patrick <UNK> who <UNK> the <UNK> with his cunning brain <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> together with their pet creature which too proudly <UNK> <UNK> fires share a common dream of <UNK> a farm land and spending <UNK> days <UNK> to their farm animals in retirement but in order to do that comes the <UNK> of being <UNK> free hence their career in monster <UNK> which doesn't exactly pay off br br that's basically the whole <UNK> of it but what makes this film a spectacle is its cg graphics which is <UNK> rich detailed and an eye popping marvel to behold it has some wonderfully crafted set action pieces that were <UNK> designed to draw you into the thick of the action and during those fight sequences there's <UNK> a boring moment photo realistic moments of non existent landscapes make you put aside the fantasy of make belief and it's easy to be in awe of the landscape which goes beyond the usual three <UNK> and a <UNK> of flying <UNK> here's having at you george and i couldn't get enough of the finale battle as well though the usual brick bats will find some fault at the <UNK> of the principle characters br br i guess this film had opened my eyes that there are many more computer animated companies out there around the world that have quality in their product to match that of <UNK> and this is definitely a movie that the local filmmakers of zodiac the race begins and legend of the sea can learn from  to keep the story effectively simple and let your moving artwork do all the talking definitely highly recommended
<START> one thing i'm sure everyone who has seen this film will agree on is that it is very creepy the other films in <UNK> <UNK> trilogy are creepy too but they are all different in what makes them creepy but they all roughly deal with the same thing they all deal with the mind definitely the staring people are very creepy each of them sent <UNK> down my spine that made me incapable of sitting still again if you have seen the other two films mentioned i'm sure you'll find this quite creepy because you begin to expect typical polanski traits that you think you have caught onto he is aware of this and will keep <UNK> you with simple things personally every time <UNK> would slowly turn around i would be <UNK> myself for a jump maybe that's just me but it felt intended to do that though it was quite subtle there is no build up of the music in those moments br br the acting in this was pretty good mostly that from polanski of course the other characters in the film don't have all that much time to <UNK> the lead polanski really proves himself as an all round great filmmaker he not only can direct and write great films but he can actually act too i don't think there is any other better person who could have pulled off the <UNK> character polanski settled right on in perfectly i like seeing films where the director is also apart of the main cast to me it really highlights their fantastic <UNK> and talent which i respect greatly br br one thing i didn't like about this film is how it was done in english for those who don't know this is a french film american <UNK> and as well to make it more <UNK> successful it was mostly done in english there are parts which it is very obvious there has been dubbing and i don't know why it is but 3 4 of the time when there is a dub they get the complete wrong person to do the dub there is a women in the film who when she speaks it's obvious it's a dub but they got the most annoying person to do the voice over it was seriously pain to my ears to hear her speak she had the <UNK> high pitch voice i've heard in a while it almost seemed fake but i don't see what the point was she was a rather small character i honestly would of preferred if they just left it as it was filmed parts of it in french and parts of it in english because the dubbing in this film was a pain and was not near two completely different films i know the high standard of another film that did a similar thing which was the good the bad and the ugly i realise it's not a big problem just when you do realise it it gets annoying but i'm sure you won't sit there the long trying to lip read what they are actually saying regardless if you know french br br whats so great about polanski is that he will let you think you know him that you know his style which in some aspects you do but really you can't see whats behind that corner this film is a lot more open to interpretation than the other two films mentioned which i think really <UNK> this one in particular i personally feel this is the best of the three i'm unsure which comes next but they are all relatively close in their level of greatness the ending is fantastic it is so easy to <UNK> on it for a long time to come and get nowhere i choose not to think to much on it just to have my personal opinion and leave it at that br br i've <UNK> on and i haven't really given any insight on what makes this film so great i don't think so i'll quickly do it here if you liked <UNK> and or rosemary's baby i guarantee you will enjoy this film to say the least for those who are too unfortunate to have seen either then i recommend you check this film out if your looking for something that is quite a creepy film that is quite intelligent particularly the end as well if your looking for something that deals with the mind paranoia even though that is better <UNK> under <UNK>
<START> yeti deserves the 8 star rating because it is the one of the greatest bad movies ever made i saw it at a midnight screening in l a and people were roaring and cheering at the insanity this movie is one of those cinematic <UNK> where you think it cant get any stranger and then it does the millionaire who <UNK> the project to <UNK> the yeti looks like chris penn and john goodman both <UNK> into an ill fitting suit the guy playing the scientist is one of the worst actors to ever appear on screen and yes there is a mute boy who sorta kinda looks like a girl and he's mute ever since he survived a plane crash that killed both his parents hmmm maybe therapy for the kid then this <UNK> italian girl is seen by yeti once he <UNK> which takes forever and he is instantly in love with her what is one of the most hysterical things about the movie is that this giant yeti makes bedroom eyes at her it's like a large barry white trying to seduce a <UNK> in fact once the large yeti picks up the <UNK> and has her against his chest she accidentally touches the <UNK> <UNK> and yes the film takes the time to show his large grey <UNK> get hard <UNK> of all <UNK> plus there's a <UNK> dog in it because the italian producer must have heard that american audiences like dogs and he sorta kinda tried to get a <UNK> there's also this insane scene where the yeti eats a giant fish keeps the large <UNK> and uses it to <UNK> the italian girl's hair gee thanks yeti now my hair is smooth and <UNK> like dead <UNK> you're the best this film is more bizarre than something ed wood could have ever <UNK> up if you are a fan of classic cinema crap seek this baby out
<START> salvage is the worst so called horror film i've ever seen there is nothing remotely horrific about it it doesn't deserve to be in a genre so fine first of all i don't see how so many people can think this piece of crap such a great movie if i wrote something as boring and utterly ridiculous as this i would be laughed at and too embarrassed to subject others to the stupidity of it second the acting is terrible and the lead actress is excruciatingly ugly third the story sucks its been used before and the excuse that its a cheap movie is no excuse read the <UNK> on the back of the case it reveals the whole story i do not recommend that you watch this movie unless you have 80 minutes to waste on something that will leave you <UNK> that you watched it i feel really bad for those crooks and the irony of their name all <UNK> anthony <UNK>
<START> of the three titles from jess franco to find their way onto the official <UNK> video nasty list devil hunter bloody moon and women behind bars this is perhaps the least deserving of <UNK> being a dreadfully dull jungle <UNK> <UNK> only very slightly by a little inept gore a gratuitous rape scene and loads of nudity br br gorgeous blonde ursula <UNK> plays movie star laura crawford who is <UNK> by a gang of ruthless <UNK> and taken to a remote <UNK> island inhabited by a savage tribe who worship the <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> in the jungle a big naked <UNK> eyed native who likes to eat the hearts of <UNK> female sacrifices br br employed by <UNK> agent to deliver a <UNK> <UNK> brave <UNK> peter <UNK> al <UNK> and his vietnam vet pilot pal travel to the island but encounter trouble when the bad guys attempt a double cross during the confusion laura escapes into the jungle but runs straight into the arms of the <UNK> natives who offer her up to their god br br franco directs in his usual <UNK> style and loads this laughable effort with his usual dreadful <UNK> crap gore murky cinematography rapid <UNK> numerous <UNK> shots out of focus imagery awful sound effects and ham <UNK> editing the result is a dire mess that is a real struggle to sit through from start to finish it took me a couple of <UNK> to finish the thing and even the sight of the <UNK> <UNK> in all of her natural glory ain't enough to make me <UNK> this film in a hurry
<START> this is the first movie i've seen of john <UNK> and he is a pretty good director the movie starts out with a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> and it shows what happens to several of them omar <UNK> plays a track star with a partial <UNK> and having a hard time keeping up with his work he is friends with ice cube and beings dating <UNK> banks <UNK> <UNK> is a rich girl who is date raped and becomes friends with jennifer <UNK> who is a lesbian and isn't sure about which way to go michael <UNK> is a kid from <UNK> who falls in with a group of neo nazis and their leader is cole <UNK> those are the three main characters and laurence fishburne is a political science professor who tries to help them it's a great film and it's unfortunate that the studio had to make several cuts to the movie
<START> i grew up on this movie and i can remember when my brother and i used to play in the backyard and pretend we were in care a lot now after so many years have passed i get to watch the movie with my daughter and watch her enjoy it if you are parent and you have not watched this movie with your children then you should just so you hold them in your arms and watch them get thrilled over the care bears and care a lot the songs especially forever young are very sweet and memorable parents i highly recommend this movie for all kids so they can learn how enjoyable caring for others can be when it comes down to all the trash that is on tv you can raise your children to have the right frame of mind about life with movies like these
<START> i had few problems with this film and i have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated true it is over three hours long but i was amazed that it goes by so quickly i don't think it is overrated at all i think the imdb rating is perfectly decent the film looks <UNK> with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects and the direction from james cameron rarely slips from focus <UNK> <UNK> gives one of his best performances as jack and kate <UNK> is lovely as rose david warner a great actor steals every scene he's in the story is very rich in detail and is hot on character development obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow the last hour is extremely riveting and i will confess that i was on the edge of my seat when the titanic <UNK> i will also say that the last five minutes were very moving the music score by james <UNK> was lovely though i never was a huge fan of the song my heart will go on the 1996 miniseries was good but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies overall i give titanic an 8 5 10 <UNK> cox
<START> somehow this movie manages to be <UNK> bittersweet and heartwarming at the same time stars like tony <UNK> from <UNK> bring the tale to life the story itself is inspiring we see a desperate up and down life through the most innocent eyes imaginable a <UNK> br br paulie begins his life as a baby parrot given to a little girl played by <UNK> <UNK> also known as the <UNK> girl with a speech <UNK> while she learns to speak correctly so does paulie however unlike most birds he can speak and understand everything being said the military father doesn't like the bird so he is sent to a <UNK> shop and bought by an aging artist <UNK> she teaches him manners etc while traveling across the country to find <UNK> owner the movie continues with several twists of fate until paulie ends up at a laboratory where he is eventually hidden away in a basement and found by a russian <UNK> who is touched by the <UNK> story the plot is in keeping with the simple <UNK> theme that language is a gift and a curse i would like to say that the soundtrack is astounding a beautiful mixture of <UNK> digital base and <UNK> enhance the movie to the point of pure ecstasy the sweeping camera angles and breathtaking scenery <UNK> the story even more and as a final remark the <UNK> is entirely believable unlike in star wars where <UNK> resembles a muppet this film is one of my favorite movies with the added remark that my wonderful <UNK> of four years died recently overall i give this movie out of four stars two thumbs up and a big hug
<START> contrary to its title this film offers no spice and thus audience is subjected to a tasteless dish all humor appears forced theatrical mechanical staged reminiscent of those <UNK> plays available on video including even the mannerisms everybody is screaming shouting and doing odd things for no reason the premise looks interesting as it is a straight lift from hollywood's <UNK> <UNK> john abraham who is so natural in almost all his films is a complete <UNK> here if we keep morality factor aside even then the bizarre events looks trite akshay kumar and <UNK> <UNK> two experienced <UNK> try hard to lift the film by being natural but in vain at least the characters of three girls should be made <UNK> in order to bring some interesting elements but sadly here too all of them appears those brainless <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who talk behave and even scream in quite similar fashion the major hole in the plot is what made the protagonist keep the three girls at his same home pretending that they will never get to know about each other just to do some sex what else the same could be done in hundreds of other ways therefore so much <UNK> for no reason is not something audience will <UNK> easily but surely great flesh show and <UNK> <UNK> always gives such films a great initial now for those who call it a <UNK> comedy i call it a pathetic taste sense of humor of such cinema going audience is surely gone <UNK> and demented to the extent that they are connecting to a sadistic weird and <UNK> type of humor where it is not the characters that they laugh at but rather at themselves and at their own <UNK> that look how senseless we have become that in order to laugh we have to bear with such things
<START> this definitely is not the intellectual film with profound mission so i really don't think there is too much not to understand to in case you aren't czech br br it's just a comedy the humor is simple pretty funny and sometimes maybe little morbid some actors and characters are very similar to <UNK> 2000 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> so the authors are but it doesn't matter the genre is really different and these two films shouldn't be compared in this way <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> won't try to give you a lesson it will try to make you laugh and there is some chance it will succeed br br not bad film not the ingenious one but i enjoyed it some scenes are truly worth seeing
<START> while not as famous as some of their other <UNK> such as the black cat and the body <UNK> this is a dandy little horror film even though the casting decisions were a bit odd boris karloff plays dr <UNK> rukh a weird scientist who lives in the <UNK> mountains near where the dracula character's home town bela lugosi plays dr <UNK> whose <UNK> was never discussed though the name certainly sounds french i really think it would have made sense to have the two switch roles as the <UNK> role seems <UNK> made for lugosi especially with his accent however despite this unusual twist the two still did excellent jobs <UNK> was definitely the lead role but lugosi <UNK> himself well as a relatively normal person something he didn't play very often in films it seems that dr rukh is a bit of a <UNK> as other scientists especially <UNK> think his theories are bizarre and nonsensical however over the course of the film rukh turns out to be right and <UNK> is especially generous in his new praise for rukh but unfortunately the wonderful new element that rukh discovered has the nasty side effect of turning him into a crazy killing machine don't you hate it when that happens while this could have just been a simple nice scientist turned mad story the plot was well constructed the characters nicely developed and the mad rukh was not a one dimensional killer but complex and interesting br br this film is bound to be enjoyed by anyone except for people who hate old horror films you can really tell that universal pictures pulled out all the stops and made a bigger budget film instead of the cheap <UNK> both lugosi and karloff unfortunately <UNK> in later years good stuff
<START> dominick <UNK> <UNK> wears a <UNK> t shirt and <UNK> off everyday to perform his duties as a garbage man he uses his physical power in picking up other's trash and <UNK> it to the town dump he reads comic book hero stories and loves <UNK> and wrestling going to <UNK> with his twin brother eugene on their birthday is a <UNK> tradition he talks kindly with the many people he comes in contact with during his day he reads comic books which he finds in the trash with a young boy who he often passes by while on the garbage route unfortunately dominick has a <UNK> ability to use his mind he has a <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> came as a result of an injury to the head in which he suffered traumatic brain injury <UNK> this injury left him slower though it did not change his core characteristic as a strong individual who helps to protect others dominick is actually more able to live <UNK> than he may seem at the beginning of the film he lives with eugene who is studying to become a doctor dominick provides the main source of <UNK> while eugene is off studying eugene must face the fact that he is to continue his education in a different city and that he must move away from dominick eugene also develops a romance which begins to separate him from his twin brother br br the film deals specifically with domestic abuse and how this can impact individuals families and then society as a whole the strain that <UNK> between eugene and dominick as eugene realizes that he must eventually leave <UNK> <UNK> on their birthday night eugene yells at dominick and throws him against the wall in this moment eugene must confront his own fears of being like his abusive father the father which dominick <UNK> him against while he himself became the victim of the abuse this event <UNK> the love between the two brothers who from then on became the best of friends though they needed each other they also both needed independence and the ability to grow and develop relationship with others the fact that they must part ways became a very real emotional strain however by the end of the film dominick is able to say good bye to his brother and wish him luck eugene is able to leave his brother with the confidence that he has started to make a social network of people who care about him and will help him with his independence br br when dominick witnesses the abuse of his friend he is forced to come face to face with the cause of his own trauma in this state of extreme stress dominick almost completely <UNK> down he then runs after the <UNK> to the hospital to see what happened to his friend after learning that the boy has died he is confronted by the abusive father who <UNK> his <UNK> tells him he didn't see nothing doesn't know anything and not to say anything and that if he does he will kill him now that his own life has been threatened he goes and find the hand gun that larry used to kill the rats he goes to the wake of the deceased boy and at <UNK> kidnaps the baby of the <UNK> family he runs away from the scene and hides in a building when the police surround him eugene goes in the building to talk to his brother eugene then reveals the cause of <UNK> <UNK> and they bring the baby back the abusive father then <UNK> a gun of his own threatening to kill dominick but eugene stops him and dominick tells the crowd that he saw the father throw his son down the stairs br br through the climactic ending the issue of dysfunctional behavior comes into view though <UNK> instinct to save the baby can be understood we also see how <UNK> this response is dominick put the <UNK> life and his own life in grave danger the larger societal consequences of these events is not directly <UNK> but rather shown through the films ending despite the more optimistic ending portrayal another sequence of events might just have likely occurred in which dominick is charged with kidnapping and possession of a <UNK> it is somewhat difficult to believe that this went completely <UNK> furthermore even if dominick is not charged there may still be a <UNK> against him within the community not that there wasn't one before these events instead the film shows that we must be able to recognize <UNK> behavior and act to <UNK> it br br dominick and eugene was released in 1988 the same year as another film <UNK> which won 5 academy awards while <UNK> was an achievement and helped increase the <UNK> with person with <UNK> it could be <UNK> that dominick and eugene holds more valuable lessons for society whereas <UNK> demonstrated that mainstream american society might be able to learn from and care for a <UNK> if the <UNK> is the <UNK> of a large estate dominick and eugene show that a person with a <UNK> might be able to care for and help save members of american society the message of an independent person with <UNK> may have been too strong for 1988 hopefully someday society will see the strengths of individuals with <UNK> not as a threat but as <UNK> for the strength of society
<START> i understand that paramount wanted to film this with the <UNK> and hart score but couldn't work out the <UNK> problems so burke and van <UNK> who wrote the between them the most songs for bing crosby contributed a very nice score br br i read leonard <UNK> saying that this movie fit crosby like a <UNK> and i couldn't have put it better no it's not mark <UNK> satire it's a bing crosby film and in 1949 crosby was the most <UNK> star in hollywood for once paramount used technicolor and <UNK> <UNK> was never <UNK> on the screen this was a woman that technicolor was invented for br br william <UNK> brooklyn origins kinda stand out but it's to a good comic effect the trio of crosby <UNK> and sir cedric <UNK> have a <UNK> good time with busy doing nothing bing has one of his <UNK> upbeat philosophical numbers with if you <UNK> your toe on the moon br br the third song he sings once and for always by himself and with <UNK> <UNK> that song was nominated for best song but lost to baby it's cold outside br br nice also that bing managed to record the score for <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> br br one thing i like about this film is that it shows <UNK> comic talents without bob hope i like the road pictures but bing was a comic talent onto himself and this film better demonstrates than any other br br this is crosby at the top of his game
<START> jared diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world didn't have animals to <UNK> but europeans did and that accounts for why we were able to make steel and <UNK> complex machines br br but then in the third episode he says that when the europeans in south africa got too far north they ran into <UNK> people and other <UNK> that <UNK> cattle and planted <UNK> so what explains their lack of technological economic and artistic achievement if they had the key things the author claims are needed for success br br diamond also claims <UNK> in the form of <UNK> brought to north america by black slaves were our biggest weapon well if 150 europeans can defeat 20 000 native warriors and 400 non military south <UNK> can defeat 10 000 <UNK> without a single <UNK> in either case then i think you have to conclude that <UNK> are irrelevant with or without <UNK> we were going to succeed br br he says <UNK> stopped europeans from <UNK> further north killing thousands of europeans while not affecting <UNK> i'd like to know real numbers but he doesn't say then at the end he says today <UNK> is killing thousands of <UNK> and that is why they can't catch up with us so which is it jared did <UNK> help the <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> or hurt them and how come europe did okay despite massive <UNK> throughout our history br br he also seems far too eager to say that the reasons europeans succeeded was because of dumb luck at times when the evidence threatens to <UNK> his <UNK> theories he's reluctant to admit that maybe europeans were successful because they worked for it it's sad watch this obvious neo <UNK> <UNK> reality to try to prove his point
<START> the acting was horrible and they got both of the sports <UNK> not only did they get the figure <UNK> rules wrong but also they rules of girls ice hockey in girls ice hockey you cannot check you also don't block for someone not all they girls are disgusting gross mean and big i play hockey and i'm only <UNK> and have been asked to go to schools like the one in the movie also not all hockey players hate figure <UNK> a lot of current girls hockey players were once figure <UNK> themselves also we <UNK> a lot faster then the ones in the movie i was embarrassed by the movie it gave people the idea that we suck although i must mention that it is difficult to transition between the sports because of the toe pick on the figure <UNK> also some of those <UNK> moves <UNK> was doing on the ice you couldn't do in a regular hockey game she basically <UNK> the person which is <UNK> its also unrealistic that she would get a hockey <UNK> when she figure <UNK> that really made me angry that <UNK> would normally be used to someone who could benefit the team
<START> overall i thought it a very nice movie i hate to use the word <UNK> as it's rather dry but it was very beautiful to look at and the central performances by rupert friend and emily blunt were very strong what i liked most was that despite the <UNK> <UNK> of the costumes and the settings all <UNK> and shiny this aspect never took over the heart of the film which was good strong writing thank you julian <UNK> d nothing too flamboyant or <UNK> with <UNK> i e not <UNK> greatly when victoria is dragged out of bed to be informed she is now queen well you couldn't get a less glamorous hand over of the crown it was paced gently and every line in the film held its worth br br undoubtedly the portrayal of the love between victoria and albert though somewhat fairytale ish on the face it was in fact a slow burning candle and friend and blunt did well to show how effortlessly these two people <UNK> together despite the union being initially arranged my <UNK> bit was when they come home after hunting and victoria simply <UNK> her new husband from behind so much said without any words that's what film is all about blunt held her own beautifully as well she has a face that demands your attention and i can't not mention the costumes that she wears every one simply gorgeous if i was blunt i would have trouble <UNK> with any of them the rest of the ensemble cast all played their roles well harriet walter as queen <UNK> being a highlight br br the only <UNK> i have is that it lacked a sense of urgency or an event that could have made the movie a little more exciting it was rather tame i don't know i wanted <UNK> to happen that would have victoria draw out some strength and prove her worth a little more when she and albert <UNK> i loved it i could have done with some more pivotal dramatic moments though that may be just me br br lastly at the risk of sounding all patriotic it did <UNK> a sort of pride and awe in the crown and what it takes to be in such a position especially in one so young this may be in part to the fact that this film's snap shot of victoria's young life is immediately apt to what i have been writing for one character of mine in 'the sword the <UNK> but nevertheless it did flag up those feelings for those following my book can you guess what character victoria so <UNK> reflects it might have been in part to the film displaying how ridiculous the government were back in those times as they didn't seem to give two <UNK> about the poor and <UNK> of the nation which only in turns <UNK> appreciation that queen victoria and prince albert were so active in this domestic <UNK> it made the government appear rather useless nothing much has changed then i suppose br br <UNK> on films and books http <UNK> <UNK> com
<START> i never finished this movie for a reason it was dreadful and thats just the acting i wasn't even sure what the film was about <UNK> it didn't make a lot of sense and the violence was awful i mean <UNK> i like some nude in a film lol but it was just sick because of what was happening all the characters annoyed me and it was just full of loud screams and the camera was shaking at parts and it looked like a sequel to the blair with project but without any good qualities this is one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time and would like my time back please i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone or even consider it n
<START> except people apparently buy into this garbage as shows like moral <UNK> have shown even if you tried to make the most outrageous over the top parody of <UNK> you could possibly think of it wouldn't come close to the hilarity of this show it's hard to tell what's even going on when you're watching it is it a news show a talk show who knows they start out by <UNK> on various international news stories but at seemingly random points the news is interrupted by this odd <UNK> like little man with a <UNK> bigger than his entire face <UNK> and laughing and generally being creepy br br pat robertson doesn't even seem like such a bad guy at first glance he just seems like a <UNK> yet harmless old <UNK> stuck in his <UNK> beliefs like most of our grandparents but this is a man who has called for an assassination who has <UNK> and offered aid to not one but two murderous <UNK> who has <UNK> used <UNK> money to run diamond mines who has supported forced <UNK> in china and who regularly implies that <UNK> straight american male <UNK> in particular are superior to all other races br br still this would all be funny except that he apparently has a large enough fan base to keep his little show on the air 40 years later either that or enough money to <UNK> some tv executives who don't give a damn what they show the idiocy of the show becomes <UNK> when you realize that some people somewhere must be watching it and hanging onto every word even when robertson has repeatedly shown how corrupt he is people still listen to him i don't know if it's funny or scary i guess a healthy mixture of both
<START> that is the best way i can describe this movie which centers on a newly married couple who move into a house that is haunted by the husband's first wife who died under mysterious circumstances that sounds well and good but what plays out is an hour of pure boredom in fact one of the funny things about this flick is that there is a warning at the beginning of the film that promises anyone who dies of fright a free coffin well trust me no one ever took them up on that offer unless someone out there is terrified of plastic <UNK> <UNK> weird <UNK> and doors being knocked on and the music is the worst it consists of constant <UNK> music which sounds like it is being played by some sixth <UNK> and you will figure out the terrible secret that is so obvious that you really have to wonder what the people in this movie were thinking someone dies while running and hitting their head and the police are never called to investigate yes in the end this is a slow paced which is really bad considering the movie is only just over an hour boring little tale that is easily figured out by the average person apparently none of the characters in this flick were the average person
<START> sadly not available on dvd as yet but worth pursuing on tcm or vhs a secretary believes her boss is wrongly accused of murder and <UNK> takes on many dangerous characters in an effort to establish the truth a movie with many twists and dark <UNK> none of which i will mention the jazz band sequence where our heroine seeks the information about the killer is one of the most erotic scenes in hollywood history despite being at very low budget and made during wwii in black and white despite the low budget long island looks somewhat <UNK> this is a movie of original style and outstanding vision ella raines was a great actress discovered by howard <UNK> who knew much about these matters casting the <UNK> women <UNK> <UNK> hepburn angie dickinson lauren bacall ann sheridan of their era robert <UNK> was of one of several german hungarian czech film makers sirk wilder <UNK> lubitsch <UNK> lang etc who <UNK> <UNK> to hollywood and brought a highly original fresh vision with them sadly ella raines was never given such a great part again and eventually ended up in poorly produced westerns
<START> this has to be one of the best movies to come out of hk in a long time i was eagerly waiting to get my hands on this movie just looking at the title loads of fantastic actors in this show and i was particularly impressed with sam lee's <UNK> believable insane behavior and <UNK> portrayal of a killer machine which totally <UNK> his normal idol image i would definitely recommend to those looking for a stylish and action packed movie however i must warn you this is also an equally depressing movie as every character in the movie is in some kind of dead end and trouble of their own and struggling to breathe makes you think about what is life about really
<START> if you're a a fan of either or both chuck norris <UNK> mills then this is the movie to see it has a lot of adventure in it it is a great follow up to <UNK> man the chemistry between the main three stars chuck norris <UNK> mills jennifer <UNK> is incredible my personal opinion this movie along with the original has turned out so well that the networks should consider turning it into a regular series if you've seen <UNK> man i recommend this movie for you if you've seen <UNK> man a line in the sand but you haven't seen <UNK> man then let me suggest that you do you will not be disappointed with either one
<START> this is one of the most guilty pleasure movies ever br br i am embarrassed to say that my favorite character is <UNK> but still enjoy watching her make her space outfit like super cool with a like totally <UNK> belt and stick on <UNK> on her face br br but anyways the movie is actually one of the few family movies that holds your interest i know that the <UNK> drags <UNK> if you know what is going to happen but the second half is probably one of the most nerve <UNK> segments in a family film br br i wouldn't stand up in front of millions of people and <UNK> to love this movie in fact renting it is pretty embarrassing itself but i'll admit it here with the internet to hide behind br br
<START> it was originally meant to be a film that gene kelly would star in but when the makers couldn't get him they got the greatest actor in the world and the result is pretty good basically nathan detroit frank sinatra is having trouble doing what he does best setting up a high stakes crap <UNK> game because he needs 1000 to get the place so to get the money he needs he has a 1000 bet with old friend sky masterson marlon brando that he can't get sergeant sarah brown great <UNK> golden globe winning and <UNK> nominated jean simmons to go with him to <UNK> meanwhile nathan is having trouble trying to get rid of the woman who wants him to ask her hand in marriage miss <UNK> vivian <UNK> also starring robert keith as lieutenant <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as nicely nicely johnson and b s <UNK> as big <UNK> an interesting romantic comedy musical with brando singing all his own songs and sinatra being smooth and cool it was nominated the oscars for best art direction set decoration best cinematography best costume design and best music for jay <UNK> and <UNK> j <UNK> it was nominated the <UNK> for best film from any source and it won the golden globe for best motion picture musical comedy frank sinatra was number <UNK> on the 100 greatest pop culture icons marlon brando was number 30 on the 100 greatest movie stars he was number 11 on the 100 greatest sex symbols he was number 4 on 100 years 100 stars men sinatra was number 35 and brando was number 1 on the world's greatest actor luck be a lady was number <UNK> on 100 years 100 songs for the film was number 23 on 100 years of musicals and it was number <UNK> on the 100 greatest musicals very good
<START> <UNK> slight spoilers ahead i got this tape from my local library which keeps a copy for obvious reasons br br i once went to the town of <UNK> west virginia and in a little museum there i saw the schedule for the town theatre <UNK> may 1954 movies would change at the theatre each day as there would be no tv for another decade or so in those parts this was much of the available entertainment in the town the raid seems to have been made for towns like <UNK> in the 1950's although it wasn't listed for that month i am sure showed there some monday or <UNK> night for an audience which probably wasn't too demanding the historical raid daring and remarkably successful didn't seem to have been very well <UNK> so the movie is full of hollywood <UNK> including a loose cannon played by lee marvin marvin uses the opportunity to practice being liberty <UNK> and st <UNK> seems to have had more <UNK> soldiers coming and going through the town than washington d c had br br what really made me <UNK> was when the <UNK> change into their <UNK> uniforms only in tacky civil war paintings do rebel uniforms look so <UNK> when anne <UNK> son catches van <UNK> in his uniform just before the raid i expected the boy to think it was halloween br br and then there's anne <UNK> herself while watching the movie i actually looked on the imdb to see if there was a second anne <UNK> the then studio contract actress looks nothing like in her later films and has none of the presence she would later have in the miracle worker <UNK> of god and of course the graduate br br worth seeing if only 1 you live in st <UNK> and 2 you have a couple hours to kill on a hollywood <UNK> of your home town's biggest news story
<START> a classic series that should be at least repeated or released on dvd billy <UNK> after <UNK> he is adopted after the death of his parents <UNK> on a journey to find his real parents after various <UNK> of passage his search <UNK> in the discovery that his fathers identity was stolen and used by a human <UNK> in europe if i remember correctly the series ends on the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and a cliff top chase resulting in the death of <UNK> fathers <UNK> this series was all filmed on location in various <UNK> round europe and appeared polished and incredibly well made with some episodes crossing into the <UNK> of film noir and crime thriller the main arc was often <UNK> by the <UNK> of life that billy went through during his years of <UNK> to find his mother and fathers secrets a class act but underrated and forgotten
<START> this movie is a mess i'm surprised it even has a theatrical release without robin williams it would have gone straight to video it is poorly written it is poorly directed it's worse offense is that it has taken an interesting topic and reduced it to a ridiculous and boring thriller that has no thrills and no suspense and no inner or emotional logic especially after the first half hour the movie <UNK> into a series of ridiculous set pieces that are so over the top that the audience i saw it with was laughing at it save your money the trailer is totally misleading it is not suspenseful and there are no thrills in fact the movie's truly worst offense is that it is simply boring
<START> this movie is great br br now i do tend to like my films heavy on the story and dialogue but now and then something like <UNK> comes along and it's watchable despite numerous flaws br br this film is no more than a highly entertaining michael jackson <UNK> beginning with <UNK> video set to <UNK> in the <UNK> a montage listing his achievements and bits and <UNK> from his career it goes through all the <UNK> of his life then crashes down into a really really entertaining segment which acts as a funny music video for <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> following the adventures of <UNK> as he runs from manic stop motion fans and finally dancing against a rabbit costume the stop motion isn't that bad as some would have you believe it's passable br br then we see the great video for <UNK> me <UNK> and straight into the main feature br br yes the plot is laughable very laughable we see michael walk out of a building then get shot at by thousands of troops then we hit flashback showing <UNK> and three children stumbling upon an underground <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> joe <UNK> is the <UNK> villain who has a plan to get every child in the world hooked on <UNK> no <UNK> are mentioned at an early age <UNK> and the little girl he is with get caught then chased <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the plot isn't really the important part we get two very cool sequences where <UNK> turns into a car then a robot spaceship thing and of course the amazing <UNK> <UNK> sequence br br it's a so so film but it is fantastic for anyone who likes <UNK> it has most of his greatest hits and some cool little bits and some quite good special effects the robot spaceship sequence in particular worth it especially seen as though you can pick it up for about a <UNK> on ebay it'll keep the kids quiet for a couple of hours as well as most 20 somethings who were kids when it was first released
<START> this is a great movie i did the play a while ago it had an extra <UNK> to it i loved vanessa williams as <UNK> and also jason alexander has a good voice it was great the setting were also very good except the fact that it is 2 hours and 50 minutes makes it pretty long overall i give it 8 5 stars they also added a few parts but it was still cool
<START> i found this a bit hard to follow to the extent that it seemed to <UNK> in the middle while i tried to make head or tail of who was fighting who and why one of the problems is the cultural language one here we have a chinese <UNK> japanese problem of which we know little and because we are simply reading english subtitles inevitably loose some of the subtleties another problem is that there seem to be just too many only half explained twists and <UNK> nevertheless it seems unlikely that there is a wholly bad <UNK> film and this certainly is not that plenty of stylish and bone <UNK> violence a window upon some less than <UNK> sexual goings on plus the family aspect all in all a decent ride but maybe checking out the storyline might actually be helpful before watching this one
<START> i've never seen many online movies in most of my life but if i'd pick any of them i'd pick <UNK> madness a clever reference to most movies like star <UNK> etc using a camera and wits of steel jason steele <UNK> the art of turning a normal image into a painting and then putting it all together with frame by frame animation to get a world inhabited by <UNK> the story begins at the middle <UNK> that for directors delight then the middle is at the beginning and so on when i first watched it i expected a <UNK> <UNK> look but jason like me loves looks so took every detail to the max although i don't recommend it for children or would anybody besides me like it but please search it up on the net its a short film look up film cow its style reminds me of south park but less violent 10 for the look 6 for the laughs and 6 for the story it all comes to a 10 10 good work br br jason steele i'm anxious to see the movie
<START> i saw this by accident one lazy summer afternoon it was playing on the family programming channel of hbo at first i was drawn in by what i thought was a disney animation but then after a few minutes i found myself searching for the remote so i could find the <UNK> <UNK> to find out what in the world was on my tv i have nothing against harvey f i enjoy him in many of his films but one thing he is not is a voice over artist sure he has one of the more unique voices in hollywood but it works only as a part of a bigger visual package <UNK> his voice to a cute duck made watching somewhat difficult as for the rest of the cast uninspired i suppose working on this film didn't appeal to the really good voice over talent out there br br so weak voice talent strong animation who was this film <UNK> gay adolescent <UNK> i don't get it is there really such a <UNK> of role models for young up and coming <UNK> that we must resort to animated <UNK> cute story and like the title this movie i found hard to love just like an ugly <UNK>
<START> it follows block heads and a <UNK> at <UNK> two films that are hard to top not that <UNK> at sea is a bad film it is the last good comedy unless one insists on <UNK> or another of the later films that laurel hardy made it's just that it is a toss off little film without the crazy destructive <UNK> of block heads or the astounding sight of <UNK> real personality in a <UNK> at <UNK> to <UNK> in at <UNK> minutes it is shorter than the other two films a bit but that actually is not a bad point for it it has just enough time to it to hit the right notes it's just not as special as the other two br br stan and ollie work in a factory that <UNK> <UNK> i suspect that there was a bit of chaplin influence in this sequence one recalls a similar <UNK> line incident in modern times only four years earlier <UNK> nerves finally snap and he goes on a rampage he goes home and naturally his roommate stan does not help stan has a music lesson with an eccentric professor on his <UNK> you've got it a <UNK> after beating up the poor professor ollie has problems with the incompetent janitor engineer ben <UNK> in a nice brief appearance and then faces his doctor jimmy <UNK> and his nerve <UNK> a balloon that <UNK> as you push air out of <UNK> stomach <UNK> <UNK> that it is a bad case of <UNK> and ollie needs a vacation with plenty of quiet and <UNK> milk they end up going to a ship but ollie and stan know nothing about <UNK> so they plan to sleep on the ship unfortunately the goat <UNK> the rope until it breaks and the ship <UNK> off also unfortunately on board is richard <UNK> an escaped dangerous criminal this is not going to be a peaceful vacation br br <UNK> at sea like a <UNK> could have been three shorts one at the factory one at the apartment and one on the boat each would have been a successful short and they all make a funny film but the <UNK> of the parts together shows there are some very amusing moments in the film the <UNK> of how <UNK> <UNK> causes various <UNK> with water <UNK> and <UNK> in the apartment the accidental remarks of building manager charlie hall when stan or ollie runs by him and asks for directions can you help me find the basement asks stan certainly you can't miss it it's <UNK> says hall who realizes what a stupid comment he just made and <UNK> <UNK> of his two hostage slaves he calls ollie <UNK> and stan <UNK> an <UNK> to the dean brothers of the st louis <UNK> teams of the 1930s see dan <UNK> the pride of st louis <UNK> has the boys cook him up some food and they make a <UNK> meal boot <UNK> for spaghetti for instance to get him sick to be <UNK> when he realizes what they have done he forces them to eat the meal themselves their reactions are brilliant br br <UNK> at sea is not on par with the top line of laurel hardy films but it is a good film on the whole and a good conclusion to the best years of their film career <UNK> 1940 when they were with hal roach in the immediate couple of years before it appeared the boys and roach had serious problems involving production costs our relations where stan was producer on the film artistic problems scenes from swiss miss were cut <UNK> and <UNK> arguments leading to ollie appearing with harry <UNK> in <UNK> stan and ollie hit back with the flying <UNK> <UNK> the production was not <UNK> but boris <UNK> at last a two picture deal of a <UNK> at <UNK> and <UNK> at sea <UNK> the arguments and problems and on a high note the boys left roach unfortunately they never found any subsequent film relationship with a producer as satisfactory as this had been
<START> incredible does it get any dumber than this not a chance the stupidity in this movie would shame even ed wood de palma and woo if the first part in the series had mediocre dialog and the second one had bad dialog then this one has <UNK> dialog amazing but this time the story has been <UNK> to the level of the dialog too in spite of the acting and the dialog i liked the first two films but cube zero will surely kill the franchise the utterly moronic plot so obviously <UNK> from the pen of a frustrated left <UNK> br br i sometimes wonder if such <UNK> even themselves realize just how anti democracy and pro <UNK> they are in this movie they obviously target the us  a democracy why don't they target korea iran <UNK> china <UNK> etc in anti military movies sure most of these places are hardly likely to produce a cube like this any time soon but that's beside the point it's obvious writers of garbage like this actually admire these kinds of <UNK> whether they are aware of it or not i would even go as far as to say that anyone who <UNK> attacks us foreign <UNK> all the time has anti <UNK> beliefs in his core br br back to the movie apart from being so far fetched that it isn't even funny any more the film has many obvious <UNK> for example for some reason the two men who <UNK> the cube have done it for a while and are oblivious to the pain and <UNK> that the project <UNK> yet the first one than the other suddenly turn against the system anyone who has any idea at all about human nature will see right through this idiocy or how about that <UNK> character the one eyed evil <UNK> who talks as if he's in a bad mel brooks comedy in fact as soon as this creature appears the movie loses all seriousness and hence any chance of being exciting it really does become a comedy
<START> in the sea of crap that hollywood and others continue to put out this is one of those <UNK> in the rough a small simple movie that is very entertaining and leaves you with the feeling that you didn't just waste an hour and a half of your life br br ashley judd is really quite amazing in this movie i had never really been a fan or had noticed her before but going back and seeing this early performance of hers convinced me she's extremely talented br br watching this film was an assignment in a college course for me so i was skeptical i would even care i thought oh boy some dumb <UNK> flick or feminist male bashing indie crap i was pleasantly surprised without <UNK> the many relevant themes i'll just say if you haven't seen it do yourself a favor and check it out sometimes the down to earth slice of life movies are the best and this is a great one
<START> so prom night was supposed to be a horror and thriller movie i'm a big <UNK> and was scared to see this movie at the beginning but upon seeing it it is neither horror or thriller br br i was basically making fun of the movie in my seat because it was so predictable you could predict what was going to happen next the young actors were alright at playing their characters but i'd have to say the killer was definitely at the top of the game acting wise br br yes i'll give props for the plot because it was good but it's not thrilling or scary there were almost zero jump in your seat scenes so don't waste ten dollars seeing it in theatres wait <UNK> it comes to dvd
<START> rather foolish attempt at a hitchcock type mystery thriller <UNK> <UNK> espionage for <UNK> and based on the robin cook novel incidentally <UNK> recently acquired another adaptation of his work â coma 1978 â in honor of the late richard widmark for the record director <UNK> had just made the boys from brazil 1978 â a similarly <UNK> but much more engrossing <UNK> and unfortunately <UNK> was a false step from which his so far impressive career would not recover br br despite its scope and reasonably decent cast however this one proved a critical and commercial flop â mainly because the narrative just <UNK> very thrilling in fact <UNK> quite dreary feeble attempts at horror â the <UNK> heroine having to put up with <UNK> rotting corpses <UNK> and even an attack by a <UNK> of bats â notwithstanding <UNK> anne down is the lovely leading lady stumbling upon a lost treasure â <UNK> actually been hidden away by a local <UNK> to prevent it from falling into the hands of <UNK> who have <UNK> much of the <UNK> <UNK> under the <UNK> of culture for far too long sir john gielgud turns up in a <UNK> bit early on as the <UNK> dealer who puts down on the way of the <UNK> and pays for this <UNK> of <UNK> with his life br br typically it <UNK> that some characters are the opposite of what they claim to be â so that apparent allies such as maurice <UNK> are eventually exposed as villains while an ambiguous figure frank <UNK> whom i saw at london in early 2007 in a west end performance of <UNK> <UNK> which has now been turned into a film goes from <UNK> antagonist to her lover and back again as he <UNK> to keep the wealth <UNK> to egyptian high priest <UNK> a national treasure
<START> this film is terrible every line is stolen from <UNK> the italian dubbed version at least if you like trash real trash give it a try but beware this ain't the so bad it's good kind of flick in its <UNK> it may really look like a porno but believe me if you're looking for snuff s m hardcore <UNK> or even an ordinary erotic thriller go find something else in store i'm telling you this 'cause the absolutely uninspired and unconvincing shooting acting plot dialogues the only good lines as i said before are the ones they stolen from joel <UNK> <UNK> will bore you to tears in a few minutes and the happy ending is absolutely revolting i'll give it one star a half for the sudden shot in the back scene after the eyes of the victim monologue stolen from <UNK> as well and a half for mom daughter's sexy bodies that didn't manage to keep me completely awake while watching this turkey anyway
<START> my wife and i watch a film every night with no <UNK> and mostly artsy films that require thought i have tons of patience for films that are slow to <UNK> my wife has double the attention span that i do all that being said this film is just plain empty and boring it went nowhere never <UNK> it started fairly strong with a promising plot then she <UNK> <UNK> goes to spain she <UNK> she stares the credits roll uneven full of holes false starts dead ends we <UNK> through several extended sequences of her just staring off into space artificial depth was implied when she played with the mud and cried <UNK> it's like a beautifully shot chick flick that's pretending to be deep or artsy you never get to know nor understand <UNK> at all about halfway through you just don't care anymore we just wanted to see at least one of the plot lines develop don't waste your time on this i'm shocked it scores so high
<START> breathtaking this is without doubt the best anime cartoon ever made i first saw castle in the sky in the late 80s as a child and it left a lasting impression years went by and i forgot the title of the film and only by chance <UNK> on the internet i found this masterpiece again after reading other peoples reviews and analysis i'm not surprised it has such acclaim and touched so many because it does leave an impression a true fantasy adventure a must see for all children and adults its best not giving the story away so i would say watch this movie will a clear and open mind if you have kids treat them to this i promise you they will love it there's not much to say about this piece of art but if you've not seen it watch it and enjoy
<START> origins of the care bears their cousins if you saw the original film you'll notice a <UNK> the cousins are raised with the care bears rather than meeting them later however i have no problems with that <UNK> to treat the films as separate interpretations the babies are adorable and it's fun watching them play and grow my favourite is swift heart rabbit the villain is a delightfully menacing <UNK> i could <UNK> with the three children since i was never good at sports either <UNK> summer is excellent as christy the songs are sweet and memorable if you have an open heart love the toys or enjoyed the original this is not to be missed 9 10
<START> i'd never heard of this movie but boy was i surprised when i caught it on tv great cast great acting excellent movie how can a movie with william h macy <UNK> campbell and donald sutherland go wrong i wonder why i never heard of it before
<START> if you hit your head with a <UNK> write the script with your feet you may come close to the intelligence level of this movie there is nothing in this movie that hasn't been done a thousand times in other gangster flicks and done much better those who think scarface was some kind of hero to be looked up to or saw <UNK> menace ii society or dead <UNK> and thought <UNK> that's the life for me will like this movie i thought i'd give the movie a chance since the premise was perfect for a prequel i should have known better after seeing mario van <UNK> and sean combs were involved anyone above a 4th grade education see the original with pacino a real actor and be satisfied
<START> i just found the imdb and searched this film and i was moved almost to tears by the comments of all the people who saw this film as i did when 6 or so years old in 1967 i saw it before the jungle book so i was eagle boy for a few hours and then <UNK> for the next year i burst into tears at the cinema when the boy turned into the eagle and always wanted to see the film again when we got home we had a <UNK> chicken dinner and i got the wish bone and guess who i wished to be my dad then said 'i bet you wished to be an <UNK> and of course we all know that wishes are broken if someone <UNK> so more tears and a little <UNK> to this day for not being able to fly away
<START> <UNK> was an amazing year for charlie chaplin it was his first year in films and he appeared in more than 30 films while most of these films weren't particularly good they did give him a chance to slowly <UNK> his screen persona however by this film the familiar little tramp character was still in development sure charlie looked the part but his character still lacked the <UNK> and decency that he later developed instead chaplin often hit kicked or did other nasty things to people for seemingly no reason at all br br as for this very slight film it is interesting to watch for the cast while they are not familiar today chaplin stars along with mabel <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and mack <UNK> all exceptionally popular stars with <UNK> films the problem with this film is that while it has a few nice scenes the plot seems very vague and <UNK> developed <UNK> and mabel got to the race track a very common theme in <UNK> productions it must have been located near a race track charlie and mack show up and sneak in mack is chased by the police for doing this while charlie <UNK> <UNK> around and steals his girl in the end for no apparent reason the cops take <UNK> and mack away leaving charlie with mabel who oddly didn't seem put off by charlie's <UNK> <UNK> br br unless you are a huge silent comedy buff or film <UNK> this is a very forgettable film that is only important in the evolution of chaplin what he and the other actors actually do on stage while not unusual for a <UNK> film isn't particularly funny when seen today
<START> in all of low budget history this movie has to be one of the worst true <UNK> are some humorous sides to the movie but in general it was just plain awful i just can't understand what person could not out run a bunch of slugs i mean they have to be one of the <UNK> creatures on the planet the only part worth while in this movie is the close up of a slugs attempt to bite the finger of a man this was rather amusing
<START> i saw this on dvd it s known as corrupt in this format and the <UNK> on the <UNK> really hyped up how harvey keitel s character frank is so much like the one he played bad lieutenant in this gritty and powerful police thriller what the <UNK> <UNK> t mention was that this is an old italian movie how old is it theo well when a character plays music he <UNK> t put on the cd player he pulls out a big plastic <UNK> thing puts it on a sort of revolving <UNK> where a sort of mechanical arm touches the <UNK> <UNK> causing music to be heard you see my point about this being an old film the dvd case gave no clue this was a movie made 20 years ago it s also a film with poor production values like so many other italian films <UNK> as american ones with the exception of keitel the cast are awful though johnny rotten s performance is bizarre rather than terrible the cinematography is static with the picture and sound quality giving the impression that i was watching a fourth generation pirate copy i don t know if it s down to a dodgy dvd or if it s a very bad film print and worst of all is <UNK> <UNK> s score it s impossible to <UNK> the man who did the irritating <UNK> incidental music for corrupt is the same one who did the music for those clint eastwood westerns br br all of this is a pity because corrupt does have its moments it s by no means the greatest psycho thriller ever <UNK> but it did hold my interest and as always keitel puts in a good performance as a violent <UNK> cop just a pity the rest of the movie <UNK> t match up to his high standards
<START> i really liked this <UNK> due to the look of the <UNK> the <UNK> and just the look overall was interesting to me for some reason anyways this could have been one of the best <UNK> ever if the <UNK> didn't have lex <UNK> in the main event against <UNK> now for it's time it was ok to have a huge fat man vs a strong man but i'm glad times have changed it was a terrible main event just like every match <UNK> is in is terrible other matches on the card were razor <UNK> vs ted <UNK> <UNK> brothers vs heavenly bodies shawn michaels vs <UNK> <UNK> this was the event where shawn named his big monster of a body guard <UNK> irs vs 1 2 3 kid <UNK> hart first takes on <UNK> then takes on jerry <UNK> and stuff with the <UNK> and <UNK> was always very interesting then <UNK> <UNK> destroyed marty <UNK> undertaker took on giant <UNK> in another terrible match the smoking <UNK> and <UNK> took on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the world title against lex <UNK> this match was boring and it has a terrible ending however it deserves 8 10
<START> this movie was excellent i was not expecting it to live up to all the hype but it did like all the bourne movies the action is fast paced realistic and intense if you liked the other two movies in the trilogy you will love this one also the movie's plot is straightforward and there are no plot twists that are too unrealistic ok julia stiles character showing up in the italian safe house was kind of far fetched especially after what happened in supremacy but it makes sense that she is the only character in <UNK> that bourne knows that does not want him dead and he could possibly trust and the only person to lead him in the right direction the action is driven by characters and their reactions to what is happening all around them the thing that i always loved about the bourne movies is that bourne can kick butt but when matched with people as good as he is the fights are struggles and he takes a lot of damage in them they never treat the audience like idiots br br all the actors were solid in their performances i believe that damon could play bourne in his sleep and receives excellent support from joan allen <UNK> her role from supremacy david <UNK> and scott glenn i recommend this film and the trilogy i do miss <UNK> <UNK> though
<START> first time of seeing buster keaton's first feature film and i have to admit i liked it a lot and only wish i'd stumbled across it years ago the <UNK> <UNK> at the start warns that the three ages single <UNK> print was <UNK> and <UNK> in 1954 just in time before <UNK> and many frames that seemed hopelessly glued together were separated so it's rocky viewing in places but i've seen and survived much worse br br it would have been ok as the 3 short films but as a take on <UNK> it's inventive and funny from the start to the finish in the stone age with baddie wallace <UNK> riding an elephant and <UNK> buster riding a pet <UNK> in the roman age buster riding a <UNK> with wheel locks and adapted for <UNK> no parking signs in latin in this technological age of speed need and greed his car beautifully falls to bits at the first <UNK> both him and <UNK> are after the girl through the ages a never ending <UNK> favourite bit as the <UNK> he gets knocked <UNK> over a cliff edge but still blows a kiss to the camera an amazing second or two br br great stuff <UNK> my love of silent film comedy
<START> to quote the film it's better not to know better still to forget best of all to be abandoned oh the irony br br a ghost story with all the technical <UNK> of a hollywood horror film but <UNK> bad dialogue after the first quarter of the film and you feel like you're being <UNK> to from the start br br it's as if the <UNK> <UNK> character dialogue can be summed up by bad cop tv and a jerry springer show fitting maybe for a film like the <UNK> not a russia set horror film the result is that a potentially great setting and some potentially great gore scenes go to waste and become just silly not scary or meaningful
<START> zombie bloodbath is a movie made by zombie fans for zombie fans with a true love of the horror genre as i understand it from the commentary and things i have read it was made during the huge <UNK> <UNK> of 1993 when half of <UNK> was underwater buildings were under water cars and houses were underwater one article said that zombies and the crew from this movie would help <UNK> the river after shooting each day the fact this movie got made at all is a miracle it is like a huge <UNK> of every zombie movie ever made put through a troma <UNK> it is a party movie to enjoy with friends who like loads of splatter and goofy characters and it is fast paced and energetic and really funny br br a toxic <UNK> accident in a nuclear power facility causes people to melt down or turn into zombies the local government covers it up tears down the factory and builds houses over it some ground shifting causes a cave opening to develop and some new residents find the cave and <UNK> the undead on the newly built community from there it just gets crazy and gory and fun br br i have read these reviews on here a few times and it seems obvious to me that the same person attacked this fun little movie three times as a different reviewer using fake names they use the same words and sentences zombie bloodbath is cheap it is raw it has some bad acting so does half the movies made there is much much worse out there than this fun movie if you hate this film so much don't buy it there is no need for personal attacks and to call the crew or cast trailer trash and it is obvious you are not from australia or england it is just <UNK> that this great service the imdb does not catch people using it just to trash others there are bad reviews and good reviews and i don't mind those i give both bad and good reviews myself but it is painfully obvious that some fool just wants to use this forum to personally attack the director of this movie sad br br some of these so called reviewers even basically sue their review just to promote their own movies one called this film boring well love it or hate it one thing you can never say about this film is that it is boring it moves fast and never has a dull spot br br oh and this reviewer from the <UNK> um liar you tried to post this same review at amazon and it got <UNK> there the same review only it said it was from <UNK> br br this nonsense has to stop love it or hate it give it a real review or type nothing it is obvious you have not seen the films br br but for the record i have and though this one is not nearly the best that i have seen it is far from the worst and even the worst i would give an actual <UNK> and would not attack the director personally br br hope this review helps some people see through the stupidity going on here
<START> this film was on last week and although at that time of the day around <UNK> the quality of the movies is almost never good at least here on mexican tv i couldn't switch the tv off the story about <UNK> moore really touches you she doesn't come across as a very sympathetic character at first but seeing the whole film you just want her so succeed this film really leaves you thinking and i think that basically due to the great acting of brooke johnson i had never heard of her before nor <UNK> seen her in another film but this was great great acting <UNK> to brooke i hope to see her in another film soon
<START> i sincerely consider this movie as another poor effort of <UNK> movie industry the first 30 minutes of the movie are a little funny but then when they switch their role in the society men doing what women usually do and women doing what men usually do the movie falls becoming boring and not funny at all they let many things without explanation and the end of the movie is predictable i didn't like the way as a <UNK> angel played his character and his little either i went to the movies theater hoping to see a good work but i went out really disappointed br br i don't recommend this movie
<START> first i would like to say how great this it is astounding and sometimes shocking and to say the least i'm 11 years old and this is my favorite movie i can definitely stand a boring film but this is anything but boring it is like a trip through humanity its stark realism shows through this monumental masterpiece it is a heart wrenching tale of two down and <UNK> voight and hoffman who build a mutual friendship joe buck voight a naive <UNK> stud comes to new york to make it rich by entertaining women soon he meets rico <UNK> rizzo hoffman who is a poor man barely being able to pay rent ratso becomes <UNK> <UNK> but soon both men can't find joe a job which results in stealing food as they try and survive on the streets of new york we realize how tough it is they can't get joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party joe makes some money and soon joe takes ratso on a <UNK> dream spot florida the final five minutes are heart breaking yet some of the greatest moments in the film from midnight cowboy we get a stark and sometimes disturbing urban view on life
<START> a best selling book about honour killings in jordan is <UNK> by its <UNK> after <UNK> surface that the story has been <UNK> associated with other <UNK> of its author's past as a con woman a few years later she <UNK> <UNK> that she took a certain amount of dramatic <UNK> but willing to <UNK> with a film maker to prove the substance of her <UNK> what follows is a fascinating insight into a <UNK> personality someone who's behaviour on one had makes no sense unless what she is saying is true yet who is seemingly incapable of saying anything that is not astonishingly dramatic but <UNK> at best and most often <UNK> false it's almost impossible to imagine what ms <UNK> hoped to gain by appearing in this film <UNK> celebrity all she does achieve is to project a certain image of herself as a deeply damaged individual and even that cannot be taken at face value director anna <UNK> appears increasingly on camera as her film progresses and increasingly <UNK> to boot but she is finally rewarded with a remarkable although scary and disturbing tale to tell and one of those films that reminds us what a thoroughly weird world it is we live in
<START> i have never seen such terrible performances in all my life br br everyone in the entire film was absolute rubbish br br not one decent actor actress in the whole film it was a joke br br reminded me of drama at school
<START> even though there are no new episodes and it is rarely showed i used to love the magic of sabrina and the teenage witch i never got to see the last episodes but i do want to know what happened to miles or josh and why did the aunts have to disappear out of the show for good i'm sure the ending went to be perfect but there are a lot of questions unanswered and i want to see the last episode of s t t w because i heard she decides between <UNK> and harvey on her wedding day i really hope that she picks harvey and may i say <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> too bad hes too old for me though melissa joan hart has her own sense of <UNK> that she adds to the show but there are many little stupid things for the show such as how famous bands come out of nowhere and play songs and all the cast is listening its kind of stupid plus the cat starts to really get lame as the show continued the jokes began just to get stupid and the things that the audio controlled audience would laugh at i would think it was so lame don't get me wrong at some parts it was funny but i think the show just kind of lost its magic so to speak as the show went on i give kudos to all the cast though for trying although that <UNK> moon frye girl had no taste and she was a horrid actress i wonder what melissa or any of the cast is doing now for that matter now that the show has ended
<START> <UNK> by the terrible lie on the cover fun as american pie my girlfriend and i sat in front of the tv waiting for a comedy and this is definitely not one you probably won't laugh one time if you're not one of those jackass like ever <UNK> minds it's not even an erotic movie which would at least been something given that it's about sex br br so what is this the <UNK> plot deals with a guy who wants to lose virginity zero in originality i remember losing it for one and his gang of friends the rest of the characters i e the girls just come and go for no credible reason come on there are even <UNK> so simple <UNK> are fun ho ho the acting is very tv like as is the video look throughout the movie and definitely amateur in the case of most of the girls br br awful movie amateurish badly produced and over all not funny kids and teens will love to watch it with friends because of the swearing and sex jokes other than that don't even think of renting this movie
<START> this is an excellent film tom hanks and paul newman performed great i was really surprised when newman was beating on his son that was a great scene and the shooting scenes were staged good i was very surprised about the end rent this film today as it is one of tom <UNK> best
<START> the sopranos now preparing to end is the very peak of adult television and drama when the sopranos hits the mark it really hits the mark using great writing and great actors most of them being extras from <UNK> the series is <UNK> to progress in a <UNK> unpredictable and exceptional way heading up the cast is james gandolfini who for all <UNK> purposes is tony soprano and edie <UNK> who certainly holds her own the series also boasts a great collection of <UNK> to push the plot along by any means necessary usually violence and foul language tony <UNK> michael <UNK> and steve van <UNK> are great secondary characters that make every episode more interesting <UNK> extras are also worth note including names like steve <UNK> great joe <UNK> great david <UNK> good robert patrick robert <UNK> and frank vincent br br the sopranos is a great family drama and a realistic interpretation of modern day mafia societies that despite the rare bad story lines manages to be unique tv symbolism and simple story lines dreams and shoot outs and many other things create <UNK> stories and relationships that at the end of each season are resolved to create yet another perfect hbo package watch it
<START> i watched this movie when joe bob <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> even he couldn't make this movie enjoyable the only reason i watched it until the end is because i teach video production and i wanted to make sure my students never made anything this bad but it took all my <UNK> <UNK> to sit through it though it's like watching your great grandmother <UNK> with a 15 year old boy excruciatingly painful br br if you took the actual film <UNK> it in paint thinner then watched it it would be more entertaining seriously br br if you see this movie in the <UNK> bin at s mart back away from it as if it were a <UNK>
<START> a haunting piece that the <UNK> horror film fan will fall upon with <UNK> keep your <UNK> and your <UNK> this film is in the same company as the haunting the original lyrical and truthful it stays with you long into the night much like those terrifying cbs radio mystery theatre shows a smart rent
<START> this movie features two of my favorite actors in kilmer and downey it also boasts the always enjoyable larry miller in a too small part despite this i found it to be nearly unwatchable michelle <UNK> may be pretty but she is nearly charisma free and the reasons for <UNK> character's obsession with her character is not at all understandable in terms of the information the film presents or the way it's portrayed the ending seems pretentious and though the intention seems to be that the audience should join in the nod and <UNK> the film having failed to bring us in on the side of its protagonists leaves us unwilling or unable to do so br br fans of the film say that those who disagree simply don't get it i don't think this is so the plot was not complicated or beyond understanding it was simply <UNK> and clumsily and obviously <UNK> i got it i just didn't like it <UNK> <UNK> i went down and guy <UNK> snatch and lock stock and two smoking <UNK> are much better realized examples of the kind of film making that director <UNK> black fails to achieve br br i share a birthday with <UNK> black but a look at his credits mostly as a screenwriter makes me want to <UNK> myself from any other connection
<START> the premise of cabin fever starts like it might have something to offer a group of college teens after <UNK> in the fall goes to a resort cabin in the woods where one by one they are attacked by an unseen flesh eating virus br br unfortunately the first paragraph is where any remote elements of film quality stop cabin fever is little more than college kids looking for sex booze talking non stop about nothing and seeing how many f bombs they can get into 1 40 minutes or however long this mess is br br the kids act and react <UNK> to everything around them one of them for instance discovers that the skin virus has infected her legs so what does she do she keeps <UNK> her legs failing to take proper medical attention for her wounds the scene is little more than a gross out in another scene rider strong from boy meets world gets bitten on the hand by some kid who only says <UNK> and likes to do karate kicks on those who sit next to him if you can figure out the reason for why the <UNK> kid was included i'd love to know anyway rider pets a wild dog and goes off to wash his bitten hand in a most likely <UNK> creek another kid likes to drop f bombs in <UNK> to everything around him and shoot <UNK> why your guess is as good as mine br br rider strong is the only kid with any recognition in this movie he tries to calm people down in between the yelling and screaming and f y bombs that people are throwing around when the kids aren't yelling they are having or talking about sex or talking nonsense to the other adult characters who are even more if that is possible idiotic than the kids the idiot cop with an iq of 60 at best may be one of the worst acting jobs i have ever seen in a movie you talk about people not playing with a full deck this <UNK> doesn't even know how to find the cards lol i was like will you please shut up already he makes the kid actors look like geniuses the only part that i sort of liked was <UNK> scary story although gory about the deranged <UNK> alley guy in interviews rider said that he had a great deal of respect for director eli roth but the problem is that mr roth appears to be going for little more than shock and gore there are far too many bad things about this movie for mr roth to get any credit i wish i could agree with rider and find something likable about this movie maybe the fall scenery in the beginning actually rider strong just saves this movie from being a 1 hopefully he was <UNK> for this junk
<START> i sat down to watch a documentary about puerto rico and i ended up watching one about <UNK> when i go to puerto rico i fail to see the 50 that live in poverty when i do see struggling people they are usually <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> that have recently arrived to the island there is no such thing as <UNK> either you speak spanish or you don't and from what i heard you don't <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is not <UNK> to me <UNK> was a great man <UNK> is a great man to those that want independence which is 1 to the rest he as <UNK> as <UNK> bin laden <UNK> that want independence are a bunch of fools if you want any proof to all of you <UNK> of an independent puerto rico see cuba <UNK> <UNK> republic <UNK> all of south and central america and mexico its worked wonders for them this documentary is not about puerto rico this documentary was about the <UNK> and their struggles br br to the person that complaint that not enough of africa was on the show it was suppose to be about puerto rico not africa denzel will make one shortly just for you br br in conclusion to all those ignorant white people that think we need green cards to come to the us and want to learn how the prime minister runs things this is not a good documentary about <UNK> culture tell your kids to pay attention in <UNK> and history class br br update br br <UNK> doc was about <UNK> she promoted it as if its how we all feel should have been titled <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> can't speak spanish please stop using puerto rico <UNK> <UNK> or anything else associated with <UNK> with this <UNK> historical lesson god <UNK> they play this on the island
<START> <UNK> to <UNK> there was a lot of confusion going on first off how do you know which movie you are <UNK> henry <UNK> stars in every one of them i bought this movie thinking it was the miniseries what a letdown it would have been a comedy but for the young girl being raped david <UNK> spelling is ok for popcorn tv but he was not believable in this film where was his english accent and what's with the love story the movie was supposed to be about a young man's rise to military power not the slave ship captain getting <UNK> with the english maiden looking for her daddy br br if i had paid more than 7 for this movie i would have to call the police because that would be a crime
<START> i picked this movie on the cover alone thinking that i was in for an adventure to the level of indiana jones and the temple of doom unfortunately i was in for a virtual yawn not like any yawn i have had before though this yawn was so large that i could barely find anything of quality in this movie the cover described amazing special effects there were none the movie was so lightweight that even the stereotypes were awfully portrayed it does give the idea that you can solve problems with violence good if you want to teach your kids that i don't keep away from this one if you are looking for family entertainment then you might find something that is more inspiring elsewhere
<START> i didn't expect much from this but i have to admit i was rolling on the ground laughing a few times during this film if you are not grossly offended in the first ten minutes this might be a film for you <UNK> if you are the type that would enjoy watching amanda <UNK> <UNK> cards for an hour and a half it's certainly not a <UNK> work of comedy but given the low budget <UNK> <UNK> this is masterful to level the playing field for comparison imagine all of the studio films with their budgets <UNK> by a factor of 100 or so and see what you get kudos to peter cohen and his network for seeing this through i look forward to his next effort
<START> i was very disappointed in this movie <UNK> it was weak <UNK> on silly souls who can affect reality in the way they do a mission apparently critical to the soul hunters <UNK> to one of their younger members and the whole b story with the <UNK> and the <UNK> against the station was so awful that at one point i <UNK> out to the television why are you wasting my time with this br br <UNK> river of souls didn't really go into the question of the soul in any more depth than the original episode soul hunter did we see that soul hunters can make mistakes but we still don't get a feeling for their culture are there any female soul hunters br br the acting was okay given the material they had to work with and the special effects especially the <UNK> in the first act were very impressive but overall i'd say give this one a miss
<START> just when i thought i would finish a whole year without giving a single movie a bomb rating a friend brought this notorious turd to my house last night i feared the worst knowing its reputation and it was as god awful as i'd anticipated this is a mexican made mess dubbed into english and produced by k gordon murray it's got terrible sets and effects and features a rather frightening santa who doesn't operate at the north pole but instead from a cloud in outer space and who doesn't have little <UNK> helping him make his toys but rather all different groups of children from practically every country there is the opening sequence where st nick chuckles <UNK> as he <UNK> <UNK> showing all these <UNK> working hard while singing terrible holiday songs in a variety of languages seems to go on forever and with no story obviously this santa claus doesn't observe the child labor laws br br eventually we get some nasty and <UNK> red suited apprentice of the devil himself traveling from hell to earth just to make little kids naughty and turn <UNK> christmas eve rounds into a nightmare watching this movie is a <UNK> and twisted experience and it's bound to <UNK> little children and turn them off santa claus and the holidays forever oddly the name of jesus christ is mentioned often in this christmas film which somehow makes it all the <UNK> in the context of all the bizarre things that are going on this easily makes my personal list of the worst movie i've ever seen but i'm sure that's nothing unique
<START> when great director actor <UNK> are talked about the team of j lee thompson and charles bronson is not usually mentioned probably because the <UNK> of nine joint <UNK> between the two of them runs the gamut from the really good action entertainment to the mediocre unfortunately <UNK> forbidden subjects falls in the latter br br that's sad because <UNK> could have been a whole lot better but for the life of me i don't understand why it was necessary to make the father of the missing japanese girl a guy used to getting some cheap <UNK> because the romance in his marriage has run out that might have been good for another film altogether but it served no purpose here br br a straightforward cop drama with charles bronson as a vice cop who's seen a bit too much in his line of work and has a strong prejudice against <UNK> that part could also have used a little explaining as well but he's going to have to overcome it if he and patient partner perry lopez are going to locate a captured japanese school girl br br <UNK> time in the vice squad have told him exactly where to look for the <UNK> a stylish murderous <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> is the guy and he and bronson have some history in fact in the film's best scene bronson made him eat an expensive <UNK> watch and set his car on fire br br at one point <UNK> happens to spot bronson and lopez in an all night <UNK> and this being after his <UNK> <UNK> he <UNK> the place with an <UNK> killing everyone but bronson and lopez i really think that little incident would have had more than a couple vice cops from the <UNK> after <UNK> but that's another terribly big hole in the plot br br still there is a very rough justice in the end for <UNK> i wish the whole film had been better though this was the last film of the bronson thompson team and j lee <UNK> last as a director he should have gone out with something better
<START> the box for to die for <UNK> me in a <UNK> hunky guy and the promise of some laughs and sex there was plenty of thomas <UNK> simon who's easy on the eyes but no laughs and little <UNK> br br the couple mark and simon have allegedly been together several years but neither character is interesting enough to care about so it's hard to imagine that they care about each other the fault seems to lie in the script not the performances both actors do the best they can with what they're given br br the ending is sappy and <UNK> well not totally <UNK> i felt relief that it was over br br if you're looking for a movie about gay relationships and aids that's funny <UNK> <UNK> is far better
<START> this film aka the four hundred blows is a <UNK> <UNK> les 400 <UNK> means to live a wild life as a french i'm stunned when i see the popularity of this good but by no means outstanding film 1 it's not the first film of the <UNK> vague move check <UNK> <UNK> la <UNK> <UNK> 1956 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1958 claude <UNK> le beau <UNK> 1958 are <UNK> historically les 400 <UNK> comes after 2 the <UNK> vague was sometimes <UNK> and hard on their predecessors overnight <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> george <UNK> claude <UNK> lara <UNK> <UNK> and a lot of others were doomed to oblivion this <UNK> and this contempt is typically <UNK> vague you <UNK> never heard or read the great generation of the thirties <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> already <UNK> laugh at say maurice <UNK> or max <UNK> so thanks to <UNK> and co some people will never discover some gems of the french fifties or forties <UNK> <UNK> le <UNK> de paris <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jolie <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> vague <UNK> went as far as saying that william <UNK> georges stevens and fred <UNK> were worthless 3 les 400 <UNK> is technically rather disappointing it's very academic the story is as linear as it can be the teachers are caricatures and the mother claire <UNK> delivers such memorable lines as you've got to be a french circa 1960 to understand how ridiculous it is well your father 's got only his <UNK> junior school <UNK> and as for me i've got only my high school <UNK> you've got to know that circa 1960 hardly 10 of the <UNK> had the <UNK> in france <UNK> <UNK> should have been proud of his mother after all she wants him to have <UNK> who can blame her 4 compared to the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which features a brand new form and a new <UNK> content les 400 <UNK> <UNK> into significance <UNK> will master a new form only with the highly superior jules and jim helped by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 5 the interpretation is rather stiff jean pierre <UNK> arguably <UNK> when dubbed in english is still decent but he will soon <UNK> into the most affected of his generation 6 the topic stolen childhood had better days before <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> luis <UNK> los <UNK> and will have after maurice <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kenneth <UNK> <UNK> i do not want to <UNK> <UNK> his movie is not bad but frankly french movie buffs prefer jules and jim <UNK> <UNK> a film honest true and <UNK> <UNK> to a fault <UNK> de <UNK> as academic as 400 <UNK> but much more funny or his nice hitchcock <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br
<START> we saw this at one of the local art movie theaters in the <UNK> area of <UNK> <UNK> it was a total surprise compared to the write up in the <UNK> <UNK> but we were both blown away by the artistry it was beautifully done and apparently photographed in a <UNK> german name for <UNK> somewhere in the <UNK> area it is a very explicit exploration of the sexual relationships of a group of <UNK> men and women isolated from the day to day constraints it is fantastic on more levels than i can remember we came home after the movie and talked and talked until about 4 am the next morning br br the version we saw was in english mostly so there must be at least two versions since the first reviewer saw the movie in probably its original german version i searched and searched for a video tape version but never came up with anything would absolutely love to have a vhs or dvd version of this it explores relationships at a fundamental level and is also a great <UNK> on how to relate to your partner if anyone knows the writer director please convince him to release again preferably on dvd these days i cannot even imagine getting tired of watching the <UNK> performance of the actors who are now probably all in their forties please please bring it back
<START> i just got this video used and i was watching it last night the acting started out extremely bad hey hey <UNK> but got very good soon after <UNK> the <UNK> looked extremely fake and many of the cgi effects were very dodgy but the scene with the house cracking apart and the <UNK> inside being blown around and sucked out were extremely well done and just about on par with movies like <UNK> the scenes of <UNK> were also extremely well done too the story was very well written and it's refreshing to see a movie like this stray away from the same old disaster <UNK> movies of this genre seems to have been stuck in for 30 years br br while this movie had a very weird mix of fx and acting quality this merits an a in my book
<START> i have seen several comments here about brando using a southern accent some of which felt it was a mistake when this movie was made racism and <UNK> were very strong in the south the jim crow laws were still in effect civil rights was in it's <UNK> could this have possibly been a subtle social commentary a southern man in love with a woman of another race the same way mash was a subtle criticism of the <UNK> <UNK> war any thoughts br br another comment was made about <UNK> <UNK> appearing cold anyone who has been in japan would understand the japanese people at least in my experience did not tend to show emotion in front of strangers there were strict social rules especially for men meeting single women americans in japan were totally foreign to this culture and the blunt attempts to meet women were shocking to the ladies one <UNK> of the japanese was to smile when embarrassed or uncomfortable which many american <UNK> took as a sign that their advances were welcomed also remember that at the time represented in the movie japan had just been defeated and the <UNK> forces were treated with reluctant acceptance i think <UNK> <UNK> gave a very credible performance of what her situation would have been watching her interaction with the american actors brought back several memories of my own experiences in the country i was able to meet a pair of lovely young ladies who after i convinced them i was not the typical american male taught me their language and their culture during my time in their country
<START> as a big fan of gorilla movies in general i anticipated that this one would be great and as for the gorilla effects they were quite good however that is the only thing i can write about this flop the film claims to be based on a true story but in effect it does not even come close to what actually happened to buddy who in real life was the famous <UNK> sold to <UNK> bros by our supposed heroic <UNK> <UNK> known by many animal <UNK> as a woman who hardly had her <UNK> <UNK> in the best interest as far as buddy being portrayed as becoming aggressive this was total fiction and at no time did the gorilla in real life resort to such behavior buddy did in fact escape his wooden <UNK> not a <UNK> cage room as depicted in movie during a storm to seek shelter and comfort in the house which frightened <UNK> <UNK> into selling him no buddy was not released into a gorilla family surrounded by lush trees in a <UNK> paradise he was abandoned in a wooden <UNK> deep in the back of a garage for some time with only a single light <UNK> for comfort and then sold to the circus where he actually lived a better life having <UNK> thrown at him until he died historically the oldest living gorilla on record by the way before a show in miami notice also in the film how buddy grows older but the <UNK> never age the <UNK> by the way were not raised simultaneously with other animals including buddy as portrayed in the film
<START> like last year i didn't manage to sit through the whole thing okay so chris rock as a host was a good choice because he was vaguely engaging or rather out of all the total <UNK> packed into the theatre he at least wasn't in the top 10 most boring a lot of the <UNK> on the other hand were in this <UNK> top 10 i hadn't known that the whole thing had been done by <UNK> although i knew it was scripted but it was really terrible to see these supposedly good actors unable to insert expression look away from the cue and stumble over simple words natalie <UNK> there's no director she's gone the night of fancy dresses and boring speeches was long and tedious <UNK> <UNK> butchered some good songs and there were very few decent acceptance speeches and clips adam sandler wins the worst <UNK> award br br for helping me write this review i'd like to thank my mum my dad my lawyers and my <UNK> for all believing in me and i'd like to point out that i have a high <UNK> and of course i haven't been starving myself for a month i'm not going to cry thank you
<START> this show is unbelievable in that what it represents and what it focuses on and words cannot describe how insane et is they will report anything if a celebrity is even remotely <UNK> connected to the story et will report on it if a dog <UNK> in the tom <UNK> yard they will report on it if a celebrity dies they will talk about it for weeks on end to the point where the public envy that celebrity if a celebrity is on trial et will report it for months on end there is no end to what this show will reports and no time frame that <UNK> how long they will focus on a story is it even considered <UNK> <UNK> the reports are so <UNK> annoying too with harsh rambling voices and end with an unnecessary pause to convey a sense of important i cannot watch this show without questioning <UNK> existence et is one big reason i avoid pre evening shows in general i regret that imdb can only allow a minimum of one star rating and not zero or even in the <UNK> for this show deserve 10 stars
<START> this 1986 italian french remake of the 1946 film of the same name turns up the heat early and doesn't let us come up for air the story is about a high school student <UNK> <UNK> who can't keep his eyes off the mysteriously beautiful young woman played by dutch <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who lives next door to the school one day he follows her and his <UNK> pays off there's only one problem she's engaged to a <UNK> character <UNK> de <UNK> who may or may not have committed a <UNK> crime and if he <UNK> will probably be let off with a slap on the <UNK> also the young woman is a little funny in the head and this is <UNK> when we discover she has been seeing the boy's father who is a psychiatrist <UNK> emotional <UNK> is only <UNK> by her <UNK> sexual desires hot hot hot from the word go with handsome leads and a <UNK> performance from <UNK> who plays us like a <UNK> <UNK> as she does the boy from scene to scene with enough suspense to keep us guessing right up until and even after the end available in r and x rated versions
<START> <UNK> boy that was definitely one of the worst flicks i've seen all summer granted it was on sci fi and i don't watch much sci fi but man talk about a razor thin plot and two dimensional characters to the max br br the characters were stereotypical and overdone the plot and setting were unbelievable the vampires were less <UNK> more funny looking the gore was unnecessary the special effects were down right horrible and the ending well the only thing unpredictable about the ending was when suddenly the <UNK> becomes a lesbian and starts to do it with the female vampire which by the way isn't really all that hot considering it occurs for about three seconds in which you're closer to what the hell then man that's hot if this ever appears in reruns god <UNK> don't watch it
<START> the main character lance barton gets killed and to heaven before his time when heaven learns about the mistake he is given the body of just deceased rich old and white mr <UNK> br br a young black guy in a old white mans body still behaving like the young black man is maybe funny if you see it done by an old white actor in this movie i ended up reminding myself several times chris rock is supposed to be an old white guy br br the whole concept does not play as intended the illusion is not transported well and the love story is not believable at all the fact that all you see is chris rock playing a young black guy because the old white person everyone is supposed to see is only shown in small scenes is to much of a challenge for the viewers suspension of disbelief
<START> and this movie has crossed it i have never seen such a terrible movie in my life i mean a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty <UNK> a snowman with a costume that has the <UNK> clearly visible this was a pitiful excuse for a movie
<START> what can i say about this movie i have seen it quite a few times since the first time when i was around 6 i have seen the english version and it is done very well it is a great movie for all ages but it is directed more for children i love the <UNK> humor and appreciate it if you have not seen it you should try to rent a copy you will not be disappointed
<START> i don't think i've really ever given walter matthau his due as a comedic performer he's certainly been wonderful in plenty of lighthearted roles but i guess i always put his success down to his characters' <UNK> and <UNK> a gruff contrast to the flamboyant personality of his frequent co star jack lemmon and i suppose a natural <UNK> of his earlier work in dramatic pictures watching gene <UNK> 'the odd couple 1968 ' adapted from a popular neil simon play the <UNK> suddenly <UNK> matthau is in his own right absolutely hilarious initially striking the audience as filthy crude and generally unappealing his oscar madison eventually manages to worm his way into our hearts culminating in a hilariously <UNK> confession of emotions that matthau <UNK> out in a voice not entirely his own at the same time while holding his own as a comedian his interplay with lemmon is of course pitch perfect indeed the film rightly belongs to both actors who have never failed to light up the cinema screen by themselves let alone together br br calling to mind billy <UNK> screenplay for 'the apartment 1960 ' this neil simon comedy builds itself around around a rather morbid premise <UNK> house <UNK> felix <UNK> lemmon having just been <UNK> by his wife of twelve years attempts to commit suicide but <UNK> <UNK> the idea after he <UNK> his back trying to open the hotel window <UNK> he arrives at the house of good friend oscar matthau a divorced <UNK> who lives alone on a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and green <UNK> that might contain either very new cheese or very old meat oscar kindly offers felix a place to stay but is soon overwhelmed by his friend's <UNK> personality and constant <UNK> on absolute <UNK> the pair form an unusual sort of marital <UNK> with felix assuming the role of the <UNK> and constantly <UNK> wife and oscar as the sloppy <UNK> husband who always comes home later than he's supposed to this is a marriage that barely lasts three weeks and by the end of it we can completely <UNK> with <UNK> ex wife who remains unseen br br 'the odd <UNK> is a terrific comedy most of all because it has a lot of heart for all their arguing it's obvious that the two roommates have plenty of affection for each other most <UNK> seen when felix tries to launch into a furious <UNK> instead  perhaps inadvertently  ending up <UNK> oscar how tops he his the <UNK> four poker buddies john <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> david <UNK> and larry haines are also constantly <UNK> each other about some obscure annoyance but you can't deny that they've got the best of intentions their decision to treat felix as though nothing has happened to him may have sounded fine in theory but maybe being ignored wasn't quite the correct solution to <UNK> gloomy feelings of <UNK> and <UNK> unlike some comedies based on popular stage plays i was recently disappointed by <UNK> 'the seven year <UNK> 1955 this film doesn't simply strike at the same <UNK> throughout and the relationship between the two leads is <UNK> developed through tears laughter and much <UNK>
<START> still being of school age and having to learn shakespeare almost constantly for the last four years which is very off putting of any writer no matter how good i didn't really expect to enjoy this film when my english teacher put it on i thought it'd be the typical english lesson movie bad acting awfully shot badly edited and the <UNK> awful old dialog so as you can tell i was all but ready to go into a coma from the go however i watched and much to my <UNK> found myself not only paying attention but actually enjoying the movie too this production of hamlet is possibly one of the best drama movies i have seen in a long time and it really brings to life what i expect shakespeare wanted his plays to be like well with the difference that this is cinema much better than my english teacher <UNK> over the text ever possibly could the story is good the dialog seems to flow with an unexpected grace that is far from boring though a little hard to keep up with if you aren't used to shakespeare's language and even the smallest parts are performed with a skill you wouldn't expect mainly perhaps due to the <UNK> number of cameos this movie has brian blessed and charlton heston are as great as you'd expect these two veterans to be even in such small parts but it is robin williams as <UNK> and billy crystal as the <UNK> who really stand out giving such minor parts an unexpected <UNK> as well as offering some comic relief amidst the tragedy br br the main stars of course are also wonderful kenneth branagh excels as hamlet bringing not only the confusion and pain required to the roll but also a sort of <UNK> air which plays beautifully in the comic scenes making the movie as a whole much more watchable the other major players are also good but it is kenneth branagh who stands head and shoulders above the rest in the title role br br the set pieces too are often quite stunning giving a refreshing change to the <UNK> old castle corridors we're used to seeing in shakespeare productions as well as a real sense of the country around them br br of course the movie taken as a movie in its own right is not without faults but no major ones the pacing is the only real problem i can think of <UNK> as well as the <UNK> for anyone not used to as i said <UNK> language and especially when compared to the sort of shakespeare productions i'm used to seeing in class it really is quite brilliant it's even made me <UNK> my previous typical teenager stance on shakespeare that his plays are boring i came to the conclusion it's not the plays that are boring merely the teachers who <UNK> them in class if only they made all of his plays into movies such as this one english students in schools everywhere might have a higher opinion of the <UNK> br br overall 7 10
<START> as a <UNK> i've seen the movie 5 6 times in the last 15 years and i only just saw the musical this week this allowed me to judge the movie without being <UNK> by what was or wasn't in the musical however it <UNK> me when i watched the musical br br i actually believe michael douglas worked quite well in that role along with <UNK> i think her <UNK> me dance for you <UNK> is one of the best parts of the movie a worthwhile addition compared to the musical the dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger easier to do in the movie of course the <UNK> lighting dancing and singing are also much superior in the movie which should be expected and was indeed delivered br br the songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie the new ones are quite good ones and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion especially compared to a musical which has few <UNK> the one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters but their dancing is impeccable and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical
<START> spoilers ahead russian fantasy <UNK> and i use the term loosely that i've been trying to watch for over a year i've finally gotten to the end and now i wish i didn't put in the repeated effort br br in an effort to save two hours of your life i'm going to tell you he plot a guy who has the ability to project a long blade out of his arm returns home to see his mom things turn ugly after he is beaten up by the mafia boyfriend of an old girl friend he takes revenge on the guy when he brings the girl home the guys mafia mom sends her men out to get revenge while the cops begin looking for him as well br br very little is said no explanation is really given for anything like why they lock id girlfriend in an asylum and the action for the most part is all off screen the film essentially consists of a guy who looks like adrian <UNK> looking intense and not saying anything killing people off screen most of the action happens off screen it looks good is well acted and had there been some form of reason for what is going on it might have been a good film hell i would have liked some sense of real character development or back story all we know is that the guy was picked on as a kid the movie runs the better part of two hours and it feels like its six if they weren't going to tell us anything they could have at least picked up the pace so it seemed like it was moving too fast no instead we get the hero on a boat the hero in a bus the hero walking the hero looking disturbed hero with his girl it really annoyed me since i think this could have been a good film if they had simply done something or had someone actually say something meaningful other than give <UNK> to get this guy br br 4 out of 10 its about four hours all my attempts to see this i'll never get back only for those who want to see a brooding russian action film with very little action
<START> if you have never viewed this film and like old time veteran actors this is the film for you seeing frank sinatra when he was very young and extremely thin with <UNK> in <UNK> and a wonderful voice which sang some great old songs <UNK> morgan <UNK> <UNK> gave an outstanding performance with plenty of dance and musical numbers leon errol <UNK> drake gave a great supporting role along with victor <UNK> sir victor <UNK> victor who performed classical piano and no slap stick comedy like he did in his career this is not a great musical but frank sinatra was a great joy to see at the beginning of his career in the 1940's
<START> no matter what anyone tells you there is a mere fact to the word possession in film circles such as what possessed you to <UNK> this film religion doesn't have anything to do with it but common sense does that is if your head is clear and you are of sound mind to make a judgment br br on many levels i tried to <UNK> where this film would entertain or even interest the average <UNK> the star the story the unique idea a buddy movie that kids would love with a dinosaur and a black woman on my goodness i am sure when this was an idea it sounded good but somewhere during the course of development someone should have pointed out where the idea could not translate into a piece of entertainment anyone would wish to watch or pay for unless they were very much deeply under the influence of alcohol or drugs and saw something the rest of us could not see br br regardless this is a complete mess mess mess sin and a mess br br who cares about the plot what plot et al <UNK> got a paycheck but i would have been embarrassed to take it i sure hope she fired her agent manager <UNK> over this career move obviously not she went on to make more bad films and more bad films sad
<START> phantasm of 1979 was a highly atmospheric creepy scary and very original horror flick and in one word cult the first sequel of 1988 was gory witty action packed and highly entertaining after the first sequel however phantasm creator don <UNK> apparently lacked new ideas phantasm iii lord of the dead of 1994 is certainly not a complete failure it even is quite entertaining but there is no more originality and the desperate attempts to bring in something new are at times tiresome which makes it quite disappointing in comparison to its predecessors br br spoilers br br quite in the beginning we are introduced the secret behind the mysterious sentinel <UNK> the brain sucking flying silver balls is <UNK> <UNK> a number of unnecessary and annoying new characters such as tim a home alone style little kid who happens to be great at shooting an rocky a tough and super cool <UNK> swinging black chick with a crew cut are introduced the film also has its qualities <UNK> <UNK> is again very cool as the <UNK> <UNK> guitar playing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is still quite creepy as the tall man but the fact that the tall man talks a lot more in this film makes him loose some of his creepiness the character of mike is played by a michael baldwin again he had been replaced by james <UNK> in part 2 which in my opinion doesn't make much of a difference the gore also keeps the film interesting enough to watch but it is still a disappointment especially because the attempts to make up for the lack of ideas get annoying quite quickly br br all things considered phantasm iii is an acceptable time <UNK> but it is definitely disappointing compared to its predecessors fans of the first two phantasm films can give it a try but i recommend not to set your expectations too high
<START> superhero movies pretty much always suck and this is no exception its only redeeming quality is the fact the movie could have been even worse i would put <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> above this movie so yes it is that bad br br if your looking for a black superhero check out <UNK> its not a serious superhero movie but at least its entertaining
<START> this is certainly one of the most bizarre films ever made even for fellini about the only one more bizarre is his <UNK> this is a two and a half hour romp through a strange nightmarish world of <UNK> <UNK> and sexual challenge sutherland makes a curiously unappealing <UNK> and the odd goings on in a series of unrelated vignettes taken from the great <UNK> autobiography fail to engage the viewer the art direction and costume design are however outstanding the academy missed on not even <UNK> the former but did itself justice by rewarding an oscar for the latter also nominated oddly was the disjointed pointless and almost <UNK> screenplay go figure the film on video is only 150 minutes 16 minutes short of the original running time this viewer was grateful
<START> this film was so amateurish i could hardly believe what i was seeing it is shot on video not film i have not seen the likes of this since the early 70's when late night networks showed movie of the week <UNK> <UNK> shot in video it looks like a bad soap opera and that is paying it a compliment some of the actors give it their best shot michael des <UNK> does okay with what he is given to do which is to act like a sex addict out of control i can't say that it is pleasant to watch br br <UNK> kinski as the <UNK> sits in a chair for practically the entire film with very little variation in camera angles i can't fault her for someone else's poor <UNK> but she is totally unbelievable in her role her little girl voice works against her here and i consider myself a <UNK> kinski fan she is certainly <UNK> and exotic but she's outside her range with this br br alexandra paul is <UNK> overwrought every line she delivers is with three <UNK> points someone must have directed her to scream at all costs why would michael des <UNK> want to have sex with such a raging <UNK> br br finally <UNK> arquette as the sweet <UNK> wife comes off okay and probably the most believable of the bunch but that is not saying much br br this has to be the worst film i have seen in years
<START> this was a blind buy used dvd it totally killed a nice buzz i had going when i hit play br br it's bubble headed comedy but it's um <UNK> the plot is zany but the characters do things to each other that are so petty and disturbed and conveniently contrived i ultimately found it depressing to watch br br maybe the box lead me to expect something more than an uneven goofy caper film i know i know the quotes on the box the academy award nomination mean nothing
<START> new york playwright michael caine as sidney <UNK> is <UNK> years old and <UNK> fast as the film opens mr <UNK> latest play <UNK> on broadway tv reviewers poke fun at caine and he gets drunk passing out on the long island <UNK> lands caine in <UNK> instead of his <UNK> in east <UNK> finally arriving home caine is <UNK> by tightly <UNK> wife <UNK> cannon as myra an unfortunately high strung heart patient there caine and ms cannon discuss a new play called deathtrap written by hunky young christopher reeve as <UNK> cliff anderson one of <UNK> former students the couple believe mr <UNK> deathtrap is the hit needed to revive <UNK> career br br the trap is <UNK> for a <UNK> funny <UNK> do it br br directed by sidney lumet ira <UNK> long running broadway hit doesn't stray too far from its stage origin the cast is enjoyable and the story's twists are still engrossing one thing that did not work for me was the curtain call ending surely it played better on stage deathtrap is a fun film to watch again the performances are dead on but in <UNK> the <UNK> reeve gives caine at the east <UNK> train station should have been <UNK> to a smiling hello the location isn't really east <UNK> but the <UNK> and pond look similar and the much <UNK> love scene is shockingly tepid but the play was so good even a gifted director couldn't ruin it and mr lumet doesn't disappoint br br deathtrap 3 19 <UNK> sidney lumet michael caine christopher reeve <UNK> cannon irene worth
<START> this is another one of those movies that could have been great the basic premise is good immortal cat people who kill to live etc sort of a variation on the vampire concept br br the thing that makes it all fall apart is the total <UNK> of the main characters even <UNK> know that you need to keep a low profile if you want to survive look how long it took to catch the <UNK> and that was because a family member figured it out br br by contrast the kid and to a lesser extent the mom behave as though they're <UNK> the kid kills without a thought for not leaving evidence or a trail or a living witness how these people managed to stay alive and <UNK> for a month is unbelievable let alone decades or centuries br br it's really a shame this could have been so much more if it had been written <UNK> i e giving the main characters the level of common sense they would have needed to get by for so long br br other than that not a bad showing i loved the bit at the end where every cat in town <UNK> on the house every time i put out food on the <UNK> and see our cats suddenly rush in from wherever they were before i think of that scene
<START> outside the household is a different world and the family struggle to <UNK> the line between <UNK> authority and their hopes and dreams br br the period is captured the <UNK> light <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> the picture <UNK> the wall paper the short <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> the mini van shiny modern <UNK> br br the location is captured a wind <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> rocky landscape walls of local stone community freedom br br but there is much much more childhood happiness <UNK> pride values freedom authority rebellion violence in the deepest sense love struggle <UNK> <UNK> morality trust faith <UNK> <UNK> manners maturity loss poverty sacrifice horror <UNK> revelation comedy and <UNK> are all there and in no particular order br br this film is a richly woven expression of family tensions that are as <UNK> today as ever the fact that some of these aren't <UNK> directly is testament in itself to the attitudes of the day but the fact that they are all here is a testament to the acting skill the story and the direction br br if there's anything bad about this film it's that all this deeply <UNK> and wonderfully <UNK> tension is swept away a little too lightly towards the end maybe i <UNK> the doom and <UNK> felt by many teenagers really does disappear if they deal with it maybe the film is trying to send even that message too well worth doing br br what is the film trying to say kids parents were young too parents struggle too everyone makes mistakes everyone learns things change struggle can end happily parents don't try too hard try to remember that your support is the key to their well being br br it sounds simplistic doesn't it sometimes the film feels like that too but it's then that you notice how much is being being challenged and <UNK> br br the film is a classic br br not the problems <UNK>
<START> there's nothing really to dislike about the odd couple and it's no surprise that jack lemmon and walter matthau make a hugely winning comedic team but there's something so underdeveloped about neil simon's adaptation of his hit stage play as to make it seem more like a skit on a sketch comedy show than a full <UNK> film i have not seen the play but have to assume that the screen version is fairly faithful since simon wrote it so the <UNK> cannot be blamed on a stage to screen adaptation there are some interesting ideas in this story two recently divorced men who fall immediately into traditional married roles when they become roommates because neither knows any differently that simon never fully <UNK> out still there are many worse ways to kill a couple of hours
<START> this is a great film <UNK> when compared with the sometimes <UNK> <UNK> of today's politically minded filmmakers a film that can so easily combine sex gender relations politics and art is a <UNK> these days while the <UNK> optimism of the 1960's can't be <UNK> i think we can at least learn a lesson from the film's <UNK> energy and charm i don't know what those who label the film boring were watching there's so much packed into it that it never remains the same film for more that 15 min at a time
<START> this is yet another depressing and boring film about aids and tragedy it begins very <UNK> and predictable and continues throughout the movie i kept waiting for it to pick up but unfortunately it never did the acting is fair but the script needs a lot of work and if you're looking for the nudity don't waste your time with these not so hot actors due to the poor sound quality and lack of <UNK> i missed 1 8 of the movie if you have never seen over five gay films or have recently come to terms with being gay you may find this film interesting otherwise it's your run of the mill low budget movie it ranks as one of the worst gay films i have ever seen
<START> this movie is very very very poor i have seen better movies br br there was a bit of tension but not much to make you jump out of your chair it begins slowly with the building of tension which is not a success at least if you ask me though at some points or moments i must say it was a bit funny when people got shot and how they went down br br they should had made it something like scary movie then it might be a better movie because i watched only pieces of the movie by skipping scenes and it got to boring through out the movie i must say that i felt sleepy watching this movie so i sure can say it is not worth it br br don't waste time on even thinking to do something with this movie besides leaving it where it already is somewhere very dusty
<START> this movie is one among the very few indian movies that would never fade away with the passage of time nor would its spell <UNK> appeal ever <UNK> even as the indian cinema transforms into the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> pop culture while <UNK> oriented extras take to <UNK> the p t <UNK> film songs br br the cinematography speaks of the excellent skills of <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> the monumental and cinema scope effect of the film in its entirety br br gone are the days of great cinema when every scene had to be <UNK> many times and <UNK> taken before <UNK> it while <UNK> attention was paid in <UNK> and editing the scenes some of its poignant scenes are filled with sublime emotional intensity like the instance when <UNK> <UNK> refuses to say yes as an <UNK> for <UNK> marriage bond and climbs down the hill while running <UNK> in traumatized frenzy at the moment raj kumar follows her and a strong <UNK> of wind blew away the <UNK> of <UNK> and onto the legs of kumar br br kamal <UNK> shall always be remembered with golden words in the <UNK> of indian <UNK> history for <UNK> to complete this movie in a record setting 12 years he had to manage filming of some of the vital songs without <UNK> close ups because <UNK> <UNK> the lady in the lead role was <UNK> ill and fighting for her life in early 1971
<START> pet sematary is an adaptation from the stephen king novel of the same title the story follows the <UNK> an all american middle class family who move into a house out in the country the family consists of louis and rachel and their two young children <UNK> and their <UNK> son gage the house couldn't be better and the family meets a strange but friendly old man <UNK> who lives across the road he leads them down an old path into the woods one day where a pet graveyard lies filled with a huge amount of animal graves and just beyond there lies a sacred indian burial ground that seems to possess a strange power when the family cat church is killed louis sees it fit to bury him in the pet cemetery and strangely enough soon after church returns to life but there's something evil about him now he isn't the same cat he used to be and when a tragic accident takes the life of young gage louis decides to apply the same concept in hopes of <UNK> his dead son unfortunately he gets more than he <UNK> for br br having read stephen king's novel i can say that the book is much better than the film not to say the movie is bad because it isn't the book is just a little bit better the real strength in this film lies in it's story which is both bizarre but extremely original something that king's stories are typically known for the script is very well adapted from the story and while it <UNK> <UNK> in some aspects it's a pretty good page to screen transformation there are a few plot holes here and there nothing major though besides that this movie is actually pretty scary and it succeeds in it's intention to do so there are some really disturbing scenes throughout the film and i'd have to say that the flashback sequence of <UNK> sister <UNK> is the number one honestly that is one of the most disgusting disturbing things i've ever seen in a horror film it's not gory and bloody it's just flat out sickening one <UNK> for sure that image won't leave your head anytime soon br br the performances in this film were all very up to par and i really had no problem there this film is actually on the gory side there are plenty of nasty little sequences to please all of the gore <UNK> out there including the shocker of an ending i really liked the way they ended the film it was abrupt and somewhat <UNK> but it worked better that way with all things considered br br overall pet sematary is a good horror movie that i'd recommend to those who are fans of either stephen king or just fans of the genre in general the story is the film's greatest asset and it's a creepy one too one of the better stephen king adaptations i'd say 7 10
<START> i grew up in <UNK> <UNK> the town where <UNK> market was i remember my whole family going out to watch the filming i remember a guy showing the blob to me and my brothers in a bucket i also would like to share that my mother was in the movie her hair style was the same as <UNK> <UNK> and she was ill one evening and they saw my mom and asked her to sit in the car with steve mcqueen for some shots from behind they <UNK> her 25 00 and gave her a story to tell until she passed away this past august my mom was not a teenager and she was a few months from giving birth to my little sister
<START> i waited and waited for this film to come out the trailers seemed to be on for years it was worth it i'm not a big fan of watching films over and over again but i cant wait for this to come out for all to buy not a big fan of jim but this suited him perfectly there was so much to see and the <UNK> good <UNK> is off the scale perfect for christmas i think ron did a <UNK> job turning this into a film if you haven't seen it then do so if you have watch it again i know you want to
<START> when i first saw this film in london in 1958 i was <UNK> over i had never seen a film like this before it had a strange hypnotic effect quite unlike the films that i had seen previously and it left a lasting impact br br i believe that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are sisters if not twins certainly the interaction is amazing in its power to influence the viewer br br if this has been converted to dvd in region 2 format and in the original french language i would love to hear about it where it can be purchased
<START> rain or shine outside you enter a movie house it makes you happy if not come right out lights go off you settle down with a bar of ice cream moving pictures begin to <UNK> on the screen you feel content in the dark you are back in the beginning of time sitting around the <UNK> looking at the modern version of the <UNK> flames 24 times per second and sharing the joy of discovering the unknown turns and twists of the scenario with rest of your clan <UNK> br br those who are not happy with themselves should not write comments long live romantic comedies
<START> this 1981 comedy still <UNK> thanks to the combined efforts of writer director steve gordon and stars dudley moore and john gielgud sadly gordon only in his early forties died soon after <UNK> this his only feature film it's an especially unfortunate loss since he shows a truly <UNK> hand at character driven farce that makes the whole film irresistible it plays almost like a 1930's style screwball comedy <UNK> for contemporary tastes the plot centers on arthur bach a drunken <UNK> millionaire playboy who is at risk of losing his <UNK> million inheritance if he doesn't marry the <UNK> and boring susan johnson an <UNK> <UNK> by his old money father and <UNK> grandmother of course he doesn't love her and by chance runs into linda <UNK> a working class waitress and of course aspiring actress after she <UNK> a <UNK> goodman tie for her father br br the standard complications ensue but in a most endearing way with loads of alcohol <UNK> slapstick executed with classic <UNK> by moore that he makes such a spoiled character likable is a credit not only to his comic talents but to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> turn as <UNK> <UNK> devoted but reality grounded <UNK> it's the type of role he could play in his sleep but gielgud makes <UNK> such a truly memorable character that his fate in the film brings a welcome <UNK> of <UNK> in the proceedings in probably her most likable film role <UNK> minnelli hands the picture to her male co stars by <UNK> down her usual <UNK> <UNK> personality and making linda quite genuine in motivation br br a pre la law jill <UNK> plays susan just at the right passive aggressive note while barney martin <UNK> dad on seinfeld steals all his scenes as <UNK> <UNK> father ralph the one fly in the <UNK> is veteran actress <UNK> fitzgerald who <UNK> the <UNK> of the grandmother and i have to admit that i still can't stand the very dated <UNK> christopher cross song that inevitably won the oscar for that year's best song unfortunately the 1997 dvd certainly in need of <UNK> has no extras worth noting except some photos and production notes
<START> i'm gonna tip the <UNK> here a bit and say i enjoyed this however the cartoon is really only going to appeal to those who have very <UNK> <UNK> it's definitely something that most people will not get as is the nature of <UNK> br br the animation is horrible but yes that's the point the main character is foul mouthed violent and stupid no redeeming qualities whatsoever his wife <UNK> and <UNK> apparently just barely capable of the most basic communication skills most of these stories completely lack any kind of point br br but again that's the point br br if non <UNK> foul language and complete and utter <UNK> are your thing you're going to love this br br it is really short so i would probably rent instead of buying
<START> first off let's start with the negative points 1 there are huge <UNK> <UNK> in the story line and questions that are raised that will get no where near being answered 2 the movie is not for all people so <UNK> viewers will get restless and start <UNK> during the movie br br point two above is important because the movie is very quiet in an older type theater like the one i went to you can hear the reel going through the <UNK> at times i loved that the movie does not keep you busy with music nor effects it lets you reflect upon what is happening br br there is a lack of rhythm that <UNK> an atmosphere that is fascinating an utterly enjoyable the same kind of atmosphere generated by stanley kubrick in eyes wide shut not for all people br br i would highly recommend it to fans of cinema as the cinematographic work is amazing those that base their appreciation of a movie solely on the story will be utterly disappointed it's the kind of story that you have to make up the <UNK> in your mind afterwards my version of it is pretty darn cool but probably quite off track if you do go catch the movie there is one very cool part when the two cops are talking to each other on their cell phones an ultra cool sound effect that really puts you in the moment hats off to the person that thought of doing this
<START> spoken like a true hard boiled <UNK> <UNK> the story is no worse than any number of gangster flicks but never ever confuse this movie with the godfather i or ii or <UNK> it is not in the same league br br but what makes the film <UNK> painful to watch is all these italian americans <UNK> around dropping bad <UNK> lines in an even worse fake <UNK> accent pacino would have been great if they could just have dubbed him i was looking forward to see <UNK> and <UNK> but their <UNK> accents spoiled the fun br br ah well the script ain't too hot either don <UNK> would have made this disappear five minutes after meeting him smiling and <UNK> him on the back all the while
<START> i have always been interested in anything about bigfoot so when i was <UNK> around looking for a movie to rent this one caught my eye it was the worst 4 50 i've ever spent and i want my money back please don't waste your money on this this was one of the <UNK> movies i've ever seen the entire movie was so incredibly boring and i found myself rolling my eyes a lot and i didn't even watch it all the way through i just got fed up with it the acting was horrible the effects were horrible everything was just really bad and tasteless it all added up to be a really bad boring movie and total waste of time and money i hope that one day they'll make a good movie about sasquatch but until then i'll have to sit through countless cheap <UNK> like this one to find the real masterpiece
<START> the year is <UNK> jeff <UNK> james stewart doesn't like people there's only one friend he's got and he's ben <UNK> walter brennan an old sympathetic man they're driving a cattle herd with them that would be their key to <UNK> in <UNK> they run into trouble when sheriff gannon john mcintire takes the cattle now jeff only has to get it back and drive it through the u s canadian border to dawson now they have a group of other people with them like the ladies <UNK> castle ruth roman and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> there the two men get into the gold business anthony <UNK> and james stewart's fourth collaboration the far country 1954 is a fine western indeed the acting work is superb walter brennan makes a terrific sidekick to stewart ruth roman is brilliant and <UNK> <UNK> delightful jay c <UNK> is very good as dawson <UNK> <UNK> morris the great jack <UNK> and kathleen freeman are seen in smaller roles it's fantastic to watch how jimmy stewart <UNK> all the troubles in his way there's just the man and his rifle but also he's vulnerable
<START> a small town is attacked by a <UNK> of <UNK> vampires the only hope is a lone <UNK> and a group of <UNK> survivors br br released in 1993 darkness garnered something of a cult following upon release it's easy to see why it's loaded and i mean freaking loaded with gore and it's energy and enthusiasm like that found in other no budget cult horror flicks like the dead next door and the children of <UNK> is actually rather <UNK> br br while that may be true that's sadly not enough to save it the film was shot on a super 8 so the image is grainy and dark making things very difficult to see it would have been great if it had <UNK> the protagonists dreadful <UNK> also grating is the soundtrack made up of annoying <UNK> keyboard and even more annoying death metal seriously what is it with these no budget horror flicks and bad death metal while one isn't expecting oscar worthy performances the acting is still strictly amateur hour as the actors sometimes seem almost confused instead of frightened or threatened br br in the end i'm sure fans of no budget <UNK> will love this everyone else though will wish there was a little more meat on the <UNK>
<START> love is overwhelming in all it's <UNK> gorgeous absolutely gorgeous <UNK> <UNK> maria <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> one truly dramatic story about love in all it's <UNK> a story about the <UNK> ways of young hearts about life and lost innocence all directed by the <UNK> eye of <UNK> <UNK> with a magnificent soundtrack featuring <UNK> chris martin and <UNK> <UNK> it surprises in every way leaving behind the sour taste of <UNK> love truly remarkable is it me or is romanian cinematography slowly but surely <UNK> and gaining respect this is a brilliant film two thumbs up to everybody involved
<START> this film is wonderful in every way that modern action adventures are not take some time relax enjoy think people who see this movie as slow or plodding or dull really need to take a week off and watch it several times until their short attention span mind comes to grips with the possibility of being involved with a cause or even beautiful story in a beautiful place for no other reason than because it isn't <UNK> to make the points you so <UNK> need it to make in the short time <UNK> at first i was <UNK> of brosnan playing a native american given the story line though i think it was apt casting now back to my <UNK> <UNK>
<START> as with all the other reviewers this movie has been a constant in my mind after 30 years i recall going to the library <UNK> all that i could on this story i even wrote to the <UNK> station for more information despite all this all i was able to find out was that it was a story <UNK> in a newspaper in the early part of the <UNK> br br <UNK> to 2002 after years of searching ebay for on a weekly basis and there it was a vhs copy of the movie there was one other <UNK> but i was determined to win this movie the losing <UNK> wrote me asking for a copy which i gave her despite <UNK> a copy i still searched and searched finally finding a site that sold a dvd copy of the movie you can find it at http www <UNK> com harvey <UNK> war <UNK> war widow <UNK>
<START> i am amazed at the amount of praise that is <UNK> on this movie by other <UNK> to me it was rather a disappointment especially the combination of historical facts fantasy and the main character's internal turmoil does not work at all in <UNK> book <UNK> five and even in george roy <UNK> adaptation for the screen it does credibility is often <UNK> too many questions are left open did i miss some central points or did i fail to spot the lines that supposedly connect the <UNK> br br a boy called campbell jr grows up in <UNK> new york at home his father has many technical trade papers and one book it has photographs of <UNK> of dead bodies in it the boy <UNK> through the book his dad doesn't like his doing that what should this tell me the family moves away from <UNK> new york to berlin bang it is 1938 the boy is a married man in berlin and a theater playwright what kind of plays does he write in what language is he successful his wife is an actress and looks glamorous the parents move back to the usa and invite their son to do the same he does not why because having grown up in germany he feels more german than american because he is successful because his wife is because he likes his life there because he likes the nazis because he is just plain lazy and doesn't like change don't ask me br br possibly the man just does not care is not interested in politics is a kind of an <UNK> he states that he is deeply in love with his wife he speaks of his republic of two meaning he and his wife there is little to no evidence proving his love for his wife in the movie it much more seems a republic of one br br on the request of an american agent campbell jr agrees to broadcast anti <UNK> nazi hate propaganda to american <UNK> as a device for <UNK> <UNK> messages to american authorities who read between the lines the crucial meeting with the agent on a berlin park <UNK> is short <UNK> and anti climactic the decision to play along comes pretty easily with no explanation the rise up to <UNK> seems to be <UNK> and apparently fast br br so now we have campbell jr presenting himself over the air as the last free american the scheme for <UNK> secret messages is fairly realistic and exciting although one wonders what happened when campbell jr really and honestly had to <UNK> <UNK> etc must have <UNK> the messages terribly anyway the nazis lose the wife dies <UNK> in the <UNK> for german troops i never heard such <UNK> really happened on german front lines in <UNK> ii campbell jr says he goes to the russian front but does not go is captured by an american soldier who <UNK> his <UNK> how come is dragged to a sight seeing tour in <UNK> is then released and <UNK> with the help of the crucial agent somewhere in the city of new york br br and this is where the story really starts br br bang from now on it is like a short story by paul <UNK> it is <UNK> campbell jr lives in new york <UNK> as a has been and <UNK> the loss of his wife nobody really cares or do they yes somehow they do and his neighbors offer some sort of distraction <UNK> survivors a painter some american <UNK> <UNK> him and want him to be their <UNK> they even find his presumed dead wife for him or is she his wife anyway in the end campbell jr calls in at the israeli <UNK> and they <UNK> give him the big war criminal treatment placing him in the cell <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> he writes his life story and once this task finished hangs himself on the <UNK> <UNK> without getting <UNK> the least bit br br while i can see that there must be an issue of guilt and of loss i just had the impression that the main character is a person who at all times is pretty indifferent to everything and hardly capable of love for anyone so i found it difficult to sympathize for this <UNK> who <UNK> his loss amazingly many reviewers focus on his status as a potential war hero having put his reputation at stake for playing the last free american i assume according to them this took a lot of courage as a matter of fact however the movie suggests that by accepting the assignment campbell created for himself a win win situation as he would have been politically on the safe side no matter who had won the war the danger of his being <UNK> never comes up during the first part of the story br br one might argue that the whole story is a <UNK> fantasy and that nobody should bother with historical accuracy or a logical development of the story which explains everything but even then it fails to make a point primarily i suspect because the love affair in the republic of two falls completely flat this is a pity especially if you consider that the wife was played by <UNK> lee a talented versatile and <UNK> actress she has much too little screen time and is forced to use a ridiculous german accent another somehow neglected aspect are the different <UNK> confession broadcast and hidden messages but i guess this is largely <UNK> maybe i should give the book a chance
<START> like watching a <UNK> summer camp home movies indian summer is a sleep inducing bore eight <UNK> <UNK> are barely introduced when unbelievably boring flashbacks begin for characters we know nothing about fine actors alan arkin and bill paxton are totally wasted in this film one <UNK> observation that everything seems so much smaller than i remember it is repeated at least ten times enough to make you <UNK> the anticipated pranks are neither funny or original unless you think that short <UNK> is a real <UNK> this movie was a great disappointment considering the ample talent involved indian summer did not make me <UNK> just sick <UNK>
<START> most horror movies are in fact horrible movies they get to be same ol' same ol' same ol' pack every minute with some cheap thrill usually <UNK> and nowadays they can pack every second with <UNK> special effects one of the goals of a really good horror flick is to suspend the sense of disbelief of the audience for instance i saw both of the recent mummy movies and nearly got <UNK> viewing ridiculous special effects every second it probably costs a million dollars per second to make those movies and my sense of disbelief was never suspended it grew roots br br subtlety can be more terrifying less is more br br i first saw 'the woman in <UNK> on the a e channel after flipping through the usual <UNK> channels of very bad television i stopped to watch it this movie almost has the feel of a <UNK> <UNK> production that was fine with me i've always preferred british tv movies anyway br br most viewers would find this to be too slowly paced but the slow pacing helps give the story credibility the special effects are few which <UNK> the viewer into thinking that this film is set in the real world thus making us a bit more uneasy the makeup and costume for the ghost are kept simple and believable hollywood would have made her look like a she demon from hell with glowing eyes <UNK> <UNK> etc hollywood would have done an <UNK> and turned this idea into a mediocrity br br the woman only makes about five appearances in the film most of them are where she appears in the distance and even that creates a good fright if she appeared too often it could've <UNK> the mood that gets set however this movie is so well made that through much of the film we're led into <UNK> that she is there the whole time but not visible the scene where she <UNK> arthur <UNK> late at night and we see her just a little too close is a masterpiece in horror br br this is just an extraordinary film that i think should rate as one the finest horror films ever made i have a copy of 'the <UNK> 'the <UNK> and a <UNK> more i haven't seen anything that tops 'the woman in <UNK> yet although i'm still looking this movie is so well made that it gives even the most hardened <UNK> like me a moment where i almost had second thoughts about the non existence of ghosts i joke to people that i occasionally get brief fears that she could appear standing in the middle of the road or that i'd see her staring through my window etc maybe she could be in a crowd at the mall glaring at me with her look of hate this is how a really great horror film should be like a <UNK> novel the woman in black very slowly pulls you in and <UNK> herself around your neck and before you realize it she's <UNK> the life out of you and then it's too late br br closest thing i have to a criticism is that this was made for the small screen and it's a terrible shame that this is out of print i just paid over 40 for my second copy of this movie it's a major prize in my collection now i'm on a quest to find an even better horror movie that not only gives the chills but also qualifies a sound drama
<START> that's a problem i have with movies that come on television when there is nothing else to watch i somehow get sucked into really bad movies br br but this one was fairly watchable the concept of being the only ones left on earth after a <UNK> then finding out zombies are around makes me laugh and that's why i gave this movie a 2 instead of 1 the story was stupid but in that way that makes you laugh too stupid funny br br i think i only watched it because the guy from star trek was the lead i was surprised to see him as a younger guy and he was the only funny character anyway
<START> as someone who has read the book i can say that this is vastly inferior to the big american version starring gwyneth paltrow there are various reasons for this firstly emma is too unpleasant yes she has faults and isn't the <UNK> person to like but the viewer shouldn't downright start to despise her secondly mr <UNK> is miscast his brooding and melancholy in this version are better suited to a <UNK> or <UNK> adaptation than austen and throw the mood of the whole affair off <UNK> samantha <UNK> is too strong an actress to be <UNK> to the role of harriet and why was she made to look so <UNK> harriet is supposed to be blonde and <UNK> not to look as if she's going to be carried off by <UNK> in the next scene <UNK> the structure has been <UNK> up and scenes cut at the end when emma decides she loves mr <UNK> it comes across as utterly <UNK> because this narrative hasn't been adequately shown and carried along throughout the film <UNK> what was going on exactly with mrs <UNK> accent she went from sounding like an american actress trying to <UNK> her own accent at the beginning to all out american half way through and then back to english at the end finally this dragged at the end the book and the big film version end with the wedding of emma and mr <UNK> this version drags on <UNK> after the <UNK> of the wedding without actually showing us the ceremony br br all in all a rather <UNK> attempt read the book or rent the paltrow version instead
<START> and not in a fun to watch way it's just bad it's shocking that people have posted positive things about it here the story sucks the acting is bad it's not scary the special effects aren't special oh no the <UNK> has hands coming out of it oh gee the mirror turned into water the hair clothes and makeup in the <UNK> scenes aren't accurate and they got a middle aged man with a <UNK> <UNK> to play the high school version of himself this is like later on nightmare on elm street stuff i enjoy sitting down to watch a cheesy horror movie as much as anyone else but there are better bad ones out there to choose from
<START> some of the acting was a bit suspect i remember that <UNK> alexander walker evening standard critic yeah ok he's now dead launched into a rant about this film saying it was a disgrace portraying <UNK> <UNK> as murderers now with respect to all <UNK> <UNK> this film was loosely based on the <UNK> <UNK> who were <UNK> and who <UNK> <UNK> in the 1970's believe me they were not called <UNK> for nothing my main <UNK> about this film is the it shows no ray of light or hope it's all doom <UNK> i mean did the little girl at the end have to die maybe this sounds corny but it could have taken the <UNK> that not all <UNK> <UNK> are bad or wholly good either
<START> ruby in paradise is a beautiful coming of age story about a young woman ruby lee <UNK> escaping her <UNK> roots to become herself although the title character is played <UNK> by the gorgeous ashley judd in likely her first movie role albeit one to be quite proud of the emphasis is not upon becoming somebody a la the next madonna whether <UNK> mother or the lurid attention hungry singer br br it instead <UNK> following <UNK> instincts and being somewhat <UNK> about them to grow into one's ideal adult self note this isn't an action movie it uses an occasional voice over narration by ms judd while writing in her <UNK> and oh i see i've just lost the male half of the readers out there but be patient with this beautiful movie where we learn that one's bliss can be discovered in oh i <UNK> carrying water and <UNK> wood br br actor director writer todd field who played nick <UNK> in eyes wide shut co stars as ruby lee's noble love interest one who helps her <UNK> her idea of relationships <UNK> from youth br br but not even his character is the answer for ruby lee there's no <UNK> hero <UNK> upon her the ultimate message is that we are responsible for ourselves writer director victor <UNK> who also wrote directed <UNK> gold did an amazing job showing a young woman growing into herself confronting age old challenges of good v evil along the way br br the supporting cast is also stellar and the music used particularly the cuts by <UNK> sam phillips whom i hear is the wife of t bone <UNK> is right on most especially trying to hold on to the earth now when i hear the first few <UNK> of that song tears spring to my eyes <UNK> and <UNK> not sure if it's the music or the <UNK> connection to the movie's quiet charming message of <UNK> br br this movie is highly recommended for any young person trying to find his her way for any woman of any age it is a must see the downside it is not on dvd except in spanish we learned however that it is legal to make one copy of a vhs version which can be readily found online my beloved husband found someone with a vhs copy and got a dvd copy made for me although this treasure of a movie occasionally pops up on air  on an indie channel usually  you can't count on that when you might need it most as a <UNK> to <UNK> the <UNK> of the world so buy a copy for yourself br br this movie should have a major re release and it would if i were queen of hollywood br br <UNK> jones
<START> this movie is still an all time favorite only a pretentious <UNK> moron would not enjoy this wonderful film this movie feels like a slice of warm apple pie topped with french vanilla ice cream i think this is <UNK> best work ever and her most believable performance cher has always been blessed with charisma good looks and an <UNK> thin figure whether you like her singing or not who else sounds like cher cher has definitely made her mark in the entertainment industry and will be remembered long after others have come and gone she is one of the most unique artists out there it's funny because who would have thought of cher as such a naturally gifted actress she is heads above the so called movie stars of today cher is a real actor on the same level as debra <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> holly hunter angela <UNK> and a few others in that she never seems to be acting she really becomes the character convincingly she has more than earned the respect of her peers and of the movie going public br br everything about moonstruck is wonderful the characters the scenery the dialog the food i never get tired of watching this movie br br every time single time i watch the scene where they are all sitting around the dinner table at <UNK> house i pause the remote to see exactly what delicious food rose is serving i saw the spaghetti <UNK> i think but i can't make out whether they are eating <UNK> <UNK> what is that main course it looks wonderful and its driving me nuts br br everybody in that family was a <UNK> individual and they respected and cared about one another the grandfather wasn't pushed aside and <UNK> he was a vital part of the family and he was listened to and respected for his age and wisdom he seemed to be a pretty healthy independent old <UNK> too br br <UNK> mom wasn't just a housewife she was the <UNK> that held the family together and was a model example of what a wife mother and home manager should <UNK> to be she was proud of the lifestyle she had chosen but she didn't let it define who she was high powered <UNK> aren't as comfortable in their skin as rose <UNK> was notice the <UNK> way she said i didn't have kids until after i was <UNK> it ain't over <UNK> its over you got the sense that she had been the type of young woman who did exactly as she pleased and got her way without the other person realizing what had happened she was charming quick witted and very smart what a great mom br br i didn't actually like loretta right away because she seemed like a bit of a know it all who wasn't really as adventurous and as in control of herself as she wanted others to think she could tell others about themselves and where they had gone wrong but she really didn't apply common sense to her own life she was going to marry a middle aged <UNK> boy simply because she wanted a husband and a sense of identity and purpose to her life she was more conventional than her own mom she dressed and wore her hair like a <UNK> at a house of <UNK> and seemed <UNK> and bored but underneath you <UNK> that she was vulnerable and lonely and had a lot of love to give the right man she would probably end up making an awesome mom too br br i could see in the future a house full of loretta and <UNK> loud screaming happy kids and rose and <UNK> enjoying every minute of it
<START> andy goldsworthy is a <UNK> master of the first order expressing the way through his sublime <UNK> art indeed time and change is what his work is <UNK> about i bought his first book several years ago and my family has <UNK> at it many times so it was a treat to get to know the artist personally through this film he is just as patient and gentle as you would expect and has some wonderful things to say about the natural world the deepest of which are expressed in his occasional inability to say it in words at all he is like most children who play in the great <UNK> alone if they do anymore creating things from sticks and sand and mud and snow before they <UNK> it mr goldsworthy was given the gift and the mission to <UNK> that sort of play to create profound visions of nature and to open our often weary eyes to it in brilliant new ways and always with the <UNK> respect <UNK> and humor of a wandering and wondering monk
<START> this would have worked a lot better if it had been made as mitchell in <UNK> at least then we would have been <UNK> the sight of joe don baker running around an otherwise <UNK> <UNK> locale clad in that ridiculous looking cowboy outfit not to mention acting like an old west <UNK> mitchell being mitchell the film wouldn't have suffered from a lack of gratuitous police brutality either oh well at least the comic comments of mike and the <UNK> made this enjoyable fare as an episode of <UNK> i can't imagine watching it on it's own however
<START> very nicely done movie it does stay in your memory better billed as a romance than flying or war <UNK> the flying parts are realistic and almost error free flying buffs like myself will enjoy this movie even if attracted by the <UNK> unless they have no sensitivity or have never been in love br br fun watching early <UNK> he is good and exudes charm his reading of high flight is superb br br cheers boom
<START> good horror movies from france are quite rare and it's fairly easy to see why whenever a talented young filmmaker releases a <UNK> new film he <UNK> towards glorious hollywood immediately after to directed the big budgeted remake of another great film classic how can france possibly build up a solid horror reputation when their <UNK> directors leave the country after just one film <UNK> tension was a fantastic movie and it earned director alexandre <UNK> a one way ticket to the states to remake the hills have eyes which he did <UNK> i may add eric <UNK> long feature debut <UNK> was a very promising and engaging horror picture too and he's already off to the hollywood as well to direct the remake of takashi miike's ghost story hit one missed call so there you have it two very gifted <UNK> that aren't likely to make any more film in their native country some time soon <UNK> is a simple but efficient <UNK> that requires some patience due to its slow start but once the plot properly develops it offers great atmospheric tension and a handful of marvelous special effects the film almost entirely takes place in one single location and only introduces four characters we're inside a <UNK> french prison cell with four <UNK> the new arrival is a businessman sentenced to do time for fraud the elderly and wise <UNK> <UNK> killed his wife and then there's a crazy <UNK> and a mentally handicapped boy to complete the odd <UNK> they find an ancient <UNK> inside the wall of their cell <UNK> to a sick murderer in the <UNK> who <UNK> in black magic <UNK> and supernatural ways to escape the four inmates begin to prepare their own escaping plan using the bizarre <UNK> of the book only to realize the occult is something you shouldn't mess <UNK> eric <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of time to the character drawings of the four protagonists which occasionally results in redundant and tedious sub plots but his reasons for this all become clear in the gruesome climax when the book suddenly turns out to be some type of <UNK> device <UNK> is a dark film with <UNK> of claustrophobic tension and several twisted details about human behavior watch it before some wealthy american production company decides to remake it with four handsome teenage actors in the unconvincing roles of hardcore criminals
<START> i had read a few positive reviews of this film and was truly surprised at how dreadful the whole thing was <UNK> as some cross between an aids related story and some kind of ghost <UNK> spirit tale this film can't always make it's mind up what it wants to be br br simon and mark are a gay couple who have an open relationship simon is able to have anonymous though safe sex on the side when he wants mark is hiv and he and simon don't seem to have a sex life anymore when mark dies simon who has made a habit of <UNK> off his emotions after being rejected years ago by his father tries to <UNK> his memory and just get on with being a bachelor not that his behavior before <UNK> death was much different but mark returns in ghostly form and <UNK> his various <UNK> while getting simon to open up and admit his true feelings br br unfortunately simon is such a selfish <UNK> it's impossible to feel any empathy toward him for most of the film by the time he is supposed to be more sympathetic it's too late to care mark on the other hand follows in <UNK> moore's footsteps from ghost by crying <UNK> throughout the movie br br there is a bizarre switch in tone after mark returns suddenly we get some lame attempts at humor a la the tv show <UNK> but that doesn't last long once simon's emotional health is at stake the whole thing becomes increasingly <UNK> with amateurish attempts to jerk at your <UNK> the finale with a gold <UNK> muscle boy angel <UNK> a <UNK> mark to heaven while a <UNK> grief stricken simon waves goodbye is just <UNK> <UNK> because it isn't intentionally funny
<START> this movie is as unique as it is overlooked a different story is just that it shows how out of the need to survive or maintain one can find the capacity to love if you have an open heart as well as an open mind i first saw this on cable in the late 70's and it truly depicted the limitations of the gay community at the time i believe this movie was ahead of its time in depicting a little slice of an obscure way of life it is truly a classic in the sense that it was a <UNK> to what is now depicted as the extended family this film should be available on dvd vhs so that not only the extra ordinary performances of meg foster perry king can be acknowledged but to show how far we have come still have to go where relationships are concerned
<START> the <UNK> as titled in this movie are three college friends dave jeff and sam <UNK> <UNK> michael <UNK> and jason <UNK> respectively who are about to graduate from university without sitting through an honest <UNK> but making it end successfully this continues until the very end when unlikeable but the most likable character of the movie nathan <UNK> figures out what they are up to nathan starts <UNK> in order to make up with his dream girl as he cant pursue that in normal conditions the only problem is when the trio starts to work on it dave falls in love with the gorgeous and good hearted angela james king unfortunately not a brilliant genre movie <UNK> makes to watch the movie easy as his performance is brilliant king's performance is average i think she was hired just to be around with her gorgeous look the <UNK> is reminiscent of american pie with a different direction jokes are as shallow as in american pie but aren't they all used i think this movie is a warning to the filmmakers of the genre that they are running out of originality overall a few <UNK> moments but a horrible movie in terms of acting except for <UNK> and subject out of
<START> i absolutely loved this movie i am not even sure what particularly about it but i think it was wonderful and should be available for dvd the women were strangers and yet got along well enough to spend the time they did in the villa in italy the actors in my opinion did an excellent job the characters were all so different and yet clever story that made it work there is humor drama and relationship issues all in good time this requires 10 lines but i just can't think of any more to say so i will just <UNK> on until i get 10 lines so sorry about this what else can i possibly say it has been a long time since i last saw it i am looking forward to view again but it isn't available
<START> drawing restraint 9 <UNK> matthew barney br br how do you know when you're in the middle of a pretentious art film is it that there is only 8 lines of dialogue in <UNK> minutes of film is it when <UNK> is wearing what looks like a giant <UNK> pita on her head in a pseudo asian ritual maybe when <UNK> <UNK> and spinal <UNK> are used in a whale <UNK> experiment or when you're about ready to kill the composer for making a minimal and still annoying version of a philip glass score in any case drawing restraint 9 is among the most pretentious of the modern art movies at <UNK> minutes it adds to its <UNK> by being boring to boot i would call the use of color stunning and the opening sequence interesting but the rest of the movie looked like it was filmed for a discovery channel documentary that is until it looks like they were trying to film their version of p ss christ but that will be coming up later br br actually the documentary esquire portions were the best parts of it the surface plot is about a <UNK> ship and then there is a ritual about making whale fat then there are the guests in the form of <UNK> and matthew barney who are welcomed on the ship by being put through a ritual of <UNK> which includes passed out head <UNK> think frat boy pranks <UNK> <UNK> and giant <UNK> pita hats then there is mutual <UNK> <UNK> and lets not forget the giant turd br br matthew barney has written that this is about the relationship between self <UNK> resistance and creativity that's almost like saying if you don't get it then you're not creative in your interpretation so <UNK> off because i'm an artist oh wait that's the post modern interpretation of that sentence and what the movie would be about if it was post modern but its supposed to be modern art which is about the art itself br br so let's start this whole interpretation bit shall we the following lines are only 3 4 serious and should not be taken as any realistic attempt to interpret the movie br br the first half hour concerns pearl <UNK> and the construction of a giant <UNK> obviously the <UNK> is symbolic of the need for self <UNK> to whatever standards you hold dear and the pearl <UNK> are looking for <UNK> of wisdom then on a <UNK> ship they build a <UNK> that looks like it is in the crude shape of a whale obviously a crude element of <UNK> br br on the ship they make whale fat inside the shape of the whale and take out the <UNK> portion they replace this with a spinal <UNK> and later a giant turd these are supposed to be the states of the movie itself when its fat its entertaining but bad for you when it is the spinal <UNK> its the important parts of the movie or the <UNK> so to speak then the giant turd is the <UNK> of the movie or when the movie is crap br br <UNK> and matthew barney the arrive on separate ships are put into strange <UNK> outfits which aren't even well made or <UNK> one suspects that they ran out of money and barney was trying to quit smoking so they put <UNK> on his head they go through a ritual and learn about the ship from a japanese wise man who tells them that the ship is <UNK> from when another ship hit it a crash or <UNK> if you will this <UNK> <UNK> and barney who are different on the outside to start cutting each other's legs off and eat them so they could turn into <UNK> themselves and be the same person they <UNK> oh did i forget to mention that this has been done in a <UNK> williams video then the pearl <UNK> come back with their mouths full of <UNK> of knowledge which they let fall to make a stupid <UNK> <UNK> barney made it through <UNK> grade <UNK> obviously or maybe at least some social studies br br oh and did i forget <UNK> ear <UNK> i want to kill her score at times it is hypnotic but at others you just want to <UNK> her br br art film is one thing but when you just throw up all sorts of symbolism in the hopes of getting a reaction out of people it becomes a self destructive joke when do you cross the line between becoming a joke in terms of art <UNK> and <UNK> frequently made surreal pieces of nonsense but were more coherent and or entertaining than this piece of trash un <UNK> <UNK> had the sensibility to <UNK> as much symbolism as it could into less than half an hour br br so can i recommend this only if you like dull high art films with lots of symbolism and flat imagery br br d
<START> the 1930s saw a <UNK> for documentary films about remote <UNK> of the world with an emphasis on wild animals exotic <UNK> and primitive people with unusual cultures despite the <UNK> of <UNK> a film crew to a distant and dangerous place and then bringing 'em back alive with the film footage such films were often much cheaper to make than were conventional hollywood features because there were no expensive sets costumes or high <UNK> movie stars br br the most successful makers of such films artistically and <UNK> were the team of martin e johnson and his wife <UNK> who made several documentaries sometimes with blatantly staged events in africa and asia the <UNK> <UNK> films were extremely popular inspiring several parodies most notably <UNK> <UNK> so this is africa in which the very sexy esther <UNK> plays a character named mrs johnson <UNK> instead of martin e johnson <UNK> although several other filmmakers were producing <UNK> documentaries at this time the <UNK> films were the most popular in this genre because they relied heavily on humour viewed from our own more <UNK> i hope standpoint this is a serious flaw in the <UNK> documentaries there are too many scenes in which the funny little brown or yellow people are made to look complete idiots who are easily <UNK> by the clever white <UNK> johnson and his wife br br one definite asset of these movies is the presence of <UNK> johnson ten years younger than her husband she manages to seem young enough to be his daughter while certainly not as attractive as the <UNK> blond esther <UNK> <UNK> johnson was a <UNK> brunette who gave <UNK> performances in front of the camera in all the films she co produced with her husband br br <UNK> is probably the best of the <UNK> films the shots of the <UNK> are interesting and have some historical value as evidence of what this environment looked like in 1930 the shots of the <UNK> and other natives are also interesting although these suffer from the <UNK> <UNK> to stage events in a manner that makes the natives look <UNK> and alien br br the best and funniest scene in <UNK> is an improvised sequence in which <UNK> johnson attempts to teach a jazz dance to some <UNK> women the dance is the black bottom no less the same dance which bob hope <UNK> taught to daisy and <UNK> hilton the <UNK> twins wearing <UNK> riding boots and a <UNK> helmet <UNK> johnson starts <UNK> singing while she does high steps and <UNK> her knees in her attempt to teach this dance to the african women meanwhile they just stand there staring at her apparently wondering what this crazy white woman is trying to accomplish it's a very funny scene but it has unpleasant undertones <UNK> johnson is doing a dance that was invented by black americans the <UNK> seems to be that black <UNK> should <UNK> be able to perform this dance after a brief <UNK> using natural rhythm i guess because it's in their blood or something br br i'll rate <UNK> 4 points out of 10 this film says a little bit about african life in the 1930s and rather more about american cultural <UNK> in that same decade
<START> i find it sad that christians and i am one feel that we must make movies like left behind we have much better stories to tell that don't have to be so preachy i was very disappointed with this film as an aspiring filmmaker who believes in christ i see this film as the perfect example for what i am not going to do with my career in film
<START> the second of the why we fight series concentrates on hitler's grab of the <UNK> and beyond as he makes a <UNK> out of <UNK> chamberlain and <UNK> on his conquest of europe br br clearly meant as propaganda in its day this series over the test of time has become an informative documentary as well with most of the allied bias turning out to be historical fact the <UNK> <UNK> himself on his own <UNK> with smug <UNK> before his people and the world as he says one thing and does another as his army moves east the <UNK> and <UNK> quickly <UNK> but the <UNK> put up an heroic struggle against overwhelming odds br br the <UNK> between hitler's military might and chamberlain waving the <UNK> <UNK> like a white flag <UNK> peace in our time to this day has <UNK> propaganda qualities here in its original context it <UNK> even more <UNK> as the darkness of world war ll sets in on europe leaving the american viewer with two <UNK> freedom or slavery in 1943 there was no <UNK> this simple truth and the nazis strike makes its point effectively
<START> for me too this christmas special is one that i remember very <UNK> in 1989 i <UNK> up the 2 <UNK> i found of the soundtrack recording giving one to my sister and keeping the other for myself it's part of my family's christmas tradition now and i would love to be able to actually see the show again rather than just remember it as i listen br br it has been noted elsewhere that john denver made a number of appearances on the muppet show and they did more than one special together the good <UNK> between denver and his fuzzy companions comes through clearly here in a charming and fun show that is good for all ages
<START> tcm is keeping me awake all the time they keep coming up with films <UNK> never heard of <UNK> now ossessione a very early film by visconti wow the italian version of the <UNK> always rings twice brilliant beautifully acted and directed never heard of either leads who were excellent clara <UNK> as giovanna and especially <UNK> <UNK> as gino what a sensual man more muscular and attractive than anyone else on the screen in 1943 his look was ahead of its time many male stars from the 1950s were probably inspired by him he should have been a major world wide star the film is much better than the jack nicholson jessica lange version and less <UNK> than the mgm version which i really like with john garfield and <UNK> turner remember that white outfit who can forget this italian version is different more realistic and with a very different ending see it watch it im going to buy it
<START> ok clara bow silent film from <UNK> it's a spin off of rain with bow playing the half <UNK> wild daughter of the local <UNK> king who falls in love with the <UNK> english engineer clive <UNK> bow <UNK> with the local widow <UNK> <UNK> for his <UNK> but both women get a big surprise when his wife shows up patricia <UNK> the <UNK> wife is ready for a divorce until she discovers he might be on the verge of a fortune bow <UNK> her <UNK> fast br br bow has personality to spare and has a few great scenes her opening nude bath her <UNK> in a grass <UNK> and the dog rescue scene with bow and <UNK> doing their own stunts br br note the imdb credit list is wrong the film credits from the dvd i have list patricia <UNK> as playing mrs <UNK> not margaret <UNK> as listed on imdb
<START> oh dear what a horrid movie br br the production was so cheap and nasty remember the shot from the natural where the lightning hits the tree leaving a glowing <UNK> that roy <UNK> makes a bat from well the producers of this movie used that same scene to <UNK> a scene where a tree branch <UNK> into the house br br i wonder if they paid to use the footage from the natural or did they just hope that no one who would watch the film would pick it up br br then at the end where they were getting trying to get away in the truck such over acting in the cabin br br a really bad film a really bad film
<START> the premise for this movie is simple and so is the script an elderly muslim gets his teenage son to drive him in his similarly elderly station <UNK> from france to the <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> so that he can fulfill his holy muslim <UNK> before he dies the father is clearly <UNK> religious but the son is <UNK> he accepts out of <UNK> to his father rather than to religion he'd rather be with his non muslim girlfriend the father is stubborn in a lot of things which the son doesn't understand and the <UNK> between them is the device that maintains the drama although it is often rather <UNK> however like any good road movie there are oddball characters encountered along the way for example a woman on a <UNK> in <UNK> who upon being asked for directions to <UNK> simply gets in the <UNK> and points with her hand <UNK> one word which they assume to be a place but can't find it on the map in <UNK> another man they ask directions of <UNK> he can speak french but then provides an extensive commentary in <UNK> there is also occasional humor in one country the son <UNK> of eating egg <UNK> and wants meat they are given a goat but unfortunately perhaps fortunately for the viewer it runs away before the father can perform the muslim <UNK> ritual they eventually make it to <UNK> the muslim equivalent of the <UNK> but on a much <UNK> scale for <UNK> it is all bizarre but fascinating the movie isn't sophisticated but is charming in its own way a kind of national <UNK> with soul
<START> sure if you ask any mom who's the most beautiful baby in the world she'd tell you her son is the most amazing kid in the whole world she's right at least in her own world br br the producers of the movie were <UNK> mother and his good friend <UNK> oh well do i need to say more i'll break it down for those who doesn't want to do a simple <UNK> br br the whole movie was fake you may just put a few <UNK> mtv video together and call it a movie br br the beautiful angela <UNK> played <UNK> mother the real one in life looks like a dog br br i just wonder why he called himself <UNK> small big body small dick big mouth small sound big fat small eyes <UNK> i'm a person of color so keep your racist remark to yourself
<START> pushing daisies for sure is one of the best tv shows of its genre in the last 5 years agree you with that or not bryan fuller the creator has an amazing creative mind he's the mind behind other great tv shows as dead like me 2003 <UNK> 2004 and the other one not as great as these ones but also interesting heroes 2006 it's a mix of the marvelous worlds brian fuller created in previous tv shows mixing once again an amazing fantasy world with real kinds of people disguised into colorful images and exaggerated feelings something that a fairytale always is so being a kind of fairytale you cannot expect more than a unrealistic world and unexpected situations or also situations a lot expected but not in a way that it would usually be told br br a gift always comes with a curse and what is sweet can also be bitter that's so ned lee pace the <UNK> is a simple guy with an interesting gift other than being an amazing chef he can give life to the dead with just a touch this could be a power that everybody would die or live for if wasn't for another simple and very sad thing he can also gives the forever dead if he touches it again the curse of this amazing gift doesn't stops there everything has a <UNK> and if he brings anything to life for more than one minute another <UNK> of that one would die instantly he's a guy full of unfortunate events in life in a way that he grown up <UNK> always afraid to touch everything and lose once more things he one day used to love till the day he could finally be close to his biggest childhood love chuck anna <UNK> if wasn't for another sad fact she was dead he gave her life again and she loves him so much as he does but this love is <UNK> the truly kiss of death and that's how this beautiful modern fairytale starts br br when i heard about pushing daisies for the first time it was promoted as something very familiar or maybe some kind of tribute to everything that tim burton has created since pee <UNK> big adventure 1985 to big fish 2003 and charlie and the <UNK> factory 2005 the results could not be better the world around the pie hole was magnificent the stories around ned and detective <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to solve <UNK> crimes can be a lot common in tv but this is just a way to guide people thru amazing stories surrounding characters as chuck and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in a wonderful world full of beautiful and dreamy images that you can almost sense the taste of the colors not only that you are <UNK> into a bunch of amazing and charismatic gentle characters even those ones with the most deep dark <UNK> br br forgetting the trivial concept of murders and <UNK> crimes the show <UNK> and is <UNK> in a lot of other things the actors here are top of note lee pace is tender soft and contained as the character asks for anna <UNK> is the <UNK> of the show as her character is supposed to be but the most superb times are always with the supporting actors as <UNK> <UNK> detective <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> charles ellen greene as vivian charles and <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shines performing a so <UNK> character drowned in a impossible dark humor that could <UNK> a clown for sure she has the best dialogs and her expressions and body languages are mesmerizing but if the best dialogs are given by <UNK> and her character the best funny moments are given by <UNK> <UNK> seems that she's <UNK> all the time she's so naturally fun that every single scene is a show aside <UNK> shines so bright in the show that winning the 2009 emmy for her supporting role in the show was totally fair and deserved also there's the chemistry between actors and their characters that are also amazing br br there are no words to express what this tv show really is and what it was meant to be for those ones who think this show is a waste of time or claimed to find no sense in it for sure needs to open their minds and comeback to a time that they probably never had childhood br br truth be told tv has never been so daring in a tv show as with this amazing one pushing daisies was a huge step forward in terms of great artistic entertainment and its sudden death was a lot <UNK> it's true that tv doesn't respect great tv shows as those ones bryan fuller created except heroes that's still on air and is far from being so amazing as the other ones
<START> if you like films that are totally bizarre then this one is for you <UNK> is one mean mother with a passion for <UNK> people and eating ham you should check this film out just for a laugh it is a low budget sci fi musical comedy <UNK> classic if you get bored of the film half way through you should <UNK> just for the sake of seeing the aliens which are nothing more than little toy robots but in my opinion are the films highlight i'm the big meat eater pass me
<START> it's one of the best movies i've seen in the last 2 years i've seen the <UNK> in tel <UNK> israel in the summer of 2006 exactly when the last war has began this problem in communication between the people that causes wars is interesting me for a long time and it doesn't matter who boys and girls straight and gays jews and <UNK> i've seen the bubble already 3 times and it still surprising and exciting me each character reminds me of one of the many people i know and the difference between them like between tel <UNK> and <UNK> the last time i saw it was with my friend who is a christian arab and it was on the independence day of israel the most symbolic i could how ironic and he cried in the end if he's been touched and wasn't embarrassed everyone would be touched by the bubble
<START> 'the <UNK> is among the great or near great films of <UNK> that are available today the year was a turning point for the feature length film especially in america lois <UNK> <UNK> cecil b <UNK> 'the <UNK> and of course d w <UNK> 'the birth of a <UNK> set new <UNK> for the art additionally that year russian filmmaker <UNK> bauer made two of his best pictures <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the french serial <UNK> <UNK> also has its <UNK> today although i disagree with them the <UNK> of the feature length film was led by europe mainly <UNK> france and italy but <UNK> of this market and to a degree the art <UNK> to across the atlantic in <UNK> br br the most <UNK> artistic achievement of 'the <UNK> is its stunning and often innovative cinematography there are some <UNK> <UNK> mobile framing including a brief <UNK> <UNK> shot of the italian racing to buy a wedding ring and another shot of him holding onto a moving car and in general there is wise use of varied camera angles and expert lighting throughout an especially amazing shot is a close up of the italian <UNK> as he slowly approaches the camera for an extreme close up in reference to d w <UNK> <UNK> of pig <UNK> <UNK> he's so <UNK> his environment even begins to shake around his anger br br unfortunately the cinematographer appears to be unknown the director although originally without credit in the film is now known to have been <UNK> barker five or so of his other films made for <UNK> are also available today but are rather <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which he worked on was a large production but a deeply flawed movie by the way i'd guess that one or more of the various <UNK> who worked on <UNK> also photographed 'the <UNK> br br moreover the entire production is very advanced for then <UNK> and new york are well rendered despite the film being shot in los angeles for <UNK> <UNK> and san francisco for the ethnic <UNK> of new york there are extensive flashbacks although perhaps one or two too many i especially like the clever framing of the narrative as being read in a book by a character played by the same actor george <UNK> who is also the lead in the inner main narrative the reading of the story is further briefly framed by the opening at the beginning and closing at the end of curtain <UNK> <UNK> la the theatre which is reflected within the inner story during the revenge climax in the child's room with the opening and closing of window <UNK> parallel editing in camera <UNK> and <UNK> and such are handled expertly additionally <UNK> and clara williams as his wife play their parts well br br on the other hand 'the <UNK> does have a few <UNK> the film's early moments of comedy clash rather <UNK> with the latter parts of harsh and heavy melodrama although the <UNK> changes from <UNK> italy to <UNK> new york works <UNK> because it's supported by the lighting and photography the harsh <UNK> of the american dream in this film enhanced by the stark photography must have been poignant to the immigrant classes who comprised a <UNK> large population of the movie going public back then the <UNK> character should have been <UNK> more his brief introduction <UNK> for another politician seems <UNK> for his later <UNK> to the <UNK> revenge in addition the filmmakers were either <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> to not explain the lack of <UNK> of the <UNK> and the <UNK> faith in the healing powers of <UNK> for the other child aside from the <UNK> in plot 'the <UNK> is exceptionally well made
<START> this was soul provoking i am an iranian and living in <UNK> 21st century i didn't know that such big <UNK> have been living in such conditions at the time of my grandfather br br you see that today or even in <UNK> on one side of the world a lady or a baby could have everything served for him or her clean and on demand but here 80 years ago people <UNK> their life to go to somewhere with more grass it's really interesting that these <UNK> bear those difficulties to find <UNK> for their sheep but they lose many the sheep on their way br br i praise the americans who accompanied this tribe they were as tough as <UNK> people
<START> this movie is <UNK> <UNK> second <UNK> in movies after his excellent character study in el <UNK> del <UNK> with <UNK> de <UNK> he creates extremely well done characters far away from <UNK> and with an <UNK> chemistry between them i've seen <UNK> talent to present every character in a lighthearted way but just enough to involve us emotionally with them his control over them is magnificent so he <UNK> on the movie a great direction and an overall brilliantly polished script the characters laugh and cry with real sentiment and invite the viewer to join them in their emotions and their evolution on screen br br the spanish takes over the english the <UNK> <UNK> urban landscape at night <UNK> hollywood sets and the premise is just as interesting as any other so we have a film daring to compete over hollywood's <UNK> br br but i want you to see the movie mainly because i've never dealt with such endearing characters all of them it seems the script suits perfectly to the actors and vice versa i really believe with a film making like this <UNK> is really up to the competition
<START> spoiler alert all throughout australia the summer turned into a <UNK> of rain and <UNK> stones the size of <UNK> that was causing havoc in <UNK> cities like sydney it's under these <UNK> conditions that tax lawyer david burton richard chamberlain got involved in a case as a defense attorney involving the death of a local <UNK> who was found dead outside a sydney bar br br having five fellow <UNK> arrested for billy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> death it's determined by the police <UNK> that billy died of drowning not by violence even though he had <UNK> on his neck and shoulders yet the court decided to <UNK> the five for his death <UNK> them with <UNK> instead of murder br br david defending the five gets no help from them in their defense with the accused <UNK> <UNK> to remain quite and keep what happened to billy to themselves and take what's coming to them from the court one of the <UNK> chris david <UNK> begin to somehow <UNK> david's dreams as if he <UNK> to tell him what was really behind <UNK> death br br david at first not taking his dreams of chris seriously begins to sense that their real when he meet him at the <UNK> chris <UNK> david's dreams by showing him a strange looking black rock that david saw chris have in his dreams later meeting chris and what turns out to be an <UNK> <UNK> charlie <UNK> <UNK> who came to his house that evening david is told that he like charlie has spiritual powers that he inherited from his mother's grandfather those powers will reveal to him the future that has to do with the strange weather conditions that are <UNK> the australian continent the earth chris tells david is going through a gigantic <UNK> cycle with the old world about to be washed away and the new world ready to take it's place br br david is confused about what both chris and charlie are telling him but as the <UNK> continue to increase and the ocean waves start to rise he feels that something terrible is going to happen david <UNK> to know if it's all <UNK> <UNK> or there's some scientific facts or logic behind their end of world like revelations br br by now it's obvious that both chris and charlie are members of an <UNK> tribe right in the heart of modern sydney that alone can get chris off as well as his four friends for the murder of billy since the australian government will not <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> leaving any justice to be done by the <UNK> themselves still chris refuses to admit he's a member of a native tribe and he and his four friends are convicted of <UNK> in <UNK> death with the sentences to be handed down by the judge within days br br david now determined to find out what was the reason for <UNK> silence and why billy had to die is taken by chris to the scene of the crime it's there that david finds out that billy betrayed <UNK> tribe members by going there with billy not being a member of <UNK> <UNK> tribe it's also revealed to david that he himself has some kind of spiritual connection with the <UNK> <UNK> as both charlie and his step father <UNK> burton david <UNK> told him br br the stage is now set for the great and final <UNK> cycle that david's been seeing in both his night time dreams and day time visions it comes in the form of a massive <UNK> wave rolling out of the pacific ocean into the australian coast city of sydney and then <UNK> the entire continent
<START> sure it was well shot and made very well shot and made but the story was just so weak and the portrayal of lincoln was even weaker not that henry fonda wasn't good but the character he played was nothing but a <UNK> do you mean to tell me that lincoln was a wise cracking smart ass with no respect of the law or the court i mean who the hell was he supposed to be cousin <UNK> i mean come on i'll just call you jackass then i understand that ford was going for great funny hero guy but i didn't really like this guy at all he <UNK> in sports talks like a real sweet <UNK> and does not seem to know were to sit in a courtroom how am i supposed to take this seriously br br the twist was even weaker i mean come on that was just stupid the whole story seemed like it was thought up by some 5 year old in his or her dreams saying that i liked it enough it was very entertaining and made me laugh at several occasions so i can't say it's a bad film in fact i must say that i must say it's good enough nothing that entertains me and makes me laugh can be bad but this vivid and silly story was just so ridiculous that i can't understand how anyone could consider it great br br i have no idea how historically accurate this film was but if any of it was true i would really have to shake my head
<START> br br after dark my sweet is a strange mix of <UNK> and <UNK> the film runs slow very slow but takes a <UNK> to tell a story about murder and passion jason <UNK> never ever was so sexy and powerful the man gives a true performance and rachel ward is all but sexy br br the sexual tension the <UNK> heat the footsteps of the past the flashback scenes the weirdness of the <UNK> character all becomes a sexy mystery i recommend this one cause is the more sexy dull movie that i ever seen check the love making scene it´s <UNK> sexy
<START> this show was appreciated by critics and those who realized that any similarities between pushing daisies style and anyone else's was not a steal yes i've seen <UNK> pushing daisies is somewhat similar but still different enough to be original rather there are too few shows on tv that have this kind of quirky charm the greatest similarity is to dead like me but p d comes by that similarity honestly bryan fuller created both shows both shows involve an undead young woman for example this show never stopped being funny and charming and it was always odd yet was consistently <UNK> br br i must say a word about the conventions of on going story lines some people have complained that this show lacked a moral center because in the first and several subsequent episodes ned seems to get away with causing the death of <UNK> father without consequences of any kind first of all this must be a new definition of without consequences of any kind because in spite of the fact that ned was only a boy and did not realize that he had caused the death of <UNK> father he nevertheless felt guilty from the moment he realized what he had done further about a dozen episodes into the series ned finally did confess to chuck that he had caused her father's death with his gift now there are no police to charge people with magically causing one person's death by bringing another person back to life so the questions of <UNK> and <UNK> have to be taken up without societal <UNK> in other words it's between ned and chuck who was not inclined to forgive ned anytime soon br br but this does point out a problem with continuing story lines in network dramas i remember when david <UNK> character on <UNK> blue did something wrong and it seemed he got away with it for a whole year then he got caught and was forced to <UNK> from the job and left the show the point is viewers should learn by now and not assume that just because a regular character does something wrong in a single episode and is not caught in that episode that he has gotten away with it there is always next week and maybe even next year
<START> this is one of the best ensemble comedy musical b film's that i have seen and since i'm in my 40's now and only seeing this now i am not an expert but i have seen all the well known films out there when there are a ton of actors getting their lead for minutes at a time usually the comedy <UNK> with the musical bits and very often the musical pieces <UNK> the comedic flow call me in a crazy kind of mood but when i saw this on tcm europe i was laughing out loud with pleasure so who delivered the laughs for me without a doubt <UNK> <UNK> delivered me some terrific gut <UNK> laughs he even steals the ending it was great speaking of which i think why this movie works is because although l h are a selling point and why i got hooked to watch this one them and hal roach i love them in their early hal roach stuff this keeps them at a minimum and stays <UNK> on adult fare by 1930's standards and not that far from today's standards if you read between the lines jack <UNK> is also great to watch i admit that i only know him from w o oz and i loved him there and i also laughed out loud here at his <UNK> bit in the show <UNK> kelly is the only ugly femme in the 30's movies that actually turns me on something tells me she was a <UNK> in real life and the musical numbers have a real professional production busby <UNK> quality that blew me away from what i am used to in this genre i could go on and on but rest assured i really enjoyed this movie 8 of 10 i saw it on tcm europe and will record it to watch again with my wife on tcm usa good stuff
<START> why does this have such a low rating i really don't get it is it because of the bad acting the bad dialogue well who cares about these things in cheesy low budget horror movies seriously the acting and the dialogue isn't important in those movies people who hate movies only because of bad acting and bad dialogue shouldn't be allowed to rate cheesy low budget movies those movies shouldn't be taken seriously period br br anyway time to talk about the movie right well i loved it i bought it because i expected a <UNK> but it's not a <UNK> and the gore is pretty bad most of the time it's just animal guts placed on the body of the actors and that's lame but i didn't really care because the movie is hilarious the characters are hilarious the acting is hilarious bad acting is a good thing in cheesy low budget horror movies the dialogue is hilarious bad dialogue is a good thing in cheesy low budget horror movies the zombie rapist with a huge dick is hilarious the flying demon baby is hilarious and i could go on and on and on but i don't want to say too much but i have to mention that there's a scene in which a girl <UNK> a sex doll like it's alive lol oh and the zombie rapist falls in love with the sex doll lol br br best lines in the movie br br detective manners <UNK> coke detective sloane what the <UNK> are you doing manners what the hell did you <UNK> what the hell is that detective manners it's nothing man it's <UNK> cold medicine br br detective manners <UNK> heroin in his arm detective sloane what the <UNK> are you doing manners are you <UNK> insane detective manners it's cold medicine br br detective manners repeatedly kicks a random guy in the face detective sloane what the <UNK> going on manners what are you doing detective manners this maniac was rambling about demons and then he started <UNK> his head on the rock he just started <UNK> his head on the rock i think he's on <UNK> or something br br lol
<START> i have read the novel <UNK> of ben <UNK> a <UNK> years ago and last night i accidentally came to see this adaption br br although it's been years since i read the story the first time the differences between the novel and the movie are <UNK> very important elements which made the whole thing plausible are just written out or changed to bad br br if the plot sounds interesting to you go and get the novel its much much much better br br still 4 out of 10 since it was hard to stop watching because of the great basic plot by ben <UNK>
<START> a few weeks ago the german <UNK> <UNK> advertised this movie as the tv event of the year sorry but i've seen better things on tv this year br br i didn't thought much of the movie but i soon <UNK> about two other horrible movies when i watched the commercial namely titanic and pearl harbor because the picture looked so familiar the heroine if i can really call her that in the middle and her two loved ones next to her pearl harbor anyone in fact the love story is a poor man's version of the one in pearl harbor and that one was already poor br br but as i like watching movies and <UNK> their <UNK> i eventually decided to watch that rubbish the movie begins with a doctor leaving his family for the military strike against russia near the end of the third <UNK> promising his wife that he will return now fast forward to spring 1948 germany lost the war and the allies russia captured the country and they both try to eliminate each other for world power and their <UNK> capitalism versus communism well i guess you already know the story because you have to know it the movie doesn't really bother with it so much and literally takes a dump on historical facts the movie tries to depict the us government as angels and completely ignores the contribution of other countries during the <UNK> especially great britain who was responsible for nearly a quarter of the <UNK> despite having their country bombed from a country that they're trying to help br br what was also pretty annoying were the historical remarks the people said in the movie like when the <UNK> mother tells her daughter that germany might be <UNK> in two with a response like that's impossible or when <UNK> where the director thought we just stick similarly looking mustache on the actor and he will look like him says that russia has to stop <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> in germany yeah right if <UNK> has ever said something like this or there is this one us pilot who tells his fellow of a bread with meat and everything possible in it please <UNK> were invented way before that time br br in the movie you once see a map showing the <UNK> <UNK> enough the map looks like it came straight out of a laser <UNK> in <UNK> the us general <UNK> clay who's main idea was to stay in berlin is portrayed as a guy who is mean and grumpy and all the ideas he historically had like for example the <UNK> and <UNK> on that idea came from the <UNK> character phillip turner the love interest of the main actress which leads me to other aspects not enough african american soldiers in the movie there were like two in the whole film also relationships between us soldiers and german civilians was not allowed and by a revealing of such a relationship the us soldier would've been sent home i don't want to say that there were no relationships at all but in this movie there was a couple that almost got married if it wasn't for the death of the pilot in his fake cgi plane which looked terribly unrealistic especially the cgi fire br br if it wasn't enough all americans in this movie spoke accent free german although they only were in germany for a couple of months look i'm also american living in germany for my whole life and even i have a little accent notably bad was also the child acting the kids had like two expressions on their faces normal i look monotonous like a robot and <UNK> br br all in all the movie was boring from beginning to end moving way too slow especially the love story which was the same as the one in pearl harbor just with half of the dialogue the sad part is that the movie was very successful 8 <UNK> millions watched the first part and 7 <UNK> millions the second part the day after thus <UNK> receiving two <UNK> wins in the overall market share and a <UNK> win in the commercial relevant group but like i always think the biggest pile of bull crap is where the most flies go to
<START> i remember being terrified of movie blood when i was younger and gradually getting less so until getting jaded enough as i'm sure many other viewers have become so that the <UNK> of gory films produced in last few years have entertained me but not scared me or made me <UNK> the dentist turned that around br br the setup seems simple a mentally unstable dentist <UNK> havoc on the <UNK> of mouths and perhaps bodies as well a clever twist though is that the dentist is the film's protagonist so instead of being some one dimensional bad guy with no clear motivation his development is the most extensive of any character and he is very human and believable the viewer thus feels sympathy for him as well as his victims and instead of hoping for justice to come to him i found myself hoping he would somehow find a way to cover up his tracks and return to a normal life br br what really makes a horror movie is the violence and the dentist does it better than any other film i can think of first off the film has tons of tension which is something that modern gore films tend to lack in one scene the dentist is emotionally <UNK> and has to see a young child patient for the first time as he reaches into the child's mouth you hope that for the <UNK> and the child's sake the encounter ends without injury i won't spoil what happens second when the gore does come it hits all the worst <UNK> nerves once again i won't give anything away br br of course being a movie that you've never heard of it does have flaws most importantly it's exclusively for horror fans also as another reviewer mentioned by taking place over a span of just a few days we don't really get any background on the characters and the tension drops a little bit during the very end but really the fact that we would even want to know background about the characters is evidence to how good it is and the bulk of the film is solid enough that any small <UNK> in tension can be forgiven br br it's strange after years of being <UNK> to movie gore to suddenly want to cover my eyes at the sight of blood the dentist made me scared and thoroughly uncomfortable and for this it earns my full <UNK>
<START> deliverance is a dead on example of what wonderful movies came out of the '70s while your jaw is dropped during a terminator movie are you really sacred i don't think so because you are there to see what new <UNK> have been strung together plot matters not br br so many daily situations can become terrifying for no reason at all because there are so many people involved in daily living like a trip to the market or a walk down a <UNK> <UNK> street deliverance is so frightening because those innocent actions can turn deadly in a heart beat <UNK> into the backwoods is a <UNK> in fun anyone who has that notion does not read the papers watch the daily news nor has not seen some of the other movies that depict the seriousness of <UNK> into <UNK> where <UNK> are not welcome it is almost unbelievable that the advance dish on deliverance didn't inform almost everyone going to view it this was no <UNK> and <UNK> like a pig wasn't a part of <UNK> <UNK> br br i hate the term <UNK> because as some users wrote that <UNK> entire <UNK> of people who are very content to live as they know how without the <UNK> of modern life much is made of <UNK> that is not sexuality peculiar to the backwoods <UNK> should teach us that lesson however city <UNK> are extremely dumb to enter a closed society and give them attitude i know lots of <UNK> they are moral people when left to themselves their justice can be brutal when they feel threatened or <UNK> just like the justice in city streets they don't need any part of the city the city should take its <UNK> ing and camping to legal sites br br deliverance was the last film i found jon voight to do any real acting i hope i'm wrong he was extremely <UNK> for midnight cowboy because he was unknown but demonstrated that he could do that role at the drop of a hat his acting in deliverance was superb it gave us a clear <UNK> ordinary people can move mountains if it's necessary but who wants to be thought of as ordinary today his <UNK> <UNK> at the dinner was brilliant wow for burt reynolds one must ask what led him into those other tacky films his <UNK> although misguided in this film set the pace for the <UNK> necessary to make it out of the wilderness not only in the backwoods but the wilderness of everyday life ned beatty was stellar his underwear may not have had <UNK> <UNK> on it but his shell shocked performance was perfect as noted he became stronger than any of the group by the end of the movie <UNK> cox played the moral guy to the <UNK> every man should have his determination to do what is right several users have <UNK> he was shot or lost his balance when he pitched into the river my theory is that he was so disgusted with the whole journey he committed suicide no <UNK> was heard during the scene and voight and beatty did not find a wound br br james <UNK> certainly knows how to <UNK> a suspenseful tale and was great as the sheriff it is said he was so terrified of acting he came to the set drunk every day his character could see the three <UNK> <UNK> were guilty of surviving but also knew they didn't stand a chance against a jury of the local people no matter how kindly they were treated in <UNK> he was also aware that the <UNK> of the locals could be cruel justice don't come back up here again not many users knew <UNK> were used in the film where ever it was possible what actors could portray them better the mountain men were actually mountain men br br every detail of this movie was perfect no doubt it was dangerous to play in play in better fight for your life in i've experienced some near dangerous incidents and am content to live outside of the <UNK> you guys who feel your <UNK> raging can have my part br br that we have absolutely killed and continue to do so <UNK> areas of this country in <UNK> to be able to view its <UNK> on any media is enthralling but it leaves a bitter taste to realize some do not care about it los angeles where i live is a perfect example it's built up right into the <UNK> for wild animals and <UNK> believes humans come before animals those are their <UNK> <UNK> we should leave them be just that any wonder why <UNK> and bears and wolves wander into <UNK> they're theirs br br in some less threatening way we all need to experience the lessons to be learned from deliverance to understand our <UNK> <UNK> does not lead to supremacy i thank all those city <UNK> who went out into the wilderness to produce this modern classic so that it can scare the heck out of me when i watch it you can have the thrill of danger i'll stick to the tv 30 out of 10
<START> <UNK> wrote his own screen adaptation of this <UNK> prize winning play but didn't live to see it produced he had won an oscar in 1938 for his brilliant adaptation of his <UNK> play <UNK> when otto preminger <UNK> produced and directed this production in 1957 seven years after <UNK> death he had noted british author graham greene do the adaptation and it was a solid choice br br taking a cue from <UNK> own screenplay greene uses material from the stage <UNK> to create a framing device to <UNK> the two acts of the play one early and one late in <UNK> story into a <UNK> and most satisfying whole where on stage the shift in tone is <UNK> with an <UNK> here it works just as well with a return to king charles <UNK> <UNK> where the man joan put on the throne is dreaming of the events which led to his current situation and more material from <UNK> <UNK> the introduction of the <UNK> of john <UNK> <UNK> the english king maker br br the majority of the language is solid <UNK> and the performances from <UNK> <UNK> like felix <UNK> <UNK> or harry <UNK> de <UNK> to relative <UNK> the film established jean <UNK> career are first rate it may jar some only familiar with richard <UNK> many movie villains to see him playing a <UNK> and somewhat silly <UNK> but the performance oddly top billed is professional even if arguably miscast br br the symbolism of the opening credits and the director's choice to use the visual <UNK> of black and white filming all serve shaw and the story well go in expecting quality entertainment and you won't be disappointed
<START> poorly made <UNK> crime drama aimed <UNK> at the black urban market of the early 1970s pam <UNK> stars in the title role that of a nurse who becomes a one woman vigilante after drug dealing thugs make <UNK> little sister a <UNK> violent nonsense <UNK> along <UNK> with <UNK> energy and excitement only <UNK> <UNK> temper gives the narrative a <UNK> she's not much of an actress here but she <UNK> with the audience in a primal way not much different from what charles bronson was doing at this time the film was <UNK> and advertised as crass exploitation yet still managed to find a <UNK> inner city audience today however it's merely a <UNK> in '70s film history and lacks the wide range appeal of other movies in this genre 1 2 from
<START> perhaps it's me and my perverted ways or the fact that i tend to have a very sick mind but i rented this film at random one very weird night and to my great surprise i enjoyed it br br yes i read the synopsis on the back of the dvd box and read that it had been banned for 25 years and figured i was prepared for anything it would offer i was clearly <UNK> after seeing well everything to cut a long story short i can see why it was banned not only for such explicit sex scenes but for <UNK> br br of course as it is <UNK> based on the classic fairy tale of beauty and the beast a personal favorite of mine it tells the story of a girl's sexual awakening over a dream about a <UNK> being chased by a whatever the hell that thing was like beast with an enormous <UNK> and a substantial amount of <UNK> of course the beast gets what he wants and the <UNK> decides she likes it and they continue <UNK> in the woods br br but that's not all oh there is so much more br br not only do we get to see <UNK> sex but there's also <UNK> horses the babysitter who gets down and dirty with the slave when she's not <UNK> the bed to get her er satisfaction and the <UNK> girl <UNK> with rose <UNK> br br creative and enjoyable but it did take a while for my father to talk to me again after he watched it after i went to bed i was 15 words of advice when watching this film make sure you're the only one who knows you have it and watch it with the <UNK> closed it may be fun but i doubt there are other porn films like this one
<START> purple rain what else can i say the title speaks for itself but i think all the actors were well picked the movie had a great story i loved it ever since i watched that movie i've been stuck in the eighties and i'm only 13 my favorite part of the movie was when his father died and he was picking up all of his music compositions and the <UNK> was sitting on the <UNK> with his <UNK> in her hand critics say that its a drama but i think its more of a romance murphy brown also did a great job in the movie he actually acted like himself i'm so glad i've seen this movie the song purple rain beautifully sung was so heartfelt i cried more than once
<START> like many others have commented before me here i have to say that this movie is bad but not the worst i've seen there will be no direct references to movie plots or sequences in this comment because i hate spoilers br br i got a feeling i was watching an episode of a tv show or something where they had gotten a hold of some extra to spend on cgi i've seen worse of those all in all it is quite an insult to the viewer at least if you have any knowledge about computers and or technology at all there are just too many of these moments of insults to make me feel comfortable and i found myself just begging for it all to end fast halfway through in addition there are countless easy way out scenarios which also is an insult to your intelligence as a thinking human being br br this movie absolutely fades in comparison to the old <UNK> and i think it's a damn shame they even got to call it a sequel br br two stars from me because of one thing and one thing only the actors' performances aren't half bad considering the <UNK> crap of a script they had to work with still they should never have signed on to this movie not really a career move but i guess we all have bills to pay br br to those of you who gave this movie top score you have to be on the <UNK> <UNK> or something that's my only explanation br br to all who haven't seen this one by all means watch it and make up your own mind but lower your expectations to the floor and then some
<START> i figured that it's about time i let this one out <UNK> fans are suffering in america these days why because we rely on kids wb and <UNK> entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies as far as the series goes they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the japanese versions to television so what is their problem when it comes to the movies honestly now i have seen all three <UNK> movies in japanese and i will definitely be seeing the fourth one they are excellent movies they are all enjoyable and fun to watch and after seeing <UNK> 2000 in theaters i can't help but wonder how these american producers read the japanese scripts the way it appears it seems that they read and see something that says insert empty moral <UNK> in big bold faced letters it definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on <UNK> extreme sarcasm there and created this crap br br possible spoilers from here on br br well i guess i should first talk about <UNK> rescue adventure my first <UNK> with this came with no narration i guess they got enough bad comments on the <UNK> narration that plagued <UNK> vacation and instead of going with a caring gentle woman's voice as appeared in <UNK> no <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> they just cut the narration all together this wouldn't have been a problem except for one thing did anyone really understand why the <UNK> didn't let <UNK> go until the end possibly the fans but i'm sure not the parents then there's the theme song i couldn't help but roll my eyes at this one the japanese theme song was <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and was sung by japanese children it was fun and enjoyable this one nauseating now one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing <UNK> nice music fun to watch that's changed with the <UNK> the music sucked for one but on top of that they had all the <UNK> talk during the music which turned out to be <UNK> annoying and just unnecessary oh and then there's the <UNK> who thinks he's a <UNK> you'd think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are basically not much could save this little ill <UNK> dub which is very unfortunate considering its potential but i haven't touched on the worst of it yet br br you'd think that the warning signs would've been apparent to me when i received my issue of <UNK> power for some <UNK> reason i had been placing some faith in <UNK> and the wb my thoughts were well they screwed up on the first movie but the second is different as far as the theme goes so they should do well ' that in mind i just didn't pay attention to the warning signs i encountered in the theaters when the trailers said you will believe that one person can make all the difference ' with the way they said that at every turn i was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like <UNK> did at the end of the english version then comes <UNK> power in which i see all my fears realized in the words the main feature 'the power of one ' at that point i became a bit more uneasy the power of one ' not a good sign however i still kept some of my false faith big mistake br br sitting in the theater i was literally getting stomach <UNK> watching another movie which i loved in japanese being turned into complete and utter junk i hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle i can see a point in that since they didn't <UNK> this thing repeating it over and over like in <UNK> however it did more damage than anything else in this movie first of all the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read the world turns to ash ' ah <UNK> so ash is the chosen one whatever in the japanese version the inhabitants of <UNK> needed a <UNK> <UNK> to carry out their traditional ceremony this time he's the chosen one a greater way that this did damage was to <UNK> <UNK> was one of the coolest characters in a <UNK> movie when the movie was about <UNK> in this one <UNK> is forced to take a back seat to ash in the scene where they're flying back to the main island <UNK> and ash are discussing the conditions of <UNK> existence not that ash is going to make all the difference overall in this category ash wasn't really the one <UNK> that would make the difference since he was helped by many along the way br br a lot of the other stuff is kind of <UNK> picking <UNK> <UNK> song wasn't nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the japanese one <UNK> speech to them saying his collection started with a <UNK> card ' ugh even worse <UNK> outrage originally concerned the way <UNK> and <UNK> were being held why didn't you put them in <UNK> when you caught them this is like <UNK> them to be displayed ' much different from whining about him thinking <UNK> are things to be <UNK> like <UNK> if there were any real redeeming values in this they came from team rocket some pretty funny lines not really to make me laugh out loud but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach well that was officially the last american <UNK> movie i'm going to see i've <UNK> the third one and find it very enjoyable i would rather not see another japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two i'll be <UNK> the fourth one as well forget you kids wb and <UNK> you have <UNK> me for the last time
<START> this is cult stuff my friends and i get together once a year to enjoy this movie its very funny and very dry i've seen this move dozens of times and have yet not to enjoy it the actors are funny and it gets better with every viewing if you enjoyed morons from out of space you will love this a great play on war of the worlds i love the red neck rampage to get the aliens the bug on the hood the <UNK> the heat seeking <UNK> <UNK> the mine field the red <UNK> breaking the speed limit by <UNK> i'll get the bucket very funny i would love for this to come out on dvd forget the negative reviews see it for yourself
<START> the film is almost laughable with debbie reynolds and shelley winters <UNK> up as the mothers of convicted murderers with the horrible <UNK> after the trial the two women team up and leave n y for california in order to open and song and dance studio for shirley temple like girls br br from the beginning it becomes apparent that reynolds has made a mistake in taking winters with her to california winters plays a deeply religious woman who increasingly seems to be going off her rocker br br to make matters worse the women who live together are receiving menacing phone calls reynolds who puts on a blond wig is soon <UNK> by the wealthy father of one of her students nicely played by dennis weaver br br <UNK> <UNK> in one of her last films briefly is seen as sister <UNK> who winters is a faithful <UNK> of br br the film really belongs to shelley winters she is heavy here and <UNK> seemed to make her acting even better winters always did well in roles testing her nerves br br the ending is of the macabre and who can forget winters at the piano <UNK> away with that totally insane look
<START> <UNK> palace is the story of two best friends alice and <UNK> who go on a spontaneous trip to thailand and wind up in prison after being caught with planted drugs in their <UNK> in this way the movie had the potential to turn into a serious and moving film such as return to paradise but instead the movie chose to focus little on the girls' situation and more on their friendship br br claire danes and kate beckinsale both turn in excellent performances and the movie is much more about the interplay between them the suspicion the jealousy the questioning and testing of their friendship and ultimately the sacrifices made in the name of friendship this movie chooses not to delve too deeply into politics or even into the <UNK> of prison life which is a bit <UNK> over and focuses more on these friendship issues br br there were some plot holes here and some parts that just didn't seem believable or realistic we didn't feel the real fear or <UNK> of their situation as well as we might have and we get very little feeling of life outside the prison walls with bill <UNK> playing the supposedly sleazy lawyer who actually turns out to have a heart of gold in short this should by all rights have been a much darker movie than it was br br but overall i enjoyed it the acting was good the soundtrack was perfect and the storyline had enough twists and turns to stay interesting worth seeing
<START> i really wanted to like this but in the end it's a poorly made film with too few laughs br br the politics are spot on it's gonna offend the hell out of <UNK> but that's what it's designed to do that alone gives me reason to chuckle br br the problem is it looks like it was made in a real hurry like about a week and it contains a stupid subplot about some bimbo singer which seems to be completely off topic br br <UNK> is obviously iraq or afghanistan or any other number of countries the us has f <UNK> with since the 50s the humour is a little dark <UNK> dancing with <UNK> legs made by <UNK> corporation but it is on the mark especially with the <UNK> <UNK> in on the <UNK> democracy <UNK> br br however like a lot of satire <UNK> the us it seems terribly heavy handed and <UNK> i guess it's running counter to so much <UNK> propaganda so it has to <UNK> people over the head to make a point who knows i prefer more of a <UNK> <UNK> approach a bit of subtlety but that's just me br br anyway i might watch it again perhaps i missed something br br i'm hoping w is more on the mark
<START> following my experience of <UNK> for slightly more than a week i'd say this movie depicts the nature of the <UNK> society very accurately especially the young couple with a baby having serious issues phenomenon is very familiar to me as i witnessed the exact same thing in person when i was in <UNK> the relationships and problems of people <UNK> of the marriage institution the drinking culture <UNK> and the <UNK> money problem all are very well put without any <UNK> or exaggeration br br there are some points in the film that are not necessarily easy to comprehend and tie to each other but the joint big picture is nonetheless rewarding not each one of the short stories is exciting or profound but as said above the big picture does not fail to deliver the feeling of real life and <UNK> the viewer i happen to think in a calm moment what is happening in the lives of all these people on the street well this is what is happening movies like this are good to feed your imaginative power it would be safe to assume this film could apply to the life in many countries but it particularly reflects <UNK> as it is and pretty damn well br br one comment about the acting being the fan of <UNK> cinema i am i've never seen any of these actors on any other movie but i found the acting in this feature right next door to perfect overall maybe not a masterpiece but a very good try by the entire crew i'll be keeping an eye on the future releases of the director and the cast br br 7 5 10
<START> there is great detail in a bug's life everything is covered the film looks great and the animation is sometimes jaw dropping the film isn't too terribly <UNK> it's basically a modern take on <UNK> seven samurai only with bugs i enjoyed the character interaction however and the bad guys in this film actually seemed bad it seems that disney usually makes their bad guys <UNK> copy cut outs the <UNK> are menacing and hopper the lead bad guy was a <UNK> creation check this one out
<START> after the success of the second <UNK> richard curtis and ben <UNK> decided that <UNK> should have a third appearance this time instead of <UNK> times or <UNK> times edmund <UNK> <UNK> nominated <UNK> <UNK> is living in the time of the french revolution accompanied by the now stupid but lovable <UNK> tony robinson <UNK> is the faithful butler to george the prince <UNK> of <UNK> hugh laurie throughout this third series to the wonderfully written sitcom <UNK> tries everything he can to get rich and powerful he tries <UNK> a lord for a rotten <UNK> tries to sell a book tries to win a bet about the scarlet <UNK> tries to be a highway man and finally poses as the prince this is a very good <UNK> to the popular comedy includes appearances from <UNK> <UNK> tim <UNK> miranda richardson and stephen <UNK> it won the <UNK> for best comedy series and it was nominated for best design and best make up <UNK> <UNK> was number 18 on the 50 greatest british actors he was number 24 on the <UNK> comedian and he was number 8 on <UNK> favourite comedian edmund <UNK> was number 3 on the 100 greatest tv characters and he was number 3 on the world's greatest comedy characters and <UNK> all four series was number 2 on <UNK> best sitcom outstanding
<START> i like this film for several reasons i have a soft spot for films about <UNK> plotted criminal plots like <UNK> i also enjoy films like <UNK> and big deal on madonna street that spoof the the genre one of the best ones is <UNK> crime br br corbin bernsen has met four cons over the years and he decides they can all be useful in a bank robbery he is planning in a small montana town but he hasn't given any details on the crime to the <UNK> nor do they really know each other at all shortly after he sends for them bernsen is arrested by two new jersey policemen ed o'neill and daniel <UNK> whom he escaped from before and have a warrant to bring him back while he is in their custody the four cons fred <UNK> lou diamond <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and will russ show up without a clue about why they are there except that bernsen was planning something br br the first twenty minutes of the film deal with the four cons slowly getting used to each other with <UNK> and <UNK> managing to push away their own <UNK> to figure out they have to trust each other at the same time we see bernsen <UNK> waiting for the right moment to escape from o'neill and <UNK> again not too difficult as they are not the <UNK> <UNK> who ever existed the result are two sets of plots that will keep <UNK> against each other throughout the film the four cons trying to figure out what <UNK> scheme was and how to put it into operation and bernsen trying to maintain his own freedom from his <UNK> and regain his cabin and hopefully find his gang there for him to take command of there is also a third smaller plot involving the growing annoyance and anger of local sheriff <UNK> <UNK> against the idiots from new jersey who keep getting into his hair br br there are many delightful moments in the film such as <UNK> <UNK> on by <UNK> and <UNK> into surrounding a house in the town that bernsen is supposed to be hiding inside of and yelling through a <UNK> come out we have you surrounded only to have the scene switch to a huge montana plain that bernsen is struggling and stumbling through miles from where the police think he is at that moment there are moments of <UNK> by our four cons who fortunately put the oldest <UNK> into <UNK> position this does not always guarantee anything at one point their car won't start and they have to thumb a ride by truck unfortunately it is a truck carrying <UNK> br br the conclusion with the gang successfully carrying out the robbery including <UNK> all the police cars at the critical time <UNK> <UNK> is cars is also a gem of timing suspense and comic results the film is very entertaining and certainly worth watching
<START> i respect alex cox the filmmaker i really do he's like the kid at school who you think at first is just trying a little too hard to be different a literary punk rocker who has <UNK> more than his feet into spaghetti westerns and science fiction and <UNK> culture and come out into the world ready to take s on but then you see what he can actually do the talent and raw <UNK> artistry and moments of true absurd hilarity capable of him and you are ready to see whatever he has to offer but there's two sides to his proverbial <UNK> he can either really hit it out of the park <UNK> man sid nancy walker arguably or just try just a little too hard and pull way too many pretentious <UNK> out of the hat straight to hell death and the <UNK> falls into the latter category and while i respect its mostly original approach to <UNK> a detective killer story it too falls on its face and its weirdness becomes oddly dull br br it has a strange enough set up and already <UNK> style to follow a detective <UNK> <UNK> is after a killer with a hell fire voice red something and it seems that the killer is leaving disturbing clues with his victims <UNK> in blood on the walls are messages that according to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> christopher <UNK> looking as if he just walked off shallow grave without changing his look has religious significance in the <UNK> we follow <UNK> on his case and his methods of going after the <UNK> which include following at first a <UNK> and then <UNK> shaped pattern on the map this despite the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who also looks back in flash <UNK> sitting at a desk and speaking to the audience in <UNK> but sad <UNK> of his former employee and colleague after the fact of the case br br oh cox has his moments of creativity and interest such as a shot where we see the entire scope of the harrowing depths of the police station where <UNK> character is taken in by <UNK> for his own protection says <UNK> in case of getting lost in the wrong room and we're followed in a long tracking shot maybe the best or just most curious where we're taken through very dark <UNK> with very little direction lost in the <UNK> of turns and <UNK> among the characters and it's never something that isn't fascinating to look at with <UNK> <UNK> cinematography a morbid delight but the plot goes through <UNK> <UNK> to keep things so off beat it might as well be beat less all together the performances save for a confident boyle and for <UNK> at the very end are pretty bad especially <UNK> who just seems to <UNK> in his seat <UNK> the goofy dialog given to him to speak at the audience br br while the murder plot itself contains an intention for the audience that this isn't something we've seen before that it's in a society with a good many <UNK> and architecture suggesting <UNK> next <UNK> wave it too <UNK> out very quickly what's the conflict here i was never that much engaged with <UNK> own personal mission to find this killer and only mildly caught up in the few flashes of deranged scenes of the killer and or killers going after people like in the building early on cox himself has an amusing cameo and just when i started to think it was leading up to something spectacular with boyle and <UNK> in that big not as big as you think building in the south section of the city it suddenly gives us a twist that we know in the back of our minds is coming but hope isn't and it <UNK> any of the <UNK> mystery it's been leading up to for all of <UNK> uncanny touches as a filmmaker for all of his opposition to <UNK> feeding the audience with a <UNK> approach which i do respect death and the <UNK> ultimately cuts one off at the brain <UNK> it's <UNK>
<START> tarantino once <UNK> on a melodrama from the 1930s called <UNK> that tragedy is like another character in the film the same could be said and not <UNK> bringing up tarantino for sidney <UNK> best work in years a melodrama where character is of the <UNK> concern not simply because of what's at stake with the cast involved kelly masterson doesn't have a masterpiece of a script here it basically breaks into crazy killer mode by the end in a series of climactic events that only work by the very end and even there suspension of disbelief is paramount but her script does convey character before plot and in a story where the actions surround a heist it's crucial to know who these people are beat by beat it's bleak as hell <UNK> as satan but also absolutely riveting 90 of the time br br <UNK> it up not just because lumet knows how to handle a non linear script where we see the day to day actions of character to character before during and mostly after the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jewelry store robbery occurs but because of the <UNK> cast assembled which i might add is <UNK> <UNK> philip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke are brothers with their own respective financial f ups and the former approaches the latter on what looks like a fool proof heist <UNK> their own mother and father's jewelry store in <UNK> <UNK> hank involves another shady character though murders occur and suddenly it's tragedy on a greek scale affecting the brothers and their father played by a perfect albert finney it's the kind of material that most actors love characters who like in dog day afternoon are painfully human flawed to the bone but only wanting love or things to be set right and have the complete inability to fulfill their wants and needs br br in this case though hoffman and hawke are matched <UNK> hoffman has until the aforementioned last ten minutes a super calm and occasionally joking demeanor that reveals him as the brains of the operation but then smaller scenes where he breaks down emotionally i e with finney or the car scene with tomei push his talents to the limit hawke meanwhile is called a loser by his ex wife and daughter can't pay any <UNK> at all and is called a baby by his own father and he fills the bill of the part in all the ways that matter he's not quite as flawed as his older brother but who wants to pick a straw for that title and finney as mentioned is spot on all the way through making his turn in big fish look like child's play the final scenes with him are <UNK> tragic his face <UNK> in a horror that has built up all through the second half br br also featuring supporting turns from a finely <UNK> and <UNK> two timing marisa tomei bug's michael shannon as bad ass white trash and amy ryan brian f <UNK> and <UNK> harris making brief exact impressions this is a film with a tremendous lot of skill and heart but not a <UNK> heart with a story that <UNK> back on details not for <UNK> plot devices but to make clear every step of a family's <UNK> <UNK> spiral if it's not as mind blowing as <UNK> or network or the <UNK> or 12 angry men it comes as close as anything <UNK> done since
<START> the pilot of enterprise has one thing that has been lacking since the original star trek a dose of realistic flawed personalities the <UNK> characters of the next generation got <UNK> they were so noble as to be unbelievable i also like the sub plot that humans are bitter toward the <UNK> its funny seeing them as pretentious <UNK> it makes me look forward to seeing when the humans become the <UNK> race between the two though i don't think it would work in the time frame of the show the only <UNK> that jumped out at me were the quick cut off the ending at 2 hours feel of the end which is common among many of the trek shows the second was the shameless dig for ratings by a couple of <UNK> sexy scenes it was out of place a good science fiction show should be able to stand on its own without trying to pad the pre teen audience with some skin but its not my job to make the show <UNK> so oh well br br lets see how the next episode does
<START> i've now seen this one about 10 times so there must be something about it i like br br 50's us sci fi movies were pretty much a mixed bunch they were either intelligently made and or thought provoking or cheap and laughable cheese forbidden planet is a bit of both but in that <UNK> for the genre colour br br it also had a head start with the script although shakespeare might not have <UNK> it it was based on his timeless play and thus guaranteed a certain amount of <UNK> itself if made well br br it's the story of one mans murderous id <UNK> <UNK> infinitely by machines a dead race left switched on 200 000 years before along the way the plot <UNK> with 50's stereotypes and corn so pure you wonder sometimes why you're watching it but always do that love triangle thing <UNK> disney's <UNK> still holds up well and the cartoon backgrounds straight off the covers of galaxy magazine etc look good even after 50 years <UNK> driving the car over the desert in the far distance is a hoot though br br all in all with all faults the best of its kind and we should be grateful that such a <UNK> print survives
<START> this film is stale and misses the mark it is far off compared to the <UNK> batman that it tries to <UNK> that women singer whats her name can not act and we see why her film <UNK> died notice how this film died in the box office no one see this film on tv either my uncle and dad were expecting batman and the films impression is more like cop rock not worth renting 3 10
<START> like his early masterpiece the elephant man lynch proves to his <UNK> that he can tell a straight simple story without losing his artistic touch this is a true story of an elderly retired man expertly played by richard farnsworth who decides to ride a <UNK> across a few states to pay a final visit to his estranged brother who now stands at <UNK> door a beautiful score from <UNK> exquisite photography of rural life love those <UNK> corn field shots and a sly director's hand that reveals man's basic humanity this is a beautiful slice of life film its extremely slow pace may <UNK> some viewers to sleep but those who stay for along for the ride will be well rewarded in the end
<START> this film features ben chaplin as a bored bank employee in england who orders a mail order bride from russia <UNK> nicole kidman in the mail and gets more than he <UNK> for when surprise she isn't what she appears to be the story is fairly <UNK> and chaplin <UNK> too much to the point where he becomes somewhat <UNK> kidman is <UNK> rather good in this role making her character about the only thing in this film that is interesting grade c
<START> also known as water <UNK> this film tells the story of two girls as they struggle their way into the world of love and sex this story is told at a slow pace and that works very well it gives plenty of time and space to get to know the different characters and to grow somewhat attached to them br br using a small cast puts some extra pressure on the people playing as they all have some more screen time than normal but the people playing in this film handle that well everyone is completely believable visual setting is great especially the underwater shots in the swimming pool add a nice effect br br many films have been made about the same subject though and this one does not really stand out above any of them it pulls some standard pressure methods out of the high hat and works on them it isn't bad not at all but it surely isn't great either and i do feel it could have done better if it had taken some what less explored angles br br 7 out of 10 <UNK> <UNK>
<START> well it's yet again a film that plays with your sentiments and you come out all soft as opposed to a rocky film but i'm a sucker for those so i gave it a good score the acting was very good and there were a lot of feeling the violence is kept to a minimal which makes a change i'd have given it a 9 if it were not for the <UNK> at the end all in all a good movie with very good actors br br
<START> this is probably the best television show i've ever seen i first saw it on comedy central several years ago at the time i was unaware that it had been dramatically edited and was shown out of order and having just watched all three series in order and <UNK> thank you internet and your wondrous series of <UNK> i am so glad i <UNK> it i think comedy central sort of picked and chose their way through series one and two to make a season and i tried to get friends and family to watch it but nobody really seemed to like it i need new friends so on my own i made the best out of it that i could even when i felt like it was <UNK> a bit i still felt compelled to continue watching years after when i discovered little britain i immediately recognized pauline from <UNK> as having influenced <UNK> in fat fighters also i love the idea of writers who act the entire show not new but done <UNK> here <UNK> has nothing on <UNK> no offense matt david love you this is indeed a darkly comedic piece of genius serial murder implied <UNK> you name it and it's probably found in this wonderful unique piece of tv art the location shots from the very first scene themselves are chilling and seem to <UNK> you to the town of <UNK> <UNK> you'll never leave i think my favorite character would have to be <UNK> but each character as portrayed has it's own charm my least favorite was <UNK> <UNK> that was until he re <UNK> in series three clever and wholly unexpected it's best to watch several episodes in a row as it drives the continuity and as i said before becomes so compelling while <UNK> that you really can't stop watching this is not for those with weak <UNK> kids <UNK> or grandma unless you've got one <UNK> <UNK> i have always loved british tv particularly comedies from monty python to benny hill red dwarf to keeping up appearances absolutely fabulous and the british originals <UNK> and the office but not their us counterparts sorry this is unlike any of those in that it completely <UNK> the line between what's funny and what's just sick and twisted nothing nothing on us tv has ever come close to this level of entertainment us broadcast tv is so sad and lame i can barely stand to watch any of it it's kind of sad that even our cable channels don't have the guts to show <UNK> versions of this gem your loss comedy central thankfully there are shows like this one that come from the across the pond that redeem the entire medium every decade or so basic cable here in the us has been making tiny steps the last few years in <UNK> crossing lines with more graphic sexual content drug use and adult language but they are still years away from just deciding to be adults about showing real life adult behavior instead of just murder obsession and blowing things up <UNK> it's like the same basic show format for the past 35 years don't even get me started on us sitcoms waste of time and lots of wasted money did you know that according to jim has been on the air for 10 years 10 years anyway watch this show get it on dvd do what you must and then make your friends watch it as well you've never seen anything like it there are three <UNK> that i have not watched yet i'm saving them to spring on my best friend next time he visits he'll watch them even if i have to chain him up and paint him with <UNK> lines and lines and lines and lines note that series three <UNK> from one and two the greater town seems to fall away to concentrate on newer characters the laugh track is gone thank bloody hell the theme is more band and less orchestra and a bit of the story takes place outside of <UNK> <UNK> don't be thrown by any of that as by the end the series has <UNK> the quiet <UNK> first demonstrated in series one and two i think these four guys have created something sort of <UNK> brilliant confident and absolutely demented you will want to re watch it again and again it's amazing that in 5 seconds of screen time they can go from cheap sight gag to horrifying <UNK> then end with a single actors close up facial expression if ever i were to meet any of the writer performers i'd <UNK> them not to recreate it or try to top it i'd just say can i help you at all then they'd probably slap me so i'd ask them to sign the slap mark 10 out of 10
<START> in texas seven friends meet in a bar to celebrate the halloween night before going to a party meanwhile they call the american nightmare pirate radio for fun and confess their <UNK> fears a serial killer who is listening to their <UNK> makes their nightmares come true killing each one of them in a sadistic way american nightmare is a weird low budget movie that has a horrible beginning without any previous explanation a woman kills two couples in an isolated camping area as if it were friday 13th then the story shifts to a bar where seven friends are celebrating halloween from this moment on the story has a great potential and the unknown cast has a very reasonable performance showing also some beautiful breasts and naked bodies as usual in this type of c production however the end of the screenplay does not provide any explanation for the killing instinct and motives for the behavior of the nurse jane <UNK> giving the sensation that the budget ended before the <UNK> of the shooting with a better beginning and conclusion this weird story would be a good low budget slasher movie my vote is four br br title brazil <UNK> agony
<START> reign over me is a success due to the powerful work by adam sandler and don cheadle while comedic actors going dramatic has been seen as somewhat of a distraction sandler is no stranger to playing more serious roles most of the characters he portrays have an unstable <UNK> and a vulnerability that can burst at any moment he might even be <UNK> for characters with such hidden anger problems however this performance has some considerable dramatic weight unlike his roles in less comedic fare like punch drunk love and <UNK> br br in the film alan johnson cheadle runs into his old college roommate charlie <UNK> sandler whom he hasn't seen in several years five years before charlie suffered the overwhelming loss of his wife and three daughters in a plane crash charlie barely even <UNK> <UNK> character due to the <UNK> of his memories and <UNK> <UNK> childish lifestyle since the accident it isn't until alan <UNK> in engaging him in conversation that charlie remembers who he is their <UNK> relationship that follows will allow <UNK> to have a friend who doesn't speak about his loss eventually <UNK> him to confront the thoughts and feelings he has <UNK> on his own terms br br though writer director mike <UNK> doesn't show much sense of an individual style and some of his shots and transitions are a bit awkward he does have a knack of getting decent to great performances from his actors while being a talented and funny writer he shot this film with a digital camera as more and more filmmakers are doing today <UNK> the crew to shoot the night scenes with limited lighting this kept the colorful backgrounds of new york city in focus but resulted in creating frequent digital grain which resembles blue <UNK> scattered and moving on the screen br br almost every main character in reign over me gives a great performance <UNK> <UNK> smith and especially <UNK> tyler are memorable in their respective roles as a frustrated wife to <UNK> character and a psychiatrist however it is sandler and cheadle that give some of their finest work to date they completely owned this movie sandler actually plays a character that doesn't <UNK> resemble or act like himself at all partially credited to his bob dylan esquire wig though <UNK> character has more screen time than sandler they both should be considered to be leading roles as they equally support and help each other throughout the film br br music also plays a great part in this film especially the title song reign over me or love reign <UNK> me by the who and later covered by pearl jam in one of the most powerful moments of the film <UNK> shows sandler using music to shut out his feelings and memories but this particular song <UNK> such intense emotion that rather than <UNK> his anger it <UNK> his emotions all an all reign over me is an enjoyable sad yet many times funny film driven by its amazing leading performances
<START> that might be a bit harsh for me saying that but sadly so far in his directing career its true just have a look at what he as done so far they barely make it past the 3 star mark br br why did i watch this movie 2 reasons lucy <UNK> and heroes star greg <UNK> lucy was outstanding in this movie her performance carries the whole movie i do hope she gets a blockbuster and breaks into the bigger league of actors she clearly has the skills greg was not so impressive typical tv acting style br br the movie is oddly <UNK> as a horror the only horror is short flashbacks and they last a max of 2 5 seconds with a little blood in them i personally would call this more a drama thriller br br but no matter how interesting the story actually is bad directing editing and acting <UNK> from lucy destroys it you get no real connection to the actors something which is very important in a story like this one you just sit there watching feeling nothing its like watching a bad tv soap actually i think the tv soap would be more interesting br br my advice stay away from this movie or better yet just stay away from anything michael <UNK> is involved with
