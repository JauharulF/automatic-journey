<START> this is quite the gripping fascinating tragic story quite good and for the most part pretty accurate considering it is a tv movie rather than a documentary they did create some fictional characters and combine several actual people into one character but otherwise this is a good telling of a very tragic and dark story br br the final moments of the movie depicting the mass suicide murder are almost directly taken from an audio recording made by jim jones this recording was made during the final <UNK> minutes of the peoples <UNK> existence it is available in several places on the internet this portion of the film is almost spot on in that regard br br to sum up a documentary this is not however it does cover most of the base elements to the people's temple story
<START> this little film had long been on my keeper list do people realize how <UNK> out <UNK> emotionally abused women as well as the mentally retarded were really treated by the medical profession at the turn of the century all of the <UNK> uptight christian attitudes of that time were deadly to exploring true emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace suffering souls let alone explore what it means to embrace our humanity can you really imagine by today's standards that walt <UNK> books were banned because he acknowledged women as having feelings and emotional <UNK> as great as a mans think about that the sensitivity of this movie still gets me and i give credit to the director for capturing this through his eyes
<START> the script for scary movie 2 just wasn't ready to go this is a problem with the film that is blatantly evident to the actors and the audience alike director <UNK> <UNK> wayans and many of the actors are funny people and so the movie isn't completely <UNK> to their credit the film has several funny moments but as a whole scary movie 2 is not even close to being as clever and amusing as the original br br the first scary movie was a laugh a minute film it turned the smallest subtleties of the slasher film genre into comedic gold the humor in scary movie 2 is as heavy handed as it is un original they even miss obvious opportunities for parody two of the movies stars are former cast members of beverly hills <UNK> and this was a show that was begging to be <UNK> in the final analysis scary movie 2 is like a fine bottle of wine that was opened far too soon the script needed a lot more time to age 2 stars out of 5
<START> one of my best films ever maybe because i was well into the punk scene in the late 70s and went to many of <UNK> <UNK> but the film was a good story line and very good acting by <UNK> and a up and coming phil daniels not sure about his latest project <UNK> excellent performance by lots of unknown actors who if you keep your eyes <UNK> will see them in many of the uk <UNK> today <UNK> <UNK> out of the bill the more i watch it the more of them i spot well if you have not seen it yet have a night in with the video don't forget to dig out the safety pin for your nose and heavy black eye makeup and <UNK> your head <UNK> style enjoy
<START> i watched this movie when i was a young <UNK> full of raging <UNK> and it was about as sexy a movie as i had ever seen or ever was to see it may not have been a great movie my guess is it wasn't i don't really remember much about it to tell you the truth i only remember the sexual chemistry between crosby and <UNK> no woman in any movie has ever done it for me as the unbelievably sexy cathy did in this movie i haven't seen it since that first time i caught it on tv in the 70s and i don't think i'd want to see it again since i'm sure it would be a disappointment my <UNK> aren't as raging and i've become more jaded over the years still when i think back on the shower scene i can still remember how great it felt way back when br br added later after watching the movie again i discovered that it's dangerous to go home again what was once erotic is now pretty tame the older woman younger man thing still works for me just not as much as it once did probably because i'm no longer a 12 year old that older woman is now younger than i am also the <UNK> of the whole thing wasn't perceived by my twelve year old mind br br moral sometimes it's better not to <UNK> the past
<START> i totally <UNK> with those comments which said this is a good movie this is a totally sucked movie i mean sucked s u c k e d the story development is strange <UNK> <UNK> changed from an innocent girl to a party fun seeking chick for no convincing reasons at all in addition all the actresses looked way too old for being college students college students looked like about 30 years old you figure out the rest i watched only about first ten minutes and started fast <UNK> to look for sex scenes all the sex scenes are lame <UNK> and most importantly no frontal at all all the sex scenes are laughable considering how many clothes they had on do yourself a favor put it down and save yourself a few bucks conclusion story 0 sex 0 acting 0 score 0 out 10
<START> along with 2 days in the valley i think this is one of worst movies i've ever seen just another of the long line of tarantino rip offs that have emerged since pulp fiction the atmosphere the movie creates is amusing for the first five minutes but then the film makers make the unforgivable mistake of allowing unnecessary and grotesque violence to up the hip <UNK> you're better off skipping this one
<START> spoilers spoilers from its very opening credits this fantastic movie sets the record straight it's an instant classic it doesn't take long to realize that this movie is big bigger than <UNK> <UNK> or police academy 7 ' the sheer greatness of it left me speechless as i walked out of the movie theater and <UNK> right back to the ticket counter to purchase myself another dozen of tickets br br this is a movie that simply requires multiple viewings the first watching will surely leave you with that strange huh ' feeling but don't feel embarrassed it happens to the best of us the story is so <UNK> clever that one has to wonder about the <UNK> of its authors what seems to be a simple story of an idiot <UNK> the fbi turns out to be an <UNK> story that works on several levels and teaches us all about the really important things in life the complexity of the plot structure will <UNK> you on your first viewing but don't give up not until my sixth or seventh viewing did i only begin to unravel some of the hidden mysteries of corky <UNK> ' and watch out for the unexpected twist at the end otherwise you might be caught completely off guard when it is revealed that fbi agent brick davis is <UNK> most wanted criminal corky is not a real fbi agent pops <UNK> is innocent peter <UNK> admits he's illiterate and paulie <UNK> comes out of the closet as a homosexual surprised the hell out of me i can tell you that much br br chris <UNK> comedic talents are <UNK> as he leads his character corky <UNK> through a <UNK> of totally unpredictable situations reminiscent of john <UNK> performance in <UNK> the hands of fate ' <UNK> takes on <UNK> multiple personalities and <UNK> all scenes with perfect comedic timing however <UNK> is not just about comedy he is a master of drama as well as he controls the audience's feelings with the slightest moves of his face his facial expressions reflect life itself in a way for example in the scene in which he <UNK> into his <UNK> faces you can see the expression of social injustice and alienation clearly reflected on his <UNK> face at a moment like that it's hard to find a dry eye in the house br br screenwriters david <UNK> and jason ward are the real heroes of corky <UNK> ' with a story of such proportions it's easy to understand why two experienced writers had to be employed to complete this ambitious project their <UNK> storytelling and <UNK> <UNK> makes pulp <UNK> look like a mediocre saturday night live skit <UNK> and <UNK> story is so compelling and <UNK> that it grips you by your hair <UNK> you entirely shakes you around and <UNK> you right out at the end of the out of this world experience known as corky <UNK> you find yourself a different person with different <UNK> and different ideas and with only one question on your mind br br why god why
<START> i'll be honest the reason i rented this movie was because i am a huge fan of kyle <UNK> most notably from early edition since he usually plays the good guy i wanted to see him as in a different role out of curiosity the plot itself also drew me in a wanna be <UNK> tony <UNK> a k a mr chandler must kill a person at random before he is trusted with the life or rather the death of a witness who will <UNK> against someone in the family the movies was nothing like i expected it was sick i hated the end if you saw it you'd know why and there were so many unnecessary parts basically it was filthy and made little sense yes it was a mob movie and yes the guns do go boom but there's more to a movie than that this film acted as if it didn't have the time to go into detail just deal with it and understand it the acting really made up for it james belushi was pretty amusing as the rose <UNK> lee made angel seem as believable as she could get she surprised me the most and kyle chandler was equally convincing as an anxious newcomer to the family if only the script did justice to the actors
<START> i have seen this film only once on tv and it has not been repeated this is strange when you consider the rubbish that is repeated over and over again usually horror movies for me are a source of amusement but this one really scared me br br do not read the next bit if you <UNK> seen the film yet br br the scariest bit is when the <UNK> pursue the preacher to where his wife lies almost dead they'd been <UNK> her he asks who the hell are you people anyway one by one they give their true identities the girl who was pretending to be deaf in order to corrupt and seduce him says i am <UNK> the witch who loved adam before eve
<START> i can't say this is one of the best films i have ever seen but then again i can't say it's one of the worst i have ever seen br br ok so it's basically a girl does <UNK> is good at it wants to go to an expensive school can't afford it and has to take a hockey <UNK> she has to hide her <UNK> secret from her friends br br personally i didn't like the actress playing <UNK> she absolutely couldn't cry to save her life just made <UNK> sounds like a <UNK> pretending to cry to get it's own way br br <UNK> was just an annoying person the way she tried to act all nice and helpful to people also the part where the two <UNK> are calling her names and they say something about her choreographer and she says she <UNK> the <UNK> made me cringe br br we all knew where it was going to go with her and spencer <UNK> they didn't like each other and sort of get together at the end was just typical br br overall i think this is a movie to watch if you like <UNK> but if you don't mind the main <UNK> being extremely annoying it's good to kill time basically
<START> this movie isn't terrible really somebody commented that mo is the type of american europeans <UNK> at but there are those and not necessarily <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who do not care for <UNK> and the <UNK> character isn't going to <UNK> them br br let's consider his stereotypical frenchman attributes br br 1 cynical very cynical check br br 2 <UNK> <UNK> appearance check despite br br 3 a great appreciation of <UNK> check br br 4 <UNK> work <UNK> check forget the fact he is supposedly a rich <UNK> from watching him in the film he seems to put in ten hour <UNK> br br 5 beautiful wife check despite that br br 6 loose interpretation of the marriage <UNK> check br br 7 big sexual ego which says an american girl owes you sex if you buy her dinner check br br whether mo is a <UNK> or not there's no reason for her to fall for this smug european <UNK> other than the script <UNK> so br br on the other hand as other male reviewers have i did enjoy seeing karen allen's cute <UNK> body i'll give the movie four stars two of them are for that
<START> it must be the most <UNK> tv show on the air this is probably a escape for jim belushi and all of his bad movies his brother sucked all the talent out he younger brother i hope this show is canceled and never spoken of again except in a negative use jim has got to <UNK> or something please let them go of the air if i here a joke from that show i will throw up and and wash my eyes out with a <UNK> id rather be taken from the devil himself than watch a full half hour that piece of <UNK> i still do not understand why the show is still in the air and running we all know deep down that we want to shoot our tv screens when we see <UNK> face in conclusion no more please
<START> mann photographs the <UNK> rocky mountains in a superb fashion and jimmy stewart and walter brennan give enjoyable performances as they always seem to do br br but come on hollywood a <UNK> telling the people of dawson city <UNK> to <UNK> themselves a <UNK> yes a <UNK> and to <UNK> the law themselves then <UNK> battling it out on the streets for control of the town br br nothing even remotely resembling that happened on the canadian side of the border during the <UNK> gold rush mr mann and company appear to have mistaken dawson city for <UNK> the canadian north for the american wild west br br canadian viewers be prepared for a <UNK> madness type of enjoyable <UNK> with this ludicrous plot or to shake your head in disgust
<START> i like musicals but as a dickens fan i hate this one mild spoilers starving boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in the <UNK> the poor of london coming out to sing fagin and <UNK> walking off into the sunset not exactly faithful to the novel as i recall <UNK> was <UNK> <UNK> and fagin went crazy in prison end of spoilers br br oliver reed is very weak as sykes doing little more than <UNK> to indicate his evil worst however is mark lester as oliver who often comes across so awkward and passive you wonder if he's really the main character his portrayal is in no way helped by the fact that the best they could do when he sings is dub in the voice of a girl guess they didn't realize that boy <UNK> can be found in almost every church in england br br self <UNK> dickens fans stick to david <UNK> amazing 1948 film or the bbc 6 hour adaptation from the mid 80's avoid this <UNK> <UNK> of a musical
<START> this is an excellent film about a traditional working class family in northern england filmed on location in <UNK> it stars james mason as the father who is the <UNK> force within his home or so it seems cleverly the film based on the play portrays the <UNK> of family life the supporting cast is terrific as well with many familiar faces <UNK> support
<START> this movie seems to start in the middle introduces <UNK> players as if they were significant and presents main characters without any substance and paper thin and or <UNK> back stories almost nobody has a credible or discernible motivation for their actions in this film the plot <UNK> and ultimately goes nowhere the dialogue is clunky and trite and the director has little concept of how to get the best from his actors it almost feels like there's a first half of this movie but it never got made br br we're told that a mysterious <UNK> has appeared over new york city and that central park has inexplicably become an <UNK> <UNK> yet none of this seems to have caused much of a stir amongst the general population and is only of minimal concern to the government br br we're presented with the evil corporation in <UNK> but that's really just a convenient <UNK> to <UNK> the universe with a couple power <UNK> <UNK> the whole <UNK> is bad double <UNK> is heavy handed and never really pans out here we're supposed to care about the central characters but we never learn enough about them to know why so much about this world is underdeveloped or completely undeveloped that it comes off as a 1 hour 40 minute <UNK> <UNK> for rape br br on the ground breaking <UNK> animated world created here all i can say is that at about the same time as this film was made several other directors did the same thing with more <UNK> and believable results br br after spending the time to watch this film the most burning question left in my mind was so what
<START> what i loved about the on screen adaptation of the stone angel is that it stayed so true to the novel great film as an avid reader i find the worst thing about film adaptations is that the book somehow gets lost in translation you can tell the stone angel team was careful not to let this happen with this film br br ellen <UNK> was an excellent casting choice for the role of <UNK> and she is definitely a movie superstar however i think the canadian actress christine <UNK> chosen to play <UNK> in her younger years also did an incredible job that <UNK> great praise i haven't seen any of <UNK> previous work but i will definitely seek it out after seeing her stone angel performance br br i heard the canadian theatrical release of the stone angel is going to happen in spring or summer 2008 i can't wait to see it on the big screen again
<START> this is one of my favourite martial arts movies from hong kong it is one of john <UNK> earliest films and one of only a few traditional martial arts movies he directed you can see his influences from working under chang <UNK> in this film the action is good the fight choreography is <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> on who appears as one of the bad guys in the movie it stars <UNK> <UNK> of five <UNK> fame and a whole host of faces familiar to fans of golden <UNK> and shaw brothers productions the story line is interesting there are a few decent plot twists and the build up of the characters and their relationships with each other is cleverly done this film has only had a vhs release in the uk media asia have released a region 3 dvd and there are versions of it on dvd available from the usa the film is lovely to watch in either it's original language or in it's english dubbed version i highly recommend this movie
<START> this movie <UNK> me so much that i watch it at least once a year at times i find it uncomfortable at times i find it <UNK> and i always find the characters human and real it is a movie that shows you the gritty reality of life in la starting with the recurring helicopter search lights <UNK> for the dangers lurking so close to the ordinary lives being carried on by the characters it is also a movie that shows you how the kindness of a stranger can change your life and <UNK> you to make a difference grand canyon reminds you that every action you take whether intended or not has powerful <UNK> i found this movie to be similar in many ways to robert altman's film short cuts both had a star <UNK> <UNK> of perfectly cast actors actresses and both movies allowed you to gradually see how the the characters <UNK> with one another and affected each other for better or worse grand canyon did a better job of providing a cohesive message hope in the face of <UNK> reality than altman's film although i found them both intriguing in their own way this film is a definite must see
<START> this thought long lost flick sometimes comes available on the web so i bought me a copy well of course the acting is terrible and the story line is childish but it does have his moments i think people who searched this one also knows the <UNK> of it it was made by a <UNK> cinema owner for an extreme low budget but for me he surely didn't spoiled the money on props but on the make up the make up is for that kind of flick well done the zombies are watchable and the gore is intact the only problem with that kind of movies is the quality of the <UNK> it's terrible <UNK> no <UNK> on the sound but sometimes it's way too dark so you have to watch clearly to see the gore in a funny way they tried to sell this one as really not for the <UNK> a voice over tells in the beginning of the movie to watch out for a sign and a man appearing with green flashes that tells you there is gore on the way of course that doesn't work made me think of cannibal girls had that annoying bell when the red stuff started to flow they had the original idea cannibal girls was made a year earlier don't go for the storyline go for the zombies and notice a continuity mistake when the girl and guy are making love first she takes of her <UNK> then they make love and suddenly her underwear is back on try to do that or am i getting a bit <UNK> eat it you ugly corpses
<START> i'm hearing rumors of an upcoming leonard <UNK> demonstrates the <UNK> ray disc with advances over the past 25 years ranging from steady <UNK> to cgi it'll be interesting to see if the franchise can be <UNK> i just hope it helps to remove the bad taste left in my mouth by that whole <UNK> <UNK> fiasco br br and yes leonard <UNK> demonstrates the <UNK> vcr was a brilliant <UNK> in entertainment history after the <UNK> leonard <UNK> demonstrates the <UNK> <UNK> and the downright tacky leonard <UNK> demonstrates the 8 track tape who would have expected such a glorious piece of cinema i'm <UNK> right now just thinking about it
<START> we all know that countless <UNK> have <UNK> the 80s slasher genre and often deserve nothing but our deepest disgust maybe that's a bit <UNK> but damn if slaughter high wasn't terribly unoriginal even for a slasher flick pretty much the plot involves a kid who experienced a carrie like shower <UNK> in high school and returns to the <UNK> building to seek out revenge on a group of former bullies who all show up to <UNK> as you'd expect they are killed off <UNK> by a masked madman on april 1st by means of <UNK> burning hanging and <UNK> altered beer i've got a number of problems with the plot details and settings of this movie but considering the ending i feel the need to <UNK> my complaints and just say that this is a complete waste of time ignore any thought of viewing this movie
<START> this movie was terrible the first half hour is much like a well apologies for the lack of <UNK> but it was simply a bad version of a clockwork orange the first scene is almost <UNK> from one of the first in clockwork supposedly it was a tribute as per the appearance of the clockwork poster on the <UNK> wall however ripoff is the more appropriate word the movie felt as though it was torn right from the kubrick classic only filmed through a new director's eyes a blind director unfortunately when it stops its massacre of kubrick's work the film gets even worse as another <UNK> said the <UNK> of this film is just shoved down your throat arrogant self absorbed and ultimately meaningless drivel br br perhaps the protagonists <UNK> would touch a nerve if there was any actual character development in this movie i felt absolutely nothing for this guy and i'm an alcoholic so i figure that if anyone might be able to feel anything for him it would be me awful character development dialogue and plot br br the worst part about this movie is the title for a film called 16 years of alcohol the alcoholism is hardly a factor in the flick see first paragraph it was such a <UNK> of a clockwork orange i can't get over it a more suited title would have been 16 years of violence or even better a clockwork banana br br just do yourself a favor and avoid this movie if you disregard my advice and take it out anyway drink trust me
<START> i'm starting to write this review during a break as i watch the movie it's the first time i've tried doing that but i'm having trouble getting through this one without occasional breaks that's not because it's intense but because it's bad br br it's almost painfully tedious and unbelievable especially when the <UNK> <UNK> dying brother ryan <UNK> <UNK> is on screen being tragic and bitchy self indulgent and self <UNK> this would have been a much better movie if they'd just left that character out of the story br br he adds nothing but <UNK> <UNK> very irritating melodrama maybe somebody decided that if they couldn't make ryan believable they'd just make him obnoxious the problem with that is who cares if a spoiled whining obnoxious jerk is dying not me br br the only thing this character has going for him is the fact that he's dying and sorry but that's just not enough dying doesn't make anybody special we're all dying sooner or later it doesn't give anybody the right to expect sympathy while acting like a jerk br br the other two characters and the actors playing them david <UNK> as theo and <UNK> west as sarah are very much more interesting and their story without <UNK> self <UNK> <UNK> would have made a much better movie but it's not over yet and it's time to hit play again maybe something great happens before the end br br nope sorry this rented turkey goes back tonight
<START> not to mention easily pierce <UNK> best performance of course greg kinnear is always great really when has he really been bad i think this film is incredibly underrated the use of colors in this movie is something very different in today's film world where every other movie has the <UNK> blue <UNK> i also love the way they used the song by asia proving that even what was once thought of as kinda cheesy can be really cool placed correctly br br i was making my first feature when this came out being that my film was a hit man movie i had to check out anything in the genre that was released after seeing it i'm sure it had some effect on me through the process it was pretty cool when my film got on the imdb that it would recommend this film if you liked mine how any of the others relate i have no idea making an even more interesting coincidence br br http www imdb com title <UNK>
<START> i think i read this <UNK> joe <UNK> director of the film and also one of the guys who <UNK> industrial light and magic for work on the first star wars film and one of his producers or something were <UNK> their brains for a title for the movie rocket boys i guess was lacking something br br one day they were messing with a pc program that forms words from other words ie you type in a word or series of words and it mixes the letters up and forms other words i think the technical term is an <UNK> br br anyway they <UNK> in rocket boys and sure enough what comes back is october sky they were shocked to say the least the title summed up everything in the movie since the movie revolves around <UNK> at first homer jr did not like the idea but he <UNK> up to it after the movie poster <UNK> novel came out and took off
<START> right then he's absolutely brilliant but you must be intelligent and quick to understand his humor he covers attacks all sorts of topics such as the first moon landing <UNK> christmas <UNK> movies and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br for those of you are <UNK> to swearing this isn't for you while some of us <UNK> with <UNK> and periods he uses the f word also if you can't laugh at yourself never watch this you will feel the fool br br incidentally i've watched his other stuff and even saw him perform live and this is by far his best work he simply shines br br what might go so far as to say he is glorious
<START> for the big <UNK> among us the intruder is a <UNK> incoherent movie from france that gives so called art films a bad name the story is something about a bitter old <UNK> louis <UNK> michel <UNK> who goes searching in <UNK> for a heart transplant but beyond that i have no idea who any of the people in the movie were or why they were doing what they were doing with no coherent storyline to <UNK> of the movie loses us early on though i'm perfectly willing to admit that there might be somebody out there who actually gets some deep message out of this film br br this muddled <UNK> paced drama runs a full two hours and five minutes though i seriously doubt anyone with any kind of a life will still be hanging around by the closing credits
<START> i've seen other guinea pig films like mermaid in a <UNK> he never dies and while they're pretty sick they at least have a bit of a sense of humor to them however dark devil's experiment though is nothing more than filming a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> a young girl to many methods of torture and violence and there's no plot and no redeeming values to it whatsoever it isn't remotely scary except for perhaps the mind set but it's definitely disgusting and i certainly would not call it entertainment now i'm not the <UNK> of good taste in films and i like my trash and sleaze but this was too much for me really i'm all for disturbing in fact i seek out things that are disturbing whenever possible but this was a bit much the young woman is kicked beaten <UNK> to continuous noise via <UNK> until she <UNK> and then <UNK> with raw meat and <UNK> and left hanging in a <UNK> out in the woods somewhere if you think that sounds great go for it but it certainly put me off viewing any more guinea pig stuff 1 out of 10 absolutely nauseating
<START> ok this movie had a terrible premise be serious according to the movie they had just been through an apocalyptic war yet they have money to buy huge robots and pit them against each other each country decides instead of <UNK> into <UNK> their country they would rather fight with robots no one could afford here's a better idea lets rely on our most inept <UNK> <UNK> to fight our battles br br everyone says what about the director what about him he makes a good movie he makes a bad movie there is no reason to give this movie some credit just because of the director maybe he was asleep i thoroughly enjoyed this movie because it was so cheesy and ridiculous i had to laugh i actually had a good time watching it well except for the cowboy mentor who turns out to be an assassin trust me no one would see this guy as an assassin so it is a surprise however lame what kind of training exercise is a jungle jim anyway i was sad to see mst3k had not done this one i am giving a two star rating however because nothing could be as bad as <UNK> the hands of fate br br the budget does not matter either i have seen plenty of reasonable movies that had nothing for budgets like cube the storyline was not even plausible and i have seen better acting in school plays <UNK> they could have <UNK> an eleven year old from any middle school play br br anyway pick it up it is a fun movie to watch
<START> except for <UNK> some nice cinematography i can hardly say anything positive about this movie the single real issue is the <UNK> dilemma whether to remain with his childhood friends in the world of misery or to leave them and take up his own life <UNK> emotionally powerful scenes do not go with this plot and because of bad acting they also fail to create the intended atmosphere the director only manages to introduce <UNK> dilemma and eventually brings an easy solution the characters do not seem to <UNK> although it is difficult to speak of any characters perhaps except for sonny beside him actors do not get to play much and when some of them have to they come off as self <UNK> amateurs i wonder what ruined the movie more the superficial script throwing away all the potential of the plot or the bad acting disturbing any appeal that might be left
<START> this review may have spoilers but that determination would be <UNK> in such a classic and well known story br br the cinderella story ranks as my favorite fairy tale the world will never have enough of this wonderful tale br br the problem is that everyone wants to tell their own version of the tale this cannot work if the story <UNK> or attempts to throw some interesting ideas together with some magical photography and <UNK> looking production designs with poor direction and editing br br this cinderella story is more like an ugly <UNK> that never <UNK> or rather is never transformed into a <UNK> br br all the production value that money can buy cannot purchase good cinematic timing and dramatic development or good acting br br the entrance of cinderella at the ball as so poorly done there was no drama of anticipation nor excitement of discovery br br the writing made me very nervous too the prince charming was the most <UNK> of memory why would any girl want to marry a <UNK> self absorbed prince who disliked women br br <UNK> turn on the stepmother role was an embarrassingly painful showing that demonstrated one liners more than acting nuance br br even the cinderella part held little interest or sympathy br br perhaps only one sentence will describe this attempt so cheaply <UNK> br br what must be mentioned and mentioned in shameful excess is the glorious photography <UNK> work and production design it was a pleasure to <UNK> the landscapes sets and settings as the story <UNK> br br for some cinderella storytelling go for two gems br br 1 <UNK> and <UNK> cinderella musical with <UNK> ann warren even with the obvious <UNK> tv 60's look to the sets this is the best version on celluloid bar none an all star cast makes every effort to provide the highest entertainment engaging <UNK> and memorable writing and music this is the classic br br 2 ever after this drew barrymore gem maintains the historical perspective <UNK> the story line but not enough to <UNK> the effective development of the <UNK> points of this classic tale the characters of the principals and of all of the supporting roles were written <UNK> and acted well
<START> i saw this dull waste of time on <UNK> comedy channel so i quite <UNK> and obviously assumed that this was a comedy but there is absolutely nothing funny here a good cast is basically wasted on a script that i could have written with my left butt cheek after it had been beaten senseless by <UNK> century <UNK> <UNK> the first half is particularly bad as it has some of the most dull pointless dialogue i've come across in a while and zero <UNK> zero plot to speak of just the fact that stars such as ewan <UNK> and zeta jones are in this little movie and yet this film has less than 1000 votes on this site should tell you everything a couple of nice shots of waves hitting the cold british coast but that's about it br br this is the sort of movie that gets made just because the people who wrote it have good connections family connections preferably and or plenty of cash lying around
<START> first off to give you some idea of my taste in movies br br 2007 comedies i enjoyed <UNK> knocked up hot <UNK> <UNK> of glory br br 2007 comedies i hated <UNK> almighty the brothers <UNK> good luck chuck br br i should have followed my first instinct and turned off hot rod after i got to about the 20 minute mark i knew by that point that this movie would not make me laugh once the script is absolutely brutal i have no idea how this monstrosity managed to crack 6 on imdb any one older than 10 years old who enjoyed this must be some kind of mental <UNK> br br this doesn't come close to anything with will farrell and it's clear that andy <UNK> can't carry anything longer than a 5 to 10 minute sketch on youtube or snl i don't know how they <UNK> ian <UNK> and <UNK> fisher into doing this movie they must have <UNK> <UNK> or something i came in knowing that it would be a dumb movie but i thought it would at least be funny i didn't so much as <UNK> br br i don't normally comment on movies at imdb but this was so awful i just had to warn people this is only the 4th movie i've seen that i've felt compelled to rate 1 10
<START> cinema is the ultimate <UNK> art it doesn't give you what you desire it tells you how to desire br br so begins the <UNK> guide to cinema in which <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> zizek applies his <UNK> <UNK> brain <UNK> to world cinema this film in three parts is the second feature documentary directed by sophie <UNK> yes sister of ralph and joseph and it is a notable accomplishment <UNK> in at 2 1 2 hours of talk from one man and yet remaining humorous and engaging throughout in essence it is an extended film lecture and one of the best you may ever get over the course of the film zizek <UNK> us through a <UNK> of obsession and desire in film history he touches on more than 40 films and in particular spends a great deal of time with hitchcock lynch chaplin <UNK> the marx brothers and <UNK> but he also takes a close look at persona the conversation three colors blue <UNK> fight club and the exorcist <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> into cinema <UNK> from thoughts on the death drive to the <UNK> of desire and from <UNK> to partial objects br br the <UNK> guide will be a slightly better experience if you've taken a few minutes to bone up on your basic <UNK> <UNK> however even if you're not <UNK> in <UNK> theory <UNK> dynamic and hilarious personality carries the film forward with such gusto that you aren't likely to <UNK> at the <UNK> <UNK> the film frequently cuts from movie clips to images of zizek inside the movie he is talking about that is in the original locations and sets the transitions in these sequences sustain such tension and humor that the trick never gets old and zizek himself is constantly making us laugh either from bizarre little jokes or from his enthusiastic <UNK> on for example a bold <UNK> interpretation of the birds and this go ahead and laugh attitude on the parts of both <UNK> and zizek is essential to the <UNK> character of the film it is the <UNK> of sugar that helps us <UNK> <UNK> weird medicine after all don't we all have a sense that past a certain point psychology <UNK> are just pulling our legs
<START> the wicker man i am so angry that i cannot write a proper comment about this movie br br the plot was ridiculous <UNK> tied together and altogether just lame nicolas cage shame on you i assumed that since you were in it that it would be at least decent it was not br br i felt like huge parts of the movie had been left on the cutting room floor and even if it's complete the movie was just outlandish and silly br br at the end you're left mouth <UNK> mind <UNK> and good taste offended i have never heard so many people leave a theater on opening day with so much hatred people were complaining about it in small groups in the mall four floors down from the theater near the entrance it's that bad br br i heard it compared to <UNK> american werewolf in paris and <UNK> my boyfriend was so mad he wouldn't even talk about it br br <UNK>
<START> this dumb comedy really does a good job of wasting comedic talent in particular dan <UNK> and howard <UNK> are <UNK> badly here i might have <UNK> once or twice during this film but in general it's a boring movie with a little bit of stupidity thrown in for good measure the premise although routine still wasn't bad but once the plot was set the film went nowhere don't waste your time with this misfire
<START> i know you've read that before on countless other films no doubt if you're reading the comments here but voodoo academy still stands as the absolute worst film i've been able to track down no doubt the really bad ones aren't even available to buy or watch on tv but even so i feel it's fair to qualify that i'm not just some dumb <UNK> who picked badly br br i've seen two thirds of the bottom 100 <UNK> films here on the imdb and i'm <UNK> of the remaining ones with every chance most of those stand head and shoulders above this <UNK> in absolute <UNK> br br i like to rate truly bad films as in ones with no humour even in how bad they are by how many people you need to watch it with to make it all the way through if you can watch it by yourself it isn't that bad if you can watch it with one single friend it's bad but could be a lot worse br br it took 5 of us to make it all the way through voodoo academy and not even the usually fun moments of watching bad films <UNK> the boom <UNK> for example 3 times in this one if i'm not mistaken could take away the dry taste in my mouth yes i'd watched it but i'd also forced 4 of my friends to watch it with me to achieve that end br br i hope and pray we saw the directors cut to think that there could be a version with 20 more minutes of big <UNK> <UNK> with baby oil <UNK> <UNK> their <UNK> just scares the hell out of me so much of the film centers around this br br i do applaud david <UNK> for managing to lens this film in two days on a short budget just as i applaud him for convincing people to pay him to make what is no doubt a celluloid version of some of his <UNK> but it isn't a good film the original shop of horrors was shot in the same length of time for a <UNK> amount of money considering <UNK> and was an utter gem it's not an excuse for how bad this baby is br br spoilers ahead br br it's not even worth picking apart the plot holes or cliched know it all hero characters the pacing of the film is insane nothing is interesting for the length of time <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> self <UNK> no matter what your <UNK> or sex <UNK> just cannot sustain that kind of screen time br br the acting is cheese but not overly <UNK> i've seen a lot worse in better films but somehow it's the semi competent delivery of some of the worst lines you'll ever hear in a film that really <UNK> br br rent this if like me you have a fascination with the worst of the worst and only if you're going to watch it with a group of people who are prepared to work to get through it this is no ha ha ha the set <UNK> affair it's an <UNK> test you probably want to skip br br i'm sure there is worse but i wouldn't be surprised if it has <UNK> name on it
<START> this movie is <UNK> one of my favorite movies in it's kind the interaction between respectable and morally strong characters is an <UNK> to <UNK> and the honor code amongst thieves and policemen it treats themes like duty guilt word manipulation and trust like few films have done and unfortunately none that i can recall since the death of the <UNK> in the late seventies the sequence is delicious down to the essential living nothing out and thus leading the <UNK> into a masterful plot right and wrong without <UNK> eye catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in lesser <UNK> of the genre in order to keep the audience awake no such scenes are present or needed the argument is sand honest to the <UNK> an important asset in a genre that too often achieve suspense through the deception of the audience no this is not miss <UNK> a note of <UNK> for the music is in order a film to watch and <UNK> every minute not just to see
<START> no this is nothing about that fairy tale with the <UNK> coach fairy <UNK> and the glass <UNK> but if i were to elaborate i would have to spoil it for you which i won't but don't let curiosity get the better of you as this movie is not fantastic it's one of those movies that start off <UNK> before <UNK> its audience with cheap scare tactics and an incoherent storyline and that's real horror br br <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> won and <UNK> <UNK> shin se <UNK> are your ideal mother and daughter one's a successful plastic surgeon while the other your <UNK> <UNK> and beautiful teenage daughter their relationship is like hand in <UNK> so close you'd think of them more as siblings rather than parent child but things start to go wrong don't they always when <UNK> <UNK> friends whom <UNK> <UNK> has <UNK> on start to go <UNK> br br perhaps it's a warning to audiences and for those <UNK> ladies who don't bat an <UNK> when going under the knife if news reports are to be believed the only truly scary moments are those scenes in plastic surgery though somehow i thought kim <UNK> <UNK> time actually had more gore when featuring and describing what goes on during the surgery itself br br it's a tale of two <UNK> the fist being an attempt to shock audiences with standard scare tactics which i admit did get to me now and then however the second half <UNK> the movie into mindless <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and was quite contrived into its forcing its ideas down your throat some things begin not to make sense and while attempts are always presented to explain you probably won't buy it not that horror movies are logical to begin with br br the leads are all beautiful and there is a distinct lack of male presence besides the <UNK> cop role but hey i'm not complaining though the storyline could have been improved tremendously i'd recommend you to watch this only if you're a fan of mediocre korean horror on <UNK> watch out for those face off ish moments
<START> i grew up watching and loving this cartoon every year i didn't think they would be able to take a half hour 20 min cartoon and make it a movie they did it with flying colours fabulous funny heart warming effective movie
<START> horrid br br the special effects make the tv version of tremors look real br br no one in the cast can act br br kind of like the <UNK> voyage to the bottom of the sea meets the cartoon ocean going electric <UNK> cartoons
<START> as you can guess by my rating and my title of this review that i don't like johnny test now i think i know what people are going to say how do you know how bad it is have you ever watched it i did watch this show a couple times because i am studying film and animation and this just doesn't hold a candle to my standards br br i want to first talk about the animation because it is one of the most confusing things i have ever seen like the first two seasons or only first season had hand drawn animation i thought it was a nice show to look at when it was hand drawn but then it switched to flash animation and the quality went down by a huge amount br br so that is one strike in my eyes but lets look at the story of the show it tries way too hard to be like <UNK> lab but there are differences because instead of one red headed scientist there is two and they are both female there is a talking dog why and the parents attitudes are switched somewhat i have others but i don't think i can write them here i don't mean <UNK> but i mean i don't know if there is a limit for words everything else though is spot on even a <UNK> character johnny himself it just tries so hard to be <UNK> but it just seems to me like a heartless <UNK> br br lastly i want to talk about the jokes remember in <UNK> lab some of the jokes involved yelling yes yelling can be good for a joke or two but <UNK> lab also had sly remarks that made me have to go back and check to get the joke johnny test just forgets all that and just yells 50 of the time and stops the music whenever a stupid joke or one liner appears that isn't comedy thats stupid comedy i know what some people are thinking isn't three stooges stupid comedy watch that and johnny test back to back and you laugh more at the first option sometimes the jokes are based on bizarre situations which like <UNK> makes me mad i have a rule for cartoons and comedies all together to much bizarre doesn't equal comedy it makes you just think what am i watching br br so it strikes out on all accounts don't watch this show if you have any respect for comedy in anyway shape or form
<START> i saw this film about twenty years ago on the late show i still vividly remember the film especially the performance of robert taylor i always thought taylor was underrated as an actor as most critics saw him as solid almost dull leading man type and women simply loved to watch his films because of his looks this film however proved what an interesting actor he could be he did not get enough roles like this during his long career this is his best performance he is totally believable in a truly villainous role from what i have read he was a very <UNK> and easy going guy in real life and never fought enough for these kind of roles he basically would just do what mgm gave him this film proves that he could have handled more diverse and difficult roles the other thing i remember about this film is how annoying lloyd <UNK> character was nolan was a great actor but this character really <UNK> me the last scene of the film has stuck with me for all of these years this film is definitely worth a look
<START> brief summary this movie <UNK> everyone it touches that means you br br first off let me say i'm not a <UNK> and this might have been funny for a few minutes the <UNK> are not bad but overall it's just dull and excruciatingly not funny a few simple jokes are repeated over and over again br br it's clear that this movies only exists to squeeze the last few dollars out of the now <UNK> laurel and hardy the producers cannot have any real regard for their place in film history or their talents this is what offended me the most br br of course my daughter liked it so i'm also a failure as a parent
<START> the information contained in this movie is somewhat familiar to many who have been paying attention to the news lately the walter reed <UNK> show a small part of the fact that we are not doing a good job taking care of our injured heroes when they return br br what this movie further shows is a truth common to all wars the psychological trauma that soldiers suffer while engaging in war and the difficulty they have when returning to <UNK> life they are not just changed or affected they are different people and most do not know how to deal with that as they do not know themselves br br finally this film shows what the military does to our young men in women in getting them ready for war and the <UNK> and practices that they have to follow in <UNK> war that leads to all the psychological trauma br br we have over 3000 dead soldiers in the four years of this invasion but we have many <UNK> of thousands that will suffer <UNK> physical and psychological trauma because of this war it doesn't matter what side you are on it <UNK> you to know the cost of war to decide if we should be in that business this film illustrates the costs to the men and women perfectly
<START> i just saw a press screening of this film and i was pleasantly surprised not often is it that i get to see all of my favorite actors in one film at one time br br i really enjoyed the pick pocket scene and it was good to see <UNK> <UNK> and hayden back together i think their chemistry on camera is a direct result of their time together off camera my favorite scene was by far surprisingly so <UNK> <UNK> piece without giving too much away i'll just say that there is a surprise that leaves you hanging br br the old couple were really good together and you actually got the impression that they had spent a lifetime together br br both the chris cooper and the ethan hawke segments packed a punch with surprises that seem realistic and similar to experiences that i've had in the big apple over all the film is a great place to take a date especially if you're already fond of the city itself br br i can't wait for the next in the cities of love
<START> weak scripts at times yep cheesy special effects at times yep deliciously guilty pleasure most of the time yep more about carl kolchak and darren <UNK> yep i always enjoyed science fiction as a kid but found so much of the dracula frankenstein mummy horror stuff as just so much crap it took <UNK> and <UNK> to give me a new perspective on the classic universal monsters and it took carl kolchak to win me over to the dark side of entertainment the duke had <UNK> <UNK> eastwood had dirty harry garner had maverick and <UNK> <UNK> had <UNK> and darren <UNK> had carl kolchak mixed in with all those weak scripts cheesy special effects that <UNK> group of supporting characters and actors and guest stars there was darren <UNK> as carl kolchak he had a <UNK> sense of humor in spite of the danger was an <UNK> in his pursuit of the truth and a <UNK> when it came to accepting the obligatory incompetence and eventual cover up by government officials additionally unlike 98 of us kolchak was willing to stick his neck out and do what needed to be done even if it meant his demise the end of his <UNK> career or jail time for all his faults including no taste in clothes carl kolchak was a man of charm and wit who drove a beautiful classic yellow <UNK> which was an old used car at the time on his way to save the day for humanity as good as any other fictional hero carl kolchak was the <UNK> hero brought to life every week for one season thanks to darren <UNK> now that he's passed on and his show is on dvd i hope he's having as much fun watching me watch him have fun playing kolchak the night stalker all over again
<START> i'm not sure if the filmmakers were after a saw type movie or 12 angry men people <UNK> together the facts to get at the truth whatever it was it was poorly done and not worth watching br br i don't watch movies for blood and gore but because this film had little else going for it it should have shown the actual killing more most were off camera <UNK> the horror that we were supposed to feel by the deaths br br it also <UNK> me that the cop was among the victims he <UNK> contributed to the innocent young man going to prison by accepting planted evidence given to him by <UNK> into the evidence room and wouldn't <UNK> a the <UNK> attorney have had access to that evidence taking it out and putting the wrong evidence back anyway so she wouldn't have needed the <UNK> help the others while often also not realizing it was this particular person they were <UNK> still played larger roles in his ultimate demise the gun dealer should have know his guns would be used for evil intent the insurance guy rejected a person obviously in need etc but the <UNK> crime seemed minor in comparison since he didn't know exactly what he was doing the filmmakers could have taken it a step further and had him be the one that encouraged <UNK> to plant the evidence which would have made him more <UNK> and <UNK> yelling that he the cop got her in that mess doesn't make any sense at all br br it would been more intriguing if each person died in a way that offered the others a clue to why he she was there and deserved to die the insurance guy for example could have had the <UNK> he rejected <UNK> down his throat so he <UNK> on them the oriental woman could have had her eyes <UNK> out because she was a false witness etc yes more violent that the gun deaths but more interesting br br the dialog wasn't witty there were no twists and the ending was one of the worse if not the worst i've ever seen the ending along knocked three stars off my rating br br the actors did a decent job especially given the garbage lines and motivation they had to work with br br overall a waste of time
<START> great movie and the family will love it if kids are bored one day just pop the tape in and you'll be so glad you did br br <UNK> br br i <UNK> <UNK> s
<START> <UNK> is a movie turned into a video game i just love the story and the things that goes on in the film it is a b film <UNK> but that <UNK> t bother one bit because its made just right and the music was <UNK> horror and sword fight freaks buy this movie now
<START> the main aspect about the <UNK> movies at his later stages were the <UNK> the <UNK> between one movie and the next being a well established star of the south indian cinema the <UNK> he was receiving before <UNK> was great br br since <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1991 the number of movies he acted in <UNK> as a mass hero in 11 years were only 11 exactly at the rate of 1 per year all of these were a great hit he was having a image that many thought could not be easily brought down br br but after <UNK> 1999 he went into a state of <UNK> his fans all over the world especially in south india were ready to see movie of any kind with their superstar in action so the <UNK> cinema industry decided to come with <UNK> br br the movie makers thought that the fans will take whatever they show with superstar in it but this clearly did not work out in this movie as usual the hype from the media and the expectation from the fans were way beyond limit br br <UNK> image was totally damaged the fans went nuts the movie's collection did not meet the expected level reputation of great people went down br br the only positive aspect about this movie was the songs by a r <UNK> <UNK> is known to have composed good music for some worst movies like <UNK> <UNK> virus <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> star en <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc well i never thought that this movie would join that league br br <UNK> feel very much depressed not because the movie was bad <UNK> be because of the <UNK> image going down it took him five full years to regain it fully back with two movies <UNK> and <UNK> and give fans back what they really look for in a superstar film
<START> this is one of my favourite kung fu films and is regarded as one the most popular shaw brothers from the late 70's the plot is interesting and <UNK> the characters are cool each with their own style <UNK> snake lizard etc the action is limited in comparison with other chang <UNK> <UNK> films but what is there is interesting with different kung fu styles on display from the various characters i recommend this film to those who think all shaw brothers especially chang <UNK> films are the same most of his films usually focus on the 10 <UNK> and shaolin vs <UNK> conflicts this film is breath of fresh air in comparison
<START> it has taken me a while to watch this version as unfortunately i don't seem to be able to rent it in the video store only the other version but i fell in love with it i was always borderline with the other emma <UNK> and toni collette as they are not british naturally have to put on the accent and well to me it doesn't seem natural it seems put on sorry but don't think toni and <UNK> did a brilliant job there i could not warm to any of the characters but this version is more heart warming and more the type of person i imagined emma to be it is definitely the version i will come back to from now on i was disappointed that mr knightley was not better looking but he is convincing i also like jane <UNK> better played by olivia williams i never <UNK> to her in the movie version but she is better portrayed in this version come to think of it besides mr knightley all characters are better played and a lot less over the top unfortunately both came out around same time and the paltrow version got more publicity pity i also love the new scene at the end well done to kate <UNK> therefore if you are a jane austen fan don't forget to watch this one
<START> oh dear jerry may be the <UNK> king of <UNK> but the movies are a whole different ball game and he's way out of his league the script for this film is so poor it has to be seen to be believed and its sad to see such vaguely familiar actors as michael <UNK> 80's action <UNK> king michael <UNK> white last seen in the sci fi flop <UNK> as well as surviving the <UNK> william <UNK> who is involved in the only half funny situation in the whole film <UNK> this low for <UNK> if you are a fan of jerry then stick to his tv show as this is a total waste of and hour and a half after i had finished sitting through this i managed to catch the last half an hour of rocky 5 on tv which looked like a cinematic masterpiece in comparison i think that says more than enough br br
<START> forbidden planet represents the kind of science fiction that is precious in cinema especially from the 1950s there was the day the earth stood still and war of the worlds but <UNK> not forget this gem which took some of its story from shakespeare's the <UNK> to tell a tale of <UNK> on a planet that has a doctor on it who has made a remarkable breakthrough it's the kind of breakthrough that is not so much incredible to look at though for 1956 it does look quite amazing to look at some of those sets and that gigantic machine the doctor creates but with its emphasis on the characters and its themes of technology taken too far by the more primitive side of human nature even when we don't know we're <UNK> it br br on the surface that is in the first ten minutes it looks standard if a little more <UNK> acted and directed with better skill than the b movies of the period a ship of <UNK> are on a mission to the planet <UNK> 4 to bring back an expedition that went missing decades before but the only one left is dr <UNK> walter <UNK> and his daughter who somehow were <UNK> to an attack that left everyone else dead <UNK> appears to be a <UNK> and highly intelligent man and his technology looks to be so impressive that the only thing the <UNK> led by the <UNK> leslie <UNK> can think to do is to report it back to their superiors on earth br br but there's a catch something is killing off members of the crew of the ship one by one every night even when the others keep an eye out and then put up an invisible electric fence which the invisible something goes through easily meanwhile there's some romance possibly between the <UNK> and <UNK> and there's a more <UNK> vibe from the doctor you shouldn't have come to the planet to start and now you need to go what happens from this is even more fascinating just on a purely intellectual level but forbidden planet never forgets that its audience should also be entertained by this story while getting some useful ideas while everyone may remember <UNK> the robot and for good reason perhaps the most unforgettable image for me is the monster realized on screen with the crew firing to no <UNK> animated with red electricity and looking so <UNK> that it looks out of <UNK> br br the acting from <UNK> is subtle you wouldn't expect him to be a villain though something is there in the character and in the performance that speaks to this and by the end it makes the character far more complex than one would expect and the other performances are <UNK> but also excellent from <UNK> as a born leader to <UNK> providing some great comic relief as the cook who i should add helps with one of the funniest scenes in the film with those <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> provides and the effects for its time are extraordinary sophisticated in a nostalgic pulp way for today too and the music done by <UNK> is beautiful in its tones but ultimately it's the screenplay and careful direction from <UNK> that puts this a notch above the rest of the b movie lot when it's meant to be funny it's intentionally so and it works when it's dramatic it <UNK> quite well even in its stiff moments with the actors and when we are made to think about a horrible situation it comes on gradually with nuance not shoved in our faces or <UNK> with mega action br br an inspiration for many other sci fi films and a fine <UNK> of thoughtful science fiction stories and books from time old it's a classy and entertaining classic
<START> true story of three girls who go into the <UNK> of <UNK> and end up hunted by a maniac in the woods this is the sort of film that would have played in the drive ins across america thirty years ago to mixed acclaim not particularly much of anything the film works with its low budget to mixed results the film is watchable but isn't at all scary blame how some of the attack scenes for that its the sort of film that you'll probably forget about once you're done with it odds are that you're never going to think to see this unless its handed to you by someone and told here watch this which is what happened to me if you're handed a copy give it back the film isn't worth the effort to see it even if it is watchable
<START> whenever i see most reviews it's called 'a misfire for eddie <UNK> these critics want to take a look at some of the stuff he's doing these days and maybe <UNK> their stance in retrospect the golden child is not <UNK> entertainment but thanks to some of the cast it <UNK> new life into old clichés and gives murphy one of his best roles i don't understand the <UNK> lack of <UNK> for its efforts at all perhaps it was released at a time when the establishment had grown weary of <UNK> thrill a minute adventures steven spielberg started it with indiana jones it's unfair to make this one a <UNK> when what is possibly its biggest sin is also utterly harmless there's nothing necessarily wrong with trying to <UNK> on <UNK> br br yes it's silly but even an occasional <UNK> should be able to understand that <UNK> is where hollywood's idea of <UNK> begins and ends what's more important than believability with a story like this is that the audience have entertaining tour <UNK> on hand to show them the mysterious sights michael ritchie and eddie murphy fit the bill for this capacity just fine my advice to you is to buy the ticket and take the ride
<START> the movie is great and i like the story i prefer this movie than other movie such the cell sick movie and <UNK> silly movie i just tell the truth i like a reality <UNK> and also a true story br br
<START> enjoyable and watchable tim meadows at his best a big boost from billy dee williams he and a very funny john <UNK> provide a solid foundation for mr <UNK> <UNK> have fun with this one
<START> excellent endearing film with peter falk and paul reiser joining forces as father and dad br br dad shows up one evening to state that after over 40 years of marriage mom olympia dukakis has left him br br the rest of the film depicts the father and son on a day trip to get <UNK> thoughts off what has occurred with them away the daughters can play detectives br br the story shows the adventures of father and son in their discussion of life what should have been why mom was complaining about dad as they discuss their <UNK> of life br br we see an unexpected fishing trip and pool playing which leads to a near <UNK> both men seem to break out of their daily lives br br the end is a <UNK> as we learn why mom suddenly left it becomes a story of courage and the human spirit in the face of <UNK> it's never too late to change
<START> this movie was strange i watched it while <UNK> a quarter of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it was really weird im pretty sure you are supposed to watch it high but <UNK> weren't enough i couldn't stop laughing maybe <UNK> would work the movie is a bunch of things <UNK> into other things and dancing its really cheesy for todays standards but when it was released im sure it was well one of a kind i could see how some people would think this movie was good but i didn't think it was very interesting and i was on <UNK> at the time if your having a party or something and <UNK> pretty lit pop it on you'll get a few laughs
<START> when this movie was released it <UNK> one of the all time great capsule movie reviews <UNK> stinks it does but in a mesmerizing sort of way the casting is silly starting at the top frank <UNK> and sir john gielgud as <UNK> not enough makeup in <UNK> for that at least not while this film was being made but it's rather amusing to see them try the performances run the gamut from mummy like sorry the obvious observation to over the top with very few stops in between the <UNK> anne down character seems as though she couldn't find egypt on a map much less <UNK> upon its <UNK> <UNK> that's due at least in part to some really bad writing one of the <UNK> that will be visited upon every viewer of this movie it's my opinion that movies involving a curse or that draw their basis from a subject that is somewhat <UNK> such as <UNK> are <UNK> for silly <UNK> dialogue it doesn't disappoint and the <UNK> proves a double <UNK> the plot has one driving source of dramatic tension can this get dumber and less believable the answer is usually yes the location shots are beautiful and the set design is generally very good the only consistent <UNK> that this wasn't some low budget production that and the fact that there are so many well known faces doing service in such an unintentional <UNK> cheap no cheesy yes
<START> <UNK> rubbish this has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen the dialogue is ghastly the horror effects are laughable the only thing that kept me watching was the ever splendid and totally underrated michael <UNK>
<START> woman with wig who <UNK> her hair in the middle of the film takes of wig presumably does not see what the audience can see from miles away br br begin spoiler alert that her <UNK> is having an affair with her best girlfriend and they both try get rid of her end of spoiler alert br br and what a spoiler that was the title already gives it away doesn't it bad acting bad script waste of time oh yeah in the end she lives happily ever after br br if you liked this movie you'll really love cannibal women in the <UNK> jungle of death
<START> i liked this film very much the story jumps back and forth quite a bit and is not easy to follow there is no resolution to the story whatsoever and you are left to wonder what really happened since i like that sort of film i enjoyed this i especially like the dating scenes between the boys and i was drawn into their lives and of course any film with a naked <UNK> <UNK> will get a couple of extra points
<START> what has ireland ever done to film <UNK> that they seek to represent the country in such a <UNK> way this movie begins like a <UNK> for film students on irish cinematic cliches <UNK> priests spitting before <UNK> town square cattle <UNK> <UNK> by country meadows to the backdrop of <UNK> folk music quickly however it becomes apparent that the main theme of the film is the big daddy o of irish cliches <UNK> <UNK> it concerns a <UNK> woman who wants to decide where her catholic <UNK> child is educated which would seem like a reasonable enough wish though not to the <UNK> county <UNK> villagers she has to live with rather than send them to a catholic school she decides to up and leave for <UNK> then scotland where a few more cliches are <UNK> while she's there her father who looks <UNK> like george lucas and family back home are subjected to a <UNK> which turns very nasty i'm not going to give away the ending not because i think people should go see this movie but because it's not very interesting one of the problems with the film is the central character we're supposed to <UNK> with her but end up instead <UNK> her to get a life the villagers are presented as <UNK> whose prejudices should be stood up to but <UNK> your kids seems an <UNK> way to go about it in addition it takes on <UNK> which it <UNK> <UNK> under when it tries to draw <UNK> with the current northern ireland peace process the woman is told by her lawyer that she must lay down <UNK> for her return the film is allegedly based on a true story but it's themes have been dealt with much more <UNK> and with less <UNK> to hackneyed cliches in the past
<START> everybody knows that gregory <UNK> original the prophecy didn't really require a sequel but you also don't need a degree in rocket science hanging above your <UNK> to realize that further cash ins on this <UNK> horror concept were inevitable part two is a very <UNK> example of a straight to video sequel meaning the creative and convoluted plot of the original has been <UNK> a lot in favor of more action more witty one liners and a lot more eerie religious scenery the only good news is that the producers managed to keep christopher walken for the role of gabriel and he delivers another <UNK> <UNK> performance that promptly <UNK> the price of a rental if it wasn't for <UNK> performance and perhaps a couple of players in the supportive cast like <UNK> murphy and glenn <UNK> the prophecy ii surely would have disappeared into oblivion straight after its release the movie begins with gabriel literally getting <UNK> out of hell to proceed with his ongoing war of heaven here on earth the purpose of his battle this time is to prevent the baby of nurse valerie <UNK> jennifer <UNK> from getting born for you see her unborn child is the first ever hybrid between a heavenly angel and an <UNK> monkey and the birth of such a superior being would imply the downfall of <UNK> evil <UNK> thus just as in the first movie he <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> to assist him and <UNK> valerie all the way down to the <UNK> for the final showdown the prophecy ii is an <UNK> and occasionally even entertaining movie as long as you don't make comparisons with the original and as long as you manage to overlook the multiple plot holes and errors in continuity whenever the storyline becomes too tedious the makers luckily enough always insert a near brilliant christopher walken moment to distract you his interactions with the rebellious <UNK> and particularly his ignorance regarding modern <UNK> <UNK> often result in worthwhile and memorable sequences on a slightly off topic note i often felt like the prophecy ii ambitions to look similar to terminator ii  <UNK> <UNK> looked somewhat like the <UNK> of a futuristic cyborg and the <UNK> location where the final battle takes place looks very similar to the steel factory where terminator ii ended as well coincidence i guess overall this is an inferior and passable sequel but still worth checking out in case you're a fan of christopher <UNK> unique acting charisma and who isn't
<START> i didn't mind the film that much but it was incredibly dull and boring a few laughs here and there but nothing to go crazy for br br you should give it a go if you like silly stupid humour because this is the film for you
<START> the big problem is where to begin as this movie needs your attention the <UNK> two hours and you better not miss some minutes for getting a coke as there is a danger you can't follow but good there is also a pause button bruce willis must travel into a <UNK> to find out some <UNK> for a virus that made animals rule over the world in 1996 thanks to some mistakes he first ends up in 1990 then in the first world war and how messed up it all might look like terry gilliam comes up with what must be one of the most intelligent scripts ever this ex monty <UNK> man knows exactly how genius sf stories has to be told like and his choice of cast couldn't have been any better there is the lunatic brad pitt his performance in the asylum is memorable and a superb bruce willis who proves he is more than some <UNK> wanna be it's a movie you can watch over and over again as the script is so weird and complicated and yet you can follow that every view gives you other surprises one of my big favourites
<START> this movie was great and i would like to buy it the boy goes with his grandfather to catch a young eagle the boy has to feed and care for the eagle until it is old enough to be sacrificed for the <UNK> the boy saves the eagle from being killed and runs away from the tribe the eagle helps feed him by catching a duck from a small pond the boy scares up later the boy shoots a deer that a bully kid was claiming because their <UNK> were marked very close the same only until they check the <UNK> of the red lines do they determine who actually got the deer but this was unfortunate because it made the other boys even <UNK> to him and at the end he is being chased up onto a cliff but when you think he will fall off his pure love for the eagle transforms him into a golden eagle with only a <UNK> as a reminder of who he was please if anyone knows where i can buy this movie let me know i haven't seen it for over 30 years but still remember parts of the movie <UNK> <UNK> com
<START> <UNK> is an example of how a horror film can be effective with nothing more than a well executed plot and a lot of heart its cast doesn't have recognized names it doesn't have a big budget and it certainly lacks in the visual effects aspect but it <UNK> all that with an intelligent and well written script an effective cast and the vision of a director focused more on telling the story than in delivering cheap thrills eric <UNK> may not be a well know name yet but with <UNK> his feature length debut he proves he is at the level of <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> br br the film is the story of four prisoners in a cell four different men with very different backgrounds but with one single goal to get out <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gets imprisoned after being <UNK> guilty of a multi millionaire fraud his cell mates the violent marcus <UNK> <UNK> the intellectual <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the mentally challenged <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are all convicted for murder and give <UNK> a cold welcome their personalities will clash as <UNK> discovers an ancient book <UNK> how a former prisoner escaped using black magic br br written by alexandre <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a great mix of dark fantasy and horror in a way very reminiscent of clive <UNK> stories the movie's strongest point is the way it builds up the characters they are all have very complex and different personalities and a lot of the tension and suspense comes from their constant clash of personalities the story's supernatural element is very well handled and overall gives the film the feeling of reading a gothic novel despite being a movie about four men locked in a room the movie never gets boring or tiresome and in fact the isolation of the group <UNK> the feeling of <UNK> <UNK> and specially paranoia br br director eric <UNK> makes a great use of atmosphere mood and his cast to give life to the plot despite its obvious lack of budget he has crafted a brilliant film that feels original fresh and very attractive his subtle and effective camera work helps to make the film dynamic despite its single location and the slow pace the film unfolds is excellent to create the heavy atmosphere of isolation and <UNK> the movie <UNK> its plot the very few displays of special effects are very well done and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for quality in the few but terrific scenes of gore br br the characters are what make this film work and the cast definitely deserves some of the credit <UNK> <UNK> is excellent as <UNK> a man at first sight innocent but who hides a dark past <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are very effective too specially <UNK> in his very demanding role however is <UNK> <UNK> who steal the show with his performance as marcus a violent and disturbed man who deep inside only wants to be himself the characters are superbly developed and the cast makes the most of them br br the movie is terrific but it is not without its share of flaws of course the most notorious one is its the low budget some of the cgi effects are a bit poor compared to the effective make up and <UNK> used in other scenes however it is never too bad for it probably the bad thing about <UNK> is that it seems to lose some steam by the end when it focuses on the supernatural black magic rather than in the characters not too much of a bad thing but the ending may seem weak from that point of view br br anyways <UNK> is another one of those great horror films coming out from france lately and one that deserves to have more recognition <UNK> is definitely a talent to follow as this modest albeit complex tale of the supernatural is prove enough of his abilities personally this film is a new favorite 8 10
<START> i saw this film back at the 2005 palm springs international film festival and of the 14 films i saw there i would rank this as my 3 film i had an initial interest in seeing this being of swedish descent myself with many of my <UNK> coming from the <UNK> region of sweden where this was filmed also i grew up in an area of rural north woods america where many small towns were much like the setting of this film it's nice to see more films using rural locations as their settings like <UNK> <UNK> i <UNK> this was a very good film and i'm sure a very hard film to pull together with it's large ensemble cast but director kay <UNK> really pulled this off after a nearly two decade absence from directing helen <UNK> in her motion picture debut as an actress was fantastic and i would look forward to more of her on the big screen i enjoyed michael <UNK> in the lead of this well rounded cast i would highly recommend this film and rate it a 9 0 on a scale of 10
<START> the first 50 minutes of this movie were quite boring it focused on the personal problems doyle had including his sick wife death <UNK> by fans a <UNK> <UNK> and feelings of guilt concerning his mentally ill father even though these subjects had an important impact on <UNK> life i was more curious about the birth of sherlock holmes the last 40 minutes were excellent we finally got a look inside doyle head how he created holmes and why he had to <UNK> holmes the actors are excellent including the intriguing <UNK> played by tim <UNK> arthur conan doyle a compelling role played by douglas <UNK> and brian cox as the <UNK> <UNK> for sherlock holmes dr bell the locations are good especially for a tv movie and the camera work is nice if the first 50 minutes were as good the the last 40 minutes this would have been a small masterpiece
<START> this happens to be one of my favorite horror films it's a rich classy production <UNK> an excellent cast of ensemble actors beautiful on location cinematography a haunting musical score an intelligent and novel plot theme and an atmosphere of dread and menace it's reminiscent of such classic films as rosemary's baby and the shining <UNK> young vulnerable women find themselves <UNK> by supernatural forces in old creepy buildings with a macabre past here <UNK> raines plays a top new york city fashion model named alison parker her happy <UNK> exterior masks a deeply conflicted and troubled soul this is <UNK> by the revelation that in her past she attempted suicide twice once as a teenage girl after walking in on her <UNK> father <UNK> in bed with two women and having him rip a silver <UNK> from her neck and toss it on the floor and the second time after her married lawyer <UNK> wife supposedly committed suicide over learning of their affair telling her beau played by a suitably slimy chris sarandon that she needs to live on her own for a year or so she answers a newspaper ad for a fully <UNK> <UNK> one bedroom apartment in an old brooklyn heights <UNK> this building actually exists and is located at 10 <UNK> <UNK> right by the brooklyn heights <UNK> off <UNK> street the producers actually filmed inside the building and its apartments paying the residents for their <UNK> of course the real estate agent a miss logan <UNK> <UNK> seems to be very interested in having alison take the apartment an interest that cannot be solely explained by the 6 <UNK> she would earn especially when she quickly drops the rental price from 500 00 a month to 400 00 alison agrees and upon leaving the building with miss logan notices an elderly man sitting and apparently staring at her from the top floor window miss logan <UNK> the man to her as father <UNK> and tells alison that he's blind <UNK> response is very logical blind then what does he look at after moving in alison meets some of the other residents in the building including a lesbian couple played by sylvia miles and beverly <UNK> who provide alison with an uncomfortable welcome to the building <UNK> mental health and physical well being soon start to <UNK> and she is plagued by splitting <UNK> and <UNK> spells when she <UNK> her concerns to miss logan about her sleep being disturbed on a <UNK> basis by <UNK> metal and loud footsteps coming from the apartment directly over her she is <UNK> to learn that apart from the blind priest and now herself no one has lived in that building for the last three years <UNK> the courage one night to confront her <UNK> <UNK> she arms herself with a butcher knife and a <UNK> and enters the apartment upstairs she is confronted by the cancer <UNK> <UNK> of her dead father and uses the knife on him in self defense when he comes after her the police investigate and find no sign of violence in that apartment no corpse no blood nothing yet alison <UNK> the building and <UNK> in the street covered in blood her own as it turns out but there's <UNK> a mark on her what alison doesn't realize until the film's denouement is that her being in that <UNK> has a purpose she was put there for a reason a reason whose origin dates back to the biblical story of the garden of <UNK> and of the angel <UNK> who was posted at its entrance to guard it from the devil she is being <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> by the catholic church to assume a most important role one that will guarantee that her soul which is damned for her two suicide attempts can be saved at the same time the invisible neighbors who turn out to be more than just quirky <UNK> have a different agenda in mind for her this is a competent and intelligently done film and one that surprisingly portrays the church and its <UNK> in a mostly sympathetic light
<START> my former <UNK> contemporary simon <UNK> today a writer and journalist has put forward the theory that just as british film makers in the eighties were often critical of what they called <UNK> britain the ealing comedies were intended as <UNK> on <UNK> britain the britain which had come into being after the <UNK> victory in the 1945 general election this theory was presumably not intended to apply to say kind hearts and <UNK> which is if anything a satire on the <UNK> upper classes or to the <UNK> or the <UNK> hill mob both of which may contain some satire but are not political in nature it can however be applied to most of the other films in the series especially <UNK> to <UNK> br br <UNK> is or at least was in the forties a <UNK> working class district of london set on the north bank of the <UNK> about a mile from victoria station it is not quite correct to say as has often been said that the film is about <UNK> <UNK> itself independent of britain what happens is that an ancient <UNK> comes to light proving that in the <UNK> century the area was <UNK> by king edward iv to the <UNK> of <UNK> this means that technically <UNK> is an independent state and has been for nearly five hundred years <UNK> of the wishes of its inhabitants the government promise to pass a special act of <UNK> to <UNK> the <UNK> but until the act receives the royal <UNK> the area remains outside the united kingdom and british laws do not apply br br because <UNK> is not subject to british law the <UNK> of the local pub is free to open whatever hours he chooses and local <UNK> can sell whatever they please to <UNK> they please <UNK> by the <UNK> laws when other <UNK> start moving into the area to sell their goods in the streets the british authorities are horrified by what they regard as <UNK> black <UNK> and seal off the area to try and force the <UNK> as the people of <UNK> have <UNK> themselves to surrender br br many of the ealing comedies have as their central theme the idea of the little man taking on the system either as an individual as happens in the man in the white suit or the <UNK> hill mob or as part of a larger community as happens in <UNK> <UNK> or the <UNK> <UNK> the central theme of <UNK> is that of ordinary men and women taking on <UNK> and government <UNK> <UNK> which seemed to be an increasingly important feature of life in the britain of the forties the film's particular target is the <UNK> system during the war the system had been accepted by most people as a necessary sacrifice in the fight against <UNK> but it became increasingly politically controversial when the government tried to retain it in <UNK> it was a major factor in the growing <UNK> of the <UNK> administration which had been elected with a large majority in 1945 and <UNK> such as the british <UNK> league were set up to campaign for the <UNK> of <UNK> i cannot agree with the reviewer who stated that the main targets of the film's satire were the <UNK> black <UNK> who play a relatively minor part in the action or the <UNK> league who do not appear at all the satire is very much targeted at the <UNK> who are portrayed either as having a rules for <UNK> sake mentality or a desire to pass the buck and avoid having to take any action at all br br i suspect that if the film were to be made today it would have a different ending with <UNK> remaining independent as a british version of <UNK> or san <UNK> indeed i suspect that today this concept would probably serve as the basis of a tv sitcom rather than a film in 1949 however four years after the end of the war the film makers were keen stress <UNK> and british identity so the film ends with <UNK> being <UNK> into britain one of the best known lines from the film is we always were english and we always will be english and it's just because we are english that we're sticking up for our right to be <UNK> there is a sharp contrast between the rather heartless attitude of <UNK> with the common sense tolerance and good humour of the <UNK> of <UNK> all of which are presented as being <UNK> british characteristics br br most of the action takes place during a summer <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> but in the last scene after <UNK> has <UNK> the uk the <UNK> drops and it starts to pour with rain global warming may have altered things slightly but for many years part of being british was the ability to hold the belief whatever <UNK> might say to the contrary that britain had an <UNK> wet climate the ability to make jokes about that climate was equally important br br there is a good performance from stanley <UNK> as arthur <UNK> the <UNK> and small time local politician who becomes the prime minister of free <UNK> and an amusing cameo from margaret <UNK> as a <UNK> history professor in the main however this is appropriately enough for a film about a small community pulling together an example of ensemble acting with no real star performances but with everyone making a contribution to an excellent film it lacks the ill will and <UNK> of many more recent satirical films but its wit and satire are no less effective for all that it remains one of the funniest <UNK> on <UNK> ever made and with the possible exception of kind hearts and <UNK> is my personal favourite among the ealing comedies 10 10
<START> this has to be the funniest stand up comedy i have ever seen eddie izzard is a genius he picks in brits americans and everyone in between his style is completely natural and completely hilarious i doubt that anyone could sit through this and not laugh their a off watch enjoy it's funny
<START> i have to admit that over her dead body actually wasn't as bad as i was expecting my mom wanted to see it so i rented it i figured just to go ahead and see the horror before my eyes but actually this wasn't too bad i was just expecting this horrific movie but it seems like the writers meant no harm but the casting of eva longoria parker sorry she seems a little off set for the movie i think i may have found it to be a little better without her just she does annoy me but paul rudd and lake bell had a decent chemistry that made the film somewhat likable but you have to admit there was no point to this movie it was one of those quick <UNK> for the actor type of thing the movie could've been funnier if someone had really paid attention to it and had a better cast br br henry just lost his bride to be kate who was killed by an ice <UNK> on their wedding day but when his sister takes him to a psychic ashley henry falls for her but kate is haunting her from beyond the grave kate is jealous and doesn't want henry to move on so quickly and she will make sure that ashley doesn't get him by torturing her day and night with her <UNK> believe me with <UNK> voice that's scary br br over her dead body is an alright movie not sure if it's worth the money but i'd give it a rental for you if you want to see it or are curious eva longoria just doesn't have enough star power to make the film work no offense to those who love her she just belongs on the small screen over the silver screen not to mention the character of ashley she seems still not too likable with everything she pulls or her gay friend dan just again not really likable just with some re writing and proper attention this film could have been better but instead we get the average predictable romantic comedy that will leave with with an empty feeling br br 4 10
<START> but this has to be the worst a christmas carol adaptation of all time and that takes some doing what with the likes of various lifetime efforts don't get me wrong i have nothing against <UNK> <UNK> i've enjoyed her tremendously in other roles look at <UNK> in fried green tomatoes for example but the script gives her no option but to chew the scenery and chew it she does with all the enthusiasm of tiny tim <UNK> into a christmas <UNK> br br give me the classics anytime <UNK> <UNK> 1951 with the exception maybe of <UNK> all the others are just over the top efforts to grasp the past present or future spirit of christmas
<START> written on the wind directed by douglas sirk and released in 1956 is like all of <UNK> mid 50's films pure melodrama yet it is engrossing richly developed melodrama and <UNK> trademark lurid colour <UNK> <UNK> barely repressed emotions symbolism and <UNK> of the classes make this a film to <UNK> br br the film opens brilliantly with the four central characters and the plot being introduced as the credits are still rolling sirk uses a clever flashback structure to take us into his world br br robert stack and dorothy malone are magnificent as the two hadley kids kyle and <UNK> he drinks and sleeps around with women she drinks and sleeps around with men they both are worth millions thanks to the hadley oil business hunky yet poor mitch wayne rock hudson is <UNK> <UNK> friend and <UNK> dream lover enter into this <UNK> mess lucy moore lauren bacall a slim attractive young woman who falls under <UNK> charms after he picks up a phone and flies her across the countryside one evening mitch loves her too but kyle wins her they quickly marry and kyle stops drinking but fate seems to be written on the wind and it is not long before a conniving <UNK> who will have mitch marriage or no marriage a secretly smitten mitch the confused lucy and the sad drunk kyle come to blows br br malone is just wonderful as <UNK> hadley thoroughly deserving her best supporting actress oscar she steals every scene she is in stack is almost just as good <UNK> up the melodrama while still maintaining subtly and quiet desperation hudson and bacall are a lot more restrained than those two yet it is in keeping with the characters they play br br so what's all this melodrama really about it well a lot of things <UNK> powerful portrait of male <UNK> and fear for one thing sirk <UNK> stack with <UNK> symbols throughout the film note his tiny little gun the oil <UNK> and the ultimate <UNK> symbol <UNK> seeming inability to <UNK> children stack seems to be suffering from a massive male <UNK> complex made worse by his father's <UNK> for hudson his sister's desire for hudson and his suspicion that his wife is carrying on with hudson with all this wealth kyle hadley still ends up at the wrong end of town buying cheap corn <UNK> like a bum br br it's about impossible dreams and having to let go of them the river where kyle <UNK> and mitch used to play when they were kids is constantly <UNK> throughout the film <UNK> kyle and especially <UNK> wish for the innocence and simplicity of youth in an excellent melodramatic scene perfectly pulled off by malone <UNK> stands by the river and <UNK> herself again as a child with voice over of mitch telling <UNK> that she will always be his girl this is where sirk strikes a huge emotional <UNK> with the viewer who hasn't <UNK> about going back to that special place in childhood who hasn't at some point lived on a <UNK> memory who hasn't wanted something they couldn't have and <UNK> last line of the film yes he gets no dialogue in the last 10 or so minutes only close ups <UNK> on how far we've come from the river <UNK> amazing
<START> 1 i am not weapon expert but even i can see difference between u s army <UNK> in wwi and wwii in movie we can see <UNK> armed with <UNK> <UNK> invented in year 1932 not authentic <UNK> <UNK> aka silent death who <UNK> use until wwii difference <UNK> can load 1 5 times more <UNK> and 3 times more fire rate <UNK> was semi automatic <UNK> requires <UNK> after every shot little difference 2 german army uniforms has borrowed from 1940 year too especially <UNK> german <UNK> until end of wwi have significant <UNK> on top we cannot see even one in movie and if we make little additional search in <UNK> how much truthful is this true story i am surprised how much truthful can be film directors in a pursuit of cheap <UNK>
<START> jack black is an annoying character this is an annoying indie movie for 14 year olds do i have to write eight more lines <UNK> de la <UNK> is <UNK> fine to look at as a mexican nun who puts up with the rather forward and rude advances of jack black this movie is a pg 13 version of an indie film i really like a movie that has the courage to explore mexican culture this movie explores mexican culture deeply i just choke on its cultural <UNK> jack black is just so rude a white person like jack black is not my most valuable <UNK> into mexican culture as it were mexican wrestling culture is not the most <UNK> <UNK> a white guy such as myself could seek i suspect mexico is more <UNK> <UNK> than jack black has presented here br br i think imdb changed my review has anyone else had his review changed as well just a question
<START> this film makes you really appreciate the invention of the fast forward button on your remote control it's exquisite boredom in beautiful pictures for once hamilton goes relatively easy on soft focus shots however what i found hard to take about the film was that although <UNK> <UNK> was about 19 when it was shot the girls are portrayed as much younger than they actually are this whole <UNK> thing especially as there is an older man involved leaves me rather uneasy the heroine is actually <UNK> in the <UNK> area in order to make her look even younger than she is come on sex is a nice past time between <UNK> adults another thing i found odd was that neither <UNK> nor <UNK> have a nude scene in the film well not a proper one at least
<START> the sentinel features a sort of run of the mill and clichéd suspense mystery but is lifted with some good acting and taut pacing these stories have already for the most part gone through as many <UNK> as we can bear so what we're left with is how good is the acting how smart are the <UNK> and bad guys how well crafted is the main plot etc etc so the sentinel does a solid job given it's content michael <UNK> and <UNK> sutherland both maintain some good screen <UNK> and attitudes eva longoria first time i've seen her on screen brings some satisfactory support the whole affair side of the story is utterly implausible knocking it down a bit but it deserves slack worth a viewing if you like the genre
<START> this film has all the size and <UNK> of many of the great biblical epics of the 1950's and <UNK> but it is also perhaps the first that really <UNK> the biblical characters themselves the best thing about it is that it does not <UNK> them in the eyes of the viewer this is a unique and compelling balance that helps us to realize that even great people like david are flawed people who find their faith and greatness in facing their flaws br br the actors are all first rate in the film from gilbert <UNK> as david's second son <UNK> through to the wonderful susan <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> is at her best in this film her own truthful but larger than life style of acting is quite at home here she is ever the <UNK> but she plays the role in such a way that you sympathize with her br br raymond massey does a great job as nathan the prophet as a child when i first saw the film massey seemed like he truly had just <UNK> with the lord himself and was an awesome sight no doubt helped also by the great music composed by the always amazing alfred newman who also had great <UNK> in other biblical epics like the <UNK> and the greatest story ever told along with perhaps 100 other films too the cinema photography by leon <UNK> is well done and adds to the size but also the <UNK> of the film henry king a truly underrated film director who like william <UNK> never really <UNK> <UNK> himself into any one genre pulls together a larger than life production that never loses sight of the love story between david and <UNK> and david's own deep struggle with his faith in god the path <UNK> in this film could have been very hokey but king keeps it real and interesting all the way plus we never lose the sense of mystery about trying to understand the will of god just as david himself is struggling with the same from the first scene where a soldier dies trying to save the <UNK> from destruction david is not satisfied with <UNK> answer to <UNK> that no one can understand the will of god this is the journey we <UNK> on right through to the powerful ending where david is finally confronted with himself br br finally this film belongs to gregory peck who wonderful as king david his david is a man you can believe could rule a country <UNK> but was at one time a faithful singer of <UNK> this is one of his best performances br br i don't see this movie on television much anymore but when i do i never fail to watch it i think it still holds up very well today
<START> how this movie escaped the wrath of mst3k i'll never know <UNK> is a ridiculous action movie filled or is that empty with paper thin plots dumb characters and preposterous situations but take it from me if you enjoy watching poor yet goofy movies you will enjoy <UNK> a great deal br br the action centers around a <UNK> who is chosen by government agents at least i think they were government agents to become a spy you see his dad was another quasi government agent who has gone missing competing in this game called <UNK> the game so the <UNK> played <UNK> by kurt thomas trains to compete in this game and find out what happened to his lost dad br br sounds promising doesn't it okay so it doesn't but still that bare bones plot <UNK> doesn't begin to describe the <UNK> of this movie they can be found in the movie's strange details like the <UNK> mysterious asian girlfriend who doesn't speak for the first half hour of the movie then all of a sudden begins to talk and doesn't shut up for the rest of the time or the really tough <UNK> bad guy who likes to make and break the game 's non existent rules whenever he so <UNK> and of course there's our hero's delightful romp through the village of the <UNK> evidently that's the <UNK> real name nice place to visit but i wouldn't want to live there br br but where this movie really shines is the action scenes since our protagonist is a <UNK> the director thought it wise to stick <UNK> equipment into the back <UNK> and town <UNK> of middle eastern cities so that our <UNK> master would be better able to use his <UNK> skills to fight the <UNK> of evil on parallel bars and <UNK> horses it has to be seen to be believed br br one interesting thing of note a lot i'd say about half the cast dies from being shot with an arrow interesting because the <UNK> are the only believable effects or action in the entire movie if these were indeed effects my one major note of compliment to whoever <UNK> these very realistic <UNK> wounds more likely this was the film's way of not paying extras nevertheless <UNK> deserves a look if you can see it without paying and are looking for some silliness that is an easy target for <UNK> br br
<START> i saw this movie about 5 years ago and the memory of it still <UNK> me to this day i was fully aware at how awful it was supposed to be going into it so i have only myself to blame but like most i didn't believe all the <UNK> being a sandler fan it just seemed <UNK> one of his movies could really be that bad i figured it was just sandler <UNK> i couldn't have been more wrong br br what we have here is a comedy that does not contain even 1 second of anything funny that is actually quite an accomplish you'd think in a 90 minute comedy they might have accidentally stumbled upon something even remotely amusing but no it's just horrible it's not so bad it's good its just bad you cannot laugh at how bad it is you can only cry you wait <UNK> for a joke that will at least make you chuckle but they never come br br have you seen the movie the ring where the people watch a video tape and die 7 days later if this movie was on the video tape people would die instantly by their own hand and there would be smile on their face as they realize their agony has ended and that would be the first smile since they pressed play br br you might be inclined to watch it just to see how bad it is unable to <UNK> your curiosity don't please don't trust me i'm doing you a favor there are 2 types of people in the world those that think going overboard is the worst movie ever made and those that have not yet seen it
<START> i'm a christian i have always been skeptical about movies made by christians however as a rule they are know <UNK> when it comes to movie production i admire <UNK> for trying to present god and jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen however they did a hideous job of it the acting was horrible and unless one is familiar with the bible in some fashion one could not have understood what the movie was trying to get across not only was the movie terribly made but the people who made it even had some facts wrong however in this critique those facts are <UNK> and too deep to delve into in short the <UNK> code is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen and i would not recommend it to anyone except for comic relief from the every day <UNK>
<START> andy <UNK> stars in another cop undercover tale daniel wu plays nick who is working for the cops and is also close to the top of a drug dealing gang <UNK> the movie begins as we watch the police try to make a drug bust only to see it go to pieces we then are introduced to the young drug addicted mother and her daughter living near nick and to his <UNK> and the cops and 45 minutes in i shut off the movie and put on the news well acted and great to look at this is as <UNK> a movie as i've seen in a long time its not bad as such its just you really don't care i mean i really didn't care at all i actually started to do something else completely forgetting i had on a subtitled movie on thats how much i didn't care i wish i could have hated the film but the film is such a <UNK> that it made almost no impression on me its not even something i could sleep to its just something to ignore come on the box called it the chinese scarface what after he was dead this is one to avoid
<START> new york city houses one man above all others the possibly immortal dr anton <UNK> <UNK> is the <UNK> <UNK> of humanity using his magical powers to keep his brother and rival <UNK> <UNK> up so that he may not <UNK> the human race well wouldn't you know it a <UNK> comes true and <UNK> breaks free and begins collecting elements including <UNK> and <UNK> for his <UNK> experiments with the help of a police woman named sam can <UNK> defeat his evil brother dr <UNK> comes to me courtesy of charles band in the full moon archive collection i had not heard of it which is a bit odd given that i'm a big fan of jeffrey combs <UNK> and the film isn't that old but now it's mine and i can enjoy it again and again the film certainly is fun in the classic full moon style richard band provides the music which doesn't <UNK> much from all his other scores and brian thompson plays the evil <UNK> we even have animated dinosaur bones what more do you want of course the cheese factor is high i felt much of the film was a rip off of the dr strange comics and the blue <UNK> was silly and plot holes are everywhere i could list at least five but why bother and why does the ancient symbol of <UNK> and <UNK> look <UNK> like a hammer and <UNK> combs has never been a strong actor so he fits right in with the cheese these aren't complaints full moon fans have come to expect these things and <UNK> them like crack laced <UNK> nuts i'm guilty i loved this film br br if you're not a full moon fan or a jeffrey combs fan you may want to look elsewhere but if you like the early 1990s style of movie making and <UNK> you'll eat this up stallone and <UNK> fans might like seeing brian thompson as a villain looking as <UNK> as ever and not being able to <UNK> english beyond a third grade level i did i wish there was a <UNK> ii but the company that makes a sequel to practically everything is <UNK> man 3 really necessary passed on this one
<START> john carpenter's halloween is quite frankly a horror masterpiece it tells the immortal story of escaped mental patient michael myers who returns to his hometown on halloween night to stalk and kill a group of <UNK> br br this was the first and without doubt the best in the halloween franchise carpenter shows great restraint in pacing the story very slowly and building likable characters unusual for a horror picture br br even more unusual is the non existence of blood and gore and yet it remains the scariest halloween to date get that br br halloween marked the film debut of jamie lee curtis and a defining point in the late great donald <UNK> career a true classic
<START> who ever came up with story is one sick person i rented it for our <UNK> party <UNK> and all six of us got freaked out cause we're all in an acting class together and we know a couple of the actors from class besides everybody screaming the whole freaky night i had freaky nightmares i kept thinking oh my god if i get up to go to the bathroom to pee i'm going to be stabbed in the middle of <UNK> or something i couldn't even go to the bathroom because we watched this gruesome horror movie i also thought why are all the girls topless in this movie but we don't any of the boys <UNK> you should make a horror film where the killer is a girl and <UNK> off <UNK> i would watch that over and over call it hard or soft or something stupid like that i'm only giving this movie a 9 because you freaked me out freaks
<START> the mother is a weird low budget movie touching at least two uncomfortable themes not usually explored in the cinema denial of love of mother for their own son and daughter and lust and passion in the third age br br the characters are awful may is a disgusting old lady and i believe it is impossible to feel any kind of sympathy or sorrow for her she <UNK> that she did not love her son and her daughter she cheated her husband twice with an intellectual she steals the beloved man of her daughter not to protect her from a guy without moral that does not love her but just because she feel horny with him she is trying to <UNK> her life after the loss of her husband in the worst possible way destroying her daughter <UNK> paula her daughter is a fragile loser who accepts her life the way it is her brother bobby is a man who lost his <UNK> because of his wife who insists in having her shop a terrible business indeed darren is an amoral addicted jerk who does not like anybody even himself br br the acting and direction are excellent the actresses and actors have outstanding performances and the direction is very precise i liked this movie but i recognize that it is recommended for very specific audiences my vote is seven br br title brazil <UNK> re start
<START> when i first saw a glimpse of this movie i quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of lucille ball rachel <UNK> portrayal of lucy is absolutely awful lucille ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent to think about a legend like lucille ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous i cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better lucy the producers decided to get rachel york she might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of lucille ball is tough it is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble lucille ball but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent if you noticed <UNK> portrayal of lucy in episodes of i love lucy like the chocolate factory or <UNK> nothing is similar in any way her expression voice or movement br br to top it all off danny <UNK> playing <UNK> <UNK> is horrible <UNK> does not qualify to play as ricky he's small and skinny his accent is unreal and once again his acting is unbelievable although fred and <UNK> were not similar either they were not as bad as the characters of lucy and ricky br br overall extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told if people want to understand the real life situation of lucille ball i suggest watching a e biography of lucy and <UNK> read the book from lucille ball herself or <UNK> american masters finding lucy if you want to see a <UNK> before the laughter would be a better choice the casting of lucille ball and <UNK> <UNK> in before the laughter is much better compared to this at least a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing
<START> the story has been told before a deadly disease is <UNK> around but the extra in this film is peter <UNK> his interpretation of <UNK> on the run is real he is indeed a desperate person just going home to see his child this person could be working next to you
<START> the van is a <UNK> movie about a guy who tries to lure girls into his new van in order to seduce them the only thing this movie doesn't fail at is precisely depicting the van <UNK> in the us in the late 70s it looks like it was totally made by amateurs it's trash but i loved it i have to admit i am a fan of 70s trash hope this one makes it to the imdb bottom 100 br br 2
<START> sorry guys i've already written my opinion of this movie but today was the first day i looked at some of the other reviews there are a quite a lot of people who agree with me but what's scary is that there are some people who seem to really like this movie i don't like to write nasty reviews or <UNK> other people's opinions but i think it's only fair to warn anybody out there who may be <UNK> whether or not to see this movie this is not a good movie i really like movies and i'll watch just about anything but this movie made it onto the incredibly short list of movies i watched and was happy to leave halfway through if you really are incredibly tempted watch the trailer that's the mistake i made because the entire movie is essentially in the trailer after that there are no surprises just some shockingly bad dialogue to waste time i love michael <UNK> in <UNK> and would hate to <UNK> him but i think it's my duty to stop other people wasting hours of their life on a movie like this
<START> <UNK> 2005 forms together with <UNK> 2007 and <UNK> 2008 the <UNK> trilogy of director christian <UNK> <UNK> one of the <UNK> de la <UNK> german movie directors of our time br br roughly <UNK> tells the story of a french woman whose daughter had been kidnapped as a 3 years old child while the mother turned around her head for 1 minute in berlin and has never been seen ever since then the mother keeps traveling to berlin whenever there is a possibility and <UNK> by aid of time <UNK> photography for girls of the age of approximately the present age of her age as we hear later in the movie the mother was already a lot of times convinced that she had found her daughter marie however this time when she meets nina everything comes quite different br br the movie does not bring <UNK> not even part <UNK> and <UNK> it is rather disappointing we are not getting <UNK> either in order to decide if the mother is really insane or not if her actual daughter is still alive or not most disappointing is the end after what we have witnessed in the movie it is an <UNK> for the watcher that he is let alone as the auteur leaves nina alone the simple walking away <UNK> that nothing has changed can be a strong effect of <UNK> f ex in <UNK> d but in <UNK> it is <UNK> br br since critics have been suggesting <UNK> motives in this movie let me give my own attempt why is it that similar persons do not know one another especially not the persons that another similar person knows this is quite an insane question agreed from the standpoint of <UNK> logic according to which the notion of the individual holds the individual is such a person that does not share any of its defining characteristics with anyone else so the <UNK> answer to my question is they do not know one another because their similarity is by pure change everybody who is not insane believes that however what about the case if these similar persons share other similarities which can hardly be by change e g <UNK> on their left under <UNK> or a heart shaped <UNK> under their right shoulder blade this is the <UNK> context out of which this movie is made although i am not sure whether even the director has realized that despite our modern <UNK> world the <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> of people around the globe that similar people also share parts of their <UNK> and that <UNK> therefore is not something <UNK> but rather <UNK> so that the borders between persons are open such and similar believes build a strong <UNK> of irrational <UNK> despite our otherwise strongly rational thinking a source of <UNK> of the most interesting kind
<START> it's depressing to see where jackie chan has ended up he used to be an <UNK> <UNK> of punches kicks and incredible stunts to be fair he's now in his fifties and one would expect some <UNK> but with <UNK> hour <UNK> where he takes a back seat to chris tucker of all people and then there's <UNK> fu <UNK> where not only is he in a purely vocal role but his character barely has any dialogue to say that jackie chan has seen better days is a <UNK> understatement br br it's times like this when the only solution is to whip out a dusty old vhs tape and watch jackie kick some <UNK> in his younger <UNK> chris tucker free days br br enter <UNK> <UNK> jackie chan plays <UNK> <UNK> a policeman whose task it is to protect a witness before a major trial he faces resistance from both the <UNK> <UNK> witness and the numerous hit men sent by the mob to silence them both br br but on the other hand who cares we don't watch jackie chan films for the story we watch them to see jackie chan perform eye popping stunts and generally punch and kick a whole lot of people who are less awesome than he is br br and on that level <UNK> <UNK> doesn't disappoint at all there is an awesome showdown in a shopping mall at the end that <UNK> in jackie <UNK> down a giant high <UNK> <UNK> seriously if this sort of thing happened more often no male would ever need <UNK> to go shopping for clothes br br there is also comedy much of which involves <UNK> <UNK> inadvertently <UNK> may maggie cheung his <UNK> suffering and apparently ever <UNK> girlfriend the humour on the whole is pretty <UNK> but it works so i'm not complaining br br the acting isn't too subtle either indeed i'm not sure there was anything subtle about <UNK> <UNK> at all director jackie chan yeah he does that too clearly has a deep understanding of why we watch his films and knows that while we're waiting for the next fight to start the last thing we want is to be looking for nuance and depth and inner meaning br br so <UNK> <UNK> is a blast as is the case with most of his films the fact that jackie actually does the stuff you see on the screen puts it head and shoulders above the competition i mean when jackie chan really is hanging from a <UNK> bus by an <UNK> a whole new wow factor is added to the action
<START> to confess having fantasies about brad pitt is a pretty tough admission for an <UNK> to make but what can i tell you maybe is that famous extra something that everybody talks about and makes a star a star it crosses that <UNK> it pulls you into unknown sensual and emotional territory brando had it in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gary cooper james dean of course and in more recent times tom cruise jude law johnny <UNK> ewan <UNK> and billy <UNK> women fell in love with garbo <UNK> <UNK> and audrey hepburn grace kelly marilyn monroe julie christie charlotte <UNK> meryl streep vanessa redgrave julia roberts and very very recently natalie portman but brad pitt has <UNK> <UNK> the concept he is the only reason to go out get in the car find parking buy a ticket popcorn and get into a theatre to see <UNK> if you liked epics in the <UNK> darling style you may enjoy this but if you don't go all the same we want to keep brad pitt in business
<START> this film was <UNK> to be a blockbuster film and it really is this is the type of movie that is made to eat popcorn to and watch the flashy graphics with that in mind the movie delivers perhaps not as well as the ultra flashy iron man but well enough outside of the popcorn <UNK> action and special effects the film drops off of the cliff faster than <UNK> e <UNK> br br many viewers myself included will complain about how most of the characters were severely altered but that only makes the film a poor adaptation not a poor film this film is <UNK> for other reasons the makers focused more on making it appealing to the eye than they did to the mind the characters that have been long <UNK> and promoted are reduced to 4 scene cameos the main characters of <UNK> victor <UNK> never called <UNK> in the film and colonel <UNK> are well developed i was pleasantly surprised by <UNK> <UNK> performance the rest of the characters are tossed to the <UNK> to make way for the all important eye candy <UNK> character is fully developed after 30 minutes as is <UNK> though victor does pull off some surprises late in the film br br the final boss of the film is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the original character and barely gets any development to show just why he is the way he is the filmmakers obviously felt that all they really needed to do was create a bad ass character who could do anything they wanted and slapped on the name of a popular character br br very disappointing
<START> oh my god this was so bad the story was weak at best and the animation was flat and lifeless even childish this film takes itself far too seriously unless of course they meant to be funny i saw this last week at the london sci fi festival and the entire audience was laughing at every scene i think my favourite was <UNK> you be studying medicine at <UNK> and i also think they were trying to see how many times they could <UNK> in the character <UNK> only line <UNK> will be together it is our destiny ' i'm sorry but after the first time the words lost all meaning br br and what was with the apple br br i recommend this as a lesson to americans you cannot <UNK> so please don't try you only embarrass yourselves
<START> writer director brian de palma is best known for his string of films that have been called somewhat unfairly hitchcock <UNK> contrary to popular belief de palma doesn't rip off hitchcock he borrows story or character elements that may have been seen in a hitchcock film and then <UNK> on them in a more violent modern way like hitchcock de palma is known for mixing blood <UNK> death with macabre humor br br dressed to kill made way back in 1980 is perhaps de palma's most well known <UNK> film and it's probably his best as well the story involves a cross dressing serial killer stalking both a burnt out housewife played by angie dickinson and a street wise hooker played by nancy allen br br yes it will remind you distinctly of psycho but de palma's flick is just as technically ingenious and darkly creative the museum sequence is particularly well scored and edited the elevator stab scene is also one of the most uniquely shot murders ever put on film dressed to kill may not be a complete original but i'd say it's definitely worth your time rated r <UNK> minutes 9 out of 10
<START> why did i waste my time with this movie there was not a single funny joke or line throughout the slapstick wasn't even mildly funny i mean really an out of control <UNK> sucking <UNK> why has the national <UNK> name been attached to this movie even christmas vacation was better than this i actually thought that film was very funny br br avoid like the plague
<START> i think a lot of people just wrote this off as another one of tom <UNK> weird movies <UNK> eyes wide shut but vanilla sky is definitely its own movie many people said it was weird it wasn't it was different and confusing but not weird weird is stanley kubrick or <UNK> shore different is the truman show confusing is the matrix or the game and unlike kubrick this movie has a conclusion everything makes sense maybe not immediately maybe not even today but it will make sense vanilla sky is confusing because david <UNK> tom cruise is confused that's the point that's where the so called weirdness that turned critics away came in if they had bothered to open their eyes as the original 1997 spanish movie they would have seen that and if that's not enough reason to see it go see it for the music cameron <UNK> offers a wonderful soundtrack he uses it to set the feel that notorious element that many movies lack with songs like the beach <UNK> good <UNK> playing at the dramatic and emotional climax of the movie he creates an offbeat yet <UNK> right feel a wonderful film in its script music acting and images vanilla sky is sadly a superficial <UNK> movie that critics <UNK> in order to appear intelligent excellent a
<START> i loved this movie the scenery was breathtaking the plot had some nice twists and turns and the characters were well rounded on two <UNK> however rob roy scored far above average first i have rarely seen a popular film in which the quality of dialogue was so high there were many verbal <UNK> and <UNK> to <UNK> the brilliantly choreographed <UNK> i could give numerous examples but why should i just watch the film second this movie understood a principle rarely acknowledged any more for a drama to succeed it needs not only a hero but a really believable villain if you don't have one there's not much joy in rooting for the good guys and rob roy has not one but three the earl of <UNK> his henchman <UNK> and <UNK> not one dimensional villains either but fully fleshed and very nasty it takes a bit more patience than braveheart there's more dialogue and the accents are a bit tough but it's a much more clever and subtle piece as i said i loved this movie
<START> i didn't give this movie a perfect score in order to be honest in comparing to great classics like citizen kane and seven <UNK> however this movie is so all around wonderful it's a real shame it scores so poorly for the general imdb <UNK> however the imdb <UNK> <UNK> to the geeky and paulie doesn't qualify for that br br the only acting criticism i might suggest is that <UNK> kate <UNK> didn't portray the perfect <UNK> child i'm sorry but asking a 6 year old child to out do dustin hoffman as the <UNK> is asking for the impossible in film making br br moving past that minor complaint the movie has the best of many films buddy road trip con games hero as friendly party animal party bird disney like humor for young and old etc what's not to like tony <UNK> wears his role like a pair of comfortable <UNK> that's normal for him it seems i'm russian i like long stories i don't like <UNK> but he almost makes me want to go out and buy one watch the movie and that will make sense br br buddy <UNK> and cheech <UNK> make very appropriate appearances in the film roles that are quite fitting to what we all know about them i have always found jay <UNK> to be a bit slimy and his on screen role fits that as well the only surprise to me was finding that jay was also <UNK> voice in the end even that works well put parrot and anti parrot together as a team and it creates a magic of its own br br if you are trying to find a film for you and the kids that is neither insulting nor boring for either paulie is a perfect candidate i will however admit that a happy moment colors my review of paulie i was on a road trip during a major heat wave the <UNK> air <UNK> died half the <UNK> had dead <UNK> as did our hotel and i said let's watch a movie where there is working air <UNK> so we did so for 100 minutes we were <UNK> amused and given a heart warming experience when i saw it recently on vcr under less emotional circumstances i realized just how well this movie was made br br it's a sleeper film you won't regret watching
<START> ah the best and funniest movie about female football fans only slightly better than the 1982 saga of teenage <UNK> set in north london <UNK> by the way i just watched this on film 4 2008 12 21 and am <UNK> my inability to set the <UNK> br br this is easily my second favourite football movie after mike <UNK> england manager but this time with the added twist of looking like a <UNK> piece of movie making from a team who apparently keep making movies which are banned in the country in which they are made just think about the bit where the girls are taken from the stadium just as the sun is setting fast reactions all round br br it is rare for a movie to make me laugh out loud but when the rural soldier <UNK> one of the girls into the <UNK> while forcing her to wear an <UNK> mask made from a poster of ali <UNK> i couldn't stop waking the others in the house with my <UNK> especially when the young soldier misunderstood the <UNK> calls for assistance br br speaking of the <UNK> i just wish i could speak <UNK> so that i could work out the writing on the toilet walls yes there were a few <UNK> in roman script but they mostly referred to <UNK> american rock bands br br also on the rural and <UNK> theme don't you <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> sounds like a <UNK> when he talks <UNK> listen to the custody sergeant in this movie and then go <UNK> br br i'm not going to bore on about the sexual politics of iran and i'm not going to bore on about the dubious acting my love for this movie comes from the script and the editing top notch stuff br br here's a list of my top favourite football movies 1 mike <UNK> england manager 2 <UNK> 3 those glory glory days 4 a shot at glory 5 the <UNK> stadium mystery
<START> wow ok so after reading the little <UNK> on here i decided i had to see this movie for myself this movie is horrible i stopped watching it i strongly recommend cleaning a closet instead of watching this movie you'll be more <UNK> entertained br br it's low budget with bad acting br br whoever is giving this movie <UNK> is completely incorrect and should be <UNK> br br i am in no way connected to any of the other reviewers br br simply put this movie is not worth watching br br very very bad movie
<START> wow here it finally is the action movie without action in a real low budget setting don't miss the hilarious flying <UNK> flying by a few times of a future seattle we find a no brain <UNK> seeking to avenge her childhood br br there is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors' performance is only <UNK> in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies mainly matrix without having the money to do it right yes we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot outs 45 <UNK> <UNK> but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid <UNK> attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then br br and yes we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere as if the script was thought out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes br br believe me it is as bad as it possibly can get in fact it doesn't deserve to be taken seriously but perhaps i can make some of you not rent it and save your money
<START> this movie has received a lot of bad press from people who don't understand what it was meant to be one must understand that this movie was never meant to be taken seriously it's camp along the same lines as army of darkness <UNK> was silly but funny and bad in a good way house of the dead fails to be good bad br br there are qualities inherent in good campy movies most important of those being believable fantasy one needs to believe what's happening in a movie to see the humor when a situation goes incredibly wrong without boundaries the movie becomes absurd <UNK> lacks any believability br br worse still <UNK> brings nothing new to the genre and repeats the same plot twists and character reactions that many horror movies inevitably start to exhibit for example all too often horror movies fall into the trap where the main characters find love amongst the gore and destruction i don't know about you but when i'm being chased by zombies i wanna make out with a hot chick believe it no then you probably won't believe it when the characters start sucking each other's faces in this movie br br beyond the obvious issues that plague this movie like so many other horror movies uwe boll elected to add scenes from the video game of zombies being shot randomly whenever a character shoots a zombie in the movie not only is there no clear <UNK> for this artistic choice but it <UNK> one from an already unbelievable plot further there are frequent and numerous examples of bad acting and seemingly no attempts by the director to guide the actors' reactions to events leaving the movie with no redeeming qualities avoid
<START> i guess this movie is a fitting tribute to the first superman film as it is just as crummy and painfully long as the original br br after an opening scene <UNK> solely of murky <UNK> visuals the credits pay homage to the even crummy looking for their time futuristic sweeping credits of the original superman film br br then there is some more murky stuff ma kent sees some kind of murky <UNK> on the farm and spends a good portion of my life slowly walking up to some <UNK> in the <UNK> then superman <UNK> up on her and <UNK> br br next we catch up with lex luthor in a scene about many murky close ups of an old lady as she dies we don't see <UNK> face until the end of the scene an early instance of the film's drive to leave no hackneyed stone <UNK> lex luthor is a guy who doesn't like superman because he is not human also he probably doesn't like humans either as the movie occasionally features some kind of plot about lex luthor planning to kill most of <UNK> population br br after a while clark kent shows up back at his old job i forgot to mention he had been away on a five year trip where nothing happened then he finds out lois lane has an <UNK> kid and is dating <UNK> it <UNK> him so much that he loses control of his super strength to such an extent that he accidentally breaks a picture frame br br at this point we see that miss lane is on some kind of jet attached to some kind of space <UNK> it is some kind of important event on account of it is on television then we learn that there are people in a control room <UNK> this event there are also people watching it on television and there are pilots in the <UNK> the film then reminds us that these people are involved by cutting between them for most of the summer br br as the events leading up to the inevitable disaster started to build i <UNK> myself to get a <UNK> i accidentally walked back into the wrong theater and watched that movie about al gore showing <UNK> in its entirety i tried to find my way back to superman returns but i somehow <UNK> into <UNK> home companion which i watched twice in a row then it was time to stop messing around br br i walked back into the first theater found my seat and looked up to see that the impending lois lane space <UNK> disaster was almost upon us still it seemed to be taking forever so i <UNK> around the theater met a girl got married raised a son and sent him off to college while attending my son's medical school <UNK> i remembered that i should probably check in on superman returns so i <UNK> myself and <UNK> back to the theater only to learn there was no need to hurry it still took about another half hour before things went wrong for space <UNK> lane when they did superman saved everybody which was pretty cool br br and then there is a a subplot where superman turns really creepy and starts stalking lois lane and her family with his x ray vision and super hearing then he tries to get her to cheat on <UNK> who seems like a good guy br br meanwhile lex luthor is involved in some kind of contest to display every possible generic villain behavior before the end of the movie i forgot to bring my <UNK> home with me they give you one at the door but i think he scored damn close to one hundred percent i hope he wins the million dollars br br at this point things start to gear up for the big murky finale i think maybe the <UNK> was broken on account of the movie seemed to be in some kind of loop for a while here i remember seeing murky things growing out of the water superman getting sick superman getting better back to the murky things he's sick again no wait he's okay again br br then lex luthor unleashed his final bad guy move yelling at his girlfriend a little bit br br then superman died and came back to life i thought the movie was over so i left br br ninety years later the <UNK> home where i lived felt a little <UNK> i realized i left my <UNK> back in the theater and i went to retrieve it when i did i was slightly surprised to find that superman returns wasn't over yet i tried to ask some of the viewers what i missed but most of them were only <UNK> with long gray <UNK> by now br br i sat back in my old seat and watched as lois lane <UNK> around her house for a while then superman showed up and started <UNK> the beginning of the movie and since i already saw that part i thought it was okay to leave br br so that is my review of superman returns br br oh also if you like jokes about people eating dogs or jokes about one dog eating another dog you will love this movie on account of there are two jokes like that in it
<START> the big bad swim has a low budget indie feel about it so many times i start to watch independent films that have had really good reviews only to find out they are pretentious <UNK> voted for by people who are so <UNK> by the idea of the film and its potential to be provocative that they forget that film is a form of entertainment first and foremost br br i do not know if the big bad swim has any message or higher meaning or metaphor if it does then i missed it br br from the get go <UNK> felt right it was easy and warm and human there were no major dramas or meaningful insights i just connected with the characters straight off and when as with all good films the end came around i felt sadness at the loss of that connection br br if you are looking for something big or fast or insightful look elsewhere look for a film trying to deliver more than it can <UNK> delivers a solid enjoyable real experience and i felt rewarded and <UNK> having watched it
<START> given the title and outlandish box art i was ready for just about anything perhaps my expectation were forced just a bit to high because i was left a little dry br br a film crew working on a soft core sex movie end up at a strange house when they get lost in the fog and decide the best way to spend the evening is to have sex where hasn't this set up been used before the difference here is the uber perverse nature of the sex not allowed to show all the goods <UNK> shots were illegal in japan for a long time what is shown is <UNK> out the movie tries as hard as it can to show the viewer just how unnatural sex can be br br amidst all the kinky goings on a mud monster whose origin i can't <UNK> shows up and begins murdering the men and <UNK> the women then murdering them too some of the sights are a bit much most notably a woman having her intestines pulled out through her <UNK> or another woman spitting out a <UNK> of stuff but otherwise the gore is pretty standard fare br br ultimately the film is pulled down by it's own designs it's too over <UNK> to be a <UNK> horror picture and too gruesome to work as a sex flick the <UNK> can work but there need to be a balance br br 4 10
<START> this movie seems on the surface to be a run of mill kids movie that parents can <UNK> watch with their mostly entertained little kids the movie seems and is mostly <UNK> towards children yet it does not stop on this level i watched this movie first as a young child and found it to be funny entertaining and heartwarming and did not see it again for several years i watched it again recently at age 18 and found it to be almost as funny but just as heartwarming and entertaining this movie is highly underrated and contains many messages of real life this movie is an inspirational quest story that is made for kids yet epic in its own right i recommend this movie to anyone of any age
<START> dig is funny fun amusing interesting stylish and very well done knowing that it was made on such a <UNK> budget over 7 years it is amazing that such a story can be told especially with such style and substance if you are a music fan or documentary fan this is a must see br br focusing on the brian <UNK> <UNK> and the dandy warhols over the years is a brilliant way to show the contrast between a decent band who meets with <UNK> success through <UNK> and the ability to compromise and a genius <UNK> lead singer backed up by a varied cast of characters who <UNK> their own success through drugs alcohol and insanity if i did not know that this is footage of real people i would swear it was an incredibly well written and imaginative scripted piece the story is compelling <UNK> and simply amazing
<START> this well conceived and carefully <UNK> documentary <UNK> the appalling case of the <UNK> <UNK> who it shows between 1969 and 1971 were <UNK> <UNK> en <UNK> from their <UNK> through the <UNK> of the british and american <UNK> <UNK> american policy makers chose to so act due to their perception that the islands would be <UNK> vital <UNK> for controlling the indian ocean through the projection of <UNK> and naval power at a time during the cold war when most newly independent post colonial states were moving away from the western <UNK> it seems british and american officials rather felt that allowing the <UNK> to decide the fate of the islands was not a <UNK> option instead they chose to effect the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of the native population the film shows that no <UNK> was made for the <UNK> at the point of their <UNK> and that from the <UNK> in <UNK> where they were left the <UNK> <UNK> community fell into three decades of <UNK> and in these new circumstances <UNK> by <UNK> they suffered <UNK> <UNK> rates of death br br following the passage of more than three decades however in recent months and years following the release of many utterly <UNK> papers from <UNK> public record office one rather suspects that there was some mistake and these papers were not supposed to have ever been made public <UNK> legal appeals by the <UNK> community in <UNK> have seen british <UNK> consistently find in favour of the <UNK> and against the british state as such the astonishing and <UNK> conclusions drawn out in the film can only reasonably be seen as proved nevertheless the <UNK> of great britain and the united states have thus far made no commitment to return the islands to what the <UNK> have <UNK> <UNK> are the <UNK> inhabitants this is a very worthwhile film for anyone to see but it is an important one for <UNK> and americans to watch to be silent in the face of these facts is to be <UNK> in a thoroughly ugly crime
<START> let's eliminate any discussion about the use of non asian actors playing asian roles the movie is <UNK> years old in <UNK> studio <UNK> believed that any actor could should be able to play any role actors were under <UNK> and did not always have a choice about what role they played end of story br br this is a truly great epic story of love individual rights class <UNK> and men women issues the <UNK> of the film is two brilliant performances by <UNK> rainer and paul muni br br muni plays wang a chinese farmer who is about to take a wife rainer from the start he treats her with respect during a time when women were looked on as little more than hired help without giving too much of the movie away they go through the <UNK> and <UNK> of all relationships and even though the story may take place in late 19th early 20th century the story and much of their feelings seems credible br br other than the fact that the movie is about 5 10 minutes longer than it needs to be and the performances of <UNK> <UNK> and walter connolly are typical 1930's cartoon characters this is a really wonderful movie that unfortunately has become a victim of political correctness br br 9 out of 10
<START> sly stallone is hardly the finest actor in the world but compared to his brother frank well roll out those awards now <UNK> haired muppet frank seems to think that every part he plays calls for him doing the role as an american italian wise guy <UNK> from the <UNK> ' please somebody make him an acting offer <UNK> can refuse ' this film just stinks the place out even by the terrible overacting in this frank still steals the acting <UNK> all the people compensate for their lack of talent by shouting their lines and throwing their arms about <UNK> wildly in a style that went out of fashion back with silent films br br the plot what there is makes no sense as a meteor lands and turns all the women into sex crazed <UNK> but as this is 15 <UNK> film that just means they strip to their underwear and make <UNK> sounds like dogs on heat what happens in the end i'm not quite sure as i was losing the will to live long before the film finished br br avoid this like the plague and watch <UNK> <UNK> for a reasonable film about a meteor about to hit the earth br br n b point of order when one of the female leads <UNK> down to her underwear she has her <UNK> <UNK> under her <UNK> <UNK> belt it's <UNK> over the <UNK> to allow women to go to the toilet with less fuss a trivial point perhaps but shows how dumb this film is when they can't even get this right
<START> one would think that a film about a young person's coming to terms with his <UNK> homosexuality would be anything but boring think again this production should be <UNK> and sold as a cure for insomnia because it's about ten times as potent as any sleep aid on the market it's almost as if the film maker considered making a movie but got lazy and decided instead to run a series of random and randomly boring images and go nowhere scenes throw in a couple of actual scenes featuring actual acting pretend that good lighting <UNK> important in the film making process and wrap it up under the <UNK> of an <UNK> film this is exactly kind of crappy product that makes it easy for a lot of traditional film makers to poo poo the indie film movement and which keeps the general public from more easily <UNK> indie films br br if you're interested in films covering this subject matter you'd be much better off <UNK> in to some of the great short films available at <UNK> website or renting get real better yet read stone butch blues whatever you do skip this long <UNK> piece of dreck
<START> <UNK> the <UNK> dinosaurs are back to take another bite out of our sanity in this all awful third film this time european terrorists irish i'd say hi jack an army <UNK> supposed to be <UNK> <UNK> they pull into a <UNK> open the truck and discover our old friends the <UNK> <UNK> comes visiting then when the rubber <UNK> <UNK> the terrorists the cops and some marines the whole film seems to be again largely inspired from alien as <UNK> 2 was with the pathetic marines going through the claustrophobic <UNK> guns at the ready this third <UNK> is probably the <UNK> and <UNK> film of the lot with only one <UNK> of blood when a rubber <UNK> rips a <UNK> head off the <UNK> are stiff <UNK> creatures as usual and the t rex sounds like an <UNK> elephant when it <UNK> it also appears to have no eyes one of the <UNK> scenes of the film is when the <UNK> arrive on the scene they enter the building where the <UNK> truck is kept and hear some weird noise coming from another truck on opening it surprise the rubber <UNK> gang burst out and <UNK> them why were the <UNK> locked up in the second truck after escaping from the first how did they get locked in as the truck door could only be locked from the outside what was the point of filming this scene oh bother who cares both thumbs down for the over sized rubber <UNK>
<START> todd <UNK> is a mad genius <UNK> jones his third and most fully realized short film has an offbeat sense of humor and will leave some scratching their heads what the film is about at heart and he would almost certainly disagree with me on this is how a regular joe finds the confidence to get through life with a little inspiration or not you just have to see for yourself the short is <UNK> making rounds on the festival circuit so keep your eyes <UNK> and catch it if you can you'll be glad you did it is hilarious and check out <UNK> other short films also popping up here and there from time to time single <UNK> and slug <UNK>
<START> i am truly beginning to believe that seagal is on a mission to see how crappy his films could become this particular movie was a complete and utter waste of time to see my first complaint was the cover of the dvd where they have <UNK> his <UNK> and made him look <UNK> and younger when in the film he looks like crap he has his big pot belly and double <UNK> going for him and the most miserable and bored look on his face br br the whole plot was ridiculous to begin with and drawn out way too long the whole film was leading up to the finale where seagal and his team had to take on a bunch of people under the influence of a top secret military chemical <UNK> <UNK> there was way too much useless dialogue and not to mention the ridiculous and constant dubbing of <UNK> voice even in the middle of a statement the dubbed voice sounded like a man with a frog in his throat and was quite comical br br the fight scenes in the film were horrible half the time when seagal fought you could not even see what was going on there would be tight shots of him <UNK> his arms at the camera and then the person flying through a wall or something it was reminiscent of the old kung fu series on television they used way too much slow motion for the fight scenes br br i believe this is <UNK> worst film to date and i am glad i did not purchase this film or i would have been very upset since i am a huge fan of seagal the <UNK> the action star is quickly <UNK> away and seems to be getting worse with every performance
<START> ok hollywood is not liberal br br obviously i'm <UNK> because it is im a conservative but the politics i will leave out of my opinion of the movie this movie was anti bush anti middle east anti big oil propaganda but that is not why it was bad br br fist off i will give credit where credit is due i saw this film opening night because i happen to like these kinds of films and am a political science major in <UNK> the cinematography was excellent and the acting was as far as i could tell very good br br the plot was impossible for me to <UNK> however i have been tested and have an iq of <UNK> but no matter how hard i tried there was no way i could piece together the story line of the movie and what characters where doing what br br the story and scene sequence was totally incoherent and poorly organized br br unless this is one of those movies that is meant to be watch many times to get the full depth <UNK> the story which it very well may be i have no idea exactly what was going on br br which makes sense because if you want to make a political argument and not receive any criticism then make your argument impossible to critique if you cant <UNK> them with brilliance then <UNK> them with bull s
<START> i watched this movie for a project on love please tell nicolas cage to learn what it would feel like to be his character and then re read the lines he's saying my life cannot go on i accidentally cut off my own hand my brother was close by obviously his fault and since when have happy endings included the nice guy who takes care of mom sad and alone no closure bad script and doesn't have enough <UNK> of minor characters save yourself unless your up for a good laugh costumes were done appropriately and extras did a fabulous job i'm sure it would have been a fun movie to make but keep it more genre specific i can't recommend this movie to anyone i know because it is not an intellectual movie it is not a chick flick it is not a strict romantic and i can't show kids because of the sex and questions to follow all in all just not a good flick
<START> damon <UNK> world of times square in new york prior to its <UNK> is the basis for this musical joseph l <UNK> a man who knew about movies directed this nostalgic tribute to the <UNK> of the world that show us that <UNK> of new york of the past frank <UNK> music sounds great we watch a magnificent cast of characters that were typical of the area people at the edges of society tended to <UNK> toward that area because of the lights the action the possibilities in that part of town this <UNK> of the city made a living out of the street life that was so intense br br some of the songs from the original production were not included in the film we don't know whether this makes sense but this is not unusual for a hollywood musical to change and alter what worked on the stage that original cast included the wonderful vivian <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and we wonder about the decision of not letting robert <UNK> sam <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> repeat their original roles these were distinguished actors that could have made an amazing contribution br br the film visually is amazing the look follows closely the fashions of the times as far as the casting of marlon brando otherwise not known for his singing abilities frank sinatra and jean simmons seem to work in the film sky masterson is after all a man's man who would look otherwise sissy if he presented a different <UNK> frank sinatra is good as nathan detroit jean simmons as sarah brown does a nice job portraying the woman from the salvation army who suddenly finds <UNK> with the same kind of man she is trying to save br br vivian <UNK> is a delight she never <UNK> to <UNK> as miss <UNK> a woman with a heart of gold who's nathan <UNK> love interest ms <UNK> makes a fantastic impression as the show girl who is <UNK> than she lets out to be <UNK> <UNK> makes a wonderful job out of <UNK> his nicely nicely johnson br br the wonderful production owes a lot to the talented <UNK> <UNK> who made the adaptation to the screen the costumes by irene <UNK> set the right tone
<START> ok let's get this clear i'm really not into sci fi but for some reason i love stargate sg 1 br br jack <UNK> takes his team sg 1 through a stargate a round device that creates a <UNK> it gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds it might sound like your usual sci fi series but it's not the plot is set today not in some distant millennium like many other sci fi series i find that great it gives you things happenings and such you can relate to and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all the <UNK> they have some of course but thanks to <UNK> who likes to keep a simple <UNK> there's not many br br the series has a nice <UNK> of action humor and drama if you enjoy loads of special effects you're not going to find it here they don't use many bad ones but a limited amount of well made special effects
<START> when i was little my parents got this movie for me to watch i really liked it and i watched it over and over again even when i was in 3rd grade i still watched it from time to time recently i watched it again just for the sake of nostalgia and though the show was not aimed for my age group i'm in my late teens i still found it entertaining and educational this show teaches good lessons about imagination and getting along well with others some parts i found quite entertaining also this show does not have any bad content so you can leave kids alone with this show and not worry about them picking up any bad language or <UNK> i would recommend this
<START> a teenager who seems to have it all commits suicide it leaves his family and his best friend keanu reeves asking a lot of questions and <UNK> themselves br br good idea badly handled for starters this has been done before 1988 mostly in tv movies and after school <UNK> aside from some swearing and dialogue hence the pg 13 rating this added nothing new the outcome is predictable and <UNK> attempts at acting were truly painful to watch he's good now but not in 1988 aside from that his character was dressed like a <UNK> and always looked so dirty is was hard to build up sympathy br br that aside the movie is dull i saw every scene coming and every surprise was <UNK> i basically couldn't wait for this thing to get over br br i have a vague <UNK> of seeing it in a theatre in 1988 and hating it it bombed badly it still looks lousy almost 20 years later the subject is worth handling but it's been done better with better acting in countless other movies ordinary people comes to mind you can skip this one
<START> this show is good i like the acting funny bits and the <UNK> of it the actors lee pace ann <UNK> etc they all did great in the show the show started off great with its funny illogical basic idea of bringing dead people back in the first series and honestly as what people said the first few episodes of the second series were a bit of a let down but it later came back looking good anyway and now i really hate the fact that it's going to be cancelled why doesn't abc just let it finish until the very end when all the episodes are already done i really wanna know how the story's going to be i think it should be given a chance as <UNK> still so many viewers who love it
<START> i myself feel this film is a rare treasure not only is it the beginning of shirley <UNK> career but a rare look on how our society has changed you have to understand certain things we today would view as sexual back then would be considered innocent for example the parents of the children in the film as well as the many parents who took their children to see this movie saw this as just children <UNK> adults most people didn't think of anyone viewing children sexually attractive other than teenage boys <UNK> over teenage girls to them it wasn't sexual mind you this was before we had internet tv etc most sex crimes weren't openly brought up occasionally there would be a <UNK> about the kid with the funny uncle but that was often all that came of it yes very sad but it is kinda sad today for even i too can see this film as anything other than what it was intended innocent and funny when i saw shirley dance like that and the boys eye <UNK> her yes i felt disturbed i have to remind myself the time this took place those children didn't know what sex was the parents knew that both those of the children in the movie and those watching it the thought may not have even entered their minds in the eyes of the average adult back then this was no more sexual then if shirley was playing house even today kids will enter beauty contest many dressed up extremely <UNK> for a three <UNK> old however the child is merely pretending i don't blame the child for wanting to act like an adult or the old movies that display this in all honesty our media has made a lot of things seem back then seem sick and wrong this sometimes can be for the best but i truly believe this movie isn't one of them it gives a rare look of an innocent mentality that we have long lost
<START> it's been a while since seeing this the first time so i watched it again with the second movie in the series while i realize there is a 3rd movie out that i haven't seen yet i'll review under the original title br br just from the standpoint of production value screen writing and movie making this movie fails on many levels though it succeeds on a few as well what can you expect from a low budget b movie not much and it works from the standpoint of production however the writing is certainly disjointed with little in the way of character development exactly what i'd expect when there is an agenda to a film i didn't have a problem with the acting the cast is solid however the screenplay in both movies gives the actors little opportunity to really stretch themselves because the film is christian this is predictable as you can't very well portray violent chaos of the end times without also breaking some of the <UNK> which are normally associated with christianity in other words the mistake comes in making this into a g rated film when the content even in the most conservative of bible interpretations would be r rated by any measure so if the purpose of the movie is to scare people into christian faith then the movie should be somewhat scary right however you can't comment on a film adaptation from a book without commenting on the book or in this case series of books there are certainly plenty of christian <UNK> worthy enough to be made into movies but not the left behind series and these movies ultimately fail because while being best sellers they are poorly written novels based on bad <UNK> br br as a southern <UNK> minister i confess that the books were a guilty pleasure for me though i have yet to finish the last two books of the series i have described them as decent fiction and if the books would take the point of view that this is one possibility or interpretation of the subject of biblical <UNK> study of the end times then i could live with that however this series is <UNK> in christian circles because it <UNK> the <UNK> interpretation of all <UNK> above a more proper <UNK> inevitably this leads to the pre <UNK> pre <UNK> <UNK> point of view which confines an all powerful god far too by <UNK> world in other words as i've always said god shouldn't need our <UNK> and bombs to do his ultimate work but because many people particularly <UNK> christians can't think beyond their own world views we are left with a pro conservative <UNK> stance with regard to bible interpretation and attempts to push it through as the only interpretation br br thus the books carry with them an agenda not so much to get the lost to understand their need for christ but to state that the <UNK> point of view is the only valid way to understand the bible i recall very clearly reading several years ago in the second novel a scene where the characters reference a person who was left behind because of his non <UNK> to this point of view as if real christians worthy to be <UNK> couldn't possibly hold to another <UNK> this is disturbing for several reasons the least of which is because a rapture is only briefly mentioned in <UNK> and it's connection to real end time prophecy is <UNK> at best br br but the real issue with these books is comes in the way they <UNK> the christian community and how they portray true christian behavior ultimately i feel they <UNK> more people to an otherwise legitimate faith religion instead of win people towards it it turns all christians into caricatures equally <UNK> and laughed at by the world despite the fact that there is <UNK> room for a wide diversity of believes within christian thought and practice as a christian body on the whole we've done enough of that kind of damage to society over 2000 years of history and we certainly don't need to promote it by film to thousands maybe millions of others br br thus the left behind movies fail because the left behind books aren't worthy to be interpreted into movies
<START> something about paulie touched my heart as few movies do it is a witty funny yet emotional movie i'm a late <UNK> in becoming a fan of this movie i didn't see paulie until may 2004 and have since ordered the widescreen dvd from a <UNK> at ebay br br the special effects of showing paulie talking are superb my son asked me how the bird knew so many phrases probably my favorite part of the movie is when paulie is in gena rowlands <UNK> company followed by cheech <UNK> <UNK> tony <UNK> <UNK> plays an excellent part as the good hearted human you root for him all the way through the movie br br you can't go wrong renting or buying this movie
<START> some films manage to survive almost on originality alone wonderland is certainly one of those films the script manages to throw everything into a near fever pitch but without making it incoherent the speed of this thriller is not to chosen to cover up a weak script but rather to accurately reflect the drug <UNK> reality br br as director james cox as a very peculiar way of working his actors most of the characters are <UNK> on edge and often because they're rather quite ugly personalities val kilmer has described john holmes to be a hustler able to manipulate and control no offense to kilmer but his version of holmes seems only able to control the drastically weak minded nonetheless it's a stunning performance comparing this to <UNK> more <UNK> roles like in the saint it seems to prove he is far more at home in gritty indie flicks br br the actors are the main force holding all together there are various little performances that stand out especially the women carrie fisher kate <UNK> and lisa <UNK> all have limited screen time next to their male counterparts but they are all fantastic aside from kilmer ted <UNK> and dylan mcdermott give a weird stunning energy to their roles br br i originally put off watching wonderland because i assumed it was a film about a porn actor in the <UNK> sense yes the story revolves around john holmes but it has literally nothing to do with his professional career basically this film is a murder mystery and as such it's excellent br br rating 7 5 out of 10
<START> how much could the general hollywood director learn from this movie all when it comes to actually <UNK> people this movies truly shows that it is possible to really <UNK> and scare a viewer and that monstrous monsters and long <UNK> never will be the best way of achieving this all who love a real psychological thriller must see this movie it is the best of it's kind
<START> the film was okay quite entertaining the cast was pretty good and i'll second what the comment before me mentioned glenn quinn was outstanding and he alone is reason enough to watch this movie he played the selfish evil friend and manager of the band brilliantly br br there are a lot of songs performed by beyond gravity in this film but this doesn't really come as a surprise considering the film is a <UNK> production however if the soft rock pop music isn't to someone's liking one might as well flash forward those scenes br br the plot of a band trying to make it to the top in l a but having to overcome many obstacles on the way isn't too original but quite entertaining with some surprising plot turns here and there
<START> forbidden planet is the best sf film from the golden age of sf cinema and what makes it a great film is its sense of wonder as soon as the spaceship lands the audience via the ships human crew travels through an intelligent and sometimes terrifying adventure we meet the <UNK> <UNK> the mysterious dr <UNK> his beautiful and innocent daughter <UNK> and we learn about the former inhabitants of the planet the <UNK> who died out overnight or did they br br you can <UNK> and say the planet is obviously filmed in a movie studio with painted backdrops but that adds to a sense of menace of <UNK> i feel and <UNK> and louis <UNK> s electronic music adds even more atmosphere br br i m shocked this film <UNK> t in the top 250 imdb films

<START> i have to admit that this re imagining of the original 1968 film was a huge disappointment specially when taken into consideration that this is a tim burton film he is <UNK> one of the most original and might i say cool directors hollywood has produced br br i am personally a great fan of his work but something obviously went wrong with his latest flick the planet of the apes i really enjoyed the original film when it first came out people expected just another <UNK> 70's science fiction film but a very surprise <UNK> totally proved that theory wrong it had indeed a clear cut message an obvious anti war message fear of the cold war where it was taking the world and fear of the use of nuclear weapons played a big role in the mind of the film makers those reasons made the film rise above all expectations and it became a instant classic although the new film the re making or whatever leaves us with nothing no message no ideals behind it it is just another money minded summer blockbuster br br visually tim burton does not let you down the dark and creepy settings were excellent and of course the make up was terrific br br obviously that is not enough to keep people <UNK> in a film there has to be an exciting plot or storyline in this movie the plot is highly uninteresting and it is extremely badly thought out the script is very lame and it is full of gaps it looks like this film had been written in a big hurry the explanation for why the apes where there and why the ruled the planet was indeed very stupid and proved the script writers ignorance br br it raised a lot of questions which had no reasonable answers to br br for example why did the apes speak english why were there other ape species than <UNK> on the planet given that there were only <UNK> in the space ship that crash landed on the planet where the hell did all of those humans come from how were a few <UNK> able to <UNK> into a huge raise of all kinds of monkeys in only a few thousands years i mean it took a few million years for us to <UNK> from monkey to man br br and finally the bad surprise ending was just plane dumb it was probably just thrown in because the original film had such an end then they felt that the audience were expecting the same kind of ending the ending also raises a lot of questions which i know <UNK> have intelligent <UNK> did <UNK> learn to work the space ship which was power less and <UNK> to fly back in time and take over the earth single hand and what did he do breed with all the women and lets say that that would happen i <UNK> doubt that history would stay the same like washington would be built exactly like it is today i mean <UNK> there be a huge banana instead of the <UNK> br br well just to say something <UNK> about the film some of the cast was great helen bonham <UNK> character was interesting and well acted as for tim roth as <UNK> he was very good a little <UNK> at some points of the film michael clark <UNK> was also fine i was not happy with marc <UNK> he is not much of an actor and plays here a very macho colour less character very <UNK> and is nothing compared to <UNK> character in the original and the main female character had no reason or place in the film she was just casted for the looks hardly said a word throughout the entire film br br well i think that in the future when people think about the planet of the apes they will think about the original one the latest will soon be forgotten
<START> i had two reasons for watching this <UNK> when it aired on danish television yesterday first of all i wanted to see gina <UNK> and here i wasn't disappointed she looked gorgeous second of all through reading about the film i had gotten the impression that it featured absurd humor not unlike that which can be found in <UNK> de <UNK> films on this account however i was sadly disappointed i found the jokes predictable apart from a few witty remarks on the topic of war and the characters completely one dimensional also the action scenes were done in a strangely mechanical and uninspired fashion with no sense of drama at all i kept watching until the end but i got bored very quickly and just sat there waiting for the scenes with <UNK>
<START> having watched this after receiving the dvd for christmas 2005 i came here to pan it but after reading the other comments i haven't the heart clearly this is a film that has worked very well for children of a certain age well let me not be a complete grinch it might still work for some children if they are not too media <UNK> and have not become visually over sophisticated e g from watching all of lotr and harry potter but if you are an adult stay miles away you will not enjoy it br br the good bits barbara <UNK> as the witch especially in her early scenes with edmund creates just the right blend of charismatic evil and restrained madness at the stone table she goes a bit over the top michael <UNK> in the minor role of the professor and jeffrey s perry as mr <UNK> also have the kind of polished <UNK> acting we'd expect from the very best bbc dramas and the <UNK> costume works very well amazingly well considering they got the eyes just right br br the bad bits almost everything else but two areas in particular one the casting england is <UNK> with good actors and contains <UNK> of thousands of attractive british school kids how could they possibly have ended up with these four <UNK> they move like wooden soldiers and speak about as well peter has no <UNK> or charisma and is <UNK> shorter than his supposedly younger siblings edmund is just whiny and lucy sophie <UNK> as lucy is so dramatically <UNK> drastically wrong for this part that i can't imagine how she got the job br br two the animal costumes again it appears that they worked for some kids if the kids are still at a level where big bird and <UNK> are exciting believable characters they might be <UNK> by this film but to a viewer with the sophistication of say a 12 year old who's seen prisoner of <UNK> when mister <UNK> comes out from behind that tree there will be <UNK> of cruel <UNK> laughter the costumes just do not work i could not and i think any adult or modern teen could not suspend disbelief when looking at mister <UNK> the drawn animation later <UNK> etc works better is easier to take br br so ten stars for the very young and tender of soul everyone else read or re read the book and watch the far better film that <UNK> in your imagination
<START> back in the forties when movies touched on matters not yet <UNK> in polite society they <UNK> to <UNK> which supposedly <UNK> over the heads of most of the audience while <UNK> those in the know to just what was up probably no film of the decade was so <UNK> with innuendo as the oddly obscure desert fury set in a small gambling <UNK> called <UNK> somewhere in the california desert <UNK> of the purple <UNK> saloon and casino is the astonishing mary <UNK> in <UNK> and sporting a cigarette <UNK> into town drives her handful of a daughter <UNK> scott looking in technicolor like 20 million bucks but listen to the dialogue between them which suggests an older lesbian and her young restless companion one can only wonder if a i <UNK> original script made this relationship explicit even more blatant are john <UNK> as a gangster and <UNK> corey as his insanely jealous <UNK> add burt <UNK> as the town sheriff stir and sit back both <UNK> and surprisingly <UNK> fall for scott it seems however that <UNK> not only has a past with <UNK> but had a wife who died under suspicious circumstances the desert sun <UNK> these ingredients up to a hard <UNK> with face <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> don't pass up this <UNK> melodrama chock full of <UNK> exotic <UNK> if it comes your way it's a remarkable movie
<START> a reporter craig <UNK> who works for the james <UNK> public <UNK> center has an interview with a german professor of a <UNK> university who made an unknown creature based upon some substance of meteor s but then a man named anderson who is trying to control the whole planet with the creature and his man kill the professor and his <UNK> and <UNK> the creature so craig and his new female psychic partner joanna fitzgerald who can communicate not only with human being but also with alien friend s of the creature begin to find the creature and try to send it to an alien spaceship this film has some great casts and <UNK> for instance it has the actor david <UNK> of the beyond the actress laura <UNK> of nightmare city the special visual effects creator sergio <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> masterpieces and the director and also the story writer <UNK> de martino of the man with icy eyes and the killer is on the phone and these talented people make an incredibly bad film named nothing but this miami <UNK> which is essentially a <UNK> combined film of close encounters of the third kind with e t the extra <UNK> and this not only confused but also <UNK> film has something worth genetic <UNK> with <UNK> research consequently the film has at least one scientific and or technical flaw genetic <UNK> and <UNK> research are never <UNK> strangely enough regarding this strangely childish combination of genetic <UNK> and <UNK> research the leading character craig himself says there must be a better explanation to the short haired psychic joanna but after all the whole story of the film doesn't and can't present any kind of better explanation in addition this film has something more laughable its <UNK> music what the composer who is credited as robert marry provides is nothing but the strangely <UNK> beverly hills cop <UNK> music i don't want to say this <UNK> theme of beverly hills cop per se is particularly bad music but i have to say it seems to be <UNK> clear the music does not have the <UNK> for this film per se at all indeed just who can think beverly hills cop has the <UNK> with genetic <UNK> and or <UNK> research
<START> director writer michael <UNK> feature is a better than expected offbeat supernatural horror film although still schlock <UNK> <UNK> for which really does by go <UNK> sure it might borrow ideas from other similar themed horror movies of this period but still manages to bring its own psychological <UNK> to the <UNK> material of good vs evil and a unique vision that has a fair share of <UNK> <UNK> if somewhat exploitative set pieces as a whole it's <UNK> however remains intriguing by <UNK> an ominous charge without going gang <UNK> with the scares actually there's always something going on amongst its busy <UNK> but it's rather down played with its shocks <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> and atmospheric <UNK> up until its vividly <UNK> and grisly climax with a downbeat revelation <UNK> dressed up <UNK> might feel pedestrian however it's the ensemble cast that really holds it <UNK> as you try to spot the faces there's plenty too some having more to do with the scheme of things than others but there's no doubts every one of them are committed despite the <UNK> crude nature of it all it's interesting to see names like sylvia miles who's significantly creepy beverly <UNK> likewise deborah <UNK> eli <UNK> christopher walken william <UNK> a neat cameo jeff goldblum jerry <UNK> and tom berenger in bit parts then you got a mild mannered chris sarandon and <UNK> gorgeous <UNK> raines in the leads offering able support <UNK> <UNK> martin <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> john carradine burgess meredith and arthur kennedy the script does throw around many characters as well as notions but gets <UNK> <UNK> by trying to squeeze all of it in however it's <UNK> air works in its favour in establishing the suspicion and deception of what's really going on here is there a reason for all of this and why is it surrounding <UNK> character the emphasis is mainly built upon that moody angle as it begins to slowly shed light of her inner goings and that of the strange worrying experiences she encounters when she's moves into her new apartment this is where winner tries to pull out the eerie shades which projects some icy moments <UNK> <UNK> was the man responsible for the grand <UNK> <UNK> score that never misses a cue and richard c <UNK> <UNK> the sweeping scope like photography
<START> just saw this movie and what a waste of time the movie was predictable and slow it's basically the mormon bad news bears that play church <UNK> basketball rather than watching this movie i should have had a root <UNK> the cameo performances were obviously driven by <UNK> funding this movie had potential due to the outrageous behavior that is <UNK> by <UNK> when they play church <UNK> basketball however because it's rated pg the true nature of the spectacle could not be <UNK> to film the acting is horrible with the exception of clint howard and fred <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> appearance in the film was completely unnecessary
<START> it's a ghost story it's a <UNK> story it's a revenge story it's a very poorly done film with a lot of violence i suppose it follows cheaply along the lines of every slasher movie you've ever seen it has the usual isolated place the cocky <UNK> heading off to the wilderness granted there are some pretty intense scenes it's just so dull bad editing and the whole works there are ghost children who sound like they are talking into a <UNK> i'm not really sure what rules the ghosts and the psycho with the seed cap are playing by it also has the gross out scene where a man eats a piece of meat which is actually what's left of his wife a friend of mine once asked me why it is necessary to show this kind of gratuitous sick violence i fear that it's just another step in our <UNK> evolution three is no <UNK> here no tongue in cheek only a sad waste of time lots of blood little plot
<START> in my humble opinion this version of the great <UNK> musical has only two things going for it <UNK> <UNK> and the fact that there is now a filmed version with the original script ok vanessa williams is good to watch but to me that's all there is most of the cast seem to be walking through the show <UNK> phillips has no idea who kim really is and no wonder people walk over harry <UNK> when it's played by george <UNK> who looks like he'd rather be back on a bar <UNK> in boston jason alexander is passable but that wig has to go and i saw better dancing in <UNK> malone as i mentioned it's good to have a version of the stage script now but i hope the young out there who have never seen a musical don't judge them all by this
<START> scoop is easily woody allen's funniest film of the <UNK> so far allen although finally looking his age is at the top of his game as low brow magician sidney <UNK> his one liners and demeanor are hilarious don't let the critics <UNK> your opinion scoop is a top notch woody <UNK> picture br br the classical music score is an excellent compliment to the action on screen scarlett <UNK> looks gorgeous in that bathing suit jackman is dashing the cinematography <UNK> scoop is wonderful <UNK> fare from start to finish the last shot of the film alone is worth the admission price
<START> the title of this movie doesn't make a lot of sense until you see it in operation because it's the sound that a retarded young man makes while he's operating his imaginary <UNK> which is what he does all day and he is just one of many odd characters in this surreal at times tragic tale of a group of <UNK> <UNK> in japan br br there are two <UNK> who trade wives there's a man with aspirations to be a architect and his young son who he sends out to beg for food there's a wise old man who seems to be the <UNK> of sanity within all that goes on around him and there's a businessman with some severe nervous <UNK> that has a wife that treats him and everyone else like dirt br br there's no particular plot to this really it's a bunch of stories that drift back forth between each other sometimes funny sometimes tragic all in all i thought it worked pretty well i had been dying to see this for a long time just based on its description i was not in the least disappointed and i'd definitely recommend this 9 out of 10
<START> the story is very <UNK> and powerful the technical side of the movie is quite fine even the directing of it the main problem is with the <UNK> that turned that movie into almost another local and regular cliché with a great lack of impact and even greater lack of impression beside the small role of the father <UNK> played <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> all other actors were unfortunately not in their best the role of the elder blind girl played by <UNK> sharon was fresh but without any intensity as the leading role therefore the figure she acted had become mild and low profile there were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal then a real movie but after all it's a good point to begin from and to make big <UNK> in the future
<START> this film is so bad and gets worse in every imaginable fashion its not just the poor acting and script nor is it the lame and perverse time one wastes on watching it what really puts this film in my hall of shame is the apparent struggling that the writers and producers do with the film to try and make it funny the actress replacing jean <UNK> <UNK> is to old and learned her lesson in the first film so they add a new girl who is to be married nearly all of the original extras and gags return however this time makes me want to <UNK> my eyes out of my <UNK> because it's a waste of perfectly good film the torture of the constant camera cuts and shots in any scene in this movie can put the viewer into violent <UNK> this second film takes the successful original and drags it out of its coffin and <UNK> the corpse out in the public square and <UNK> <UNK> not only the original idea and its legacy but our intelligence as well this film unlike the <UNK> <UNK> could not fly for it had no plot in the principals returning for a <UNK> no script since it was apparently written and added to daily no attention to camera or shots in mind poor lighting and special effects done for the sake of doing so this film would not even pass for a student film in basic film 101 how this pile got through no one can tell it was a big <UNK> investment and it appears that no one had the strength to put this unnatural cruel mistake out of our <UNK> this movie has one good part its end this film is my 1 worst film of all time finally howard the duck is no longer the <UNK>
<START> this film is stunningly beautiful <UNK> art really benefits with the medium of film because you can see the art at its most beautiful moving and changing and <UNK> i strongly recommend this movie to everyone i can think of nothing else to say about it it's just the kind of movie you have to see because it's so visually compelling and left me very <UNK> when i left the theatre
<START> <UNK> <UNK> pretty well sums up what this movie was i'd rather examine the <UNK> of an african elephant with a <UNK> than sit through this again i think i've wasted enough time watching this movie i don't need to waste more by commenting on it further
<START> halloween is one of the best examples of independent film it's very well made and has more psychological elements to it than you might realize at first glance it is a simple movie told very well the music is perfect and is one of the most haunting scores if you haven't seen this movie yet you must check it out the cast is all terrific i wish they had never made sequel after sequel the first one was by far the best and should have ended like it did without having a sequel it was fun to see jamie lee curtis in the movie she hasn't seemed to age she's just as gorgeous today without the <UNK> and seventies clothes the scenes through the mask are one of the scariest things ever
<START> wow if you think that a film can't <UNK> in some way then you haven't seen dog bite dog this film pulls no punches and it doesn't shy away from showing very disturbing images at all much like <UNK> this one shows us the <UNK> of the human spirit it is gritty dark depressing and hopeless but it is also one of the best films to ever come out of hong kong br br the script is much more of the same but don't go on thinking it is incredibly clichéd it basically is about a <UNK> and obsessive detective in a cat and mouse game against a professional and <UNK> hit man while the script offers nothing new on the surface it does provide a lot of questions about the dark side of humanity is violence really that necessary do we become more or less human when we abuse a 5 year old child without pity without <UNK> in turn we humans act no less than <UNK> dogs when we are <UNK> by anger this is a sad truth it is a topic that the director brilliantly explores without <UNK> himself at all besides the cat and mouse chase the script also develops two separate story lines for the main characters one is about love and the other is about redemption even if the script isn't that new it is still wonderfully written and it keeps you glued to the seat at all times br br the acting is really really good edison <UNK> as the hit man is incredible he proves that he isn't just any pretty face he is ruthless vile and beyond likable sam lee as the obsessed cop is also outstanding the supporting cast in short is excellent the music is also worth mentioning very somber score by ben cheung with some effective light hearted songs played at key dark moments in the film the cinematography by <UNK> man is also really good br br overall this <UNK> film is highly recommended very well paced incredibly acted <UNK> scored and just really good at the end of it all however as many have pointed out this is not a movie for everyone if you dislike strong violence then you should stay away from this one if you don't like seeing heavy <UNK> in film then this isn't for you too in the end a <UNK> film 8 10
<START> the first cruel intentions the original is my favorite movie of all time it was an absolute masterpiece so how on earth could they make a sequel so downright bad sarah michelle <UNK> was perfect in the first movie in this one amy adams sucks she is terrible and couldn't they have found a chick who actually looked like sarah michelle <UNK> at least the same hair color i mean come on robin <UNK> isn't as bad as adams but he is absolutely terrible when compared to ryan <UNK> the sebastian in the first film is <UNK> <UNK> and much more evil than the sebastian in the prequel and what is up with the story line it basically goes like this br br 1 sebastian has a bad <UNK> at his first school so the movie says although it mentions nothing about him and his dating life and how he has been with girls 2 sebastian moves to new york and just suddenly decides he's going to turn himself around he falls in love with <UNK> might i remind you that in the original sarah michelle <UNK> says quote you broke up with the first person you ever loved because i said to so how can he have been in love in the prequel and he's all nice and charming and all good person as he turns down sex from the chick his dad was doing br br 3 he does a complete <UNK> and ends up in a <UNK> at the end of the movie and then <UNK> <UNK> br br i mean its terrible and i loved the first one so much i haven't even seen the third one yet i hope to god its better than this prequel
<START> return to cabin by the lake is perhaps one of the few sequels that can live up to the original it had black humor good suspense nice looking girls and of course a psycho killer what are we missing i think nothing except we are left with a small amount of gore and nudity because it was made for television besides being one of the best sequels it is one of the best thrillers to watch as a family recommended for everyone
<START> very strange but occasionally elegant exploitation movie with no real story but <UNK> from its stunningly ravishing lead actress and a handful of nice gruesome make up effects <UNK> is a beautiful twenty something girl carrying with her the trauma of being raped at the age of 13 nightmares and hallucinations lead her further into believing she's the reincarnation of a female <UNK> who was said to be a werewolf she kills her brother in law during a <UNK> encounter and gets <UNK> in a hospital she escapes again however and randomly <UNK> more men whilst on the run for police detectives doctors and relatives it's all pretty to look at and listen too really great soundtrack but the absence of plot and continuity become irritating quite fast luckily enough leading lady <UNK> <UNK> rarely ever wears clothes and she fills up the boring moments by dancing naked around a fire the film is too long too weird and too forgettable the biggest surprise comes at the end when suddenly and out of the blue director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> tries to make us believe that his movie was based on true facts yeah right
<START> this movie must be in line for the most boring movie in years not even woody harrison can save this movie from sinking to the bottom br br the murder in this movie are supposed to be the point of interest in this movie but is not nothing is of any interest the cast are not to bad but the script are just plain awful i just sat in utter <UNK> during this movie thinking how on earth can anyone find this movie entertaining br br the producers of this movie were very clever they made a boring movie but <UNK> it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their cast people will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think woody harrison <UNK> scott thomas and willem dafoe this must be good and rent this movie boy are they in for a horrible time br br if you like getting ripped off go and rent this movie some people actually did enjoyed this movie but i like to watch a movie with meaning
<START> who doesn't have <UNK> issues with parents and which parents don't have <UNK> issues with each other br br i know that sounds heavy but this is played for laughs in the movie making both the comedy better and the drama better i've always like paul reiser and peter falk and although i was a bit concerned that their star qualities might be too big for a small movie i was enchanted from the very first scene br br especially entertaining were the <UNK> that the son makes about his father as a person and peter <UNK> monologue about being a hard working <UNK> father and husband was the perfect <UNK> point without that scene being acted so well the movie would have seemed far less nuanced and the character far less interesting br br nicely done paul and peter
<START> cheap and manipulative this film has no heart br br it's also got dire dialogue unconvincing characters and a preposterous or rather non existent story it just <UNK> from bad to worse in a cynical effort to <UNK> some kind of emotion from an <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br and the <UNK> how many cheap shots can a film take the <UNK> by the way gave the most convincing and watchable performance in this ninety minute cringe <UNK> br br if you have considered watching this film don't i'm sorry but i cannot find a single redeeming feature to this movie it scores a big fat zero with me strictly for sub dogma <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br still if you liked dancing in the dark br br
<START> i was lucky enough to catch this film finally on turner classic films tonight as it is one of the films that won an oscar for special effects in their <UNK> month of oscar winning films br br <UNK> and <UNK> is easily a sequel film for the earlier success of mary <UNK> that film too was a big success and an oscar winner best actress for julie andrews like mary <UNK> <UNK> has david <UNK> in it in a role <UNK> he learns about <UNK> it is a fine mixture of live action and animation it is set in a past period of british history if not the <UNK> <UNK> world of <UNK> london it is <UNK> <UNK> during the <UNK> summer of 1940 it even has old <UNK> owen in it here as a general in the home guard whereas <UNK> he was <UNK> boom in mary <UNK> ironically it was <UNK> final role br br the home guard sequences not too many in the film reminds one of the british series <UNK> army dealing with the problems of the local home guard in the early years of the war the period is also well suggested by the appearance of the three <UNK> children as war <UNK> from the <UNK> in the <UNK> in london and in typical disney fashion in the musical number <UNK> road different members of the british army including soldiers from india and the <UNK> complete with metal drums yet appear with scottish and local female <UNK> in costume br br all of which surprisingly is a plus but the biggest plus is that for angela lansbury her performance as <UNK> price is finally it her sole real musical film lead in a noteworthy acting career lansbury never got the real career musical role she deserved as <UNK> <UNK> in the musical <UNK> that came out shortly after <UNK> did she had been in singing parts in <UNK> with her brief up in a balloon boys and in the picture of <UNK> gray with little yellow bird and best of all in support and in conclusion of the harvey girls with the final <UNK> of on the <UNK> <UNK> and the santa <UNK> but only here does she play the female lead so when you hear her singing with david <UNK> you may be able to understand what we lost when she did not play <UNK> dennis <UNK> br br the rest of the cast is pretty good <UNK> here learning that he can rise to the occasion after a lifetime of relative failure the three children cindy <UNK> roy <UNK> and ian <UNK> actually showing more interesting sides in their characters than their <UNK> predecessors in <UNK> <UNK> in particular as something of a budding <UNK> thinking of <UNK> lansbury after finding out she is a witch the only surprising waste possibly due to cutting of scenes is <UNK> <UNK> as the local <UNK> who is only in two sequences of the film with his possible role as a <UNK> <UNK> of witchcraft he should have had a bigger part also of note is john <UNK> as the german officer who leads a raid at the conclusion of the film only to find that he is facing something more powerful than he ever imagined in the british countryside and sam <UNK> as a <UNK> for the magic formula that lansbury and <UNK> are seeking br br as for the animation the two sequences under the sea in a <UNK> and at the <UNK> soccer match ever drawn are well worth the view with <UNK> pulled into the latter as the <UNK> and getting pretty badly <UNK> up in various charges and <UNK> as i said it is a pretty fine <UNK> of the disney <UNK> best work
<START> before stan laurel became the smaller half of the all time greatest comedy team he <UNK> under contract to <UNK> billy anderson in a series of <UNK> many of which were parodies of major hollywood features following a <UNK> with anderson laurel continued the <UNK> series of parodies at joe <UNK> smaller and more <UNK> production company br br most of <UNK> parody films were only mildly funny at the time and even less funny for modern audiences who haven't seen the original movie which laurel is <UNK> <UNK> of hot <UNK> is a fairly generic parody of cowboy shoot 'em ups it's <UNK> a specific parody of <UNK> of the <UNK> an <UNK> released two years earlier with no major actors since <UNK> of the <UNK> was never a huge success it's difficult to see why <UNK> film unit chose this particular movie as a target for their <UNK> much less why they waited so long after its release to parody it and where did they get that title <UNK> of hot <UNK> possibly it's down to the fact that <UNK> dog ' was a sexual <UNK> <UNK> by american <UNK> in the 1920s as in the opening scene of the stage play <UNK> br br <UNK> of hot <UNK> was produced and co directed by joe rock among his many other achievements rock introduced laurel to lois <UNK> and he was subsequently best man at their wedding full <UNK> in the last years of his life i had the great <UNK> of <UNK> joe rock and <UNK> him nearly ninety years old at the time <UNK> memory was <UNK> clear but he remembered nothing at all about <UNK> of hot <UNK> and i can't blame him this movie is <UNK> forgettable br br the leading <UNK> character is named little <UNK> if that's meant to be a parody of something in <UNK> of the <UNK> i don't get it there are a couple of <UNK> gags here including <UNK> method for <UNK> a horse for just one moment in this movie stan laurel reminded me of the great buster keaton when he suddenly broke into a run <UNK> of hot <UNK> is vaguely similar in subject matter and tone to keaton's short comedy 'the frozen <UNK> but keaton's version is much funnier the plot of this film somewhat <UNK> a situation in keaton's feature <UNK> <UNK> but again suffers by comparison here two tough <UNK> brothers expect to <UNK> the last chance saloon but the previous owner has <UNK> it to <UNK> <UNK> stan however the brothers will become the legal <UNK> if stan dies hmmm br br seriously though is such a <UNK> legal as soon as stan takes possession of the property surely any further questions of <UNK> or inheritance become his decision not the previous <UNK> decision i had plenty of time to consider such points of law while watching this dull comedy br br at one point a gag involves some crude animation drawn directly onto the film stock it looks cheap and isn't funny br br this <UNK> <UNK> is no <UNK> and no winner it's just a <UNK> my rating one point out of 10 hang on stan in a few more years you'll be one half of a comedy legend
<START> yeah it is in fact it's somewhere in my top 20 all time favorite movies number 15 i think anyways i'm usually not one for plots but i think plots work better in anime and <UNK> video games final fantasy 7 for example and not movies but this one has it all vivid drawings of planets stars an extremely well written screenplay while this is not really for children they can still watch it it contains no graphic blood guts and <UNK> but i don't think they're going to understand it
<START> alright if you want to go see this movie just give me our money i'll br br kick you were it counts and you'll have the same amount of fun i'll br br even guarantee more fun this movie once again shows what happens when br br you can't get any one else to hire your family and your forced to make br br your own movies same i'm going through <UNK> humor jokes just br br dumber and <UNK> this movie is really a disgrace to movie goers they br br try to shock you into laughing because you can't believe the levels they br br have to <UNK> to make you laugh so my offer above stands as
<START> this is not a loose but a precise faithful remake of 1958 <UNK> classic i <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> mastroianni <UNK> <UNK> etc and that's the reason is good it copies all the funny characters and the plot even in details like the scene where the photographer steals the camera from the local market br br i have watched the superb old version many times and i knew by heart all the gangs and the ending but i still enjoyed welcome to <UNK> which has its own <UNK> and atmosphere it is interesting to see how the life and ways of the little thieves in 1950's italy are adapted to <UNK> usa things haven't changed much 8 10
<START> in <UNK> charlie chaplin began making pictures these were made for mack <UNK> also known as <UNK> studios and were literally <UNK> out in very rapid succession the short comedies had very little structure and were completely ad <UNK> as a result the films though popular in their day were just awful by today's standards many of them bear a strong similarity to home movies featuring obnoxious relatives <UNK> for the camera many others show the characters wander in front of the camera and do pretty much nothing and regardless of the outcome <UNK> sent them straight to theaters my <UNK> is that all movies at this time must have been pretty bad as the <UNK> films with chaplin were very successful br br the charlie chaplin we know and love today only began to <UNK> later in <UNK> career with <UNK> by <UNK> he signed a new <UNK> contract with <UNK> studios and the films improved dramatically with chaplin as director however at times these films were still very rough and not especially memorable no chaplin as the cute little tramp was still <UNK> in <UNK> when he switched to mutual studios his films once again improved and he became the more recognizable nice guy in many of the previous films he was just a jerk either getting drunk a lot beating up women provoking fights with innocent people etc the final evolution of his little tramp to classic status occurred in the 1920s as a result of his full length films br br it's interesting that this film is called twenty minutes of love since the film only lasts about 10 minutes oh well the plot what little there is involves the little tramp in the park a couple wants to neck but inexplicably charlie insists on practically sitting on the <UNK> lap and really annoying them i can't understand why and the short consists of charlie wandering about the park annoying these people and some others later in the film perhaps he was looking for a <UNK> i don't know but the film lacks <UNK> and just isn't particularly funny even when people start <UNK> each other and pushing each other in the lake a typical poor effort before chaplin began to give his character a plot and personality
<START> this 1939 film tried to capitalize on the much better michael <UNK> film angels with dirty faces as directed by ray <UNK> the only interesting thing is how <UNK> these kids were in comparison with what's going on with the youth in america's inner cities today br br the film is only worth seeing because of the presence of ann sheridan and ronald reagan who showed they were well paired together the dead end kids have larger parts as the plot concentrates on them rather than in the older folks br br in a way it's curious how <UNK> was used in the same way some <UNK> <UNK> did in later years right here in new york it was the <UNK> way to turn a property around never considering the social problems it created in today's climate with so many guns around there is a new reality the young kids of the story seemed mere <UNK> rather than criminals how times change
<START> it's terrific when a funny movie doesn't make smile you what a pity this film is very boring and so long it's simply <UNK> the story is <UNK> without goal and no fun br br you feel better when it's finished
<START> there was some truth to this movie i remember a story reported 15 to 20 years ago of 4 <UNK> finding a body in the water and they chose not to report it until their trip was finished i also recall they were charged with <UNK> with a corpse or some such charge i'm not sure if it was in australia the viewers outside of australia must think we live in a country full of <UNK> and serial murders wolf creek and this film would encourage this perception the film itself reminded me of a simple plan but as far a being one of the best australian films ever as someone claimed i can't be that generous put it this way i wouldn't bother watching it again
<START> man on fire was hot i love a classic tale of good ol' revenge and what better cause for revenge than the kidnapping of an innocent little girl br br the writers did an excellent job in this movie of building the relationship between creasy denzel washington and pita <UNK> fanning so that the viewer would understand and actually feel the drive creasy had to rescue pita it was also good that creasy wasn't a choir boy type trying to rescue pita through the proper channels but instead used torture tactics and street <UNK> some may say torture is wrong regardless and you may be right but when you see the pain creasy goes through due to the loss of pita and the sheer passion he has for getting her back you can't help but side with creasy and pull for him to be even more <UNK> there would be no progress if creasy used <UNK> to deal with the different <UNK> gangsters and criminals and he knew that br br <UNK> quest ended with the return of pita to her mother and creasy dying in the vehicle of the bad guys but <UNK> death did not <UNK> the <UNK> of the movie it in fact enhanced it by showing that creasy was willing to die to get pita back his death was noble in fact br br denzel does an excellent job as do the writers this movie deserves good marks because it definitely was a good movie
<START> this is one of those movies that after watching it you will keep thinking about and coming back to even months after viewing the acting is spectacular for starring two children i usually hate movies with whiny kid acting bill paxton is awesome his directorial debut is even better than what i expected of an actor whose most memorable line is game over man game over from the movie aliens br br the best part about the movie is the <UNK> between those scenes where the actors play a family and when they are doing their work it really makes the movie believable and memorable br br keep it up bill i'll be waiting for more movies i m sure to love
<START> red eye a movie that id had wanted to see for awhile cillian murphy plays jack <UNK> jack the <UNK> a <UNK> pose to <UNK> and his literally killer plan to knock off a highly <UNK> man and his family br br an everyday woman lisa i think is a normal woman goes to work home <UNK> hates to fly br br the death of her grandmother sends her on a flight which <UNK> several times br br a flight where she meets jack an ordinary seeming guy until he <UNK> reveals his profession and plans which <UNK> include her in them she is the key to the <UNK> <UNK> death br br she succeeds in saving them but nearly the cost of her life is taken jack is beaten the <UNK> are saved oh what a story laughs just kidding the movie is really good actually the best of last year there are small things that you have to pay attention to earlier in the movie that play a great importance to the movie later the frankenstein pen i watched it several times before catching all the little jokes and quirks br br a must see for thriller fans no sexual but there is a slight hint the bathroom scene jack thanks for the <UNK> and the female attendant <UNK> its gonna be one of those <UNK> second female attendant hey this isn't a motel you get the idea
<START> if you are wondering where many of the conspiracy theories and paranoid ideas about the the un israel and international affairs come from look no further br br this isn't a supernatural hollywood film loosely based on some biblical passage instead this movie was made by a company cloud ten pictures with a political and religious agenda as a movie the end result at times more looks like clips out of a <UNK> program complete with family <UNK> and light breaking through church windows while <UNK> are playing br br for mainstream viewers it may be hard to believe but many people believe in this stuff literally as presented in the movie and that perhaps makes the movie important you probably won't find a more <UNK> exposition of the bizarre views of a significant number of your fellow citizens so if you view it view it as a social cultural document if you are at all media <UNK> you don't need to be warned about the <UNK> attempts at propaganda and manipulation in the movie
<START> sure it was cheesy and nonsensical and at times corny but at least the filmmakers didn't try while most tv movies border on the brink of mediocrity this film actually has some redeeming qualities to it the cinematography was pretty good for a tv film and viggo <UNK> displays shades of <UNK> in a film about a man who played by his own rules most of the flashback sequences were kind of cheesy but the scene with the mountain lion was intense i was kind of annoyed by jason <UNK> role in the film as a rebellious shock jock but then again it's a tv movie despite all of the good things the soundtrack was atrocious however it was nice to see <UNK> arizona <UNK> featured in the film
<START> this film is amazing it's just like a nightmare the bizarre story the dark <UNK> the <UNK> insects everywhere the idea jumps and the <UNK> dreams really great people who love cult movies or very dark thrillers will find this fantastic it seems a little to the films of david lynch the strange story the bizarre dreams the red <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> contains almost no plot it's rather a succession of <UNK> happenings nightmares and <UNK> that's a <UNK> if the film had a really fascinating plot full of tension with a captivating denouement i would give it a 10 out of 10 but that's missing and that's why i gave the movie an 8 <UNK> <UNK> is a film worth watching search that dvd and you'll be rewarded
<START> your mind will not be satisfied by this <UNK> <UNK> thriller but pray who's will a <UNK> couple spends the actual end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens <UNK> as church people br br small <UNK> themed outing end of the world has the <UNK> and the lack of both <UNK> and style of the purely <UNK> similar movies and it's not only that but <UNK> plays like a <UNK> only <UNK> but convent creeps as well the villain of the movie is a <UNK> character actor br br this wholly shameless <UNK> seems a piece of <UNK> that significantly '70s genre which looks today so <UNK> outdated anyway the <UNK> secret laboratory is some nasty piece of futuristic <UNK> christopher lee is the pride of end of the world but the end of the world is not at all his pride
<START> how this film could miss so many of the fascinating complex and mysterious aspects of the original story or the original movie is truly remarkable an unbelievably thin and <UNK> plot <UNK> deep characterisation motivation and a really awful soundtrack replacing tension with vast <UNK> of noise replacing the <UNK> musical references of the original for <UNK> crashes and <UNK> then there are the specific references to the original which are merely <UNK> on over the cracks dreadful in a world where <UNK> brain dead <UNK> remakes of the italian job a tear appears get carter <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> have <UNK> our screens recently this one takes the proverbial <UNK> <UNK> nonsense how ellen <UNK> ever got involved is a wonder rubbish
<START> a chemical <UNK> is turning people into zombies it's up to two doctor's to survive the <UNK> it's an <UNK> <UNK> film so you know what the par for the course will be bad acting horribly awful special effects and no budget to speak of the dubbing is ridiculous with a capital r and the saddest thing is that i feel compelled to write one word about this piece of <UNK> much less the ten lines mandatory because of the <UNK> placed on me by imdb my original review of merely one word crap wouldn't fly so i have to <UNK> it and go more in to how bad it is but i don't know if i can so wait i think i may have enough words or lines rather to make this review pass which is cool i guess so in <UNK> this movie sucks balls don't watch it br br my grade f
<START> if you are looking for a definitive biography of the life of boxer james corbett then this is probably not the film for you the famed boxer receives a 1940s hollywood <UNK> of his life making the story far more entertaining and engaging than real life however because the performances were so good particularly by errol flynn and the script so likable the film's <UNK> can be forgiven br br errol flynn plays gay nineties era boxer james gentleman jim corbett a man who became world boxing <UNK> in <UNK> the film goes from his rather humble <UNK> and follows his through his career through him winning the title match against john l sullivan however while it could have focused mostly on the matches most are rather brief in the film except for the final title match and the emphasis is on <UNK> <UNK> personality as well as his relationship with the lady played by <UNK> smith throughout the film there is excellent supporting work done by a cast of wonderful supporting actors such as the <UNK> supporting actor in flynn films alan hale and the writing really helped bring these people alive br br what is particularly nice about the film is seeing the <UNK> of flynn as a boxer while a few of the shots are of <UNK> almost all the boxing scenes are of flynn and he did a convincing job as a <UNK> this was a nice departure for flynn who generally played pretty boy roles or <UNK> and this shows just how tough a character he was to find out more about this try reading a biography of him he was quite the rough and <UNK> character before coming to hollywood br br now as for the real james corbett read on if you aren't afraid of finding out how the movie isn't accurate first corbett was not a poor guy coming from a poor family but was college educated and bright second while he did get <UNK> smith at the end of the film they also divorced a few years later third the wonderfully touching final scene of the film between sullivan and corbett was probably the best part of the film sullivan was a jerk and this never could have happened in reality sullivan was more the <UNK> and corbett was not the fat headed guy they portrayed in the film though it made for a lovely film
<START> i desperately want to give this movie a 10 i really do some movies especially horror movies are so budget that they are good a wise cracking ninja scarecrow who can <UNK> corn <UNK> as lethal <UNK> definitely fits this <UNK> to <UNK> system the depth of the movie is definitely its strong point and the twists and turns it <UNK> keeping the audience at the edge of their seats really drives the creepy ninja <UNK> stricken pre thirty year old student non cowboy drawing wise cracking son of a bitch scarecrow into the <UNK> as the <UNK> horror icon of the year all i can really say is <UNK> you dig <UNK> and recommend watching movies such as <UNK> if you enjoy this sort of hilarious horror br br what the hell were they smoking '
<START> don't get me wrong i love david <UNK> as <UNK> i love the series as well as the movies but enough already re death on the <UNK> everyone has done this one we know who dies we know why they die we know who the killer is we know how it was done so i say enough already mr <UNK> could have used that awesome talent in another one of agatha <UNK> novels i will say that the acting by all the actors was superb the sets were terrific and very realistic i especially liked david soul but i was surprised at how <UNK> he looked i hope he doesn't look that way in <UNK> life i honestly can't remember from other movies whether the very end was the same somehow i don't think so i thought that was a rather brilliant touch whether or not ms christie wrote it that way i would much rather have that ending then wasting away in prison
<START> i saw it at cinema <UNK> <UNK> just one night after its first public projection in paris a very pretty film about three 15 years old teenagers all of them just at about the same psychologically stages many of the scenes let us to come back to our <UNK> age our first feelings about sexual relations it is possible to imagine that the director would like to <UNK> the first strong sensual feelings of the girls to <UNK> but even in that case she doesn't corrupt the <UNK> of the story you can sometimes find the film a little slow but it is what creates this intimate atmosphere i <UNK> the young actresses of talent special mention with floriane and marie very convincing there are many small details but this film also <UNK> me to discover what <UNK> swimming is <UNK>
<START> budget decent actors who knew these things were important don't waste your time on this piece of junk the effects are crap the acting is crap the only thing that could have made this even tolerable was a little cheap t a and that gets <UNK> in the first 20 minutes br br the only even remotely redeeming quality about this movie is the very awkward profanity it was like they found the only 7 people on the planet who have never cursed before hats off br br if you want to see some dude in a bad suit just go back and look at old prom photos the only way for a bigfoot flick to be any good is for it to have a big budget and some actors who didn't come from <UNK> community theater
<START> as i watched one of orson welles' last <UNK> to hollywood as a filmmaker i knew i was watching a great movie unfold though at times i did not know why the story in the lady from shanghai has the prime elements of a film noir average joe lead femme fatale <UNK> supporting characters and a <UNK> if somewhat convoluted plot structure it is an entertaining ride and it's filled to the <UNK> with welles' unique gifts as a director but there are scenes that tend to just not work or don't feel complete in what was welles' full vision the latter is unfortunately too true executive producer harry <UNK> and the columbia <UNK> are to blame for that br br welles co stars with his then wife the profoundly gorgeous rita hayworth as mike o'hara an irish worker who can and does get angry at the right people hayworth is mrs <UNK> married to mr <UNK> everett sloane who played mr <UNK> in citizen kane who is accompanied by a friend mr <UNK> glenn <UNK> who has great control in his eyes they want to go <UNK> on their <UNK> and take o'hara along for the ride and at first he's reluctant but agrees since he's falling for the married mrs as their journey unfolds o'hara finds that <UNK> and <UNK> are not pleasant to be around and more so with <UNK> who at first seems out of his <UNK> yet as the plot unfolds o'hara is drawn into a <UNK> that <UNK> is planning for insurance money with results that i dare not reveal although they have been discussed over and over by others br br whatever <UNK> pop up here and there in the mystery part of the story and those few noticeable moments where shots were studio <UNK> the performances and the look of the film are what remains striking after over fifty five years though he doesn't have the terrific greg <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at his side <UNK> charles <UNK> jr <UNK> welles in creating an atmosphere that is both elegant and stark covered in shadows deep focus low angles the works a particular accomplishment is the fun house mirror scene which is merely a highlight among others welles himself is always <UNK> as an actor even if his accent isn't anything special and hayworth herself makes a scene a little more lush despite her path in the story br br the lady from shanghai is worth checking out especially for welles hayworth or film noir buffs fans of the <UNK> brothers might find this fascinating as well it may just take a little while repeat viewings as was for touch of evil for the underlying motives in the plot to sink in
<START> as long as you go into this movie knowing that it's terrible bad acting bad effects bad story bad everything then you'll love it this is one of my favorite goof on movies watch it as a comedy and have a dozen good laughs
<START> the people who are <UNK> this film are the real <UNK> i am hoping at least that leonard will see some good out of this as his life <UNK> were <UNK> away by a manager a couple of years ago and he's over 70 now but this film is simply terrible at the beginning leonard himself says he is not sentimental about his past and then for the next hour and a half the film <UNK> all the worst sentimental elements of <UNK> songs it is so bloody precious with its endless close ups of over <UNK> singers <UNK> interview is all done in lo fi video closeups and i so wanted to see a medium or a long shot of his whole body i couldn't care less about the comments of the performers especially those overblown ego boys edge and <UNK> none of the performers in this film have done even one song as good as <UNK> own music and if you are thinking about seeing this and you have any doubts at all <UNK> them this would be an acceptable <UNK> special maybe for a one time showing but i will even hesitate at getting a dvd of this when the film finally shows leonard semi performing tower of song it's ruined by <UNK> taking a <UNK> even the occasional good performances <UNK> <UNK> first number <UNK> the <UNK> are spoiled by the context of the rest of this turgid <UNK> forget this one and go buy <UNK> most recent album if you want to pay tribute to him
<START> i wanted to see this movie ever since it was first advertised on tv i went to <UNK> town to see it last night at 7 40 i regret the day that wasted my ticket on this trash when i could of saw something better the beginning was all a bunch sex trash and cliches they exaggerated the way love works in reality all of the girls were <UNK> types the boyfriend was too stupid for his own age the passing <UNK> that the pregnant girl kept having barely got any laughs the bank robbery was completely boring with gags that have been used in other movies their <UNK> car was an old beat up chevy van that they claimed that had no breaks hey why didn't they get nice <UNK> vehicle for the robbery instead it might have <UNK> the audience opinion about the movie this movie was very low low low low low budgeted since nothing in there was damaged or destroyed this movie had a lot of stuff in it that would drive christian people nuts hey i even expected a car chase scene because all bank robbing movies have car chases but i but there was never any so i rate this movie b which stands for low budgeted and 1 out of ten stars
<START> just saw the movie and the scary thing was the people talking during the movie sounded just like the actors the movie had its moments but also <UNK> and was rather sick it was all meant to be a farce but once you see the pathetic lives of the people in the movie you think to yourself people like this are all around us all attempts at getting the audience's sympathy are <UNK> as the actors do one stupid thing after another on the plus side there are some great and funny insults i think i would wait for video but it was a good laugh warning jerry takes his shirt off during the movie not a pretty sight
<START> sure i like short cartoons but i didn't like this one naturally kids would love it but then again i'm not a kid anymore although i still consider myself young br br i will not tell you anything about the story for the simple reason there is no story how is it possible this dragon of a cartoon was nominated for an oscar well i guess it's because people in the 30's were more happy with not much than now in the present where we live everything must happen fast look at the movies nowadays and you will come to the same conclusion we live in a society that doesn't allow men to be slow that's really a shame i wish i lived in the 30's because it seems so peaceful but every time has got its ups and downs i guess br br to conclude if you like music and <UNK> you'll have to see this cartoon otherwise don't <UNK> your time on it
<START> well how was i suppose to know this was the dumb ass <UNK> <UNK> motion picture i mean i realized this when that dinosaur costume showed up and by the time the lead singer made his appearance i was <UNK> hard rock <UNK> to myself even though i hate that song dark floors is about a young <UNK> girl who is in the process of being <UNK> out of the hospital by her over protective father when they and the rest of the people in that particular elevator become <UNK> trapped when they arrive at their floor it comes as quite a surprise to find that there is nobody else around the hospital is empty except for a variety of monsters that seem to be stalking them for no apparent reason they run through the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> all of the band members of the heavy metal band in their outlandish shock rock costumes nothing really memorable here except the lousy acting lack of gore nudity and the utterly shameless <UNK> edge reminding me very much of kiss meet the phantom of the park yeah remember that dud wish i didn't i would just recommend avoiding all of these ghost house films like a <UNK> and not listen to <UNK> since they are a <UNK> ripoff band
<START> never viewed this 1971 film and was greatly entertained by this great production created by the walt disney studios and great animation creations angela lansbury <UNK> price played an outstanding role as a woman who had taken a course in witch craft and was an apprentice who was beginning to fly on a <UNK> and had quite a few difficulties taking off <UNK> discovered many tricks and was able to make a bed travel to different parts of the world however <UNK> missed her final <UNK> to becoming an accomplished witch mr <UNK> <UNK> david <UNK> was the person who sold <UNK> this course in witchcraft and he tries to help her in every way possible to find her solution <UNK> has a purpose to her madness and that is to stop the <UNK> from <UNK> england great family entertainment and we need more films like this today
<START> cecil b <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to prison <UNK> <UNK> finds the lovely <UNK> joy as a good at heart but <UNK> young lady with more money than she knows what to do with her <UNK> leads to <UNK> which in turn leads to her <UNK> thomas <UNK> is the <UNK> district attorney who has made it his personal <UNK> to bring out the goodness and <UNK> in <UNK> joy but he gets <UNK> by alcohol and once she is released it is up to her to rescue him br br if the plot doesn't sound too bad you'll be <UNK> by the <UNK> presentation the quality of <UNK> direction is very low and he does not show any particular skill that is unique to him the photography is standard and flat and the editing is hardly more dynamic one could easily <UNK> it as a fashion show and be pretty correct demille gets to dress miss joy up in so many different types of clothes evening <UNK> <UNK> costumes <UNK> costumes <UNK> of <UNK> that it's <UNK> could be <UNK> of <UNK> br br one thing more disappointing than the photography or editing or the direction is the acting which is mostly flat and wooden when it is not it is merely routine silent <UNK> rolling eye balls <UNK> eye <UNK> and deliberate pointing and arm movements what would have been <UNK> for modern viewers by <UNK> and scene chewing of some of the worst silent films is here merely dull to watch the only member of the cast who succeeds in any form of excellence is lois wilson who is not only beautiful but is able to play her role naturally she is convincing and endearing in <UNK> close ups as long as you don't read the <UNK> title card that follows once she opens her mouth to speak like i said everybody else is <UNK> routine joy <UNK> even julia faye her performance here makes a good argument for why she never <UNK> true stardom br br the worst and most amusing part of this movie is the heavy <UNK> tone that carries through all of it <UNK> character has plenty of <UNK> where he <UNK> on about how the youth of america is <UNK> in it's moral stance and going right back to the <UNK> of rome insert absurd flashback this movie's <UNK> has been described as victorian but it's further than that it has so little bearing in reality that i have a feeling audiences at that time didn't take it any more seriously than modern viewers could br br this movie is exactly what the <UNK> tend to think of as a <UNK> silent movie with it's <UNK> moral structure wooden acting and bad direction demille shows that he could be a terrible director with no sense of pacing camera placement or skill in handling either script or actors i can't imagine anybody in their right mind taking it seriously boring slow and idiotic i recommend it to hardcore silent movie <UNK> like myself only
<START> i enjoyed american movie so i rented chris smith's first film which i thought was a documentary too in the first minute i saw that it wasn't but i gave it a go br br what a dead end film being true to life hardly serves you if you're merely going to examine <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that we're already <UNK> with br br i'm sorry but will it come as a <UNK> to anyone that 1 a lot of jobs suck and 2 most of them are crappy minimum <UNK> jobs in the service <UNK> i knew that before i saw the film it didn't really provide an examination of that anyway as while the film struggles to feel real <UNK> camera no music etc what's going on hardly plays out as it would in the real world br br would an <UNK> be so cheerful to randy when he picks up his check after randy quit on him after 3 days when the guy said he expected him to stay 6 months or the day after <UNK> his job and <UNK> up the machine he was working on that everyone would be so easy on him br br a big problem is our hero randy this guy is a loser not because he's stuck in these jobs or has a crummy apartment or looks like one he's a <UNK> he doesn't pay attention or even really try at these jobs he has zero <UNK> if i had to hire someone he wouldn't make it past the interview br br i'm looking forward to what chris smith does next but guys knock off the this is an important film stuff american job doesn't work
<START> i was <UNK> taking my <UNK> to this movie as i didn't think it was going to be well done the kids ages 6 and 10 were set on seeing it so i <UNK> i must admit that it was not nearly as bad as i had thought but was still a far cry from the book the movie seemed right on with the 10 year <UNK> understanding and sense of humor i found that the 6 year old understood what was going on and he was presenting <UNK> to the issues that were taking place i eventually had to explain that sometimes the movies don't show the best <UNK> to the problems because it is more fun to watch what happens if they make the silly or stupid choices
<START> admittedly i didn't have high expectations of corky <UNK> but then again who did however i felt it deserved the benefit of the doubt i had no high hopes of joe dirt either another recent comedy starring an snl cast member and i ended up being pleasantly surprised but this film is just as bad as it looks in the previews chris <UNK> is actually a talented comic actor contrary to what you might think after watching this movie with great energy he's been in many hilarious snl skits and i think he's one of the most talented cast members on snl as of now in this case he's given a lame pointless script and he tries to <UNK> each scene with his <UNK> <UNK> throughout each scene he attempts a lame jerry lewis act and fails miserably jerry lewis knew how to pull off this type of physical comedy not to mention he worked with much better writing <UNK> simply looks like some ignorant fool with <UNK> who had one too many <UNK> <UNK> he doesn't even wait for the punchline he assumes we'll all laugh once he starts jumping around like an ape on crack in one scene he ends up in a <UNK> match with a dog who has a package of cocaine in his mouth the package explodes and the cocaine <UNK> all over him he comes back to the job strung out on coke now how are we supposed to laugh at the fact that he's acting hyper and on edge when he's doing the same thing throughout the whole film br br as for the rest of the cast members vanessa shaw is really hot peter <UNK> is wasted in a <UNK> role and so is chris penn peter falk is also wasted though he has a few funny lines that i'm pretty sure he improvised i hope falk gets a decent movie someday soon that's too much talent too waste on a <UNK> like corky <UNK> i didn't like <UNK> last movie made all that much either but at least he had a decent role br br i <UNK> a few times but i could not get a single laugh each gag is performed with no sense of timing or delivery and it's made worse by <UNK> hammy acting and there are certain gags that are <UNK> dragged out for example when <UNK> is about to fart in his two <UNK> faces he stands there for 2 or 3 minutes trying to get out a fart and when he finally he does it's a little tiny one it's bad enough when you have a gag that's funny and drag it out but when you have a lame gag and you drag it out it's a hell of a lot worse and another example of this is when he tries to translate what those two asian men are saying during a drug bust i can go on and on about what's wrong with this so called comedy but i'm not gonna waste my time like i said earlier if you predicted bad things from the trailers you predicted right br br my score 3 out of 10
<START> family is about two families who are after each other's blood br br <UNK> <UNK> amitabh bachchan is an underworld don <UNK> from <UNK> he has a family in india once by mistake he kills <UNK> akshay kumar like <UNK> <UNK> he also has a family a brother wife and parents <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> brother is out to take revenge of his brother's death he kidnaps <UNK> <UNK> family for the same reason br br the film has got one turning point amitabh bachchan second half of the movie belongs to him completely where instead of his dialogs expression matters more <UNK> <UNK> role has also put him at par with amitabh i didn't understand what <UNK> <UNK> was doing in this movie br br there were a few loose points in the script like amitabh has been shown as the most wanted criminal of the city still he walks <UNK> free in the city kidnapping of his family is also seemed vague how can the family of such a big don doesn't have any security cover
<START> <UNK> pick up never got the respect it should have it works on many levels and has a complicated but <UNK> plot the actors involved give some of their finest performances ann <UNK> roy <UNK> and john glover are perfectly cast and provide deep character portrayals notable too are vanity who should have <UNK> this into a serious acting career given the unexpected ability she shows and kelly preston who's character will haunt you for a few days anyone who likes action combined with a gritty complicated story will enjoy this
<START> i really enjoyed this movie it took a pretty dark story that of shakespeare's <UNK> and wrapped it in a quirky often funny and poignant modern yarn br br kudos to the way the filmmaker brought the very different worlds of modern nyc and <UNK> scotland together under one roof the <UNK> worlds act to br br really bring out the intrigue and comedy of the play and you have to love harold <UNK> as the chorus a part which doesn't exist in the play but really helps to jazz things up the ending stands out among little <UNK> i've seen for it's closure and originality
<START> there is no suspense in this serial when one episode ends the acting is so shoddy the effects are so poor and the script is so awful that the last thing on your mind is how batman and robin will save the day no in fact the last thing on your mind is watching the next episode this show is so boring that i can't see how it ever got made let alone released on dvd obviously the effects are not up to par with contemporary batman films but even the script is awful an incoherent <UNK> mess about some evil professor and a ray gun or something like that i am not quite sure because it is too awful to follow watch the 60s version or the 90's versions or even batman begins just anything over this version
<START> this is one of the worst written movies i've ever had to sit through br br the story's nothing new but it's a cartoon so who cares as long as it's pretty and fun br br i'm not going to go as deep as the <UNK> or i'll be here all day except to say that there aren't any the characters change personality whenever it's convenient to the plot but whoever wrote the script and visual direction should be forbidden access to so much as <UNK> and paper thumbs down i'd vote to cut their thumbs off br br narrow in on an object prop cut back to character close up character gives a knowing look which the audience will not even remotely understand repeat that several times with different objects props br br make the characters pay no attention at all the huge <UNK> of rock are floating around crashing into each other generally <UNK> destruction all over and which could kill them all at any moment but make them stop and gasp in fear when they see a harmless looking almost <UNK> green rock in the distance br br the whole thing is a long succession of events actions and behaviour that are only there for the <UNK> of the writer to save him having to think or make any effort at all to write the story properly br br this is the plan 9 of cg cartoons except that it doesn't have ed wood <UNK> factor to make it fun to watch br br do yourselves a favour spend your cartoon budget on pixar movies
<START> <UNK> machine is an amazing splatter film it has an original plot with young love <UNK> of blood and weird alien creatures that <UNK> people into <UNK> robotic war machines br br now the film isn't for everyone people who love splatter films or the movie <UNK> the iron man will applaud it br br the special effects can be cheesy at some points of the film but your not exactly suppose to take the film very seriously br br yet all in all it's a lot of fun well if you find budding <UNK> <UNK> with slimy <UNK> like <UNK> who seek to destroy each other in bloody alien <UNK> battles
<START> an ultra modern house in an <UNK> neighborhood appears to be the cause of each of its inhabitants bizarre and deadly behavior or at least that is what lara flynn <UNK> character <UNK> kennedy <UNK> after a series of deadly <UNK> in a <UNK> house next door <UNK> knows something has got to give mark paul <UNK> also stars as the mysterious architect br br my opinion the house next door works because of lara flynn boyle and the locations beautiful house and stylish sets boyle is a talented and dynamic actress not to mention absolutely stunning she brings credibility to her character and makes the film intriguing without her it would have failed it's so alive declares a <UNK> <UNK> in reference to the house yes it is alive but the story itself is not so much br br <UNK> <UNK> presence not much is happening here as an enormous amount of the movie is spent watching or waiting to see how the house will affect its current owners the results are predictable but i liked it anyway the cinematography lends the film a polished look 8 10 on account of boyle the premise of an evil ultra modern house the locations and cinematography and set decoration and wardrobe
<START> doyle had never wanted to <UNK> holmes from his joint death with professor <UNK> in the adventure of the final problem however financial <UNK> made him willing in <UNK> to write the <UNK> of the <UNK> which is still considered his best <UNK> novel and possibly his best novel but it was a <UNK> of the great detective written before his death only a greater <UNK> from his public led doyle to fully <UNK> holmes in the adventure of the empty house published in <UNK> br br it is not that the new short stories and the last novel are really bad maybe three of the stories are really terrible but even the terrible ones are very <UNK> several of the later ones like the adventure of the <UNK> <UNK> are really very good but the <UNK> of production in particularly after the stories in his last bow <UNK> become increasingly apparent he repeats past story lines and he shows really negative aspects of holmes in the story the adventure of the three <UNK> holmes shows a <UNK> sarcasm at a character who is of african <UNK> br br spoiler coming up br br the adventure of charles <UNK> <UNK> deals with holmes trying to recover <UNK> letters from <UNK> a hugely successful <UNK> it is an interesting example of how doyle could make a highly <UNK> story with a minimum of plot for there is little real detective work in the tale holmes is hired to try to <UNK> with <UNK> regarding the purchase of the letters but to get them back no matter what <UNK> proves not only unwilling to consider a smaller amount for the papers but prepared to protect himself from holmes attempting a search of his person later we learn holmes has gotten into the household of <UNK> by <UNK> a maid while disguised at the end holmes goes with watson to <UNK> <UNK> home he and watson are in the house when they find that <UNK> is awaiting some new business deal in his study someone with information that <UNK> can use carefully hiding holmes and watson watch as a woman comes in who turns out to be a victim of <UNK> damage from <UNK> past activities and who shoots the <UNK> to death holmes and watson are able to set fire to <UNK> collection of <UNK> documents before fleeing the house and subsequently discover for themselves the identity of the woman the police under <UNK> don't discover who the two mysterious men seen running from <UNK> home are and they are so disgusted by <UNK> activities they never were able to bring anything home against him that it is obvious the murder will never be solved br br the tale is not one of the fascinating ones with real detective work involved like the adventure of the <UNK> band or silver <UNK> it is a tale of mood and late action the issue being will holmes and watson get the papers or will they be caught by <UNK> it is not one of the best stories but it is in the bulk of the tales as being really well told and interesting br br at the time he wrote charles <UNK> <UNK> conan doyle had an experience with the police regarding his sometimes activities as a highly respected amateur detective <UNK> an artist was found murdered in his studio in london and conan doyle began writing his opinions about how the killing was committed then he stopped apparently warned by his friends at scotland yard that the murder did not bare looking into the victim had been a homosexual and the police were certain that it was a <UNK> <UNK> gone horribly wrong for the sake of the family of the victim this was in <UNK> doyle dropped his interest in the case so he was aware that sometimes the british police <UNK> with restraint on matters that did not seem to justify their full <UNK> as <UNK> restraint towards whoever did kill the villainous <UNK> in the story br br given the description of the story it could have been told in the normal hour long version of the series but the <UNK> for the master <UNK> spent some time showing the horrible dilemma <UNK> victims in victorian <UNK> england faced we see a promising young <UNK> army officer kill himself when faced with a homosexual exposure because of <UNK> <UNK> demands all at the start of the <UNK> and it is not only <UNK> men and women of good reputation in <UNK> <UNK> could be <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> children or past <UNK> relationships indeed in the story the woman who kills <UNK> is <UNK> the destruction of her husband a prominent <UNK> destroyed by the <UNK> br br <UNK> is well played at his most <UNK> <UNK> by that fine actor robert hardy who even when confronted by the unexpected <UNK> he has unleashed is totally <UNK> he looks like he will just have the angry woman showed out of his home in a moment brett and <UNK> do quite well in their holmes and watson roles as to be expected br br how serious was the loss of character by <UNK> or innuendo in <UNK> in <UNK> one of the heroes of the various <UNK> wars and the leader of the last <UNK> charge at the battle of <UNK> that destroyed the <UNK> army see four <UNK> was sir hector macdonald he was <UNK> of <UNK> in <UNK> when he suddenly unexpectedly <UNK> sir hector returned to london and shot himself in a hotel while awaiting some sort of hearing it later came out that fighting mac frequently considered the most popular army commander in britain had been caught having sleeping <UNK> with native boys <UNK> would have eaten him up very quickly or his real life counterparts would have
<START> i enjoyed this movie very much <UNK> <UNK> omar <UNK> and ice cube were all great in it the movie dealt with many issues and i didn't know if i was going to like it but <UNK> did a terrific job of creating characters that you really cared about
<START> superbly trashy and <UNK> <UNK> 80's exploitation <UNK> the pre credits opening sequences somewhat give the false impression that we're dealing with a serious and harrowing drama but you need not fear because barely ten minutes later we're up until our <UNK> in nonsensical chainsaw battles rough fist fights lurid dialogs and gratuitous nudity bo and ingrid are two <UNK> siblings with an unusually close and even slightly perverted relationship can you imagine <UNK> ripping off the <UNK> that covers your sister's naked body and then stare at her <UNK> <UNK> for several whole minutes well bo does that to his sister and judging by her dubbed laughter she doesn't mind at all sick dude anyway as kids they <UNK> from russia with their parents but nasty soldiers brutally slaughtered <UNK> and daddy a friendly <UNK> took custody over them however and even raised and trained bo and ingrid into expert <UNK> when the actual plot lifts off 20 years later they're facing their ultimate quest as the mythical and incredibly valuable white fire diamond is <UNK> found in a mine very few things in life ever made as little sense as the plot and narrative structure of white fire but it sure is a lot of fun to watch most of the time you have no clue who's beating up who or for what cause and i bet the actors understood even less but whatever the violence is <UNK> grotesque and every single plot twist is <UNK> retarded the script goes totally <UNK> beyond <UNK> when suddenly  and i won't reveal for what reason  bo needs a replacement for ingrid and fred <UNK> enters the scene with a big <UNK> in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local prostitutes <UNK> principal <UNK> is an italian chick with big breasts but a hideous accent the preposterous but catchy theme song plays at least a dozen times throughout the film there's the obligatory we're falling in love montage and loads of other <UNK> my god what a brilliant experience the original french title <UNK> itself as life to survive which is uniquely appropriate because it makes just as much sense as the rest of the movie none
<START> flynn known mostly for his <UNK> roles and his bedroom antics takes a different <UNK> with this film and it works beautifully playing real life boxing <UNK> jim corbett flynn turns on the charm full blast as he makes his way from a <UNK> san francisco bank <UNK> to a celebrated <UNK> all the while setting one eye on society <UNK> smith he and best pal carson attend an illegal bare <UNK> fight and are arrested along with scores of other men and a dog including a prominent judge the next day he gets a chance via smith to gain entrance to the <UNK> private club he uses this opportunity to <UNK> his way into the good <UNK> of its <UNK> members and land a spot as the <UNK> resident boxer his unusually <UNK> skill in the sport soon has him taking on all <UNK> up to and including the world champion john l sullivan bond flynn is downright magical here he is the epitome of charm charisma and appeal in this role he looks terrific especially in a <UNK> scene with his hair <UNK> and wearing a white union suit and does virtually all of his own <UNK> <UNK> his line delivery is delicious and he is credible and sympathetic and at the same time <UNK> and <UNK> smith exudes class and taste from every <UNK> and is a good match for flynn at this stage he needed a female <UNK> who could stand up to his advances and reputation he was <UNK> <UNK> rape charges at the time and she does so admirably she is <UNK> by his <UNK> and <UNK> attitude yet can hardly help but fall under his enchanting spell bond is incredibly <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> yet tender when the script calls for it amusing support is provided by a young and <UNK> carson <UNK> is his <UNK> <UNK> self as <UNK> manager the rest of the cast is excellent as well including <UNK> <UNK> family and an assortment of <UNK> <UNK> hill types the whole thing is beautifully <UNK> and <UNK> directed a few of the sets are amazingly presented some of smith's <UNK> border on the <UNK> but she suits the <UNK> <UNK> very well it's a terrific glimpse into the earliest days of championship boxing but it's also so much more some of it like the character traits shown by flynn is enhanced or exaggerated for entertainment purposes but a lot of it is authentic like the methods and costumes shown in the fight scenes one line is particularly memorable i believe you like me more than i like you but it's entirely possible that i love you more than you love me it's classic romantic dialogue and there are more than a few <UNK> <UNK> throughout the script as well
<START> to my surprise i really enjoyed disney's latest animation installment the film had its <UNK> but overall i felt the story was strong and the characters were easy to relate to it was also pleasant to see an animated disney film that was not a musical i was about pushed to the limits with tarzan thankfully they gave the music thing a rest another nice feature about the film is that the comedy was not completely <UNK> down a la <UNK> rather subtle so it still made the kids laugh while not make the adults feel <UNK> or just plain stupid br br one disappointment was the animation with all the great animated films happening outside disney studios you would think they would move along and catch up a little there is something to say about tradition but imagine the possibilities with the story of atlantis overall the film was entertaining and definitely worth a trip to the <UNK> br br
<START> the <UNK> released in 1956 has some of the finest actors of its time <UNK> hepburn lloyd bridges and burt <UNK> being the principle players not even they can save this completely over acted melodrama first of all hepburn is horribly miscast as a shy <UNK> despite her brilliance as an actress not even she can pull this off she is too strong to be credible as being this much of a <UNK> and was just too old for the part <UNK> over acts to the extreme and earl <UNK> is way too hammy and comes off more like <UNK> <UNK> only bridges and the ever reliable <UNK> corey seem to rise above the cast a bit but even they can only do so much it seems like the 1950's was a time when <UNK> hepburn wanted to spread her wings a bit as an actress and that is fine she just made a bad choice here fortunately for her fans me being among them she didn't make too many of them despite an a list cast and good production values it doesn't work
<START> this movie surprised me in a good way from the box i got the impression that it was an action thriller but it was too funny to be a thriller even though it was somewhat exciting br br there's a lot of nice one liners and funny situations in this movie and james belushi was born to do bill <UNK> he does a great job the rest of the cast ain't half bad either and especially timothy dalton is a treat br br the story can get pretty confusing at times as new characters shows up during the film things get more complicated as nobody seldom tells the truth about things if you don't pay attention things might get a bit messy in the end but i really liked it br br louis <UNK> isn't all that well known but he has done a perfectly ok job with this one and i never really grew <UNK> while watching the movie br br made men is well worth checking out
<START> i watched this film based on the very <UNK> reviews that i read about it here by others br br they definitely saw something in this movie i didn't see that's for sure br br the movie starts off at a good pace and the first 15 or 20 minutes of it are interesting then it begins to get <UNK> down and <UNK> not to mention completely unbelievable br br eventually you find yourself saying what he's going to do that too just how far is he going to go with this thing br br the plot begins with jeff <UNK> character john going into a <UNK> to purchase a bottle of wine there is a robbery and a new store clerk <UNK> rose gets killed during the robbery br br john gets in the <UNK> and goes to the hospital with the guy this seems a little much but wait there's more br br john becomes totally obsessed with <UNK> rose br br for reasons that never make any kind of logical sense john who has a very good life a beautiful loving girlfriend a secure well paying job nice house nice car expensive suits decides he wants to be a loser like <UNK> rose was and experience life in a low paying job living in a dump with a <UNK> girlfriend and possible connections with dangerous people br br why this dim witted half baked film got <UNK> reviews i'll never know sure goldblum does a good acting job he always does and his looks have improved with age but unless you have a big <UNK> with jeff goldblum and have to see every film he's in i wouldn't recommend this turkey it's approximately two hours of your life you're not going to get back and believe me you'll have nothing to be thankful about when those two hours are over other than being grateful you're not still sitting there watching this film br br
<START> i am the parent of a special needs child and i enjoyed the the movie very much it was loving warm and fun i learned a long time ago to see the humor in things i especially thought it was sweet how all the other characters worried about frankie and who would take care of him after his grandmother died i attended a focus screening of the film with other parents and siblings of special needs children before the film was edited everyone enjoyed the film and it actually inspired wonderful discussions we talked about how our kids make us laugh and we also talked about how we worry about them the screenwriter talked about how she work with <UNK> children and other special needs children as a <UNK> for several years she based the character on a real person our family is blessed with a sense of humor that has gotten us through some very <UNK> times i give the movie two thumbs up
<START> i began riding horses fairly recently and as anyone who has ever ridden should know i fell in love with horses and their world i rented spirit on a <UNK> just trying to pack my life full of as much horse related material as i could and i was surprised by the results br br what i expected was a feel good <UNK> movie with talking animals and stereotypes every five minutes br br what i got was an amazing film filled with beautiful scenery and animation and an amazing storyline that has the great potential to warm one's heart br br spirit is a wild <UNK> in the old west whose entire world is brought <UNK> down around him when he discovers the humans slowly taking over his <UNK> the story unfolds with a wide array of characters some human some animals all are well written and most are pleasant to watch on screen br br i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good story and who has an appreciation for history and animals br br one thing i forgot to mention but that i feel is important is that the animals in this film do not talk this was a really nice vacation from the lady and the tramp animated movies that everyone today is used to
<START> i bought this movie exciting a <UNK> gratuitous over the top entertaining bloodbath i got none of them this film fails on practically every level not in the least frightening or funny it is simply terrible film making and never provides the audience with anything worth seeing what is so bad about it is that far from being as raw violent and brutal as it had promised to be there is very little violence at all virtually no blood shed and no excitement whatsoever acting direction and dialogue is absolutely unbearable honestly it is truly laughable i could hardly sit through this total garbage once i certainly will never want to watch it again don't waste your time with a waste of celluloid like this it is truly possibly the worst film ever made if i could give it minus stars i would
<START> i'm not great at writing reviews so i'll just <UNK> my opinions br br i loved this series at first the adventure the action the comedy the drama i thought it was all brilliant anderson <UNK> <UNK> judge davis i loved them all davis it seemed was the fifth most important person in the cast not a big deal but when his character general <UNK> left at the end of the seventh season and <UNK> character colonel o'neill moved from the field to the office the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff i don't know whether it's because <UNK> was more important that i realized or what but for some reason after the seventh season the series turned to br br the first seven seasons though were awesome the movie stargate seemed mediocre the first time i saw it but it turned out to be even if this wasn't the original intention a brilliant setup to the series i recommend that you watch the movie first then watch the first season of the tv series then watch the movie again you'll have a whole new appreciation of it the second time around believe me and then watch the rest of the tv series br br the last three seasons of the series aren't nearly as good as the first seven but that doesn't mean they aren't good it just means they're a letdown if you've gotten spoiled by the first seven seasons br br after you have finished this series be sure to watch the spin off series stargate atlantis it is a worthy <UNK> to this brilliant series br br edit on 7 18 <UNK> i just found out that don s davis died a few weeks ago it is a great loss
<START> as a massive fan of fantasy in general and of the works of neil <UNK> in particular i've been looking forward to this film so <UNK> so <UNK> and with such a bittersweet mixture of anticipation and fear of disappointment that i can <UNK> believe it's finally here and you know what i <UNK> have feared the film version is <UNK> <UNK> awesome different from the book but in a good way less whimsical more comical still deeply sweet and enchanting br br the special effects are absolutely spot on and make magic feel a natural and proper part of the world of wall without being overtly spectacular and <UNK> br br proper attention has been paid to storytelling and pacing and the casting in the main is a triumph with the ghostly <UNK> whose roll call read almost as a who's who of currently cool british comedy rupert everett david <UNK> of little britain fame two of the <UNK> from green wing etc stealing most of the best lines and pretty much all of the <UNK> funniest moments which exist in abundance br br in fact the one minor criticism i have at all of the film is that sometimes the comedy elements become a little <UNK> subtlety goes out of the window to the <UNK> of the main story ricky <UNK> cameo for example was far too much just ricky <UNK> doing his usual david brent from the office comedy persona for my liking and in my opinion created an <UNK> and <UNK> break from the magical spell of the <UNK> story though in fairness from memory i believe the <UNK> character in the original book was pretty ricky <UNK> esquire when i think back on it br br but this is a minor <UNK> in an otherwise <UNK> cast and scripted fairytale with a good mixture of action and romance charlie cox as the protagonist <UNK> captures the correct mixture of <UNK> subtle comedy and self <UNK> required for a story like this where a humble young boy <UNK> on life changing quest claire danes as <UNK> is beautiful <UNK> and just ever so slightly alien or <UNK> a perfect interpretation of her stellar role robert de niro in the cameo every reviewer is talking about is indeed deserving of praise <UNK> good fun looks like he's having a ball too and michelle pfeiffer is <UNK> cool and nasty as wicked witch <UNK> my favourite performance of the film overall if you enjoyed her deliciously b <UNK> performance in the recent <UNK> then you will thoroughly enjoy her in this too br br so to round off this review you will laugh for sure you will smile and you may even cry stardust is a beautiful heart warming fairytale for all the family with a heart of gold and more <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> than is immediately apparent one of my all time favourite films is the absolutely fantastic princess bride and stardust is being readily <UNK> to this with good reason as it is a very similar type of film exploring similar themes and territory and just as the princess bride remains fresh smart and funny twenty years after its initial release i believe that the delicious tongue in cheek <UNK> of stardust will be showing up as a family favourite on our <UNK> or equivalent future device for many years to come
<START> i may very well be one of the few who really stuck to this film i also saw this movie when it came out and i agree with the last post that up the <UNK> was way ahead of its' time the humor in the film itself is pure mad magazine i don't see why mad stand behind this feature it was also one of the few films of the early 80's to have a killer accompanying soundtrack with the punk and new wave bands that were <UNK> from l a at the time i own the soundtrack and i play it constantly to this day what can i say there are definitely worst movies out there i don't consider <UNK> to be as funny as up the academy there are some really good laughs throughout the film and the jokes fall on either stereotypes or getting laid hey nobody said this was going to be the <UNK> <UNK>
<START> yeah unfortunately i came across the dvd of this and found that it was incredibly awful br br first of all the characters suck i mean come on if some <UNK> in an orange hat who calls himself <UNK> <UNK> is the best creative idea these guys could come up for a character then they should definitely not be in the film making scene poor costumes bad interviews and basically there is not one wrestler on this whole disc with any shred of charisma br br the wrestling in splatter rampage wrestling is nothing more than these idiots gently and <UNK> <UNK> together on a <UNK> they make sure to giggle together all the while too making the experience seem more like a <UNK> <UNK> than a wrestling <UNK> br br basically splatter rampage wrestling is a pretty lackluster backyard wrestling clone only instead of blood weapons mayhem and wrestling we get a <UNK> <UNK> kids terrible audio and some guy called orange <UNK> br br wrestling fan or not avoid this dvd it's awful
<START> first off i'd like to say that if i had to honestly rate this movie from a 1 to a 10 then i'd give it a 4 it's not that i'm a tough critic it's just that this movie is that bad everything from the story to the directing to the editing is awful the story is not even halfway decent to begin with you can't expect much since it is based on a video game something i was not aware of going into the movie but the directing and editing made it even worse the movie cuts at awkward points and goes to scenes that are completely unrelated to the previous ones some like a quick sex scene in the middle don't even make sense being put into the story seeing as how the characters don't show any feelings toward each other you could go into this movie expecting to see a pile of crap on the screen for an hour and a half and you'd still be disappointed honestly if you pay to watch this movie then you are wasting your money and if you don't pay anything then you are still wasting an hour and a half of your life so do yourself a favor and don't watch it
<START> all these reviewers are spot on i've seen many bad films over the years believe me and this beats the lot br br this is not just a so bad it's good <UNK> waste of time but a genuine hilarious movie atrocity br br check out the white <UNK> monster type thing br br wet yourself laughing at <UNK> <UNK> spell <UNK> acting br br <UNK> in sheer a e <UNK> disbelief at the <UNK> sets br br this is one of those european co productions no wonder we have so many wars i swear some of the people taking part in <UNK> of the lost <UNK> aren't actually aware they are appearing in a film br br fact i originally watched this movie on <UNK> <UNK> late one night while suffering from <UNK> and sleep <UNK> i had to track down a copy several weeks later to make sure it was really this awful it is worse even than lee <UNK> in the <UNK> more laughable than all of john <UNK> films this is truly the citizen kane of trash
<START> a surprising rent at a local video store i was pleased to find a media satire worthy enough to challenge oliver <UNK> natural born killers and almost as disturbing i think it went well with my viewing to be in late 2004 watching the <UNK> machine do it's magic on the majority of america's television viewing <UNK> it brings up the question are we really that manipulative br br it definitely <UNK> my view there was also a larger <UNK> question being <UNK> the story of christ could word of mouth and overwhelming <UNK> on something <UNK> as television produce a <UNK> could the story of christ been exaggerated could it have been completely <UNK> it's something the movie puts in a extremely <UNK> light
<START> but it does have some good action and a plot that is somewhat interesting <UNK> acts like a body <UNK> and he isn't all that attractive in fact imo he is ugly his acting skills lack everything <UNK> is played very well by joanna <UNK> but she needed more lines than she was given her character needed to be developed there are way too many men in this story there is zero romance too much action and way too dumb of an ending it is very violent i did however love the scenery this movie takes you all over the world and that is a bonus i also liked how it had some stuff about the mafia in it not too much or too little but enough that it got my attention the actors needed to be more handsome the biggest problem i had was that <UNK> was just too normal not sexy enough i think for most guys <UNK> will be hot enough but for us ladies that are fans of action <UNK> just doesn't cut it overall this movie was fine i didn't love it nor did i hate it just found it to be another normal action flick
<START> steven <UNK> directed and co wrote with james <UNK> the star this strange little drama <UNK> horror flick with evidently very good ideas and intentions make a gay film that takes a different storyline than the usual fare and make a drama that wants to be judged on its merits as a thriller so why doesn't it work for starters the film loses direction from the opening frame and wanders rather <UNK> throughout the film dead set on making a suspense thriller but getting <UNK> into satisfying an audience who wants to see nude encounters not that that is a bad thing it can certainly enhance some films that have been hollywood <UNK> the film also tries to talk about coming out experiences in young men and women relationships disturbed <UNK> the club scene with all the wild antics that <UNK> such events and murder it is all a bit much to <UNK> into a <UNK> minute film br br <UNK> james <UNK> by all appearances is a successful kid with a kind girlfriend jenna sarah kelly but he has an eye for boys and visits a bar where he meets brian alex wilson who has been down the same path and can offer <UNK> assistance on every level they bond <UNK> comes out and the mysteries begin boys are missing in the neighborhood <UNK> <UNK> psychologist dr kirk tyler dan <UNK> is not at all what he appears to be and despite <UNK> <UNK> mother donna <UNK> fisher <UNK> is cast into the streets because of his new relationship it seems dr tyler is in a dark business with hunky detective cunningham earl <UNK> who apparently is investigating the missing boys <UNK> <UNK> his resources from his understanding girlfriend jenna and her <UNK> and together the group <UNK> the dark <UNK> of dr tyler and his detective sidekick and through it all donna <UNK> warmth and understanding as the perfect mother of a gay boy etc br br some of the actors are pleasing to the eye and there is very little the eye doesn't examine frequently but the degree of acting is at an all time low the only thing that makes us forgive that and in some cases it is just too poor to forgive is the feeling of commitment on the part of everyone involved yes this is a low budget movie and yes the director needs time to learn his trade but in the end there is something to be said for the involved people to try to take a gay film to a different level maybe their next one will be more polished grady <UNK>
<START> i <UNK> as to whether or not i should <UNK> the spoiler box since 99 of this show has probably already been seen by any <UNK> of <UNK> it probably doesn't come under the category of a spoiler br br clip shows <UNK> we all knew friends was going down the tube when they started with clip shows and five and a half years into <UNK> they've gone and fallen down that hole br br i have to wonder if the writers just couldn't be bothered writing that week and just said to themselves let's show the other funny stuff it didn't work br br for starters showing all the times that people have fallen down isn't funny when taken out of context it's not funny to see todd <UNK> by his banana <UNK> unless we know why he was <UNK> by his banana <UNK> br br second for what was supposed to be a <UNK> of <UNK> fantasies one was <UNK> dream another also wasn't his fantasy although i forget which br br and that's the problem this episode is totally forgettable we've seen all these things before and the collection of clips of people dancing why that's not funny br br finally i must admit two of my favourite <UNK> moments were shown in the last <UNK> dr cox <UNK> that ben died and <UNK> telling him how proud of him he is br br but even seeing those moments again didn't save the episode the summary says it all br br worst episode ever bill lawrence please don't let your show go the same way as friends keep it fresh keep it funny or wrap it up
<START> seven pounds emotionally flat illogical morally disturbing br br the movie was distributed in italy as seven souls i was curious about the original title and after some research i found out that it refers to shakespeare's <UNK> of <UNK> where the <UNK> <UNK> makes a terrible bond with the <UNK> antonio who will have to give him a pound of his flesh in case he is not able to <UNK> his debt whereas the italian translation makes ben's plan something deeply human <UNK> by human sympathy the original one though <UNK> enough to remain <UNK> by anyone makes it just in its reference to the flesh something cold rational deep <UNK> in the physical side of man unfortunately i think that the real quality of ben's plan is revealed by the original title <UNK> a cold <UNK> aimed at <UNK> parts of his body but lacking any authentic human empathy at least the audience is not given the chance to see or perceive any pure relation of souls within the whole movie the only exception is the love story with the girl which seems to be a sort of non <UNK> incident to which ben <UNK> but incapable of conveying true emotional involvement i really didn't like the idea at the core of the movie the idea that a person however <UNK> by the pain for the death of his beloved and of other people he himself has caused takes the <UNK> decision to <UNK> his sense of guilt through suicide besides being improbable it makes no sense i would have liked and i think it would have been more positive if in the end ben had decided to abandon the idea of committing suicide and go on living thus helping those same people and maybe many more just standing near them and helping them through his presence he wouldn't have saved their lives miraculously of course this would have probably caused more suffering but i think it could have been more <UNK> from a human and moral point of view there are many illogical and disturbing things the initial reference to god's creation in seven days which by the way according to the bible are six what does it mean and what about a woman suffering from heart disease which <UNK> her from running and even from singing without feeling bad who can have normal sex with a man who feeling as it should be destroyed by the death of his wife and having <UNK> organs and pieces of his body doesn't seem to feel so much tried both emotionally and physically from his <UNK> condition the movie is saved by good acting but all the rest is pure nonsense not only from a logical point of view but also from a human and emotional one
<START> an <UNK> twenty something <UNK> played by john travolta leaves the farm and goes to <UNK> where he learns about life and love in a texas <UNK> <UNK> at face value it's a modern love story texas style there's <UNK> of cowboy hats pickup <UNK> <UNK> beer signs and references to big belt <UNK> and <UNK> the music if not texas native is texas adapted courtesy of the talents of mickey <UNK> johnny lee and the charlie daniels band and that texas <UNK> <UNK> br br the story and the characters are about as subtle as the taste of texas five alarm <UNK> made with <UNK> <UNK> it's enough to make <UNK> viewers <UNK> the film in favor of a <UNK> classic one starring laurence olivier or ingrid bergman maybe hamlet it's not but urban cowboy is <UNK> and explicit and i kinda like it br br technically the film is generally good the dialogue the production design and the costumes are all realistic the editing is <UNK> and both the casting and the acting are commendable if not oscar worthy i would not have cast travolta in the role he plays but he does a fine job <UNK> debra <UNK> barry corbin and brooke <UNK> among others are good too in support roles but the cinematography seemed weak the film copy i watched was grainy and at times suffered from a <UNK> orange <UNK> a visual <UNK> i have noticed in other films from the same time period br br at first glance the film does not seem to offer any social or political message but i would argue that when urban cowboy was released twenty five years ago it had rather <UNK> <UNK> in 1980 the u s had all kinds of problems not the least being american <UNK> held by iran in the minds of a lot of folks back then the u s was being pushed around <UNK> br br this film along with others of its time offered something that americans wanted to see in their political leaders <UNK> urban cowboy is a very physical film the characters in it may not be the <UNK> people on earth but they're tough br br everything about urban cowboy is anti intellectual as a vehicle for cultural expression then this 1980 film was one of several that <UNK> a new get tough era for the u s it started in 1980 with the election of reagan and that era continues to this day with a president who probably will not be remembered for his intellect but will be remembered for his <UNK> and <UNK> traits that americans seem to <UNK> to as surely as <UNK> to five alarm <UNK>
<START> despite the excellent cast this is an <UNK> film especially from the <UNK> perspective it may be somewhat better than the <UNK> von <UNK> and brown but not by much blue max remains the best of a small market over the last 35 years while darling <UNK> is fun if not taken seriously it's interesting to <UNK> what <UNK> could do with <UNK> and <UNK> in a new high quality <UNK> i <UNK> film
<START> great drama with all the areas covered except for <UNK> which was too slow and should have shown more relevant scenes like <UNK> character <UNK> the president or pitt getting murdered instead of just having it described to us scenes like those would have kept the audience awake cutting away some useless minutes could have made more room for more <UNK> scenes like those the dragging of the film kept this one from all time greatness although to see pitt here makes the film so worth watching also big fans of <UNK> early 20th century styles and montana will really like this as well
<START> this film could well have been one of those ordinary <UNK> relating the day to day events of half a dozen families whose lives are <UNK> broken relationships building new friendships street <UNK> near <UNK> hopes and dreams and even the discovery of a baby <UNK> under some <UNK> what a mixture of events br br fortunately the film maker goes beyond those daily events and poses questions to consider although there are no satisfactory answers he <UNK> this chaotic world do things just happen is it just luck when things turn out right or taking a <UNK> view is a person <UNK> to be at a certain place at a certain time and thus become involved in the event and his future takes on a new perspective most of us have had this uncanny experience br br is it our super ego that makes us believe we are so important as one character <UNK> he once sat on the edge <UNK> the grand canyon and came to realize how infinitely small he was br br this is not one of my favourite films but is a good study of human relationships danny glover is outstanding in a sympathetic role
<START> there's something compelling and strangely believable about this episode from the very beginning an atmosphere of tension is created by the knowledge that a certain planet is going to explode within a few hours kirk spock and mccoy have <UNK> down to <UNK> the inhabitants all of whom seem to have left already for parts unknown except for an elderly <UNK> br br the <UNK> polite but <UNK> advice about where all the citizens have gone to is interrupted by a crisis in which all three enterprise crew members find themselves unexpectedly <UNK> into different <UNK> of the <UNK> past kirk finds himself in a time period resembling <UNK> century england while spock and mccoy are stranded in a desolate frozen waste br br the <UNK> between the two stories and the different <UNK> situations the men find themselves in is superbly handled with return to the present an unknown chance while the minutes are counting down to the <UNK> explosion br br imaginative writing and fine acting <UNK> this episode with a touching performance by <UNK> hartley as a woman <UNK> to the ice age and ian <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> somewhat reminiscent of the classic episode city on the edge of forever this time travel story is a rich and compelling finale to the series which <UNK> one episode later this has to be one of the best of the whole series especially remarkable given the generally lesser quality of the third season overall
<START> this film is about a family trying to come to terms with the death of the mother wife by moving to <UNK> italy br br the plot of <UNK> sounds promising but unfortunately it is empty and without focus the film only consists of a collection of scenes depicting the daily life of the family such as swimming taking piano lessons or cooking eggs most of such scenes are redundant and tiresome completely failing to engage viewers emotionally the ending is very disappointing as it is not spectacular moving or emotional i can safely say that i am disappointed and bored by <UNK> the only thing good about the film is the sunny weather and the beauty of <UNK> <UNK> can serve as an extended <UNK> <UNK> for the city but not as a film to be enjoyed
<START> just saying you've got a movie about john holmes is a guarantee to get some folks in front of the screen but writer director james cox delivers oh so much more a <UNK> of the sleazy hollywood set the film <UNK> the july 1981 wonderland murders through a variety of angles and film <UNK> but mostly through the <UNK> of john <UNK> <UNK> out <UNK> brain in a film full of bad guys holmes is either the most vile the most pathetic or both several versions of the story emerge and <UNK> as cox flashes jump cuts and <UNK> title cards amid effects and <UNK> the dialogue is fast and <UNK> and never once rings false while the film takes places two years after holmes had fallen out of porn and into a truly wicked drug <UNK> <UNK> kilmer relentlessly exudes a sexuality so intense it can be <UNK> in <UNK> this sexuality at its edges creates a sense of foreboding that hangs over the entire film almost as heavily as the violence at its center those murders are <UNK> at through the whole film though are never clearly shown not even at the climax though the violence of them relentlessly <UNK> the whole picture and much blood is <UNK> across walls and crime scene photos once again val kilmer as holmes shows he can act <UNK> better than anyone else working <UNK> cringing <UNK> or begging kilmer is constantly in character and the character is constantly a fascinating car wreck stand out performances beside kilmer definitely include ted <UNK> as the lead cop in the investigation and lisa <UNK> as holmes estranged wife the trio of criminals holmes falls in with include the <UNK> high energy josh lucas the ever interesting timothy blake nelson and an absolutely <UNK> dylan mcdermott in a pivotal role as the <UNK> yet another version of the murders cox suggests that no matter how much we learn about wonderland there is always a worse version possible but looking through the <UNK> surrounding it is much more fascinating than understanding the truth
<START> the legend of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 4 and a half hour poem to <UNK> is not to begin at once because it must hold back for space because it takes its time in <UNK> <UNK> of half remembered childhood memories in a turn of the century backwoods village yet the movie goes on picking up steam building in emotional <UNK> as though even the sounds and images which <UNK> it become <UNK> by sheer association with their subject matter with that quality of fierce <UNK> quiet dignity that <UNK> the soviet working spirit <UNK> <UNK> soviet <UNK> but in an almost <UNK> way to <UNK> like <UNK> cuba and <UNK> the mood turns somber and <UNK> news of the revolution reach the secluded <UNK> village through the <UNK> the <UNK> of its labor reach it only when a world war calls for the young men to <UNK> through all this <UNK> <UNK> in on the individual with care and affection to examine the bitter longing and regret of the woman who waited 6 years after the war for a fiancé who never came back waited long enough to go out and become a <UNK> in a ship with <UNK> <UNK> and which she quit years later to come back to her village to care for an aging uncle who killed the <UNK> father with an axe the <UNK> <UNK> of the fiancé who came back from the war a hero 20 years too late came back not for the sake of the girl he left behind but to <UNK> oil for the <UNK> the despair and <UNK> of the middle aged <UNK> party leader who comes back to his small <UNK> village with the sole purpose of <UNK> it out of the map to build a power plant the movie <UNK> from decade to decade from the <UNK> to the 80's with amazing <UNK> footage <UNK> soviet history from the revolution to war <UNK> and the titanic technological achievements of an empire terrific visuals here all <UNK> violence and <UNK> angles and <UNK> <UNK> shots of crowds and faces but the actual movie focuses on the individual on <UNK> and <UNK> small and big by the second half a sense of bittersweet <UNK> creeps in of broken lives that never reached <UNK> <UNK> with regret and yearning it can't matter seems like the world is saying to which <UNK> answers it must matter because the protagonists keep on trying for redemption br br yet behind this saga of <UNK> against <UNK> something seems to <UNK> shadowy almost <UNK> like the eternal old man <UNK> who appears in every segment to guide or <UNK> the protagonists sometimes a mere <UNK> sometimes the enigmatic <UNK> a little behind and above all the other straightforward and logical incomprehensible <UNK> challenges and <UNK> of the human characters something invisible seems to <UNK> ghosts of the fathers appearing in <UNK> dreams repeated shots of a star <UNK> in the <UNK> a curious bear indeed the eternal old man himself <UNK> calls for awe and <UNK> before a mystical land of some other order in its treatment of a small backwoods community struggling against nature progress and time and in the ways it learns to deal with them often funny bizarre and tragic at the same time and in how the director never allows cynicism to <UNK> his <UNK> it reminds me of <UNK> <UNK> the profound desires of the gods when in a dream scene <UNK> tears through the <UNK> of a door on which is <UNK> a propaganda poster of <UNK> to reach out at his dead father as he <UNK> in the fog the movie hints at the betrayal of the soviet dream or better yet at all the things lost in the revolution this betrayal made more explicit in the film's fiery denouement the amazing visuals <UNK> and somber with a raw <UNK> edge help seal the deal by the end of it an oil <UNK> <UNK> in flames and the movie <UNK> in a wild explosion of pure cinema
<START> i give this movie a 3 as it is worse than the cult movies that deserve a proper 2 it does not make sense to you well it doesn't have to this is another vampire movie with a stupid plot no let me <UNK> incredibly idiotic plot where space <UNK> complete with cowboy hats battle a space race of moron vampires br br does it get any <UNK> than this the only good thing in this movie was <UNK> <UNK> with her stunning norwegian beauty god i wish michael <UNK> and the <UNK> brothers would stop accepting dumb roles in dumb movies i mean at least <UNK> was nice i know mr <UNK> from a lot of movies he has acted in <UNK> movies at this date it's true that he was rarely in a major role but still
<START> basic slasher movie premise 3 young ladies wreck their car and end up staying with a creepy family yawn br br watching <UNK> minutes of a <UNK> of <UNK> car chase with a white <UNK> instead of a <UNK> yawn br br old lady with hot and cold <UNK> controlling her daughter yawn br br 23 minutes of watching the actors eat yawn trying to identify what the heck they are eating ok there might be a drinking game here nope yawn br br <UNK> shower scenes ok got my interest for a couple of seconds br br completely random and uninspired killings yawn br br the ending dude that psycho is deranged why couldn't the rest of the movie be like the last 5 minutes unfortunately that is it my advice fast forward to the last five minutes and watch that and then put something good in the player for me i am going back to sleep
<START> i haven't been able to decide if this movie is so bad it's good or to quote <UNK> <UNK> so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again no matter it forced me look much the same way a pile of weird <UNK> vomit might and it offers up a number of scenes that you won't forget even if you want to there's a <UNK> young ray liotta telling a <UNK> pia that her creative writing <UNK> looks like a penis a bit later there's ray again <UNK> pia not with the appropriately shaped <UNK> but a garden <UNK> there's a firm <UNK> pia telling her <UNK> mom that she wants to go to bed with <UNK> <UNK> father walter there's the actress in the graveyard scene <UNK> the best line ever written by pia or anyone else <UNK> there's that garden <UNK> again as walter waves it <UNK> face and <UNK> is this more to your liking there's pia and her date so turned on by closeups of each other <UNK> <UNK> that they start <UNK> each other's clothes off there's pia <UNK> but forgetting to remove her dress perhaps best of all there's <UNK> <UNK> but instead of keys there are the <UNK> talking heads of those who have tormented her the most afterwards i was afraid to open my <UNK> and finally there's pia at the awards exposing hollywood for the <UNK> it is spitting out the second best line ever i guess i'm not the only one who has ever had to her way to the top i see i have already spent more time commenting on the lonely lady than i have on far better pictures so i'll quit be <UNK> though that once you start watching you probably won't be able to take your eyes off the screen until two hours of your life have <UNK> forever
<START> there were times during the movie i wish i had been beat to death the only reason i endured the entirety of the movie was because i couldn't believe how bad it really was and thought it must get better this truly was a horror film i was horrified that i wasted what seemed like 4 hours of my life that i will never get back the other two hours i spent mourning at the loss please recommend this movie to <UNK> you wish to torture and tell them the suspense will kill them
<START> let me start out by saying this movie has 1 funny point at the very beginning with the exchange between the narrator and george narrator huh wait a minute who the heck are you george me new george studio too cheap to pay brendan <UNK> narrator how did you get the part george new george just lucky i guess br br sadly that's the only funny part in the entire movie br br it was still entertaining but then again i'm easily entertained br br i wouldn't say this is the worst movie i've ever seen that title goes to the terribly un funny disaster movie this movie falls 7 on my bottom 15 list br br if your a small child who is easily entertained you'll enjoy this movie if you're a movie watcher who wants a good funny movie you'll end up shooting yourself halfway through this one
<START> this is really a great unknown movie perfect dialogue without the typical clichés this movie relied on the actor's talent and it was pulled off it even had a little bit a comedy in it but it wasn't overdone once in the life is what a crime drama is supposed to be not the typical special affects garbage with sex thrown in i especially loved the <UNK> aspects of it all br br now onto the actors themselves laurence fishburne was superb at playing a career petty criminal it's a shame that he's only allowed to show his talent in his own movie <UNK> <UNK> was fabulous as <UNK> <UNK> half brother <UNK> walker added flavor to the already perfectly <UNK> film paul <UNK> was perfect as a grease monkey drug lord i loved his acting since king of new york but the best acting in this film came from gregory hines and michael paul chan who were paired perfectly as two of <UNK> henchmen br br once in the life is for sure a keeper 1 2 out of
<START> after not having much luck at selling his screenplays to the new movie industry during the first decade of the 20th century in <UNK> playwright d w griffith got the job that would make him a legend he was hired by the <UNK> company as a director of movies it wasn't really what griffith had expected when he decided to enter the movie business but he accepted the job and in less than a year he became <UNK> most successful director thanks to his original approach to film making and the wild inventive of his narrative many years later he would direct the birth of a nation in <UNK> the movie that would <UNK> film making and make him one of <UNK> first recognized authors however a lot of what would make him a great filmmaker can be found in the many short films he made for <UNK> company in the early years of his career <UNK> the sealed room is one of those and also one of the few horror movies of that very first decade of the 20th century br br the sealed room is a story set in the <UNK> century in which a count <UNK> v johnson has built a <UNK> room in his castle it is a small yet nice and very <UNK> room as it is meant to be used to enjoy the love and company of his wife the <UNK> marion leonard in a more private way however the count doesn't know that his wife is not exactly faithful as she is <UNK> with the <UNK> henry b <UNK> at court with whom she is having an affair as soon as the count gets busy with his own business the <UNK> calls the <UNK> and both lovers go to enjoy the <UNK> new room when the count returns he discovers she is missing and begins to suspect finally discovering the two lovers in his room but instead of making a scene he prefers to remain hidden as he decides that there is a better punishment for his <UNK> wife to seal the <UNK> room with the couple inside br br written by <UNK> regular <UNK> frank e woods the sealed room takes elements from edgar allan <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> and mainly <UNK> de <UNK> la <UNK> <UNK> to create a haunting gothic melodrama based on the themes of <UNK> and <UNK> despite having a runtime of 11 minutes <UNK> screenplay develops the story in a very good way and plays remarkably well with the horror elements of the story while a melodrama at heart woods focus on the character of the count and his <UNK> creates one of the best horror characters of these early era the sealed room is definitely a very simple and basic story but woods handling of the dark and morbid <UNK> of its plot makes the story a very entertaining film that was very different than most <UNK> <UNK> br br in the sealed room griffith uses his talents to experiment with tension and suspense in a different way than his usual while he often played with editing to create thrillers that excited his audience in this movie his focus was to create desperation and horror playing with the inherent feeling of <UNK> that the source stories had it is interesting how the story starts as another of his <UNK> and slowly the pacing becomes faster as the horror themes begin to dominate the plot culminating in his great use of editing for the final scenes not being a movie where camera tricks are essential what shines the most in the sealed room is <UNK> talent to direct his actors as the legendary filmmaker manages to bring the best out of his cast with his usual natural style far removed from the <UNK> that was the norm in his day br br as usual the cast was comprised of usual <UNK> of griffith starting with arthur v johnson as the count johnson gives a great performance and truly conveys the character's transition from loving husband to sadistic monster his performance is not without a touch of overacting but actually that adds realism to the character's exaggerated personality as the <UNK> marion leonard looks very good and is also very effective in her acting conveying a natural charm that makes hard not to sympathize with her in her <UNK> finally the legendary henry b <UNK> appears as the handsome <UNK> and while far from being one of his best performances he manages to give a <UNK> acting that also adds a nice touch of comedy to the film while not of real importance to the plot it's nice to see other members of <UNK> stock company in the background like his wife linda <UNK> and a young mary pickford as <UNK> at court br br while not exactly a masterpiece the sealed room is a notable exercise of editing to create suspense and tension like griffith used to do in those days the movie has very good set design and while of a very low budget <UNK> care for details makes it look very convincing and works perfectly along with his directing style the change of focus to horror makes it to stand out among other of his films from that era and <UNK> performance as the sadistic count makes it worth a watch while griffith will always be remembered for his highly influential and controversial the birth of a nation the early short films he made before it really give a good idea of the development of the techniques and the style that would make him a legend simple yet elegant the sealed room is a fun movie to watch and one of the few horrors of the first decade of the 20th century 7 10
<START> i suppose that any novel that's as much of a <UNK> as <UNK> dick would not find much favor with depression era audiences who had enough of their own troubles but any resemblance to the classic herman <UNK> novel is a pure coincidence br br in fact half of the film is a prequel to the main story as we know it not that too much of it was kept for the film we first meet <UNK> <UNK> he's got a last name and a brother as one happy go lucky soul with two legs and intentions to marry joan bennett who is father <UNK> daughter that brother derek played by lloyd hughes also wants to marry bennett br br john barrymore is <UNK> in an over the top performance barrymore had not quite <UNK> the sound cinema and he gave out with all the silent era <UNK> plus a stage voice that would have <UNK> the <UNK> of any movie theater this film was playing in br br we see <UNK> lose his leg to the great whale <UNK> dick and i have to say the <UNK> scene was pretty gruesome of course this was all before the code still i'm sure 1930 audiences <UNK> br br after that the story of <UNK> hunt for the whale that he thinks made him <UNK> in joan <UNK> eyes that is not exactly <UNK> motivation in fact there are no women characters in <UNK> dick as he wrote it br br one of the things <UNK> did was <UNK> the crew of <UNK> ship the <UNK> with personalities other than <UNK> the cannibal <UNK> the names are there but not the personalities <UNK> and <UNK> might as well be smith and jones br br i'd see this version of <UNK> dick strictly for curiosity and nothing else
<START> i never understood why some people dislike bollywood films they've got charismatic actors great dance numbers and <UNK> emotion what's not to like what i didn't realize was that i had only seen the upper <UNK> of bollywood then i watched <UNK> <UNK> i could tell from the first scene that this was not a movie i was going to like the film opens with a montage of the two leads driving around a city and apparently happening <UNK> on a series of photo <UNK> populated with <UNK> models but i kept hoping things would improve sadly they didn't the main problem is that the two protagonists mac sam are completely unsympathetic they spend the entire movie lying to women and lying brutally in order to get them into bed and the audience is supposed to find this funny and be <UNK> the boys are <UNK> and inept and not in a lovable way mac even goes so far as to have one of the women drugged in order to keep her from discovering his cheating the script is extremely poor with repetitive scenes <UNK> that never lead to anything and illogical actions and statements by the characters in fact the characters are never really developed at all the males are <UNK> greedy <UNK> and the women merely <UNK> beautiful if you go by this movie you would think that air <UNK> are pretty easy to pass from man to man in reality betrayal is not so humorous br br the only bright spots i found in the movie were one dance number that had brilliant sets and a few <UNK> moments involving the french farce door <UNK> aspects of the story but bollywood dancing is better enjoyed in movies choreographed by <UNK> khan and for slapstick you might as well just go straight to the silent comedies of buster keaton and harold lloyd who seem to have influenced writer director <UNK> not a little <UNK> also takes false credit for <UNK> the story the basic premise of the plot is stolen from the 1960 play <UNK> <UNK> the original author of that work marc <UNK> is credited nowhere at least <UNK> changed the title for this remake rather than <UNK> using the original without giving credit as he did in his 1985 version of this same tale according to <UNK> credits list
<START> i have seen this movie and even though i kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning i still liked watching it i would recommend it to other people it comes on lifetime movie network quite a lot and i am thinking since it's close to halloween they might play it more so please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it i believe that alicia <UNK> played her part very well i really like her as an actress and person she seems so nice and down to earth kevin dillon he's performance was so so for me i am not trying to knock him or anything but i believe that his brother matt would have been able to pull this bad evil serial killer persona better kevin just seems too sweet for me but i think he did okay
<START> i really enjoyed the performances of the main cast emma lung is courageous and interesting the director has developed performances where the characters are not one dimensional a complex story with the changing between <UNK> also appreciated the underlying story of the <UNK> losing power and the effect of a large <UNK> closing on a small town i do not agree with the comment that the older man has to be attractive there have be many relationships with older men and younger women without the male being good looking depth of character can be appealing to the not so shallow the film has a good look and the cinematography is also good
<START> this film is scary because you can find yourself relating to ideas they have and can recall other people saying and having <UNK> ideas make this a haunting well done movie the <UNK> style is not <UNK> to point it draws you out of film like blair witch it only adds to the raw real feeling of the film that makes it
<START> final score who cares it's a reality show it has no love for it's audience it <UNK> to lazy tv viewers puts nothing in and gets nothing out br br joe millionaire the most blatantly phony reality show of them all is a television disaster of epic proportions it's a <UNK> rock bottom moment not only for fox but for the american viewing public who actually watch like and talked about this crap the next day you people ought to be ashamed of yourselves because as much as fox <UNK> this junk it won't make any money unless it's watch by people and boy was it the finale got nearly super bowl numbers it doesn't bother you people that there are many quality shows written directed acted and generally have effort put into them that are being cancelled while you sit back and lap up this <UNK> cold game show br br i used to be a <UNK> <UNK> of fox it's those of us like me who like and seek out quality tv that helped build fox back in the days of married with children and the simpsons conveniently enough now neither of those shows would make it 6 weeks with the current management the <UNK> <UNK> reign of terror as it's often called the network has <UNK> war on scripted tv and strangely enough it's fans the very people who helped build them in the beginning now not only do we have to fight for good shows but we have to fight against their own network it <UNK> the mind nothing fox has done in the past 3 years makes any sense from <UNK> hits like <UNK> <UNK> and john <UNK> nbc can <UNK> <UNK> but fox can't lift it's pitiful head to give the only decent show they had this season another shot and the reason they can do all this the success of junk like joe millionaire they can now say we don't need you tv fans we have reality shows they apparently seem to have no idea that the big audience the draw with this junk is <UNK> and will abandon them the second the next <UNK> comes along to alienate their base like this will eventually kill the network the way it has set back abc br br the show itself is a joke here we have a premise in the now classic fox gimmick that promises us something different and edgy but then delivers something not in any way different from the bachelor or anything on the big 3 fox has gone mainstream the finale and twist quote <UNK> showed they have no ideas up their <UNK> now we know that all these shows no matter how different they look will all end up the same <UNK> fairy tale ending we got to see a bunch of lame aspiring actors that the network picked out of millions of head shots to fit their <UNK> parade around like high school <UNK> pretending they liked this <UNK> <UNK> because well because it was a competition and that's what you're supposed to do <UNK> himself is like a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> man who struggles to put together the <UNK> sentences but how can the women all average to ugly looking by the way an important minus is a guilty pleasure show like this not fall for joe with such charming lines like look you're not stupid br br i used to think that people who watched these reality dating game shows were just to lazy to change the channel but after joe millionaire i think they must be genuinely mentally <UNK> come on people have a little more pride in yourselves demand a little bit more from your entertainment then this br br <UNK> fox
<START> go see this movie for the gorgeous imagery of andy <UNK> <UNK> and treat yourself to a thoroughly eye opening and relaxing experience the music perfectly <UNK> the footage but never draws attention towards itself some <UNK> called the interview snippets with the artist a weak spot but consider this why would you expand on this in a movie if you can read <UNK> <UNK> at length in his books or attend one of his excellent <UNK> this medium is much more suitable to show the <UNK> nature of the <UNK> works and is used expertly in this respect
<START> i really didn't expect much from this movie but it wasn't bad actually it was quite good this movie contained a couple of the funniest bits of writing i have ever seen from a motion picture now am not saying this is one of the funniest movies of all time but i laughed pretty hard at some parts the police ruled my father's death a suicide they said he fell down an elevator <UNK> onto some bullets now this movie is not for everybody its mostly stupid humor like <UNK> or <UNK> so if you hated these movies i would probably recommend you to steer clear overall it was an enjoyable movie about a group of superhero <UNK> who end up becoming real heroes in the end it's a vastly overrated comedy that many people probably haven't seen yet because like me before viewing it expected it to be utter garbage after viewing this film i finally understand why this movie was able to <UNK> such a superstar cast which includes ben stiller william h macy hank <UNK> and even that kid from good <UNK> it's because mystery man is full of excellent comedic writing period 7 out of 10 a very big surprise
<START> my girlfriend has the habit of going to blockbuster and choosing movies no one has ever heard anything about admittedly at times it has led to some fun <UNK> often times the best that can be said is they definitely run an hour and a half br br she brought home advice from a <UNK> she was excited because the box said it was funny lucky for us the propaganda on the boxes never lie br br this movie was an exercise in patience this is one of those movies where unless you are a pretentious and shallow person who likes watching movies about yourself you will hate every character in the movie until the introduction of the one nice character which the lead annoying pretentious character will fall in love with and act in such a way that in the real world would drive anyone away br br mild spoilers from here on br br so a bunch of emotionally vapid stuck up pretentious artists swear off love and find success in their careers then they meet a nice intelligent emotionally mature and loving character an almost perfect guy we then watch the woman the annoyingly pretentious artist in her 30's freak out as she falls in love so she tries to flee from the nice intelligent emotionally mature man and stay with the married man with whom she's been having great but empty sex she is rude to the man and does everything in her power to drive him away in the real world she would have been quite successful i certainly wanted to flee from her and i wasn't even in a relationship with her br br although its nice that the man <UNK> for his <UNK> i never wanted her to have him nor did my girlfriend she didn't deserve him and why i wonder did the director think that the <UNK> perfect <UNK> should be <UNK> by having to win a relationship with her when the artist was asking the <UNK> perfect <UNK> to leave we were screaming for him to leave too there's a problem with a movie when the heroine of the film is so annoying childish and stupid that you want her to fail br br beyond that let me say that andy dick made me laugh a few times even though his character was also pretentious to the point of annoyance regarding the other characters they were well acted morally <UNK> and annoying characters br br it is a comedy and i can say i did laugh a few times in the film unfortunately not much laughing happened until the last 10 minutes or so but by the time i had those laughs i had been praying for the movie to end for far too long i needed to get these vapid characters out of my life br br if you want to watch people you hate struggle with a love for people they don't deserve then this is the movie for you
<START> <UNK> want a little romance with your mystery this has it i think if the romance was <UNK> this would have made for a better movie but how could the romance be <UNK> when the story's borrowed from something called a <UNK> romance novel whatever the heck that is had the romance been <UNK> the story might have been a little too weak the mystery here wasn't too bad quite interesting but nothing on the level of mission impossible international espionage oh well i thought mel harris was pretty good her short <UNK> i think added some sex appeal but this rob stewart guy probably could have been better cast maybe with a more well known tv movie actor the directing was decent and the writing could have been improved on both could have been a little <UNK> a little darker more adventurous one thing that was great about this was the use of real european locations that could easily have been changed so this could have been filmed in canada but they really were in <UNK> beautiful places like <UNK> possibly a <UNK> was the director and or <UNK> choice to frame certain shots picture <UNK> perfect not good had this been a more dramatic motion picture shot for the big screen picture <UNK> perfect scenes really need to take a <UNK> and just be a nice part of the background this was just a tv movie though so they had to add some <UNK> to the picture and some of that <UNK> came from the scenery overall <UNK> really a bad movie i'll tell you what this was absolutely the best canadian hungarian production i have ever seen and the only that i know of i <UNK> <UNK> this to be a mediocre made for tv movie giving it a grade of c
<START> after the overrated success of <UNK> and <UNK> spanish horror movies spread like a disease in the increasingly sad world of horror movies the result is all in films like el <UNK> <UNK> a tv like production bad written but acted and directed even worse i didn't read the <UNK> campbell book but i'm sure that the author of the doll who ate its mother didn't have much in common with this terrible production avoid it at any cost unless you're searching for a quiet sleepy night in a fresh movie theater 2 10
<START> i enjoyed this film it was funny cute silly and entertaining had a fine cast and really got <UNK> by some critics for reasons that i truly don't understand no it wasn't the <UNK> of wrath or casablanca or even moonstruck but it was an enjoyable film br br julia was excellent playing the psychotic <UNK> behind the man' the story is a little silly to be sure but it this isn't high drama folks i happened to see a review of the film probably the only good one it got and then ran into it one night when looking for a movie i never heard it was supposed to stink until after i saw it and i'm glad i saw it eventually bought the vhs tape on the bargain pile and i watch it a couple times a year
<START> disappointing film performance of actors is weak sets are fine could have been better the story is also weak battle sequences are awful sounds and quality of film are trashy the history of <UNK> people was told very poorly this film should have included more <UNK> actors in leading roles and also should have been in <UNK> language <UNK> <UNK> and jay <UNK> are hispanic origins i don't get it since when hispanic people play <UNK> <UNK> people this film is shame of <UNK> cinema <UNK> <UNK> disappointed me he is one of the finest filmmakers in the world <UNK> director is <UNK> since he is not <UNK> origin he cannot know true spirit and history of <UNK>
<START> a spoiler br br what three words can guarantee you a terrible film cheap canadian production the brain fits those words perfectly terrible script idiotic acting and hilarious special effects make this a must for every bad movie fan the horror is hilarious the post production team looks like it gave up what makes the brain admirable is in the second half it actually tries to be good can a bit of <UNK> and <UNK> save what is already a joke br br it's around christmas time a mother and daughter are murdered by one of the funniest looking villains ever the day later a rebel teen gets into enough trouble that he is sent for a psychiatric analysis br br if a cop 's head is chopped off and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody axe told you some kids did it who would you believe what begins as funny turns dull and <UNK> toward the end when the brain tries to be serious a child cannot be frightened by the scary moments the brain is too funny a concept to try and be gritty the psychological research <UNK> is larger than major <UNK> plants our ugly villain and its <UNK> get credit for pulling some of the worst acting i have seen viewer <UNK> advised heavily
<START> myself and my <UNK> 20 something pals just can't get enough of this awesome parker posey classic i tried renting this on dvd but can't seem to find it too bad as i'm sure the features would be extra special we all highly recommend this uber cool comedy <UNK> for a date or even just a <UNK> night home alone this would also be the <UNK> <UNK> type of movie to watch with your cat or even throw a party based on like a party girl party just like the one in the movie that the lovable <UNK> <UNK> parker posey goes to at the end oh and be on the <UNK> for a gripping and hilarious surprise ending move aside the sixth sense you've just been <UNK> by a way <UNK> movie sorry no offense just calling it like it is take it from an old flick lover comedy just doesn't get better than party girl with parker p feel it yours ronald marie <UNK> aka dj <UNK> rap
<START> this work is a bold look into the mindset of men who find themselves in <UNK> this film never tries to tone it down <UNK> candy <UNK> or soft soap the angst confusion and pain of what these guys live with that is its strength i think br br but more so the performances are fantastic with well conceived and delivered dialog which draws you in and makes you feel a part of the experience the characters never attempt to block out the audience from knowing what's on their mind what's in their hearts br br i found it plodding but enjoyable br br it rates a 6 6 10 from br br the fiend
<START> barbara stanwyck plays lily powers she's a waitress for her father's <UNK> in a little crummy mining town he also sells her to men she escapes to new york and literally sleeps her way to the top br br originally i had only seen the <UNK> minute version but it's pretty extreme for its time nowadays it's pretty tame the movie moves very quickly and has tons of sexual innuendo some of it comes off as pretty silly but fun today it moves so quickly you can easily ignore that most of it could never happen even in 1933 there's nothing classic or monumental about this it's just a quick <UNK> dirty little film that's lots of fun it only falls apart at the end with a little moral ending that the censors <UNK> it comes across as unbelievable and stupid i saw it in a theatre and the audience laughed at it one guy quite rightfully said no way i just saw the uncut 75 minute version which has a different somewhat tragic and much better ending this version was thought to be lost until 2004 when it was discovered by mistake i believe this is the only one in release but be aware br br the acting is good stanwyck jumps into her role and plays it way over the top she makes you believe that she enjoys being cruel and sleeping around there are also strong supporting performances from handsome donald cook and george brent also look for a pre stardom john wayne in a hilarious bit as a meek and mild office worker fun dirty and fast i give this a 9
<START> despite loving rita hayworth finding the final few sequences of the film intriguing and being able to appreciate some of the <UNK> symbolic aspects of the cinematography the lady from shanghai didn't quite work for me i had a problem with most of the performances the script and the overall structure and in a film that's mostly people talking with each other in various situations that's quite a problem the lady from shanghai ended up at a very low c or a 7 for me br br the lady from shanghai is really all about orson welles' character michael o'hara o'hara sees elsa <UNK> <UNK> rita hayworth in central park on a <UNK> ride and hits on her later he saves her from a <UNK> and she takes a shine to him o'hara is a <UNK> from ireland and the <UNK> elsa happens to own a <UNK> with her husband arthur everett sloane a very famous and powerful california defense attorney they talk o'hara into working for them despite his initial <UNK> it seems to him and to the audience that elsa is just looking for someone to have an affair with and o'hara doesn't want to get involved br br shortly after going to work on their <UNK> a strange man george <UNK> glenn <UNK> who says he's <UNK> partner shows up at a <UNK> of call and begins stirring up trouble eventually <UNK> asks o'hara to enter into a very dubious and dangerous scheme <UNK> o'hara agrees naturally it gets him into quite a bit of trouble and eventually a number of mysteries are revealed br br maybe my problems with the film lie in the fact that so far i'm not exactly a huge fan of orson welles and here he produces writes directs and <UNK> most of the screen time i haven't seen anywhere near the majority of welles' work yet but i've tended to like his later films better when he became a bit more campy and performance arty i love f for fake <UNK> et <UNK> 1974 for example and i even kind of like his performance in casino <UNK> 1967 when he <UNK> insisted on being allowed to do magic tricks at a <UNK> table but citizen kane 1941 never did much for me despite giving it 3 or 4 chances over the years including about one year ago my rating was a low 7 the same as my current score for the lady from shanghai br br welles' performance and the dialogue he's written for himself come across as affected and pretentious to me he's a bit of a <UNK> a bit of a <UNK> and a bit <UNK> he tends to sound like he's reading his performance reminded me of what i've seen of welles' version of <UNK> dick listed on imdb as 1999 but completed in 1971 it can also be seen in orson welles the one man band 1995 where he seems to be just reading to the camera and believing that he's <UNK> <UNK> dramatic i'm also someone who almost never complains about accents but somehow welles manages to make his irish accent sound affected and pretentious to me too br br as for the other performances i can only say i thought hayworth did an excellent job of course she's gorgeous which doesn't hurt plenty of eye candy here like welles sloane also seemed a bit affected and pretentious to me i never quite bought his character his <UNK> and so on and <UNK> is simply bizarre where bizarre doesn't seem to fit welles often shoots him in close up and <UNK> almost always has some over exaggerated manic expression on his <UNK> face br br <UNK> the lady from shanghai is very uneven the first 50 minutes or so are extremely bland and soap operatic although the soap opera <UNK> tend to be approached from a <UNK> <UNK> once <UNK> introduces his scheme things pick up a bit and mostly improve as we near the end but by the time the lady from shanghai becomes a crime mystery film it's too little too late and it quickly turns into a courtroom drama before the sudden thrilling ending that comes almost out of nowhere and is over far too quickly for its relative excellence br br the ending is more action oriented less dialogue heavy more varied and exotic in settings and at times fairly abstract welles handles that combination of material <UNK> as a director if the lady from shanghai would have been a largely a combination of the crime mystery stuff and the arty ending it could have easily been at least a 9 the final scenes are easily <UNK> as welles shifts from a <UNK> suspense scene in a san francisco chinese opera house to another suspense scene in a chinese amusement park the <UNK> climax uses cinematography that was experimental for its time it's well integrated with the script as it allows a complex resolution and <UNK> a lot of symbolism br br the cinematography throughout is interesting even if it usually can't make up for the problems in the <UNK> welles <UNK> scenes with skill there are lots of <UNK> filmed settings from central park to <UNK> to various san francisco locations welles effectively creates symbolic backdrops for his action from the <UNK> heights and <UNK> drops of <UNK> to the <UNK> like <UNK> streets the beautifully framed and <UNK> shots of the san francisco <UNK> and so on the romance material for which the <UNK> serves as one backdrop is interestingly <UNK> with a kind of <UNK> throughout the film but on the other hand that makes the romance never quite work as romance br br surely serious welles fans will appreciate the lady from shanghai much more than i did and of course it's worth a watch if you love rita hayworth the lady from shanghai isn't exactly a terrible film in my view but it's dangerously close to not passing proceed with caution
<START> you'd better choose paul verhoeven's even if you have watched it
<START> if you like horror movies with lots of blood and gore tons of jump scare moments and <UNK> <UNK> scenes of excruciating death then look elsewhere if you like quiet moody thoughtful horror which casts blood aside in favor of a genuine feeling of dread then wendigo is for you br br thoughtful <UNK> out george his <UNK> wife kim and their young son miles are heading out to the snowy countryside for a long weekend vacation away from the city on the way up george hits a <UNK> with his car the hunters who had been pursuing the deer are not thrilled when they find that george has ended their chase in particular deranged hunter <UNK> takes it personally he follows the family to their vacation home making sure they see him he spies on george and kim as they have sex he fires through their windows with his rifle when they aren't home letting them discover the ominous holes in their windows and walls when they return when kim takes miles to the <UNK> in town miles is attracted to a small <UNK> in a display case <UNK> to resemble a man with the head of a <UNK> a native american man tells miles that this is the wendigo a spirit of the woods who has a taste for flesh and is always hungry miles takes the figure home with him already haunted by the death of the deer the day before that afternoon when he and his father go <UNK> george is shot and miles pursued through the woods by a creature barely <UNK> or is he just in shock and imagining the whole thing hours later george is rushed to the hospital and miles still <UNK> his statue either <UNK> dreams or goes on a vision quest in which the wendigo returns this time the angry flesh eating god part tree part <UNK> and part man is hunting for <UNK> who has finally gone over the edge br br wendigo is a beautifully made film almost totally silent but for the wind howling through the snow covered trees okay so the monster itself is kind of <UNK> looking but it's a small flaw more than made up for by the genuine feeling of tension and dread that creeps through every frame of the film and the eerie backdrop of the silent snowy countryside the performances are great particularly by jake <UNK> as the moody and thoughtful george and patricia <UNK> as his sweet but no nonsense wife they are a happy couple with their share of common problems and it is the strength of their relationship and their love for each other that makes this film powerful watching this film is often like watching someone's home videos so realistic are the performances br br this movie is not for everyone a lot of people may find themselves totally bored waiting for the hideous <UNK> beast and bloody revenge that never come we can never really be sure if the wendigo even exists seen as it is through the eyes of a sensitive child and also later through the eyes of a madman this is more a psychological drama than a horror film but it has more than enough creepy elements in it to satisfy fans of subtle horror
<START> probably the best picture producers releasing <UNK> ever made this little horror piece <UNK> the attention from first to last director frank <UNK> obviously knows a good story when he writes one and what's more important he knows how to realize its full shock potential on the screen not only is the plot involving and the characters <UNK> drawn but the setting is absolutely out of this world just about all the action takes place either at night or in the middle of a <UNK> <UNK> fog this chilling atmosphere is <UNK> by <UNK> inventive direction and the wholly convincing performances he has drawn from all his players the lovely <UNK> la <UNK> makes an ideal heroine beautiful spirited yet vulnerable robert <UNK> delivers his usual no nonsense straight down the line portrait of the local <UNK> though it's hard to believe that the <UNK> good looking guy who plays his son is none other than the later <UNK> writer director blake <UNK>

<START> the summer has been so full of blockbusters and <UNK> of films and not to mention some of the <UNK> of those <UNK> that i was <UNK> to find a film i could just sit down and enjoy br br in case you don't want to read further down the page there aren't any spoilers i'll sum it up here it's more mature than ella enchanted there are some <UNK> violent parts plenty of death and a handful of scenes with a little blood not for small children but doesn't try to be overly corny or <UNK> its <UNK> think of it as a bit more serious bit more magical princess bride and you'll be close br br br br i am perhaps not as <UNK> a movie goer as others maybe once or twice a month if i feel active i'm also a huge sci fi fantasy fan i get bored of remade repetitive story lines and films with more flash than filling faster than you can count to 10 and this film is the diamond in the rough br br by the end here august i was tired enough of <UNK> expectations from the big hits that i <UNK> seeing bourne ultimatum in favor of stardust having had my hopes thoroughly <UNK> by transformers for my fiction addiction the previews of stardust seemed appealing but i was certainly <UNK> br br as many others here i was utterly surprised i had gone in thinking to see another generic fantasy movie clichéd from here to breakfast don't be fooled it is most definitely a fairy tale and it does indeed have witches magic and utterly requires suspension of disbelief but the most refreshing thing i found is that it's not based on anything i've seen or read in the past 15 years and it's actually a really good movie br br unlike 90 of the other movies which seem to <UNK> re appear like <UNK> in a side perhaps a sign that hollywood is running out of ideas i could read a book this year and in two years the movie would be out as another epic fantasy tale the likes of lotr and the rest so says the <UNK> and such and such no doubt br br stardust didn't have me <UNK> to my seat because of jam packed action at every turn nor was i <UNK> bullets because of plot hook after plot hook threatening to tear the dramatic tension apart and echo throughout the theater in a loud boom it didn't even use enormous <UNK> of sound to grab my attention to what's happening on screen transformers i'm looking at you it's not trying to show off the latest cgi techniques nor did it offend my intelligence with <UNK> dialogs and story lines that are simple enough i could've figured them out in 3rd grade boy i hate those br br i just watched watched and enjoyed a <UNK> creative storyline unfold before my eyes sure i may have known what was going to happen throughout most of the film but it makes you forget that it even made my heart <UNK> at some parts but the most important aspect i noticed is that i left the theater feeling better than when i'd gone in br br it truly is a gem after so much <UNK> this summer with so many remakes and films that fell short of my expectations this was like a cold sweet cup of tea to cap off all the hard work i'd done sitting through the others trying to come out of them with my <UNK> worth br br it's probably not for everyone but do yourself a favor if you enjoy fantasy films that stand the test of time alone princess bride black <UNK> the dark crystal etc then you should really see this movie this little diamond is finding its way into my dvd collection the moment it hits stores you can trust me on this br br simply wonderful
<START> i had the tv on for a white noise companion and heard 400 for a fully <UNK> apartment so i ran into the tv room expecting another 70's flick and got much more luckily i could <UNK> to the beginning <UNK> <UNK> and hit the record button to watch it entirely <UNK> uncut and in <UNK> no less aside from some holes in the story and <UNK> improbable dialog events this is an effective thriller worthy of your time to watch pretty creepy and <UNK> at times beverly <UNK> character <UNK> in front of alison parker played <UNK> by <UNK> raines parker stabs in very gory fashion her father an explicit <UNK> a <UNK> scene don't let the kids watch the film is totally 70's full of bad clothes <UNK> suits and tacky <UNK> and <UNK> bad hair over <UNK> music score and familiar looking cinematography the cast is excellent take a second on this film's home page to check it out it was a surprise to see christopher walken jerry <UNK> and jeff goldblum so young sylvia miles always wonderfully creepy enjoy
<START> much worse than the original it was actually painful to sit through and it barely held my six year <UNK> interest br br introduction of some new pokemon is <UNK> interesting but storyline is extra thin dialogue is still bad and music is mediocre watch the television show instead it's much better
<START> <UNK> <UNK> has the lead role in this movie i saw this movie 6 times and i still am not tired of it this movie is similar to flesh blood in some ways <UNK> <UNK> is a great writer he wrote all of paul verhoeven's dutch films paul verhoeven is one of the greatest directors i have seen all of his movies all except for <UNK> my mom does not like him so much but i disagree i think all of his films are a ride to watch especially total recall and basic instinct jerry <UNK> did some of his movies which include total recall basic instinct and hollow man i wish jerry <UNK> never died dutch films are different but still enjoyable
<START> <UNK> again from the darkness mary <UNK> is <UNK> quite the list of films which provide a glimpse into their specific era her previous i shot andy <UNK> and american psycho were at their best when commenting on the <UNK> of society during that period although the notorious bettie page is obviously about ms page it is every bit as much a peak behind the curtain at the world of kinky photo shoots in the 50's br br the film is fun to watch both from the perspective of the story and the technical aspect of the way it was filmed and put together the grainy b w film and photos capture the time and the introduction of color in miami beach through the photos of bunny <UNK> is very well done br br the supporting cast is strong with david <UNK> fresh off his edward r <UNK> role chris bauer as irving <UNK> and <UNK> taylor the star of the film is the wonderfully talented and underrated and <UNK> gretchen mol ms mol always brings an edge and spirit to her roles she was absolutely mesmerizing in the little seen jason alexander directed just looking in 2000 here she is the notorious bettie page her smile is captivating and her body is flawless she really seems to enjoy this role and helps us understand how the girl next door from <UNK> could become the underworld pin up queen br br as one would expect the soundtrack from the era is terrific <UNK> <UNK> and peggy lee are just two of the featured performers although the film hints at providing a history into this industry the final third kinda falls flat <UNK> pure movie magic but the magic of gretchen mol and bettie page make this a fun movie to watch and one that will <UNK> endless <UNK> on hbo in the near future now will someone please turn ms mol into the star she should be
<START> a typical <UNK> chick <UNK> <UNK> looking like a cross between <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> and boy george gets even with people she feels have <UNK> her with the help of an old haunted mirror that she finds in the new house she and her mom horror <UNK> karen black the only remotely good thing about this travesty buy the <UNK> pretty laughably bad especially when <UNK> <UNK> with the aforementioned mirror and there are no scares or suspense to be had this film inexplicably <UNK> thus for 3 sequels each slightly more atrocious than the last people looking for a similarly themed but far superior cinematic <UNK> would be well advised to just search out the episode of friday the 13th the series where a geeky girl finds an old cursed <UNK> mirror that packs more chills in it's <UNK> 40 minutes than this whole franchise has provided across it's 4 films br br my grade d br br eye candy charlie <UNK> provides the obligatory t a
<START> this movie was so bad it was laughable i couldn't resist watching it though the plot is standard the acting quite horrible supporting cast such as the nutty neighbor and the lawyer friend were better actors kind of amusing if you have some time to waste and like seeing the conclusion to a dramatic plot br br the <UNK> who plays kathy was just fascinating because i couldn't decide if her deadpan flat affect was the result of bad surgery or simply bad acting i decided it was both this leaves the script to comment on which was pretty awful pat remarks idiotic decisions and reckless stupidity on the part of every character in the movie maybe this is what was so riveting i don't know i just watched it to see how bad it could be actually the dialog doesn't even qualify to be called <UNK> but it's almost completely inane br br all in all very bad cheaply made movie the sets the same scenes a house a building were shown over and over with no artistry or actual tie in to the action more like props that were randomly dropped into the action in a bad play a chase scene could have been shot by any juvenile in a warehouse or an old school poorly shot cheap props minimal action and i still wanted to see the ending go figure
<START> this is the single worst movie i have ever seen i cannot express how bad it is i honestly wanted to kill myself several times through this atrocious experience just to have the pain end i recommend instead of seeing this movie you <UNK> in acid then you will at least know a <UNK> of the pain without all of the <UNK> br br i had such high expectations when i read the back of the dvd case and when in the beginning it added that jesus was following them i was so excited then by the end i wanted to kill myself i mean a twenty three minute introduction to the most annoying characters in the history of cinema just pain monkeys could have done a better job editing this trash at least they would have thrown <UNK> and <UNK> some of the garbage it would have made it better to have not seen any of the horror br br it wasn't that i didn't get the jokes it's that they were not only not funny they repeated themselves like twenty times apparently something isn't funny unless you see it like a million times br br do not under any circumstances see this people have rated <UNK> the hands of <UNK> as the worlds worst movie i have seen that too and agree that it is bad but alas it is only the second worst <UNK> drives the <UNK> is by far worse br br this deserves all kind of harsh language but i can't write that here so just imagine i <UNK> a whole bunch
<START> this service comedy for which peter marshall <UNK> <UNK> brother and later <UNK> host of the hollywood <UNK> and tommy <UNK> were hyped as 'the new lewis and <UNK> is just shy of dreadful a few random sight gags are inserted everyone talks fast and nothing works quite right there's one scene in which <UNK> is throwing <UNK> at officers and politicians in anger they're about five feet apart <UNK> is throwing them in between and the total reaction is that everyone <UNK> br br in the midst of an awfulness <UNK> only by the <UNK> julie <UNK> there are a few moments of <UNK> marshall and <UNK> engage in occasional <UNK> of double talk and <UNK> and their timing is <UNK> <UNK> perfect clearly they were a well <UNK> comedy pair br br it isn't enough to save this turkey alas
<START> the movie was ok not bad not good just ok if there was anything else in the theater this would be <UNK> by far sadly fast and furious 2 also <UNK> but i'd rather see this than <UNK> if you have a fetish for harrison ford or that other young punk this will be a cute movie for you personally i'd wait for hbo or blockbuster
<START> what is contained on this <UNK> is a first rate show by a first rate band this disc is not for the faint of heart the music is incredibly intense and very cool what you will learn when you watch this movie is just why the who was so huge for so long it is true that their records were great but their shows were the top of the heap in 1969 when this concert was shot the screaming <UNK> <UNK> that threw <UNK> <UNK> at the beatles were gone and bands and audiences had settled down to long and often amazing displays of musical <UNK> something that few audiences have the intellectual curiosity to pursue in the age of <UNK> music by britney and christina what you especially learn here are the amazing things that can happen when gifted musicians are encouraged to <UNK> try the concert out it really is amazing
<START> it'd be easy to call guys and dolls great it's got frank sinatra and marlon brando and contrary to sinatra's original wishes the casting works it's got a really cool 1950s feel even if it is basically <UNK> from stage to screen with only a little <UNK> and most of the songs are often a lot of fun and catchy and performed with that <UNK> and nod to the wonderful <UNK> inherent in the form itself if it's not entirely as great as some others of its <UNK> it shouldn't be any fault of the filmmaker joseph l <UNK> not all the songs entirely click and a little of the dialog feels like it's being performed for the stage as opposed to film it's hard to tell at times brando and sinatra <UNK> the line so often that one has to watch carefully to tell when one plays for the camera or for the stage while the actress playing adele is better for stage than screen br br the plot is one of those winners that works well for its period even if one wonders if its influence has stretched to the likes of <UNK> she's all that well not quite but close a <UNK> and 14 year <UNK> played by sinatra wants to host a big time game but is told that the heat is on meaning the cops are on watch so he has only one choice to host the game with a thousand dollar <UNK> the only way he can get it is through a big time bet with fellow <UNK> brando who's put on to make a wild <UNK> job of a mission worker it allows for the predictable twists in the story in the sudden turn on turn off of the charms of the character of the <UNK> of people from the streets gangsters and dancers and the <UNK> played by jean simmons who falls for brando it is in its basic concept about this whole world of guys and dolls and how to balance one or the other obviously without getting married or too <UNK> br br <UNK> brings a lot of energy to the piece even when keeping still with the camera on the subject and his stars are properly <UNK> in hell even brando works excellently for a musical as he goes beyond being simply the method actor and shows his chops for singing and big star quality the story and characters eventually wind down to what you'd hope will happen and that's fine all we ask for and what we get is entertainment in good <UNK> of witty involving dialog and a few songs and dances that bring the house down my favorites were the number with the lady cats at the club luck be a lady and the two numbers down in <UNK> cuba a
<START> the young dr <UNK> mark <UNK> an avid <UNK> is <UNK> by his museum boss to the large country home of <UNK> richards <UNK> <UNK> where his task is to find <UNK> for and <UNK> the collection of

seems to <UNK> the extra work that <UNK> visit will <UNK> the large empty house providing an endless amount of cooking cleaning and <UNK> for him <UNK> is a <UNK> sort very neat and precise with everything having its place whether they be his clothes or his books and papers and he is rather disgusted by the dirt in his room needless to say he is rather eager to begin his work but <UNK> he finds his <UNK> have been damaged in <UNK> so he asks the <UNK> for a replacement pair the <UNK> who is a modern thinking man but also it would seem rather <UNK> with such matters is also eager to get rid of the clutter around the house so he <UNK> and walks <UNK> to the top of the hill so that he can <UNK> the estate and the surrounding <UNK> there the <UNK> directs him to points of interest including <UNK> hill where locals were hung for their crimes and <UNK> his interest is also taken by a local <UNK> which the <UNK> describes as a ruin but <UNK> can see through the <UNK> that it clearly isn't he <UNK> further and pays a visit to the site of the <UNK> and is shocked to find that there are but a few stone <UNK> <UNK> doesn't have too much time to think about this <UNK> as he

destiny the ghost story for christmas series of films made by the bbc sadly ended its initial run of films in 1978 with the ice house they were for the most part based on the work of the great m r james in 2005 and 2006 the series was <UNK> briefly and thankfully a view from a hill also marked a return to the work of james whose ghostly <UNK> have haunted many generations of readers director luke watson being new to the series might have worried fans of the older films but he returns to the period setting abandoned by the later films which immediately sets the tone for a great ghost story his direction is assured as he stays true to the mood of the masters works and gradually builds up the fear factor to a terrifying climax all the while keeping what the viewer sees to a minimum thus <UNK> the tension and mystery the <UNK> countryside provides <UNK> of atmosphere the falling leaves and low lying sun providing an unsettling backdrop for the sinister events to come the cast it must be said are all superb and are perfectly cast in their respective roles the idea behind the <UNK> is simple but very effective the use of a man made object to see supernatural beings and events that the naked eye cannot see may even have influenced <UNK> de la <UNK> in his film la <UNK> del <UNK> 2006 of the following year with which it bears striking similarity i had heard mixed reviews of this particular film but i must say i found it at all times intriguing and it even raised a few <UNK> on my head and gave me a few <UNK> something that doesn't happen much these days i think any <UNK> surrounding the film can only be attributed to its pacing which to my eyes is perfection but to modern audiences it will be seen as <UNK> slow plenty of time is given even within its brief 40 minutes running time for character development and plot <UNK> and i must say its a new favourite of mine and certainly one of the better films of the decade
<START> ah the spirit of <UNK> the streets of paris were running wild with rebellion the hippies were high on the spirit of love how was britain <UNK> this age of <UNK> and revolution <UNK> by the looks of it dear old <UNK> was focusing on making films about boys in <UNK> schools if contains the evil establishment it contains the <UNK> of the <UNK> what it lacks in contrast to the <UNK> passion and the <UNK> <UNK> is any sense of excitement except in its all out <UNK> and <UNK> fire ending br br lindsay <UNK> if stars the ever marvellous malcolm mcdowell as one of three private school <UNK> who <UNK> their <UNK> with photos of <UNK> and other left wing <UNK> it's clearly an anti establishment movie in its depiction of the evil upper class <UNK> who rule the <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> practices of the <UNK> posh public school standard what makes if unusual though is that for all its radical <UNK> it doesn't <UNK> give us any sense of great tension between human decency and the <UNK> school system instead it just kind of <UNK> lacking in plot and lacking in personality br br <UNK> bits fade in and out occasionally and the film slips from black and white to colour again is it due to the low budget or is it an arty expression but there is little of interest to speak of all we get is the poignant denouement where the young rebels reach for their <UNK> and shoot down the shady <UNK> of the establishment <UNK> a revolution at last something that demands a second thought unlike the rest of this dull exercise in <UNK> school <UNK> br br if could have been a powerful political statement but as it is it <UNK> and only <UNK> any sense of direct interest at the end instead of being a testament to the <UNK> <UNK> of the late sixties it only succeeds in being a <UNK> document of upper class british education <UNK> <UNK> more like the only man many viewers will want to stick it to after watching if will be lindsay anderson
<START> excellent writing and wild cast the tech is poor but it's obviously very low budget looks like they didn't cut the negative but had to release on a video <UNK> in any case one of the most inventive comedies i've seen lately the screenwriter in particular is fine
<START> chances are uses that marvelous song by the same name throughout the film robert downey jr is excellent in this movie his extra large eyes and wonderfully <UNK> facial expressions are part of expertise in acting as different people in diverse films compare robert downey jr in chaplin you will enjoy chances are i did
<START> i watched grendel the other night and am compelled to put together a public service <UNK> br br grendel is another version of beowulf the thousand year old <UNK> <UNK> epic poem the scifi channel has a growing <UNK> of <UNK> and uninteresting movies and the previews promised an <UNK> low budget mini epic but this one refused to let me switch channels it was <UNK> <UNK> bad i watched in fascination and horror at the train wreck you couldn't tear your eyes away from i reached for a <UNK> and managed to capture part of what i was seeing the following may contain spoilers or might just save your sanity you've been warned br br just to get it over with <UNK> warriors wore <UNK> <UNK> trivial issue compared to what came after it also appears that the <UNK> were in a bin and handed to <UNK> actor <UNK> by next fit appearance and function were apparently irrelevant br br <UNK> <UNK> had obviously been <UNK> into doing the movie by the <UNK> brothers <UNK> and <UNK> circus she managed to avoid a red rubber nose but the <UNK> had already done the rest of her makeup br br ben cross <UNK> not to be embarrassed as the king his character <UNK> must have become king of the danes only minutes before the film opened and hadn't had a chance to get the crown <UNK> to fit him yet br br to <UNK> the actors' return to their day jobs waiting tables none were required to change their <UNK> at all the variety of hair included <UNK> <UNK> buzz cuts and a <UNK> and at least served to distract from the dialog to prove it was a multi national cast all were encouraged to retain whatever accent they chose br br as is typical with this type of movie at least since mad max leather armor was a <UNK> in this case it was odd shaped ill fitting and brand new br br the female love interest ingrid played by <UNK> peters followed a long standing tradition of <UNK> who should be watched with the volume turned completely down br br the <UNK> focus of the movie was a repeating compound <UNK> with exploding <UNK> it never needed to be loaded and even had a <UNK> when fired it managed to shred the laws of physics the integrity of the original legend historical fact and plot suspense all by itself br br <UNK> palace <UNK> rather than being a <UNK> long hall apparently was designed and constructed by <UNK> who <UNK> with atlantis br br beowulf arrived at the <UNK> <UNK> in a two <UNK> stern <UNK> ship that originally was part of a set the other two being the santa maria and the <UNK> br br prince <UNK> observed <UNK> <UNK> approach using a <UNK> before you could recover from that astounding <UNK> you got to see the ship from his point of view judging from the angle the prince was in an aircraft of some sort br br fun fact 1 in <UNK> fire as from a <UNK> creates light without heat this explains why you could see the actors' breath whether <UNK> or out br br fun fact 2 dark age dancing in <UNK> looks like slow dances i went to in the <UNK> grade br br fun fact 3 you too can make a <UNK> with a timed release air burst explosive but don't expect it to actually harm anything incidentally beowulf was apparently a veteran of world war ii yelling <UNK> to shred any remaining suspension of disbelief br br grendel was so upset and always in a <UNK> because as a completely cgi creation he couldn't leave <UNK> even in snow br br <UNK> mom <UNK> was in a foul mood because she was a single mother and junior hadn't inherited her wings <UNK> gene i suppose by the way we can now make an educated guess that <UNK> pop was probably swamp thing br br grendel and mom chose to randomly kill fly away with or drag away their prey based only on a close reading of the next few pages of the script br br fun medical fact being <UNK> by a mythical beast hard enough to be thrown fifty feet against stone causes slight facial <UNK> that don't bleed much br br the sword of legend beowulf used to <UNK> the <UNK> was as long as he was tall and would have contained enough steel to put a second deck on the golden gate bridge luckily the <UNK> <UNK> any concerns over its weight br br best line of the movie prince <UNK> had just been <UNK> by <UNK> and spit a <UNK> of blood roughly six feet princess ingrid <UNK> him gently and said you're going to be okay my prince so much for that job at the <UNK> clinic br br i feel better now
<START> i think this movie had to be fun to make it for us it was fun to watch it the actors look like they have a fun time my girlfriends like the boy actors and my boyfriends like the girl actors not very much do we get to have crazy fun with a movie that is horror make i see a lot of scary movies and i would watch this one all together once more or more because we laugh together if this actors make other scary movies i will watch them the <UNK> mad man thats chase to kill the actors is very much a good bad man he make us laugh together the most i would give this movie a high score if you ask me br br i don't know if the market has any more of the movies with the actors but the main boy is cute the actor with the grand chest has to be not real they doesn't look to real
<START> first i am not really a fan of the whole things eating flesh in disgusting new ways genre of film but i am a bad movie <UNK> so my next door neighbor said he had the worst movie ever this one so we start watching it first and foremost it is recorded on a camcorder sans <UNK> second the voice of the skinny white doctor is dubbed by a large black man third none of the dialogue makes any sense fourth the zombie scenes though unconvincing and <UNK> of poor makeup and <UNK> <UNK> lead me to believe the director and my next door neighbor are in need of psychological help it's funny for about 5 minutes but it gets old fast it's so amateurish it's like watching a poorly dubbed high school video <UNK> with zombies a note to anyone involved with this movie i want the 20 minutes of my life i spent watching this before i fell asleep back
<START> this movie <UNK> child <UNK> from the point of view of a mom lisa <UNK> black who acts like a man would in an action thriller unlike other movies where the focus is on the police here the mom is tracking down her ex husband who kidnapped their son she gets help from her lawyer who eventually falls in love with her br br before finally catching up with her son a lot of bizarre things happen the mom tries to take a child that looks like her son from a local children's play at a community theater she gets caught and then realizes it is not her child that alone would have gotten most people put into the mental ward or a few months in jail waiting for trial however in this movie the mom is release after a couple of hours because the <UNK> parents feel sorry for her a little while later mom breaks into her mother in <UNK> house and then the police arrive and they have their guns aimed at her but they let her run away because they recognize her and feel sorry for her br br at another point in the story they have found the child but when the police arrive to search the house it turns out they left out the back door and got into the river on a <UNK> that apparently the dad kept around just for such an <UNK> escape the mom gets someone to lend her a raft and even though it must have taken some time in a real world she and the lawyer boyfriend and the police catch up to the other raft pretty fast and it is upside down in the water by <UNK> instead of getting out of the raft to search for the dad on the land mom <UNK> he drowned the boy and she jumps into the water when she sees his life jacket of course she cannot swim and sinks like a rock the lawyer saves her but they miss a chance to run after the dad at one point the mom is told her son died at a clinic in mexico on and on it goes and where it stops nobody knows in some ways this movie really exploits child <UNK> and it is not very positive on the other hand seeing a woman do all the crazy things that men do in these kind of movies was fun or funny
<START> the plot has already been described by other reviewers so i will simply add that my reason for wanting to see this film was to see <UNK> drake in all her <UNK> glory br br miss drake has to be one of the <UNK> <UNK> examples of posh <UNK> to have been committed to celluloid of her era and <UNK> only the equally exquisite jane <UNK> comes close what was it about actresses with musical brothers nick drake and peter <UNK> for those who like me have admired <UNK> her scenes in this movie will not disappoint she has a magnificent figure and none of it is left to the imagination here br br as a whole the movie is very poor and being of its time very cheaply made the song that covers the opening credits seems to go on forever and is appalling
<START> reign over me titled after the who song is a movie that is sure to bring a tear to almost everyone's eye it was a moving story of a guy sandler that lost his family in the 9 11 world trade center attacks years later he runs into an old college roommate cheadle that he doesn't even recognize due to the post dramatic stress <UNK> by the loss of his family the two <UNK> their old friendship and <UNK> character johnson realizes that he must get <UNK> character <UNK> some help before it's too late br br this was the first movie that has made me cry in a long time it's completely worth watching and after seeing it i'm positive the viewer will appreciate his or her family much more
<START> this is without doubt my favourite le <UNK> novel and it is transformed to the silver screen with all the love and care one could wish for i read a review on this site that seems to find the characters <UNK> but i believe this misses the point all le <UNK> stories are essentially love stories and this is no exception it is an accurate reflection of the period in which it is set betrayal is the key by everybody for the good of nobody <UNK> upbringing is so close to my own that i find it chilling watching peter <UNK> is in his finest role and the late <UNK> ray <UNK> is unbelievably good even the smallest roles played by such as andy de la tour tim <UNK> and jack <UNK> are spot on this cast is a theatre <UNK> dream the story should not be spoiled by ill informed description but suffice it to say it relates to a young mans slow but <UNK> destruction and descent into espionage and <UNK> all my <UNK> lie with <UNK> <UNK> and his sole non sexual love for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as wonderful as always his only true friendship but also by definition another in the long line of <UNK> outstanding rent it buy it love it
<START> a great movie lansbury and <UNK> are perfect the songs are wonderful the dances with a particular mention for the <UNK> ballet are gorgeous as for the animated section the match between animals has become an instant classic the climax with the attack of the <UNK> is chilling and fascinating i recommend to see the restored <UNK> minutes version or at least the <UNK> minutes video here in italy we have only the 98 minutes version although the film was presented in its original release at the running of <UNK> minutes if possible watch also the german <UNK> it was generated from the 98 minutes running but it's missing of every refer to world war ii and of all the scenes between english people and their nazi <UNK>
<START> made in 1946 and released in 1948 the lady and shanghai was one of the big films made by welles after returning from relative <UNK> for making citizen kane dark brooding and expressing some early cold war paranoia this film stands tall as a film noir crime film the cinematography of this film is filled with welles' characteristic quirks of odd angles quick cuts long pans and sinister lighting the use of <UNK> street music is a <UNK> to the incredible long opening shot in touch of evil and the mysterious chinese characters and the sequences in <UNK> can only be considered as the inspiration in many ways to roman <UNK> <UNK> unfortunately it is welles' obsession with technical filmmaking that hurts this film in its entirety the plot of this story is often lost behind a sometimes incomprehensible clutter of film techniques br br however despite this criticism the story combined with wonderful performances by welles hayworth and especially glenn <UNK> laughter make this film a joy to watch orson welles pulls off not only the irish <UNK> but the torn identities as the honest but dangerous sailor rita hayworth who was married to welles at the time breaks with her usual roles as a sex <UNK> and takes on a role of real depth and <UNK> finally glenn <UNK> strange and bizarre portrayal or <UNK> <UNK> law partner is nothing short of classic
<START> five year old michael sees his mother getting <UNK> to death by his serial killer father the <UNK> who later commits suicide 20 years later grown mike gordon <UNK> from puppet master 4 and 5 invites seven of his friends to his secluded grandparents home to master their own fears at a halloween night costume party <UNK> a life size wooden doll kept in the attic by the indian <UNK> becomes possessed by the dead father's spirit and kills them off using their <UNK> characters are thrown out a window drowned in a toilet eaten by rats blown up etc <UNK> <UNK> into the dad and a tree walks around and makes stupid <UNK> after finding a girl chopped up and stuffed in a cardboard box the characters remain in the house act cheerful crack jokes and have sex br br the <UNK> design is good and <UNK> <UNK> mrs <UNK> from the original friday the 13th is surprisingly delightful as the grandmother but this thing is even more senseless and confusing than the original and is full of false scares bad acting brain dead characters repeat flashback footage and annoying distorted camera work plus the only two minority characters the indian and a half black girl are the first to die blah
<START> i was amazed at the <UNK> made in an animated film if you sit close to the screen you will see the detail in the grass and surface <UNK> the detail colors and <UNK> are at least an order of <UNK> better than toy story how they were able to pull off the <UNK> i will never know i do hope that pixar will provide a documentary on how the film was produced so i can find out how all this was accomplished based on this film i think animated films of the future will be judged on the basis of this film
<START> ok so it borrows a little from it's a wonderful life but that was <UNK> years prior to this film so why not a new attempt belushi is having a rotten <UNK> birthday he didn't get his <UNK> his coffee and has lost his job the <UNK> is when his self described big blue piece of sh car breaks down at the end of the day he heads into an empty bar to call for a <UNK> while waiting he's recognized by the bartender caine as the kid who lost the town's championship baseball game 20 years earlier this gets him to thinking how life would've been if he had won the game he finds out when <UNK> to him caine serves up a motion <UNK> in a glass that gives him a mansion the prom queen russo as his wife and makes him president of the sporting goods company he's been <UNK> from caine later reveals himself as the one who's responsible for this change but belushi is not entirely on board he never fully <UNK> and in a plot development that doesn't kill the movie but is still odd he tries to court his wife hamilton from his real life who is now married to someone else the good move is that they don't spend too much time on it as basically they rip of ghost with belushi constantly telling hamilton things only she could know it also brings in a hokey dramatic element as two of his lovers <UNK> in the shadows new wife russo and his <UNK> lover cox but the keys to the film are the somewhat lengthy beginning and <UNK> end also good work from the big and recognizable cast as belushi is very likable very attractive ladies chosen and caine is perfectly easy going as the title guy strange that this was <UNK> second film of 1990 dealing with him getting an alternative lifestyle of <UNK> which was found in taking care of business though similar both films are on the same level of laughs provided so check this out for a fun exploration of what if
<START> i understand what this movie was trying to portray how the old are often ignored and treated like a bother which means they end up feeling <UNK> and like their lives are empty br br i do not have a problem with this message but i just feel that it could have been put across in a way that is not so painful to watch i enjoy a good art movie but when a movie becomes too self <UNK> arty as in this case the result is often frustrating including shots of a person <UNK> a <UNK> slowly that take 5 minutes try to make a point but just end up annoying the audience br br the female characters are very weak and you end up wanting to just tell them to pull it together this is a movie you feel you should enjoy or rate highly and certainly has its' merits but i was just too frustrated watching it to ever recommend it to someone else it might have a deeper message than other roger <UNK> movies for example <UNK> <UNK> but at least that was a movie you could enjoy watching
<START> for those who think of dame may witty as the kindly slightly <UNK> old lady from hitchcock's the lady <UNK> this movie requires an <UNK> here she's anything but kindly or <UNK> instead her son george <UNK> is the loony one just don't give him a knife otherwise his eyes light up and no furniture <UNK> in the house is safe now we know what he has in mind for the trapped nina <UNK> if he can just get out from under mother's <UNK> hand br br really tight little woman in danger film that keeps the suspense on high throughout the script never <UNK> from <UNK> dilemma she's held prisoner in a big old gothic house on the edge of an angry sea they're going to kill her but why her <UNK> makes no sense the tension <UNK> as she tries one escape <UNK> after another but even strangers seem against her we begin to feel her <UNK> and <UNK> paranoia as the world turns away from her br br director joseph h lewis took a big step toward cult status with this film and understandably so then too watch <UNK> run subtly through a gamut of emotions without once going over the top witty too shines as a really <UNK> <UNK> who knows what she wants and how to get it if she can just keep her <UNK> son in line my one <UNK> is the climax which seems too contrived considering the timing of the events nonetheless it's a good nerve <UNK> way to spend a little over an hour courtesy columbia studios
<START> this film captured my heart from the very beginning when hearing <UNK> jones' first notes or seeing the wonderful color of purple of the flowers in the meadows this is truly a film to cry and die for the whole cast gives the best performance in a film i've seen in years and spielberg has really <UNK> himself <UNK> goldberg margaret <UNK> oprah <UNK> oh lord danny glover and the others all give us their best and you can feel it almost touch it goldberg is <UNK> she gives her that <UNK> and feeling of <UNK> that is needed for the character and we grow with her we grow strong together with her throughout the movie and we triumph with her margaret <UNK> is wonderful as <UNK> <UNK> even when she's at her most arrogant and shows us that <UNK> indeed have souls too the always sympathetic charming danny glover makes a marvellous job at making people hate him and the magnificent music of i'd say sir <UNK> jones adds even more beauty to this splendid film the photography the music the director and the music makes this beautiful <UNK> movie into an experience of life you don't want to miss it <UNK> remember my name
<START> really excellent movie one of the best i've seen touching and simple just like life sometimes you cry sometimes you laugh and it's just beautiful not too much of anything just as it's suppose to be really loved the idea of the movie <UNK> is bad or good all or just people sometimes make mistakes mostly because of <UNK> pressure everyone tries to stay strong and some succeed more than others and the most important thing is that you don't have reasons to get angry you can do it but eventually the anger goes away and then you to need to let love come back in although it's hard there lies the true happiness br br great actors and cast the movie really gets you into the feeling of the movie br br nice nice nice br br i recommend to see it especially if you like to see <UNK> life
<START> i can't say much about this film i think it speaks for itself as do the current ratings on here i rented this about two years ago and i totally <UNK> it i even tried to like it by watching it twice but i just couldn't i can safely say that i have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time ever ever again and i'm not one to trash a movie but i truly believe this was awful it wasn't even funny in the slightest the only bits i enjoyed were the few scenes with christopher walken in them i think this film ruined both jack black and ben stiller for me all i can think of when i see one of their films now a days is this terrible movie and it reminds me not to waste my money amy <UNK> is so very annoying too br br overall well i think you get my point the stars are for walken by the way
<START> i found this film to funny from the start john waters use of characters reminded of some of the down to earth characters from fellini films christina <UNK> has once again expanded her abilities in this film if you are looking for a fun movie without preaching i recommend this film
<START> soulless <UNK> of cash cow franchise generic superhero flick cgi showcase <UNK> <UNK> a series of improbable events <UNK> <UNK> of mutant fight scenes strung together by inane exposition <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> i'm not expecting shakespeare here but the cliché per minute <UNK> was off the <UNK> primal scream while looking <UNK> and <UNK> over murdered girlfriend <UNK> military commander predictable double crosses revenge sought for <UNK> lover <UNK> memories evil character discovering morality at last minute misguided failures to <UNK> <UNK> after <UNK> them in <UNK> lover not really dead lover actually acting as spy for hero's arch nemesis girlfriend spy actually falls for protagonist good people work for antagonist in order to save kidnapped family members evil mastermind fails to honor promises to reluctant employees kindly old couple care for weary hero and get murdered for their troubles certain deaths <UNK> as third parties arrive on scene before coup de grace hero reluctantly joining secret government agency <UNK> of elite squad in protest over slaughter of <UNK> scientists unable to control <UNK> killing machine of their own creation outdated but lovable government <UNK> <UNK> kills off better designed but heartless <UNK> hero <UNK> away from wreck and casually lights a trail of <UNK> behind him after everyone has given up <UNK> heart <UNK> picks up a pulse evil mastermind explains plans to hero he no longer sees as a threat hero refuses to kill defeated <UNK> because he's better than that transparent comic relief character makes hilarious <UNK> and offbeat comments cheerful psychopath <UNK> in random murderous <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> one another through a series of walls and other physical <UNK> that would kill a mere mortal man <UNK> dozens of gun wielding enemies with nothing but <UNK> <UNK> common sense and the laws of physics <UNK> and chemistry <UNK> abandoned antagonist using loved one's murder as justification for misguided <UNK> br br i could go on but this is just <UNK> if you're over the age of twelve and not living in mom's basement there's probably nothing here for you <UNK> enough it's not too far off of par for superhero movies so <UNK> all i've written if you can't get enough of the genre
<START> well i don't know what people saw in this movie i don't know br br i saw this movie yesterday and i got a severe headache other than few good dialog there is nothing in this movie br br the big b <UNK> now is preaching to fall in love with girls of half of you age br br i didn't like the movie at all i wanted to give 1 rating but giving 3 as br br i like the role of the small girl who is called sexy by <UNK> my word dont watch br br save your self <UNK> watch this movie br br save time and money
<START> listen i don't care what anybody says as cypher is nothing less than a 5 star movie cypher is not i repeat not a b movie cypher is an absolute masterpiece suffice it to say i am a <UNK> of the world's finest spy films and this film is nothing less than top flight i cannot <UNK> how phenomenal this movie is cypher is one of the best spy movies ever conceived and ever made the technology in this movie is over the horizon of <UNK> in fact i must admit that cypher completely surprised the hell out of me in fact i've recommended this movie to my colleagues more than any other movie other critics of whom some <UNK> the movie have no idea as to what the hell they're talking about don't listen to the <UNK> and actually for the most part reviews of cypher have been largely positive and it should be noted that <UNK> is not only a good movie but it is also a fantastic movie cypher is the kind of movie that's so advanced and so <UNK> crafted that it's over the heads of most critics and all the <UNK> there is nothing wrong with or cheap about cypher whatsoever again the cinematography the backdrops the technology the storyline and the acting are all 100 world class top notch naturally i won't give anything away this is not a spoiler and though it is the <UNK> of some critics that cypher should have been in movie theaters i believe quite the opposite cypher is a movie that seems to have been just right for dvd release only and not in a bad way cypher has got to be the greatest underground spy flick ever to hit the shelves blade runner 1984 brave new world total recall <UNK> run jason bourne and <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> look out cypher equally earns the distinction of being placed in the <UNK> <UNK> research 5 star eternal spy movie hall of fame cypher is <UNK> at it's absolute best hands down and hats off nothing is what it seems and truth is stranger than fiction the future is now
<START> one of the most popular <UNK> at my local video store is not <UNK> or the <UNK> but a 2005 documentary about jesus christ called the god who wasn't there by director brian <UNK> an ex christian <UNK> <UNK> in his <UNK> minute documentary <UNK> that jesus was not a historical figure but a legend based solely on <UNK> traditions using interviews with authors <UNK> and historians to <UNK> the long held christian belief that jesus the son of god lived among men was <UNK> and was <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the christ story with those of cult figures <UNK> and <UNK> in egypt <UNK> and <UNK> in greek mythology and roman mystery <UNK> such as <UNK> and finds many surprising similarities br br in addition to his evidence about <UNK> <UNK> he also states that the earliest sources for the christ story the four <UNK> were written forty or fifty years after the date given for <UNK> <UNK> and that the letters of st paul show little evidence of jesus being a flesh and blood figure <UNK> unfortunately however is not out to conduct a solid investigation of the truth about <UNK> life but to use the subject only as a point of departure for a full <UNK> attack on christianity and all religion most of the interviews are with those <UNK> <UNK> with the director including <UNK> <UNK> such as <UNK> richard <UNK> and author sam price the only christians interviewed are those on the <UNK> such as scott butcher the creator of the website rapture letters com and ronald <UNK> principal of the <UNK> village christian school which <UNK> attended as a boy br br like michael moore's interview of charlton heston in <UNK> for <UNK> his interview with <UNK> is so <UNK> that <UNK> walks out in the middle in a sarcastic tone <UNK> tells us how wrong christianity was wrong about the sun revolving around the earth then points to atrocities committed in the name of christianity such as those by cult leader charles <UNK> who killed 11 people and <UNK> <UNK> who cut her <UNK> arm off for god he also lifts a statement from a book by <UNK> and <UNK> that says that christians look forward to the day when all non christians are thrown into a lake of fire howling and <UNK> to further turn us against christianity <UNK> shows us extended clips from mel <UNK> the passion of the christ <UNK> in minute detail each scene of violence and torture what could have been a serious discussion on a very interesting subject eventually becomes a childish rant and a <UNK> against all religion in the process of <UNK> those who used christianity to commit <UNK> acts he ignores such people as <UNK> muriel lester a famous christian <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> indian of <UNK> who helped found the revolutionary christians and received the <UNK> peace prize in recognition of her work for social justice and mother <UNK> whose work was about respect for each <UNK> worth and dignity br br his most telling argument is his comparison of christian <UNK> with the <UNK> <UNK> and he makes some good points yet <UNK> does not tell us that while some aspects of these <UNK> may resemble christian <UNK> there are no <UNK> or source <UNK> for these <UNK> before <UNK> long after the new testament also it is important to note one major difference the immediate goal of the <UNK> was a mystical experience that led them to feel they had achieved union with their god this is <UNK> to christianity which believes that a church <UNK> including priests and <UNK> all the way up to the <UNK> are required to interpret god's will to mankind br br although i am not a christian and have some doubts about whether or not jesus christ was in fact a historical figure the truth is that in the long scheme of things it may not matter what matters is that a message was introduced to mankind and spread around the world that contributed to <UNK> spiritual evolution regardless of the <UNK> and crimes later committed in its name and there were many christianity as conceived was a <UNK> of compassion and love and a moral and <UNK> code that <UNK> respect for our fellow man br br while i applaud the fact that the film was made and that a taboo topic was discussed what is sorely needed is not another <UNK> attempt to use religion as a field of combat but to see it as a common thread that can bring the world's people together while there is room for debate and discussion on religious subjects in the words of annie <UNK> spiritual truths are best seen in the clear air of <UNK> and mutual respect the god who wasn't there is recommended only for those whose idea of a good time is to trash the religion of others
<START> <UNK> <UNK> was one of the few women to break through the directorial glass ceiling in hollywood under the studio system not surprisingly she also <UNK> <UNK> feminist themes that when touched at all were approached in so <UNK> a manner that it was seldom quite clear what was being talked about in outrage she treats rape and its aftermath and though throughout the short movie it's referred to as criminal assault ' she leaves for once no doubt about what happened br br <UNK> powers in her official debut plays a secretary <UNK> at a big industrial plant she lives with her parents but is engaged to a <UNK> guy robert clarke who just got a raise and now makes 90 a week leaving the plant after working late one night she finds herself being stalked in the ensuing scene  the best in the movie  she tries to escape her <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK> of buildings and <UNK> but fails br br when she returns home <UNK> and in shock the police can't get much out of her she claims she never saw her <UNK> who <UNK> a <UNK> truck outside the factory trying to pretend that nothing happened she returns to her job but falls apart thinking that everybody is staring at her judging her she goes into a <UNK> state running away to los angeles on a bus but stumbling off at a rest stop br br waking up in a strange ranch house she learns that she's been rescued by <UNK> andrews a young minister in a california <UNK> town she lies about her identity and takes a job <UNK> <UNK> the two fall vaguely in love but it's clear to andrews that powers is keeping dire secrets when at a company <UNK> she <UNK> a <UNK> and cracks the skull of jerry paris who was trying to steal a kiss the truth about her past comes out br br it was a courageous movie to come out in 1950 and that may explain and excuse some of its shortcomings <UNK> never <UNK> the <UNK> of the early assault scene and the movie wanders off into the <UNK> and sentimental ending up talky and <UNK> yes <UNK> had important information to <UNK> but she didn't trust the narrative to speak for itself her cast pleasant but bland and generic weren't much help either <UNK> to melodramatic <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> but outrage was a breakthrough blazing a trail for later <UNK> on what the crime of rape really is and what it really means to its victims
<START> i can't believe anyone liked this movie i've seen a lot of low budget indie films but this one absolutely sucked low budget doesn't mean the movie has to be demented horror doesn't mean the movie has to be demented there was nothing scary about this movie at all it was just a gore fest and a particularly disturbing one at that the acting was average considering they were all <UNK> of actors but the story was pathetic the dialog was pathetic the movie tries to come off as artistic or something this is not one of those really great indie films that cost only thousands of dollars to make but are incredibly well done this was nothing more than an excuse for some extremely sick people to put their perverse <UNK> on film other reviews here also said that the soundtrack sucked that's because most of it was written by the same person and some of the songs were written by one of the writers of the movie there were no redeeming qualities to this movie at all a complete waste of my time and money
<START> a quiet sweet and <UNK> nostalgic movie on how it is to be confronted with old friends and surroundings from your youth with all that memories and the problems and <UNK> of the present with you a movie that makes you feel good all the ingredients are here old <UNK> rivalry friendship and loyalty <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and all the other fun stuff that we all remember from our summer camps all the characters get the opportunity for a week to experience this again as the old camp leader now is <UNK> and want to meet the children from the golden years of the camp all of them are now in their thirties and in the middle of their careers
<START> already his first claim that desires are always artificial is totally <UNK> br br when a <UNK> witness reject gets his own documentary on movies  or anything for that matter it's time for anyone to get their own although far far more intelligent than say paris hilton i know not too difficult <UNK> mouth <UNK> just as much <UNK> as hers just a different kind he combines the worst from both his professional worlds <UNK> and philosophy both fields are notorious for conveniently offering the expert b <UNK> <UNK> plenty of <UNK> to create <UNK> theories to rant without a beginning or

idea to connect them with three levels of human consciousness the id the ego and the super ego i'm kind of surprised he didn't play a clip from <UNK> and make an <UNK> between the seven <UNK> and the seven levels of <UNK> <UNK> hell it's like the premise of <UNK> the number 23 play with numbers long enough and you can come up with any kind of <UNK> theory you want even <UNK> ancient <UNK> with princess <UNK> death br br however there is an entertainment element to <UNK> watching a raving lunatic sweat like a <UNK> while <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> masked as intellectual analysis can be quite a lot of fun why watch <UNK> nest or any other <UNK> drama when you can have zizek for more than 2 hours it's like watching an amusing train wreck admittedly he is almost funny on one or two occasions br br i have always been <UNK> by people who desperately try to elevate movie making into an <UNK> intellectual social science giving idiotic movies like birds this much thought hence this much credit probably has its fat creator laughing in his grave the raw truth is that the vast majority of movies have zero intellectual value and the few ones that do have some intelligence don't require a shrink turned <UNK> to draw one a map to understand them  unless one is a complete idiot zizek sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal movies <UNK> drugs must be rather popular and cheap in <UNK> these days br br when zizek showed the <UNK> hole in the psycho shower scene i thought he was going to say something about <UNK> black holes how they drain the life out of stars just as the <UNK> hole sucks in janet <UNK> blood or perhaps he could have said how the hole represents <UNK> <UNK> with the blood flowing into it instead of out as in <UNK> this representing some kind of clever <UNK> irony speaking of which the real irony is that if hitchcock had really put that much thought into every scene and the script his movies wouldn't have been the illogical far fetched crap that they often are the point of these <UNK> hole <UNK> was to show just how easy it is to <UNK> about hidden deep meanings and when you add <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from philosophy and psychology <UNK> these

things here one of the most absurd ideas being when he associates anthony <UNK> cleaning of the <UNK> bathroom with the satisfaction of work of a job well done don't laugh neither hitchcock nor the writer of psycho could have ever even vaguely entertained this notion that <UNK> might be enjoying a job well done the cleaning of a blood <UNK> toilet while they were <UNK> directing that scene talk

<START> i'm not sure if users ought to be allowed to review films after only sitting through half but i'm afraid i just couldn't stand another minute br br if this <UNK> excuse for a film doesn't have the late great <UNK> spinning like a wheel in his grave then i doubt anything will br br the excellent review above <UNK> a film for parsons <UNK> sums up most of my feelings how dare a second rate director and writer attempt something to which they're so clearly incapable of delivering what were they thinking where to start br br the script i thought i'd be getting a slice of bittersweet <UNK> what i got was poorly executed slapstick with no cliché left <UNK> stupid <UNK> check stupid fat cop check awful plot <UNK> check embarrassingly written female characters double check total disregard for the story which you're trying to portray check br br after a while you realize that what you're watching is a soap and not a very well written one at that scene with <UNK> scene with ex girlfriend scene with <UNK> which hasn't moved on much scene with ex girlfriend which was a bit like the last one and so on br br the direction my friends and i decided after some consideration that watching this was like watching a bad episode of <UNK> or maybe a particularly poor dukes of hazzard that's how bad the direction was terrible jump cuts awful camera work clunky ins and outs to scenes god it was <UNK> and then i discovered the director was an <UNK> who's most noteworthy recent work is a really lousy bbc sunday night drama called <UNK> of the <UNK> trust me it's lowest common <UNK> tv and then it all made sense br br the acting are we now so critical that when some random guy from the tv decides to give acting a go if he's not so bad he stinks we applaud his efforts <UNK> just about manages to get through every scene poor christina a has no such luck her performance is a car crash though what you do with those lines i don't know the <UNK> in the <UNK> oh dear oh dear oh dear have we not moved on since cheech and chong br br i could go on but i think you get my drift what i would say is that as other reviews have mentioned no one on this film clearly gives a flying damn for the <UNK> the flying <UNK> brothers or <UNK> solo work they knew nothing about the american road movie and they certainly give a damn about trying to do anything with an admittedly decent story from rock mythology this film was shallow failed to explore anything and was jaw <UNK> unfunny from beginning to oh wait i didn't quite make the end and i suggest you stay away too
<START> of watching this as a child although i'll probably find it god awful now it was kind of spooky stuff as i was only seven or so i also recall working on a saturday afternoon puzzle while watching it so i wasn't really paying much attention however the scene with the rolling <UNK> has been burnt into my mind ever since i've asked numerous people if they've seen this flick but to no <UNK> 12 years ago one person mentioned that possibly he had seen it but he thought it merely a dream a <UNK> <UNK> like wind it's no dream my friend no dreaming now again i haven't seen it since then but i can't wait to find a copy and stuff it into my vcr anything that can stay <UNK> in my <UNK> eye for 23 years deserves a <UNK>
<START> there i was sitting alone in my flat on a saturday night with the choice of watching citizen x or the <UNK> song contest and for the benefit of americans reading this i'll explain that <UNK> is an <UNK> event where musicians from countries all over europe and asia minor have a song contest at the end of the contest countries vote to see what the best song was it's a contest that is even less exciting than it sounds and it may not come as a shock when i say that singing and <UNK> isn't of the <UNK> of lennon and <UNK> and i should correct something in the first sentence of this review because the word choice is misleading because being a music lover i wasn't going to watch <UNK> under any <UNK> br br so i sat down as the credits rolled for citizen x expecting a run of mill serial killer <UNK> but i'd be misleading everyone calling it that it's obvious within the first 10 minutes of citizen x <UNK> what the film does is point out the failures of communism a serial killer <UNK> this is the soviet union serial killers can only exist in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> systems this <UNK> attitude goes far beyond denial there's a scene where an undercover cop sits in a <UNK> train station keeping an eye out for potential suspects whilst wearing his police jacket because it's the only warm coat he's got and of course all suspects who are members of the communist party are released without <UNK> something which will affect the final death <UNK> all this is very well done as we are shown that it's the communist party system that's on trial but about two thirds of the way through citizen x we find ourselves in 1990 as communism is on its last legs and <UNK> to the police investigation have taken place it's at this point that the film becomes rather uninteresting due to a lack of political subtext and the film <UNK> into an average <UNK> film but don't let that put you off citizen x is an intelligent thriller well played by the cast especially donald sutherland as a <UNK> police chief br br strangely enough a few years ago i read something written by the famous <UNK> colin wilson in which he said something along the lines that serial killers let themselves get caught so that they will be the center of attention in the media spotlight and i found myself almost <UNK> the party <UNK> denying there could be a serial killer in the soviet union after all media is controlled by the party and anyone who's old enough to have listened to radio <UNK> or read english <UNK> of <UNK> will know that the <UNK> only reported news stories like <UNK> <UNK> coal production and thank you letters from afghanistan cuba etc for soviet assistance the concept of becoming a serial killer in a communist system is illogical but i guess if a tree falls in a remote <UNK> forest it will still make a sound even though no one is around to hear it
<START> i don't know who to blame the <UNK> writers or the clueless director it seemed to be one of those movies where so much was paid to the stars angie charlie denise <UNK> and jon that there wasn't enough left to really make a movie this could have been very entertaining but there was a <UNK> of <UNK> even <UNK> that hung over each scene since it got an r rating anyway why was the <UNK> bubble bath scene shot with a 70 year old woman and not angie <UNK> why does sheen <UNK> through potentially hot relationships with two of the most beautiful and sexy actresses in the world if they were only looking for laughs why not cast whoopi goldberg and judy <UNK> instead this was so predictable i was surprised to find that the director wasn't a five year old what a waste not just for the viewers but for the actors as well
<START> the bourne ultimatum 2007 review after a thrilling set of two we get the final installment here's my take br br the bourne ultimatum has it all we have jason bourne matt damon on the <UNK> of the ones who know everything he has been running for too long this time it ends br br the bourne ultimatum has a great plot awesome writing fantastic direction suspense and some of the best action of the summer matt damon delivers possibly his best performance to date he has the conviction and <UNK> desire of the troubled assassin br br there are some intelligent humor here and some fine suspense the reactions to certain events will have you either laughing in a good way or cheering on or both i heard a lot of intelligent laughter in the theater and lots of <UNK> the audience was loving it br br the bourne ultimatum delivers all in a nicely gift wrapped package all of the goods and then some this is in my opinion the best movie this summer br br the last word excellent conclusion the best of the trilogy this is how summer movie thrillers should be done i love the bourne trilogy
<START> first let me <UNK> this post by saying that i am a fan of the original star wars movies i don't read the books play the games wear the underwear or eat the <UNK> if there is one i am simply a fan of the films br br with that being said i struggle to see how people are giving this movie such high praise taking this movie by itself and not comparing it to it's terrible predecessors <UNK> 1 2 i don't understand how you can say this is an amazing movie for all of the terrible shortcomings in the script cheesy dialogue contrived scenes ie <UNK> suddenly being a <UNK> and long cgi intense chase scenes that have little human touch horrible acting and noted plot holes how is this good there was no real internal dilemma within <UNK> it just seemed like a switch was <UNK> and he was evil all of a sudden i was not interested in the movie until the last 20 minutes or so which by the way was ruined by the <UNK> frankenstein scene when you <UNK> the screen with intensely amazing cgi effects and fill in the gaps with absolutely atrocious one liners when more could have and should have been said this is not a great movie for a film with such a dark tone there was too much <UNK> in the speech of all characters br br i close with a question from the beginning to the end of the film was there really a sense of urgency and importance for what was actually about to take place
<START> wow i watched the trailer for this one and though <UNK> this one is not for <UNK> i watched my husband and our friend's faces during the trailer and knew this was a <UNK> <UNK> i mean <UNK> a bunch of chick <UNK> that dance another <UNK> br br then i started watching it it didn't look all that bad so i carried on watching i watched it right to the end what an awesome movie if anything this is a chick flick these girls have attitude it is really a feel good movie and a bit of a love story really leaves you with a nice feeling br br basically the story of a small town girl making it big in the city after going through the usual big city c p there have been a couple of these it is almost a new urban legend but it also makes you think of your life and what you have achieved well me anyway i think it is because the whole working in a bar scenario is very familiar not just for me but for many people i know don't trust the trailers for this one it is aimed at bringing the men in
<START> i'm not much of an expert on acting or other movie details but this movie just hit me deep i don't think i'll ever forget it one scene especially i think that anybody who has seen the film will know of which one i am speaking is <UNK> on my brain br br i also watched the similar movie <UNK> 4 ever as referred to by a previous <UNK> it was also very moving but not quite as straight to the point and brutal if you are sensitive at all either will bring tears to your eyes but <UNK> do <UNK> angels of the sun may stay with you forever br br this is very depressing subject matter but i think no i hope that the film succeeds in bringing more attention to it br br more people need to see this film
<START> it was a <UNK> interesting experience for some reason the greatest scientific mind of the 20th century had never been the central figure in a movie the closest i can think of as films with einstein in them are <UNK> for <UNK> where like a <UNK> ex ma china the great man is heard <UNK> a point on a radio <UNK> show so that ronald colman is proved to have given the correct answer after all and in <UNK> where the great albert is one of a dozen leading <UNK> and scientists who are drugged with <UNK> by the villain intent on stealing some machines of theirs it is notable that in those two cases and in iq we are dealing with comedies so far nobody has tried to do a serious film about the life of einstein like john <UNK> attempt to do one on <UNK> with <UNK> cliff i guess it is just too hard to get the world of <UNK> <UNK> or the secrets of <UNK> <UNK> field theory into exciting dialog but then only three years ago russell <UNK> and christopher plummer did a beautiful mind maybe nobody really has tried br br subsequently after writing this i remembered the successful comedy young einstein with <UNK> serious about ten years ago but that is an exception and it was a spoof br br the other surprise was the actor playing the great albert it was walter matthau here taking time away from the series of films he did with jack lemmon in that last decade of their careers matthau was a highly capable and gifted character actor in both comedy and drama but normally his comic <UNK> were <UNK> of his <UNK> willie <UNK> from the fortune cookie they were <UNK> and <UNK> later they would shed their criminal <UNK> because we had grown to like them but they remained grumpy types but his albert einstein happens to be genuinely sweet more like his <UNK> than like willie clarke br br he plays albert as good old uncle albert it seems that <UNK> einstein is living in <UNK> with his niece catherine <UNK> meg ryan and she is seeing a <UNK> professor named james <UNK> stephen <UNK> but <UNK> car needs <UNK> and they take it to the auto shop where ed <UNK> tim robbins works robbins falls for ryan who is attracted to him but finds that he lacks the mental equipment that she <UNK> good old uncle albert aided by his three friends lou <UNK> joseph <UNK> and gene <UNK> decide to give their assistance to robbins and make him an apparently <UNK> physics genius this will open the doors of romance between him and ryan provided ryan is impressed and <UNK> does not spoil things as he hopes to do br br the atmosphere is sweet as when matthau and his <UNK> <UNK> up a super physics <UNK> that they help robbins cheat on by switching the positions of their bodies the plot eventually leads to the outright lie that the brilliant robbins has constructed an atomic powered rocket ship which brings in the interests of the nation in the figure of president <UNK> <UNK> curtis br br it was a charming comedy and an interesting stretch for matthau in that he was not as hyper as normal but far more subdued
<START> honestly my expectations for little bush were low i was expecting a little cartoon series with lots of fun but <UNK> and overdone bush jokes apparently i should have <UNK> my expectations even more br br the writing was absolutely pathetic aside from the <UNK> chicken eating joke and some <UNK> little <UNK> it was really boring and unfunny br br the animation was about as sophisticated as a thirteen year <UNK> flash project it's <UNK> that they used <UNK> product for this because it's capable of so much more br br i don't like bush that much and i enjoy a bush joke as much as the next guy but this was just a half hour <UNK> at the president with several painfully un funny moments <UNK> parker and matt stone did so much more with that's my bush br br do yourself a favor skip <UNK> bush and go buy a copy of the short lived comedy that's my bush you'll thank me
<START> i wish i had my rental money back from this piece of trash so i could <UNK> it to the home for aged actors total rubbish five people watched this movie at the same time and there wasn't one single laugh to be heard lots of <UNK> though <UNK> a beautiful woman and she was the best thing to look at in the entire so called comedic movie
<START> words can't describe how utterly stupid this story and therefore bad this movie is basinger del toro what were you thinking so there's a mall and its parking space is totally full <UNK> character goes in to buy a cup of tea and some <UNK> paper br br when she comes out the whole place is so empty that nobody hears two <UNK> fired nearby even though she lives there when she drives away from the baddies she goes to the most remote and <UNK> place possible instead of the nearest police station or at least a crowded place come on i won't even go into the infamous red <UNK> since other people have done that before let alone how she kills the moronic thugs one by one br br this is so stupid without the least bit of logic i can only warn you watching it it's a total waste of time honestly
<START> a bit slow and boring the tale of an old man and his wife living a <UNK> building and <UNK> with a fixed cast of characters like the <UNK> the brothers sitting on the <UNK> the wealthy <UNK> smoking man the photography of the river is marvelous as is the interior period decoration if you like decoration of banana republic stores this is a must
<START> this is the kind of film that if it were made today it would probably star sandra <UNK> and hugh grant actually now that i think about it this one is quite <UNK> to be remade one day it's pleasant but with no depth whatsoever it suffers from the almost fatal <UNK> of james stewart in a role he is about 20 years too old for and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful kim novak ernie <UNK> in the small supporting role of an aspiring writer is the only actor in the film whose performance approaches what you might call wit 1 2
<START> i watched this last night on tv hbo i have to admit that the tension in this movie was <UNK> by most other <UNK> era movies i loved the way chip would be all calm one moment and then violent the very next moment it was classic <UNK> yes the <UNK> the <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> cops it has it all this movie delivered all the goods to me i especially loved the way they mixed communism into the plot very common for this era of movie very daring also since <UNK> was popular in those days i rate this movie one of the best i have seen in the <UNK> genre
<START> i just read a review defending this film because it had a low budget now my take on things br br the cgi monsters was reasonable well animated but was <UNK> in the worst possible way the fight scenes weren't even fights it was just one shot of an actor then one shot of monster with very interaction at all when the monster did interact it looked like it was done in <UNK> pro in my opinion if you have a low budget you should use models and puppets they may not look as fancy but at least they interact just look at peter <UNK> early films br br as for the acting beowulf did an descent job but the rest of the cast were either not trying or they forgot where they where br br the script seemed confused to me one minute they would be talking as if it were a modern day setting the next you get drama club shakespeare speech i'm not say it should be all <UNK> and <UNK> it <UNK> but you need to find a cohesive balance so the lines sound like they come from the same person br br i did notice one part near the start when beowulf was <UNK> the old testament which would have been find had he not spent the rest of the films talking about the gods and <UNK> br br in short this film is a very slightly polished turd but a turn none the less
<START> although too young to remember the first showing of the series being just a baby i later caught repeats of it on television in the late 80's just when i was getting interested in the war and all of its aspects it was my grandfather who first showed me the series and also gave me my first interests relating tales of his time in the royal navy at <UNK> and later in the pacific since then i have <UNK> many books and seen many television series about the world war two era with mixed opinions the british television stations are generally very good at producing these as the world at war can easily <UNK> with many gems made by both the bbc and independent companies i strongly recommend such titles as the nazis a warning from history <UNK> and the bbc series about <UNK> britain at war in colour with its companion series japan germany and america are of a very high standard the world at war is by far the best and despite its age never fails to deliver there will always be new revelations about the war that will keep <UNK> up that obviously aren't included in the series and of course world war two took place over such a large <UNK> that to produce a series with every detail would take more time and money then any other even if such an <UNK> was even possible what i feel i must say to those who <UNK> that it does not include everything is that the world at war can't physically do that as a series but it sure as heck can <UNK> you to do further research and make it enjoyable that certainly worked for me i now have a very <UNK> library of books videos dvds and tapes and <UNK> recommend to anyone with even a passing interest the series was so well made that they'd find it hard not to agree that it is quality programming and highly informative
<START> i've rarely been as annoyed by a leading performance as i was by ali <UNK> in this movie god is she <UNK> or what she says everything in the same tone and is horrible so horrible in fact that by contrast ryan <UNK> is brilliant br br there is not much of a story he's rich she's wooden they both have to sacrifice a lot for love his father is <UNK> jackson hers is called by his first name in case you didn't notice the difference in the two of them that they <UNK> in the name of love br br the oscar nominations for this movie indicate it had to have been a bad year john <UNK> is fine as <UNK> father but a supporting nomination at least ali didn't win br br i still think <UNK> ross should have played jennifer but then again if it were up to me <UNK> ross would have been in a lot more movies she's certainly a better actress than <UNK> br br i didn't even cry when she got sick never <UNK> to me to even feel sad br br it was nice to see tommy lee jones looking like he was about 15 and the score is good but this one is so old by now it has a beard a mile long and the sin of that is its not that old but it feels it
<START> first of all i ain't american or middle eastern second of all i don't have a religion the closest thing to a religion i have are sports and movies <UNK> i believe i would be best served to supply an opinion of <UNK> and free from bias br br most of these short films are an utter disgrace this dreadful event should be used to <UNK> all those innocent people whom were murdered by some <UNK> and <UNK> morons instead most of what i saw in these short films were <UNK> attempts to score varied political points examples br br 1 ken <UNK> segment sure we are all sad that this dude had a hard life in his country but what has that got to do with the innocent victims of 2001 two <UNK> don't make a right whatever this film should have a <UNK> for those who have trouble listening to a partially incoherent <UNK> english accent br br 2 most disturbing is <UNK> <UNK> segment it is obvious that he has trouble with logic he justified the murders due to america being a democracy and because some americans voted the politicians in power then all americans in the end are responsible for the actions and decisions made by their leaders on the middle east <UNK> is this guy for real some americans don't even vote some americans don't even know where the middle east is some don't even know what religion is <UNK> there and majority don't know the real political issues that are played behind the scenes mr <UNK> the reason why we have all these problems in the world is because there are too many people with your kind of logic the innocent victims in the twin towers came from around the world the murdered <UNK> <UNK> office workers by <UNK> and flight passengers have nothing to do with politics and yet we are not allowed to go about our lives because some people think everyone has to choose a side or a religion we are perceived as fair game for the extreme politics br br 3 the israeli segment showed their own bombed victims another filmmaker using this event to push their own political agenda sometimes it is not about you some people always think about the me me me sometimes it is about other people br br 4 <UNK> <UNK> segment is a joke and another political point <UNK> they obviously want money from the international community by <UNK> their poverty blah blah blah br br this movie <UNK> the memory of <UNK> <UNK> 2001 victims br br the best thing for it is the trash can
<START> this movie is probably for you it had an overall <UNK> quality from the music to the beautiful photography and listening to the often cliché things about life that andy goldsworthy would say as he worked or in between shots if you're familiar with <UNK> that is the sort of the sense i got out of this film the <UNK> of life the beauty of nature the <UNK> of all things etc however what i did not understand confused and ultimately forced me to leave without finishing i saw over an hour of it was the <UNK> of the whole thing you only find out bits and pieces of why he's <UNK> and how he can even afford to live off of this kind of work the art work comes alive but all his talking with no conclusions leads to dead ends
<START> this 1984 version of the <UNK> classic a christmas carol ' directed by clive <UNK> stars george c scott as <UNK> scrooge by this time around the challenge for the filmmaker was to take such familiar material and make it seem fresh and new again and happily to say with this film <UNK> not only met the challenge but <UNK> any expectations anyone might have had for it he tells the story with <UNK> and an eye to detail and <UNK> performances from his actors that are nothing less than <UNK> especially scott one could argue that the definitive portrayal of scrooge one of the best known characters in literary fiction ever was created by <UNK> <UNK> in the 1951 film but i think with his performance here scott has now achieved that distinction there is such a <UNK> and honesty in his scrooge that it becomes difficult to even consider anyone else in the role once you've seen scott do it simply put he is scrooge and what a tribute it is to such a gifted actor to be able to take such a well known figure and make it so uniquely his own is quite <UNK> it is truly a joy to see an actor <UNK> his trade so well to be able to make a character so real from every word he <UNK> down to the finest expression of his face and to make it all ring so true it's a study in perfection br br the other members of the cast are splendid as well but then again they have to be in order to maintain the integrity of scott's performance and they do frank <UNK> is the ghost of <UNK> <UNK> a notable turn though not as memorable perhaps as the one by alec guinness as <UNK> in the film scrooge ' angela <UNK> is a welcome <UNK> as the spirit of christmas past edward <UNK> grand and <UNK> and altogether convincing as the spirit of christmas present and michael carter grim and menacing as the spirit of christmas yet to come br br david warner hits just the right mark with his bob <UNK> bringing a sincerity to the role that <UNK> up well to the standard of quality set by scott's scrooge and <UNK> york <UNK> just as well as mrs <UNK> the real gem to be found here though is the performance of young anthony <UNK> as tiny tim it's heartfelt without ever becoming <UNK> and simply one of the best interpretations and the most real ever presented on film br br the excellent supporting cast includes roger <UNK> fred <UNK> and also the narrator of the film caroline <UNK> janet <UNK> lucy <UNK> belle michael <UNK> mr <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> fan a flawless presentation this version of a christmas <UNK> sets the standard against which all others must be <UNK> no matter how many versions you may have seen watching this one is like seeing it for the first time ever and forever after whenever you think of scrooge the image your mind will <UNK> up will be that of george c scott a thoroughly entertaining and satisfying experience this film demands a place in the <UNK> schedule of the holiday <UNK> of every home i rate this one 10 10
<START> it's not easy making a movie with 18 different stories in it although 18 different international directors took the challenge not everyone of them is good some of them even boring but in his <UNK> paris je t'aime is breathtaking showing that as love actually put it <UNK> is all <UNK> especially in the city of love here's a <UNK> i'll try to make at as spoiler free as possible of the 18 different stories br br <UNK> kind of a dull opening sequence nothing really special about it a man finds a parking spot and sees a lot of odd couples walking by wondering why he can't find a girl and than suddenly a woman <UNK> next to his car br br <UNK> de <UNK> another dull sequence about three teenage boys who are searching for some <UNK> of <UNK> when suddenly a muslim girl <UNK> right in front of them receiving help from one of the boys really basic but with a sweet heart to it br br les <UNK> this was a huge disappointment although a love story between two boys with an artsy background could have been interesting by the great van <UNK> eventually everything that comes after the monologue by <UNK> is good everything before it is just annoying br br <UNK> an entertaining sequence by the <UNK> brothers <UNK> without even saying one word is mesmerizing and the whole sequence is just hilarious this one kept me hooked until the very end and this one also gets you truly hooked to the movie br br <UNK> du <UNK> a beautiful story too even if the execution is poor the heart is there it's the story of an hispanic woman who drops her child off early in the morning to take care of another suburban baby beautiful br br <UNK> de <UNK> this segment has got to be the strangest and <UNK> from the whole movie some kind of <UNK> salesman arrives in a <UNK> <UNK> place in paris if i understood it correctly the story is about inner beauty but i think i'm wrong br br <UNK> a truly wonderful sequence a man meets with his wife at a restaurant to break up with her so that he can run off with his mistress but the wife has some devastating news pretty basic but truly sad and beautiful place des <UNK> a sad sequence as well juliette <UNK> plays a <UNK> mother one night she wakes up hearing her dead child when she arrives at the location a cowboy tells her she can give one last good bye to her child one of the best segments tour <UNK> two <UNK> who fall in love could have been great but even though it has some nice cinematic tricks the story isn't intriguing and not funny at all br br <UNK> <UNK> a truly original and great sequence one of the best of the movie a young girl and an older man discuss their future and her fear for a certain man <UNK> does a great directing job and the actors are amazing <UNK> des <UNK> <UNK> an american actress <UNK> falls in love with her drug dealer a beautiful segment again with a very sad ending place des <UNK> a woman comes to a homeless man he starts talking romantic to her because she is the love of his life beautiful sad shocking romantic place des <UNK> will make everyone cry br br <UNK> a boring sequence between <UNK> and <UNK> who are looking for new thrills in their relationship very unfunny and <UNK> <UNK> is a let down br br <UNK> de la madeleine bringing some diversity in the movie <UNK> is a relief a young guy wood finds a vampire killing a victim the tourist and the vampire fall in love dark scary and oddly romantic madeleine is superb br br <UNK> <UNK> another let down segment directed by wes craven and with stars as <UNK> and <UNK> it could have been great but <UNK> <UNK> is just ordinary not original at all br br <UNK> saint denis the rumors are true <UNK> short film is beautiful stunning and well done a blind man picks up the phone and hears from his girlfriend portman truly stunning that she breaks up with him he reflects on their relationship br br <UNK> latin even though this segment has been co directed by depardieu and has such stars as rowlands <UNK> and depardieu this segment is a let down too nothing happens lack of chemistry between the actors br br <UNK> <UNK> the last sequence is hilarious and sad at the same time an american tells in her french class about her trip to paris her french is truly terrible but at the end of the segment she realizes that paris is so much more than meets the eye br br with <UNK> on the background paris je t'aime ends in a sweet tone not letting me down at all even though some segments bored the hell out of me the <UNK> of the movie is great a true cinematic experience for young and old paris je t'aime <UNK>
<START> moonstruck is a movie that i liked the first time i watched it i really liked it the second time i loved it the third time now it is one of my all time favorites br br the humor is subtle but really good the film offers a lot of warmth humor the story takes place in a old school italian neighborhood in nyc <UNK> search for love is enjoyable to watch this film is by far the best job nicholas cage has done on film the old man character is fantastic he lights up the screen without saying a word the scene with his dogs howling at the moon was fantastic but perhaps the best character is the one played by olympia dukakis br br the film's climax is a scene where the main characters have it out over a breakfast of <UNK> in the family kitchen exceptional direction and wrap up
<START> this film is actually <UNK> even today given the threat of bio terrorism and the <UNK> of <UNK> west <UNK> virus and <UNK> as a thriller the tension is fairly intense richard widmark and paul douglas are more than <UNK> in their roles the domestic scenes between widmark and his wife provide a nice <UNK> to the main plot the actor in this film who most left his mark is jack palance his <UNK> defined features and seemingly <UNK> exterior always <UNK> way to reveal the <UNK> and cruel man beneath the surface the chase scene through the <UNK> plant is impressive even today recommended 7 10
<START> this is a rip roaring british comedy movie and one that i could watch over and over again without growing tired peter ustinov has never performed in a bad role and this is no exception particularly with his dry wit but very clever master plan karl malden has always been an admirer of mine since he starred in <UNK> of san <UNK> i believe that maggie smith is the real star of this film though appearing to be so inept at everything she tries to do but in truth is so switched on particularly at the end when she informs everyone that she has invested so much money that she has discovered whilst <UNK> his clothes one thing does concern me though could someone please tell me why i cannot purchase this on either dvd or vhs format in the uk could someone please assist
<START> a surprising misfire from the usually reliable larry cohen god told me too q etc full moon high tries so hard to be funny and fails miserably even with decent turns by ed <UNK> and kenneth mars alan arkin looks embarrassed throughout his performance and son adam simply looks <UNK> this makes teen wolf look like a comedy classic
<START> it's not a brilliant idea to watch <UNK> if you're not 100 sure of your mental <UNK> because it will be severely tested with this film no matter how sane you are i have to say <UNK> is an art film rather than an entertainment film so the majority of the viewers wouldn't have the level of maturity to reach in to its delightful side kind of like <UNK> films but different in a way i myself can't say i had a lot of fun watching it but it's an outstanding and very interesting experience for those who are only tormented by the cliché that hollywood offers <UNK> sticks a finger right into your brain and <UNK> your mind all over you can't simply sit back and watch it you'll be using <UNK> or looking with eyes wide open throughout the film a film that's similar to this in style is <UNK> but it was considerably better and way less violent this one for instance is not for children or those who are mentally tender or bad <UNK> most viewers would most likely give either a 10 or a 1 to this film i give it a 9 because i've seen the multiple stories in one film phenomenon in another film and it was better but this one's an outstanding piece on its own worth watching but get ready to see something disturbing
<START> since was only a <UNK> when this show originally aired i just recently picked up the dvd set and am wishing there were more episodes filmed this show was a 70s version of the <UNK> 90's tv series x files but with a bit more of a comedic light hearted approach but don't get me wrong some of these episodes have full on horror themes many in which have some pretty <UNK> plots left to the imagination of course this was the early 70s television br br some of the plots where a bit silly as well as the acting but that is the charm and attraction to this series whether you like mystery crime dramas comedies or sci fi horror themes this series brought all that together each episode <UNK> in at around 50 minutes or so 1 hour with commercials and that 50 minutes goes by quick always leaving me wanting more a great classic show that is underrated in my book
<START> three giant <UNK> <UNK> created in a laboratory from <UNK> <UNK> a genetic breakthrough derived from <UNK> material are on the rampage accidentally set free through a series of events such as a computer <UNK> introduced virus in order to <UNK> security <UNK> keeping the resort novelty <UNK> closed during construction a security <UNK> leaving a gate open while searching for the missing page from a porn <UNK> that flew away in the <UNK> that <UNK> the lives of those it comes in contact with the <UNK> are always hungry but are unable to <UNK> what they eat so pretty much the <UNK> just rip their prey to <UNK> victims include a group of college kids the stereotypes include a <UNK> girl jock and tech nerd security <UNK> and those somewhat developed rich <UNK> who we can easily despise and wish horrible death br br <UNK> out a series of bad sci fi channel flicks attack of the <UNK> has some of the most wretched computer <UNK> animals i've seen yet and the final death sequence is so <UNK> presented you'll demand within the deepest <UNK> of your soul the time spent on this truly awful exercise in the creature feature <UNK> there's some good dark humor <UNK> from heads being torn from <UNK> but even here the <UNK> work is unconvincing <UNK> body parts and blood <UNK> as victims are <UNK> upon crying for help and receiving none i'm starting to sound like a broken record repeating myself in every user comment i write for these sci fi channel flicks i think maybe it's time to move on to other kinds of cinema robert carradine has a role as a ruthless businessman who is being <UNK> by his truly <UNK> ex brother in law nicholas bell the one opening primal park a resort <UNK> featuring <UNK> created <UNK> <UNK> as it's major attraction <UNK> <UNK> still quite <UNK> is a security officer who attempts to convince bell to get the <UNK> he hopes to <UNK> into putting money in his multi million dollar project to leave the island brian <UNK> is <UNK> lover and his role is a mechanic keeping <UNK> running smoothly br br <UNK> fate at the end resulting from a <UNK> tooth from a <UNK> tiger statue is the <UNK> carradine spends a great deal of the film <UNK> bell his arch nemesis the <UNK> point of view shows humans in a bright color as it moves towards them the film ultimately consists of characters walking through <UNK> corridors the tech <UNK> virus cut off the power worried for their safety the college kids commit breaking and entering to score certain items needed it's a <UNK> hunt type of activity to enter a <UNK> <UNK> the cast playing these kids do not rise above their clichés
<START> this is only related to the first movie by the name the plot has nothing to do with the first and the whole movie stinks i have no idea what they were thinking but this movie is so bad avoid this at all costs the first movie in the series is acceptable as a slasher flick and so is the fourth but this one and the 3rd are rubbish
<START> and that is the only reason i <UNK> this dvd now i haven't seen the first nemesis film but i did check the info out of it and i here by say what why because in the first film alex was male but then again the first one was set in the future so maybe this alex is brand new one and the scientist just happened to make alex female this time who knows at least it wasn't addressed in the film in any way br br here's a quick summary of the plot alex still a baby then or how ever you want as it was is in the future escapes with her mom using a special time <UNK> and ends up in the 80's africa there <UNK> gets killed and alex sue price grows up in a african tribe then the tribe gets slaughtered by a cyborg from the future and alex then runs and hides and finally she kills the cyborg so there does sound familiar doesn't it br br terminator isn't the only film being ripped here predator gets its fair share too and i think the first fly movie the vincent price one gets special nomination for giving a solid base to build up your <UNK> head from br br lets see what else okay the film was quite standard small budget flick but it did have bad special effects for a mid 90's film it would have looked okay for a 80's flick how ever biggest problem is the plot things just happen and the viewer is barely interested nemesis 2 isn't the <UNK> piece of cinema i've had pleasure to watch but it does come damn close br br i won't say a thing about acting because let's be honest here did anyone expect oscar worthy performances here oh well at least i did find sue price hot in that <UNK> warrior way br br a real movie rating 2 10 there isn't a lot of pros about the over all quality and despite of the very basic plot the film it self makes very little sense br br a camp movie rating 4 10 i did get occasional laughs from the sheer badness of the film so it does have small merits in it
<START> some 25 year olds behave like teenagers <UNK> with the death of a high school mate trying to find their purpose in live and love the script is so lame that i had to force myself to even finish this movie stay away from it 1 10
<START> first a little summary this reporter named torch is basically trying to get out the story of a zombie <UNK> and finds the military government <UNK> him nice message government censorship and all that but the way they did the movie was well let me explain br br this movie is beyond description the idea that somebody holds it in higher regard than anything by george romero is justification enough for the reviewer to be committed to a mental institution the script is atrocious on its own like it was written by a sixth <UNK> as for special effects i understand that independent films have low budgets and some gore effects looked acceptable but if you want a scene with fire here's a tip buy some <UNK> material have an <UNK> ready and get a fire going don't <UNK> add it in and make it look like an explosion from a <UNK> 64 game the acting well let's put it this way in my summer theater program a cold reading of the script is compared to this the godfather i won't even go into the inconsistencies find them yourself br br what disturbed me the most though was when everything was finished after shooting and editing somebody might have said okay this looks good let's release it it sends a chill down my spine to even think about it to think somebody felt that this was good enough for dvd release this isn't dvd quality this isn't sci fi channel quality hell this isn't even film school quality if you were to submit this in for a project at a film school you would get an f no not even an f more like an f i wouldn't be surprised if he would try to get you <UNK> br br i felt used after i saw this thing blockbuster and the makers of this movie have my money right now and i'd prefer not to think of what they're doing with it i have been the <UNK> of some elaborate <UNK> scheme at <UNK> <UNK> and it doesn't feel good to think that i walked right into it looking at the back cover with pleasant memories of 28 days later only to find a film ed wood would watch and say afterwards i didn't much care for this this film is the single most terrible movie i have seen i have not seen anything by ed wood but i have confidence this is worse if you are looking for serious cinema so much as being within ten feet of it will probably give you a bad headache if not i still recommend that you personally write the director and ask how he sleeps at night however if you are the kind of person who get a laugh out of really bad stuff then i recommend you check this out you won't be disappointed
<START> i hope she can keep acting and directing she's surely up to the task and could easily develop that <UNK> streak into a long career of unconventional and rare works of art her work has a rare kind of <UNK> and her timing is spot on <UNK> i'm <UNK>
<START> there are very few movies that are so funny as this one i was lucky enough to watch this movie at a theater reserved for movie buffs like me so it was not so embarrassing sitting there laughing till my jaw was completely sore and my shirt <UNK> were all wet from <UNK> my eyes br br at times the story was a bit slow but that is perhaps for the best a bit of rest in between the rolling amongst the <UNK> i nearly fell out of the seat was most welcome
<START> unlike <UNK> version of hello <UNK> jay <UNK> allen's screen adaptation of ira <UNK> hit broadway thriller couldn't wait for it's stage incarnation to <UNK> before putting it up on the silver screen so producers wisely decided to make the most of it's lengthy white way run the film's opening and closing scenes are shot inside new <UNK> intimate music box theater where deathtrap played for nearly five years even the film's final <UNK> on the theatre <UNK> is a version of the <UNK> famous <UNK> although <UNK> decided to go with a more fun <UNK> cube icon for the movie br br now on a low <UNK> dvd release deathtrap seems just as fresh and <UNK> as ever the cast is just right better than their stage counterparts and location <UNK> should be <UNK> for finding a suitably spooky house for our one room two act thriller to take place in opened up in surprisingly simple and innovative ways director sidney lumet wisely <UNK> any new material onto the beginning and end of the film and leaves <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> center alone br br the film's last scene is a major hollywood departure from the boards and slightly <UNK> one of <UNK> plot points from earlier in the film <UNK> about a <UNK> will be used by another woman because of play like robert altman's the player however our new finale helps the film <UNK> in on itself once again and <UNK> the lines between stage screen and could it be real life
<START> plot an <UNK> couple decide to engage in some extra marital <UNK> in a flashy car they then become stuck literally in a <UNK> position while said car wanders <UNK> about the countryside until the hapless couple are rescued by the authorities br br that's it that's the entire movie there may have been some dialogue here and there but nothing comes to mind it should be obvious by now that this movie is not just pointless but actually physically painful to watch the fact that it starred two of the <UNK> best up and coming actors one of whom is now sadly deceased only adds to the horror br br ian <UNK> was outstanding in the very much deserved oscar winning <UNK> of <UNK> let's remember him for that role and try hard to pretend that this particular <UNK> abomination never happened
<START> in a future society the military <UNK> does not have to <UNK> rather their candidates are chosen at birth <UNK> from <UNK> and <UNK> to spend their entire lives in the service of the government they are given over to the war machine body and soul for no reason other than to protect and serve they have no personal identity other than a name and rank and no <UNK> whatsoever this is the fate of those whose destiny is <UNK> for them in soldier ' directed by paul anderson and starring kurt russell the scenario is hard and bleak as the movie begins by depicting the training of the soldiers during <UNK> periods of time from <UNK> to <UNK> russell is sergeant todd the best of the best and we glimpse his career as he <UNK> his duties in an <UNK> manner in campaign after campaign he is what he was born to be a soldier but even the best cannot go on forever and the day arrives when todd and his peers are no longer the elite a new generation of soldiers has been created products of advanced <UNK> and technology and <UNK> generation is suddenly <UNK> what follows is the story of a man who must fight for his life while struggling to discover his own sense of humanity and <UNK> traits new to a soldier who has known only two things his entire life fear and discipline russell gives a commanding performance as todd the soldier who above all else must <UNK> orders without question while <UNK> all emotion and individual thoughts he has few lines in this movie but russell speaks volumes with his eyes this role demonstrates that he is in fact one of the under appreciated actors of our times that he can disappear so entirely into the character of todd is a credit to his ability and with this part he has created someone quite different from any he's done before and he's given todd a depth and credibility that someone of lesser talent could easily have rendered as nothing more than a pretentious and superficial stereotype notable performances are also turned in here by connie <UNK> sandra and jason <UNK> colonel <UNK> <UNK> out the supporting cast are jason scott lee memorable as caine <UNK> one of the new generation of soldiers sean pertwee <UNK> gary busey captain church michael <UNK> jimmy pig and mark <UNK> <UNK> anderson has delivered an action film with a message a <UNK> tale that <UNK> the genre of science fiction <UNK> reminds us of the importance of keeping the humanity of our lives intact it's an entertaining way of making us consider the <UNK> like a bleak future and a world in which good movies just wouldn't make a whole lot of difference much like 1984 ' and mad max ' this movie which is ultimately uplifting is going to make you take pause and think about the kind of universe in which we all must live together and share i rate this one 7 10
<START> heavily re edited and often confusing the original screen version of man on fire was at least ten years out of date when it was made and the passing years haven't made it any better this is the kind of movie that producers with too much money and too little experience make to get attention and everyone else does just to pay off their outstanding <UNK> or their drug dealer with scott <UNK> bodyguard going out on a <UNK> to rescue his 12 year old charge the kidnapped daughter of a wealthy italian family an interesting cast joe <UNK> brooke adams danny aiello jonathan <UNK> have all done better the action is <UNK> and sparse and only john scott's exceptionally fine score part of which turned up in the last reel of die hard makes a positive impression one case where the remake made by tony scott the original choice of director for this version is an improvement
<START> this paramount version ripoff of <UNK> annie get your gun <UNK> jane isn't all that unusual or innovative the marketing and intro comments may be there to salvage what is really a pretty bad movie musical western shot on a <UNK> and like a live tv show i don't find the use of the background <UNK> lit in various scenes with yellow or pink or red or all that innovative as noted it looks more to me like a movie that was produced on a tv budget all <UNK> with minimal sets backed by the <UNK> <UNK> compare to new faces of <UNK> the actors come off reasonably well though and this style was much better realized when paramount shot <UNK> <UNK> in 1959 of <UNK> this movie suggests the often repeated question what were they thinking
<START> this is not bela <UNK> best movie but it's got a good old style approach for some 40's horror entertainment br br brides are dropping dead at the <UNK> like flies i think i'd <UNK> the wedding until after the fiend is caught but it's a horror movie so i guess people ignore the danger for some reason anyway <UNK> is a mad doctor who needs young female blood to keep his aging <UNK> wife healthy and happy he always <UNK> the <UNK> cops by hiding the bodies in a <UNK> who would think of looking for a corpse in a <UNK> and the brides just keep on getting <UNK> br br no movie like this would be complete without a lois lane type female reporter who wants to catch the criminal on her own good at solving crime bad at keeping her mouth shut at all the wrong times guess who <UNK> picks for his next intended victim i love the haunted house bit where lois lane gets stranded by a <UNK> as a guest at <UNK> sinister mansion hidden <UNK> a vampire like wife an evil dwarf <UNK> assistant and so on good stuff br br fairly well done pacing keeps the film moving and the story <UNK> itself in a typical but satisfying manner if you like old horror movies this one is worth a watch
<START> i also just got back from an advanced screening of <UNK> and i must say i haven't had so much fun at a movie in a long time wes craven is at his best ever he brings us an amazing end of summer thriller i was so desperately <UNK> this is the thriller of the year no doubt br br all the actors are amazing and the action is realistic and fun the f x were great it <UNK> built suspense i was on the edge of my seat most of the movie it's been a while since i heard an audience cheer and <UNK> and get excited in a theater br br if your looking for thrills action and a good plot this summer <UNK> delivers go see it
<START> in the last 10 years i have worked in 3 different indie professional wrestling <UNK> managed many pro <UNK> including 2 backyard wrestling stars worked on 2 different wrestling tv programs and did voice overs and commentary for many wrestling dvd's i have never witnessed the level of outright amateurish stupidity lack of talent and skill and shoddy production quality found in splatter rampage wrestling to even list this as a wrestling video of any kind is an outright <UNK> of the term shot with low dollar video cameras it's essentially home videos of kids play fighting in back <UNK> the sound quality is bad the video quality is bad and the acting is horrendous the <UNK> wear <UNK> costumes with hand drawn <UNK> shirts and <UNK> masks and hit each other with a variety of items and halfway imitate wrestling moves sometimes the matches are on the grass sometimes on a back yard <UNK> all are poorly acted and executed with a shameless lack of any wrestling skill in short don't bother with this stinker whether your interest in this dvd is entertainment or academic both in my case you will be terribly disappointed
<START> supposedly based on the life of domino harvey a model turned bounty hunter i'd say 95 is <UNK> i always keep an open mind when it comes to movies however this movie lost its chances when it became apparent it had narration throughout the film something i can't stand and to top it off the heroine of the story is so hateful and depicted as an arrogant b <UNK> i just wanted it to end with her being shot in the head it's too incoherent too flashy and way too boring it's a who gives a crap kinda story and i really think that big time directors need to make movies based on their own or a writer's own imagination not something based on some ignorant <UNK> <UNK> life
<START> so wonderful so quirky so romantic so italian the film is so <UNK> light you <UNK> off into its <UNK> reality and you never want to return to the <UNK> again a kitchen sink world of <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> but one that <UNK> with a soft <UNK> should the credit go to the screenplay or the direction take your pick they're both <UNK> let me get back to that new york city that lies just beyond the looking glass
<START> oh wait i can this movie is not for the typical film <UNK> unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic <UNK> like continuity editing and <UNK> match i couldn't tell where i was in this movie one second they're in the present next minute their supposedly in the 70's driving a modern <UNK> and wearing what looked like to me as 80's style clothing i think i couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible i think it only got attention because it has a 3d which i did not watch if you're a b movie buff and by b movie i mean bad movie then this film is for you it's home movie and all non sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake if your tastes are more for <UNK> and antonioni though just skip this one
<START> well some people would say that this particular movie stinks but hey thats not right not right at al the movie may not have the best special effects and may not have the best actors except the <UNK> of the barbarian bros <UNK> <UNK> minor fact i can <UNK> say that this is one of the funniest movies <UNK> ever seen and <UNK> seen em al
<START> except for an awkward scene this refreshing fairy tale fantasy has a fun and delightful <UNK> of adult cynical wit that charms its way into the audience as well as a soundtrack that <UNK> moves this fairy epic along except for one of the robert deniro scenes that doesn't come across smooth and appears out of sync with the tone of the rest of the movie this <UNK> romantic fairy tail has a great storytelling feel and the strong magic and the fine balance between serious adventure scenes and the lighter spiritual humor is well done in the updated tradition of the princess bride this contemporary presentation of magic and love is captivating eight out of ten stars
<START> contains spoilers br br the truly exquisite sean young who in some scenes with her hair <UNK> up looks something like elizabeth taylor is striking in her opening moments in this film sitting in the back of a police car waiting to <UNK> a bust her face and body are tense and distracted unfortunately once the bust is over <UNK> strained demeanor never changes this is one <UNK> <UNK> actress br br one has only to compare young to the performer playing her <UNK> and best friend <UNK> walker to grasp what is missing in young walker is open emotional and at ease at all times in that there's no apparent <UNK> between what she may be feeling and her expression of it she is an open book young on the other hand acts in the <UNK> self conscious way you might expect your neighbor to act were they suddenly thrown into starring in a film basically she doesn't have a clue br br with this major void <UNK> at the center of the movie we're left to <UNK> the <UNK> of the story for instance after miss young is kidnapped by the criminal she's <UNK> and locked in a closet she breaks the door down when left alone granted she's dressed only in a <UNK> and <UNK> but in a similar situation with a psycho <UNK> due to return any moment would you head for the door or take the time to go through his <UNK> take out some clothes and get dressed i would guess that this and other scenes are trying to suggest some sort of mixed emotions miss <UNK> character is experiencing but young can not convey this type of complexity br br there are a few affecting moments in the film such as the short police interviews with the <UNK> past victims but overall this is an <UNK> <UNK> it's too bad miss young was replaced while filming the pair of comic book style films that might have exploited her limitations with some humor batman and dick tracy because her <UNK> while attempting to play actual people is oddly touching watching miss young try to act at least in this thriller is a sad spectacle
<START> a movie that attempts to be far smarter than its makers are capable of producing the movie twists and turns through <UNK> plot surprises at a desperate attempt to <UNK> the audience guessing <UNK> <UNK> the plot with steamy scenes they thought would help it along br br james belushi is involved in this pseudo intellectual attempt and just sleep walks through the movie the same applies for the other actors the plot is quite silly and tacky <UNK> in <UNK> is not such a crime but towards the end the tremendous plot twists get very tiresome and boring br br however the movie does manage to generate some interest in the middle in all worth a lazy watch on a really boring day but don't <UNK> if you miss this one br br a rather lame 4
<START> i was one of many that expected to see a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dandy portrayal of a day that as <UNK> <UNK> should live in <UNK> rather than glory how wrong i was these guys were there right in the middle of it and the pictures they returned are both amazing and heartbreaking and yet it all occurred on a chance trip to the world trade centre on september 11 2001 br br two french filmmakers were <UNK> a documentary about life as a ny <UNK> particularly from the perspective of a young rookie coming up through the ranks at the beginning we see much of this footage just to remind us that there was no thought to producing a film about terrorism this was intended to be a film about regular people <UNK> an honest living helping others and the beauty of the film is that it never loses this edge br br while investigating a suspect gas line i think my <UNK> a little <UNK> on that we suddenly hear a plane fly <UNK> the camera pans up to reveal a commercial jet <UNK> itself into one of the towers what must the cameraman have been thinking at this time <UNK> the importance of the footage the camera stays on and possibly realizing the same thing the <UNK> allow the camera to follow them into the building br br what follows is a true view from the front lines we see the commitment of the <UNK> their reactions the stunned silence after hearing the first person fall to their death is chilling as well as the collapse of the one of the buildings from the inside while a second camera captures the events from the outside br br if it wasn't for the horrific event they were covering the footage alone would be any young <UNK> <UNK> dream come true quite simply the footage deserves to be <UNK> for all time but what really sets this film apart is the genuine humanity that it brings to the viewer we see <UNK> <UNK> in without <UNK> people of different races helping one another escape to wave of <UNK> and even the concern of the filmmakers for one another they are brothers as they cannot reach one another in the confusion there are amazing sights as well as amazing human stories in this film something hollywood could never <UNK> even though it's trying br br 9 11 isn't a film about politics nor is it a film about religion <UNK> or even <UNK> for that matter 9 11 is a film about people and a true indication of the best and worst that we are capable of 9 11 is quite simply one of the most important films i've ever seen and would be the only film to be born from this event if it were up to me you can't <UNK> this
<START> i first saw rob roy twelve years ago with little money for entertainment i rented it for my fiancé and i to watch on a bone chilling <UNK> night the movie i had wanted was gone so i rented this instead not expecting much and was very much surprised with how good it was i just recently watched it again and loved it every bit as much as the first time br br for those unfamiliar with the story it's about scottish outlaw robert roy <UNK> a <UNK> and folk hero from the little i know about the man and his story liberties have been taken with the facts but it's a movie not a <UNK> and so the filmmakers can be <UNK> basically the plot of the movie is that rob roy borrows money from the marquis of <UNK> to buy cattle which he then <UNK> to sell and <UNK> a large profit from but his plan is <UNK> when the friend <UNK> with the money is robbed of the cash and murdered in the forest our hero finds himself on the run after failing to settle the matter with the marquis and mary his wife suffers a sadistic rape at the hands of <UNK> cunningham a smarmy <UNK> with no soul atrocities ensue until in an immensely satisfying conclusion rob <UNK> <UNK> up like a christmas turkey br br there are many great performances in this movie but allow me to touch specifically on a few liam neeson as usual is fantastic a sexy beast you can't take your eyes off of honestly this man is like ice cream even when he's bad he's good his rob roy is an <UNK> man struggling to provide for those who depend on him in the best way he knows how jessica lange as mary gives this woman a <UNK> which is a nice change from the <UNK> dull movie wives audiences are usually forced to endure you just know she doesn't take any b s from rob or anyone else for that matter tim roth is completely over the top with his portrayal of the evil <UNK> yet somehow it works all the <UNK> and <UNK> combined with some wicked dialogue result in one of the most memorable movie villains in recent memory combine all of this and the stellar work by other supporting players with the <UNK> scenery of scotland and you have what amounts to one really really cool movie if you haven't seen this i highly recommend that you do
<START> oh my i think this may be the single <UNK> movie i've ever seen i'm serious this is one of the ultimate b movies the first proof is that it isn't a 5 dvd oh no that's too mainstream for this i got this on vhs from a bin full of ex rental videos at my local video store br br if i may quote the <UNK> in <UNK> century japan there lived a samurai who would set the standard for the ages his name was <UNK> he is sent on an epic journey across the world to <UNK> 5 000 <UNK> from the king of spain whilst at sea a violent storm <UNK> their precious gold intended to buy the weapons and almost takes their lives <UNK> must battle all odds to survive and the secure the fate of his beloved japan it then goes on to say a multi million dollar action adventure epic set across three <UNK> br br i must have seen a different movie this was no epic and it certainly wasn't a multi million dollar anything no <UNK> <UNK> is really just the crazy adventures of the <UNK> speaking <UNK> sho <UNK> he isn't even a <UNK> really but thats not important what is important is that he does a really cool impression of john <UNK> repeated <UNK> of the one castle in <UNK> python and the holy <UNK> and his ability to go from serious scenes to showing off his samurai mind powers awesome br br the greatest thing about this movie is sho <UNK> <UNK> accent the movie may lack nearly everything that makes a good movie but makes up for it with some of the <UNK> lines ever delivered by the coolest <UNK> accent ever and honestly do you really want anything else you could fast forward <UNK> <UNK> to the end and replay <UNK> final line over and over the tape will probably wear out before you get tired of that one line awesome br br 2 10 so very very cheesy
<START> man would expect that a movie shot with an <UNK> budget of 300 000 000 u d should at least entertain you for the time you are spending in the cinema <UNK> watching it matrix <UNK> proves this <UNK> wrong br br the matrix worked out better despite having apparent holes concerning logic of the story at least nobody could explain to me why beating up a <UNK> aka agent inside a <UNK> aka <UNK> would harm the responsible computer program in any way br br unfortunately the <UNK> brothers made <UNK> this agent bashing the main thing in matrix <UNK> it's a beat 'em up o <UNK> this fighting scenes may be work out sufficient or even cool in a 5 <UNK> trailer but prolonged for several minutes apparently being <UNK> choreographed poorly and repeated over and over again it is nothing more than boring despite seeing the promised <UNK> stunts there is nothing more than simple low quality unimaginative bashing already seen or better not in <UNK> van damme <UNK> the difference of post production <UNK> is 5 times faster the camera <UNK> around a lot and <UNK> on certain scenes and this is repeated for at least <UNK> doesn't help here all this has nothing to do with the very meaning of martial arts beside these <UNK> all actors do refuse to do what they are <UNK> for acting br br what's up besides the fighting scenes few except hollywood routine this oh so <UNK> bunch of hippies which sucked in <UNK> are recycled as citizen of <UNK> mans last city on earth and on the order of <UNK> they start dancing 'cause this is a good opportunity to show a lot of barely covered tits and <UNK> the oh so popular <UNK> of the frog aka <UNK> talking with this je <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dumb accent who wastes his fortune because of a <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> served following this and <UNK> funny is the fight between neo and the sinister followers of 'the <UNK> since it takes place in an <UNK> flynn like <UNK> luckily featuring a lot of <UNK> weapons for decoration for neo posing with the <UNK> just add 2 stairs and a lot of <UNK> for being <UNK> thrown over evil guys and the like and you get 5 more senseless boring min of this junk br br whats left to expect the usual <UNK> hell and <UNK> which will happen or not certainly without me
<START> repetitive music annoying narration terrible cinematography effects half of the plot seemed centered around shock value and the other half seemed to be focused on <UNK> the type of crowd that would <UNK> at people to start a fight br br one of the best scenes was in the deleted scenes section the one where she's in the <UNK> office with her mom i don't understand why they'd cut that the movie seemed desperate to make a point about anything it could and domino talking about <UNK> would have been a highlight of the movie br br ridiculous camera work is reminiscent of mtv and completely not needed or helpful to a movie <UNK> the film up just to jump past a lot of things and <UNK> the camera around something repeatedly got old the first time it was used it's like the directors are wanting to use up all this extra footage they didn't want to throw away br br another movie with jerry springer in it that should've told me not to watch it from the preview br br a popular movie for the in crowd
<START> war inc <UNK> take over war in the future and use a lone assassin brand <UNK> john cusack to do their wet work against rival <UNK> a dark comedy <UNK> the military and <UNK> alike it was often difficult to figure out what exactly was going on i kept waiting for things to make sense there's no reason or method to the madness br br it's considered by cusack to be the spiritual <UNK> to <UNK> point blank i e war is more or less a knock off we again see cusack as an assassin protecting spoiler the person he's supposed to kill as he grips with his conscience to be fair john cusack looks kind of credible taking out half a dozen guys with relative ease the brief fights look good the rest of the film does not it's all quirky often <UNK> on bizarre war <UNK> not funny enough to be a parody and too <UNK> for anyone to even think about whatever the film's message might be which i suppose might be the heartless ways that <UNK> like war <UNK> compete and scheme without a drop of consideration given to how they affect average citizens interesting but the satire just doesn't work because it's not funny and at its heart the film has no heart we're supposed to give a damn about how war affects <UNK> shell of a character rather than the millions of lives torn apart by war br br john cusack gives a decent performance his character <UNK> shots of hot <UNK> and drives the <UNK> private plane but quirks are meant to replace character traits marisa tomei is <UNK> as the romantic sidekick journalist there really isn't a lot of chemistry between them <UNK> duff tries a russian accent and doesn't make a fool of herself joan cusack just screams and <UNK> and <UNK> out <UNK> ben kingsley might have to return the oscar if he doesn't start <UNK> out a decent performance now and again pathetic br br it's not a terrible movie but in the end you gotta ask war what is it good for absolutely nothing c
<START> one of the first <UNK> original video animation i ever bought this still has to be one of my favourite anime titles a <UNK> sci fi action comedy set against an unlikely for a comedy that is background of near future <UNK> in a <UNK> society br br the heroes of <UNK> are the tank police formed with a if we can't beat crime we'll get bigger guns philosophy and who are like the name suggests <UNK> the city in tanks instead of <UNK> cars and who are actually far more dangerous than any criminals they are trying to catch most if not all of these cops are borderline <UNK> and <UNK> giving new meaning to the phrase loose <UNK> br br equally colourful and amusing are their <UNK> terrorist <UNK> and his <UNK> <UNK> men the twin cat sisters whose existence always seems to involve giving the tank police a hard time br br the animation is not state of the art but it's very nice otherwise the colourful palette and cartoonish look of the characters and <UNK> fit nicely with the comedic atmosphere of <UNK> br br the english dubbing is again lots of fun the soundtrack of the english version is also very good i wonder if they ever made a soundtrack album of that br br anyway <UNK> tank police is great it's japanese <UNK> sf with lots of comedy filled with completely over the top characters and situations making sure that it never takes itself seriously highly recommended
<START> i thought this was a splendid showcase for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> if you don't expect anything else such as clever plot twists and believable character development you won't be disappointed consider this a sports illustrated shoot whose character goes around killing people especially those who <UNK> to come between her and her <UNK> <UNK> arquette who obviously doesn't want to play the sex <UNK> she leaves that up to her daughter br br <UNK> face is a little too perfect but her body is a complete 5 alarm fire up there in the ranks of sophia loren when it comes to natural <UNK> a perfect 7 to 10 ratio of <UNK> to <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> legs right down to her feet there has to be some ideal <UNK> of <UNK> to knees to <UNK> to <UNK> that is altogether pleasing to the eye mandy certainly is the model for this <UNK> ratio br br and no flat butt to boot which seems to be the <UNK> of many a <UNK> babe with <UNK> everywhere except in the <UNK> <UNK> mandy might have used a body double in the rear shot of her losing her <UNK> as she <UNK> into the candle lit hot <UNK> with her <UNK> german guy victim no 2 but from all i could see from her bikini shots she had the butt for it and didn't need a double to prove it br br <UNK> acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychotic <UNK> <UNK> with the obvious erotic lesbian overtones her <UNK> nature allowing herself to be <UNK> in the hot <UNK> after a long <UNK> with german guy no 2 who also happened to be her mother's lover added an additional dimension to an otherwise one dimensional caricature of adolescent female <UNK> conflicted with <UNK> murderous <UNK> always by water with the men the ultimate fate of the <UNK> <UNK> was edited out in the <UNK> version for some obscure reason br br <UNK> uber <UNK> facial features coupled with her uber <UNK> body could either be a <UNK> or a curse if mandy really wants to further her career as an actress i'd advise her to <UNK> herself fully in the romance languages especially italian and spanish and maybe french although i don't know if they would go for her type but this would <UNK> her to <UNK> her bo derek face with her <UNK> <UNK> body but maybe her face is just a little too <UNK> and she has shown off too much of her extraordinary body in a cheesy movie to <UNK> her to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by michelle johnson of the 1980's whose early fame in blame it on <UNK> was followed by a series of skin flicks that failed to make it off the ground br br <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the only word i can think of to describe this movie is ordinary br br the plot line about gary <UNK> character attempting suicide is a ridiculous premise and c'mon living as some sort <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> in a shack driving golf balls into the ocean because he couldn't handle life in the <UNK> pro am golf community cry me a river i wish these were my problems i do enjoy dylan baker and <UNK> but this movie was clearly a bad choice or a pay check for <UNK> the scene in which little timmy price gets <UNK> abused by the other club member in front of his father during the <UNK> is so over the top that i am embarrassed to watch it
<START> this story was never among my favourites in <UNK> works so i was pleasantly surprised to quite enjoy this adaptation the mouse <UNK> was effective if a little overdone the bones of the story are there although more emphasis is placed on the <UNK> in the <UNK> subplot the students were all pretty much as i imagined them although its a pity they weren't a more <UNK> bunch perhaps the <UNK> thirties setting didn't allow for that i thought some very daring risks were taken with the filming perhaps its because i've not long re read the book but it seemed pretty obvious to me who the murderer was from their appearance in some reveal shots quite early on br br humour was much more prevalent in these early <UNK> sometimes it works but i found a lot of it rather heavy handed in this episode though i did smile at the <UNK> <UNK> throwaway line altogether though a solid entry in the series though not one of the best
<START> if ever there was a film that deserved a big fat zero rating it's this pile of crap i love zombie films and even bad ones usually have something going for them but not this atrocity i actually began to feel angry watching this film because it's so <UNK> poor i can't believe the people responsible for it would actually think this was acceptable br br there's no plot and the non plot is cut with scenes of <UNK> and <UNK> the people don't react act or in any way resemble human beings the entire movie is also shot in two rooms scantily <UNK> to vaguely resemble the places they are supposed to be the whole thing is one pointless mess it doesn't go anywhere and when the zombies finally turn up they look rubbish and don't do very much br br i could make a better film than this so could you and so could someone who had never seen a movie before it's pitiful and without doubt the worst movie of all time br br honestly the very worst movie of all time you'll note by the way that the only positive reviews give this a 10 10 and urge you to buy the dvd i can't imagine anyone neutral genuinely thinking this is a good film it's terrible br br 0 10 and that's generous
<START> i enjoy watching people doing <UNK> especially if they do it as well as in the best scenes of this movie which takes you to a disco club called <UNK> especially at christmas time because there also appears a <UNK> santa claus br br even if this is an old film and even if i have <UNK> it from tv when the state movie archive of <UNK> showed this in the summer of 2004 on their own big screen i went there to check it out it's much more enjoyable on big screen than on tv br br even if many people here think that watching this on big screen is a waste of money for the ticket cost i disagree with this and i think that when i paid my ticket i got the <UNK> worth by seeing this as it is on big screen especially <UNK> on front row of the cinema an unforgettable experience and much better than just on video
<START> next to the slasher films of the 1970s and 80s ones about the walking dead were probably the second most popular horror sub genre while slasher films had <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> to get the whole thing going zombie flicks had george romero's <UNK> films and <UNK> soon after the success of his first two in the series other directors wanted to cash in a lot of italian directors were especially interested such as lucio fulci who brought us <UNK> a year after romero's <UNK> of the <UNK> known as <UNK> in italy and some other countries and it was there that <UNK> film was known as <UNK> <UNK> apart from the walking dead it has no relation to romero's film but is a good film in it's own right it was a big success in europe and 9 years later a sequel was born br br pros lots of beautiful lush scenery awesome score the acting isn't exactly good but the cast is game and seem to be enjoying the experience after kind of a slow start the pace moves along like that of an action flick plenty cheese and unintentional hilarity for bad film lovers good job on the make up effects lots of blood and some decent gore br br cons virtually plot less nothing you haven't already seen before blatantly rips off some things from the first couple of <UNK> of the living <UNK> films cardboard characters hasn't aged too well due to the bad 1980s rock music not that i'm saying all rock music of that period is bad clothing and overall feel of the movie br br final thoughts first of all this is not a true sequel to <UNK> cult classic in fact i don't know if it was ever meant to pick up where that film left off for those that don't know fulci was ill during production and ended up leaving and was replaced with bruno mattei <UNK> films are pretty laughable but like this film many are good campy fun and that's all this film really is just something to watch for fun br br my rating 3 5 5 so bad it's good rating 2 5 serious rating
<START> i'm no fan of newer movies but this one was a real pleasure to watch adults and children could watch it together how unusual my aunt liked it too it had laughter tears love adventure special effects good actors and a talking parrot it reminded me of a favourite the wizard of oz the hero paulie an intelligent parrot is separated from his home and family and goes through many adventures <UNK> and <UNK> always keeping in mind his resolution to find his friend marie highly recommended
<START> seeing this movie as i just did for the first time on turner classic which lists it as dangerous female can only <UNK> your appreciation for the 1941 bogart <UNK> version <UNK> cortez must have been getting paid by the <UNK> i hope he remembered his dentist and his <UNK> salesman in his will they made him the actor he was the women are all good but no better than that well <UNK> <UNK> is a little better more interesting are the original joel <UNK> and mr <UNK> who competently deliver many of the individual <UNK> but almost nothing of the set changing <UNK> of their <UNK> in the roles peter lorre and sydney <UNK> <UNK> bogart and mary <UNK> somehow <UNK> the essential <UNK> of their characters in the remake here sam spade and ruth <UNK> can't br br this movie doesn't exactly stink it lies there like a big slice of ham its chief value today is as a reminder that great movies like the <UNK> <UNK> don't just happen on the 1 to 10 scale i rate it a 4 mainly for the camera work and the supporting players
<START> this movie has got to be one of the worst i have ever seen make it to dvd the story line might have <UNK> if the film had more funding and writers that would have cut the nonsense and <UNK> scenes that i highly caution parents on but the story line is like a loose cannon if there was such a thing as a drive thru movie maker this one would have <UNK> from that it reminded me a lot of the <UNK> films that were put out in the 1960's poor script writing and filming br br the only sensible characters in the whole movie was the bartender and <UNK> the rest of the film could have easily been made by middle school children i give this film a rating of 1 as it is truly awful and left my entire family with a sense of being cheated my advice don't watch it
<START> the first two thirds of this biopic of fetish model betty page are very interesting betty as portrayed with enormous sincerity by gretchen mol comes across as a pleasant girl next door type who saw nothing wrong with what she did and there certainly wasn't anything wrong with it director mary harron who also made i shot andy <UNK> and american psycho <UNK> <UNK> america by mixing old black and white stock footage with new <UNK> black and white footage once betty lands in florida and starts working with bunny <UNK> color is introduced <UNK> <UNK> was mostly the result of her work with paula and irving <UNK> <UNK> taylor in a great performance and chris bauer as well as john willie jared harris the scenes where harron <UNK> <UNK> bondage photography sessions are fascinating and <UNK> executed the early <UNK> of fetish material are not portrayed too <UNK> and we get a sense that these folks were part of a tight community betty never had too much of a problem with her <UNK> although we get the impression that her reputation prevented her from gaining <UNK> in the straight acting world because the film's third act is virtually non existent we are left with the impression that we have been watching a feature length documentary on betty page rather than a structured drama flaws aside it's a film well worth catching and represents yet another fine <UNK> in the cap of producer christine <UNK>
<START> okay first of all i didn't sit down to watch the <UNK> of a star trek series to see a cowboy flying around in space this is how a normal enterprise episode works br br 1 archer finds a <UNK> or something <UNK> the lines of that and wants to take a closer look but it might destroy the ship br br 2 he sends a <UNK> into the <UNK> and and the <UNK> get damaged br br in all of the episodes i have seen all of the problems are happening because of <UNK> stupid mistakes oh and did you see the preview of one episode showing archer and <UNK> kissing i was planning to watch that episode but after that i totally gave up on enterprise and turned to tv right off come on this is star trek br br also what was with the banana slug in one episode <UNK> had a banana slug but had to leave it behind for some stupid reason okay fine little dumb to bring you pet slug in space but whatever okay that was what i thought until they left it on a desert planet a banana slug cannot leave in a desert how dumb are these writers br br any ways just saying if enterprise is on don't watch it
<START> i had the pleasure of attending a screening of the pacific and eddy last weekend at the santa barbara international film festival this film had caught my attention a little while back when i stumbled across an article about it in <UNK> magazine seemed interesting at the time but nothing too exciting anyhow i saw it on the festival program and decided to check it out all i can say is that i was speechless when the ending credits began to roll this is one of the most beautiful and refreshing films that i have seen in some time the photography art direction acting and especially directing were <UNK> and impeccable nothing is <UNK> <UNK> for you in this film and actually makes you think something that a vast majority of films today do the exact opposite the dialogue is carefully crafted and although this script is not wall to wall <UNK> the characters words are very deliberate and meaningful br br it's definitely one of those films that deserves a second viewing and the more you see it the more things you notice it's a very layered and intelligent film not sure when or where it's playing again but a definite must see for film <UNK>
<START> i often wonder why this series was <UNK> so much i thought it was brilliant and also very cleverly written and performed i think in time to come it will be seen in the light it deserves that is if they ever issue it many up and coming young comedy actors appeared in this and all went on to greater things maybe this fact will make people aware of its value and it will have to be <UNK> sally phillips simon pegg peter <UNK> and not least julian <UNK> <UNK> of the hugely successful green wing the writers graham <UNK> and arthur <UNK> are two of the finest comedy writers of the modern age anyone that can produce comedy like father ted couldn't be capable of writing something not worthy of <UNK> if it is ever <UNK> i will certainly buy it
<START> very unnecessary movie with characters that are acting so <UNK> that i really didn't care who would fare the best or was that the purpose of the film to portray some smooth talking cold hearted new york city folks no romance here no comedy either acting is very flat and a very predictable plot what annoyed me the most was this constant joking with quotes from classic movies man can't you see that the more you quote the less significant your own movie becomes try to be original yourself a small budget is no excuse at all first time director neither crappy crappy crappy no wonder it only cost me one buck
<START> rather well done actually attack the evil villains in their <UNK> stop a little big horn style <UNK> save the day via the <UNK> <UNK> works for me stiff upper british lip and all that br br so how does it play on a dvd <UNK> years later struck me as being like a western <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> for the thugs and the us <UNK> for the <UNK> british army it's very colonial in it's <UNK> you know white man's burden and all that <UNK> certainly would have <UNK> br br cary grant fairbanks and <UNK> play it as <UNK> as possible putting some buddy buddy slapstick into the mix between the shootings and <UNK> for good measure i had no idea it was joan fontaine as the token army wife did they leave some of her scenes on the cutting room floor very short none of them were aiming for an oscar here in fact grant was not at his best in a few scenes but <UNK> it it still works and where else would ben <UNK> wind up as an indian <UNK> only in hollywood br br <UNK> check this out if you like adventure and pseudo western style antics it was done by a bunch of pros well i might add br br outta
<START> a young woman who is a successful model and is also engaged to be married and who has twice attempted suicide in the past is chosen by a <UNK> and distant association of catholic priests to be the next sentinel to the <UNK> to hell which apparently goes through a creepy old but well <UNK> brooklyn apartment building its <UNK> take the <UNK> up and can <UNK> themselves but apparently can't escape as long as a sentinel is there to block the way the previous one john carradine is about dead so she by fate or whatever becomes the next one and the doomed must get her to kill herself in order for them to be free lots of interesting details lie under the surface her relationship with her father the stories of the doomed her fiancé so one can pass this off as cheap exploitation horror but given the sets the great cast and overall level of <UNK> this is definitely worth seeing
<START> a tour <UNK> ok the kid that plays oliver is a bit <UNK> sweet starting with the great cinematography color costumes and most impressive performances this is a must see movie i have seen several adaptations of this great novel but this one stands above them all and its a musical to boot it is a masterful <UNK> never leaving his character to do a song you never really know if you like him or not the same feeling i got in the book in other versions you hate him from start to finish bill sykes when you read the book hes a mean one and so he is in this movie oliver reed was masterful his wife directed this masterpiece i went and saw his last movie gladiator based on his many fine performances not to see the <UNK> the music fits the times and the mood who will buy this beautiful movie you should
<START> baseketball is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen it is an off the wall movie starring south park creators matt stone and <UNK> parker they play two <UNK> friends who create a sport in their <UNK> which goes on to become a national sensation most of the gags are indeed hilarious but the funniest parts of the movie is when players attempt to psyche out other members of the <UNK> team there is no rule about what is not allowed so naturally they do the <UNK> things possible one flaw of this movie is that the pace is way too fast and after watching for about half an hour i found myself asking wow this this over already another hilarious part of the movie was how joe and doug continuously <UNK> <UNK> who is a hyped up little guy baseketball is a comedic classic with some very <UNK> lines and it is very fun to watch
<START> the movie freddy's dead the final nightmare is just as horrific and disturbing as every other nightmare on elm street yes it has comedy essence about it so has all the other films but how can anyone possibly say that you wouldn't find freddy krueger scary if you were to come across this man in your dreams you wouldn't find him even more scary with a comic essence about him because his comedy shows that he doesn't care at all about killing you that he finds it extremely funny and freddy also plays comic mind games with them which in its own way is very disturbing by using his comic ways i think that makes the horror movies nightmare on elm street what they are today the writers are extremely clever making krueger comic and scary as <UNK> to jason <UNK> who doesn't say anything and hasn't got the wit to truly <UNK> his victims this movie is about as good as freddy's wit gets and i would recommend it to anyone with a sense of humour and by the way don't fall asleep
<START> but i've seen better too br br the story here is predictable a film crew trying to film a horror movie in a place where murders occurred three <UNK> what happens this isn't a total bomb the cast is fairly good with pros john ireland faith <UNK> and john carradine giving the best performances it's reasonably well made for a low budget film just don't expect any nudity swearing blood or gore the film has a very mild pg rating i was never totally bored it's ok viewing on a quiet night i saw it on video it was a horrible print very dark and some scenes were impossible to see still i didn't hate it and it does have a cool ending which surprised me basically nothing happens up till then so it catches you off guard worth seeing but only if you're a horror film <UNK>
<START> an expedition led by hunky captain storm mark dana travels to the valley of the kings in <UNK> to find out what happened to an earlier expedition they meet beautiful mysterious <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who joins them they soon find themselves faced with a blood drinking mummy and only <UNK> seems to know what's going on br br a real <UNK> i caught this on late night tv when i was about 10 it put me to sleep seeing it again all these years later i can see why it's slow moving the mummy doesn't even show up until 40 minutes in and this is only <UNK> minutes long the acting <UNK> from bad dana to real bad george n <UNK> and there's no violence or blood to be found this movie concentrates more on second rate <UNK> involving a silly love triangle than horror br br this rates three stars because it actually looks pretty good everyone plays it straight there's some good acting from diane <UNK> it's short and the mummy attack scenes all three of them aren't bad they're not scary just mildly creepy still this movie is pretty bad a sure fire cure for insomnia
<START> this infamous ending to <UNK> <UNK> career came to my attention through the <UNK> of bad <UNK> judging by the comment <UNK> i wasn't the first and i am not to be the last person in western europe to learn that this musician undoubtedly one of the best on our contemporary pop scene even the dutch agree on that tried to be an actor whether he should have made the attempt or not cannot be judged br br in <UNK> <UNK> he's quite likable but he seems to be uncomfortable with the flick in which he is <UNK> no one can blame him it deserves its <UNK> in <UNK> hall of fame by all means standards the story of the murderous maniac who is supposed to have died in an accident but is alive and <UNK> has been told dozens of times before and even without original twists a director can deliver a more than mediocre story through innovative settings and cinematography br br <UNK> <UNK> itself with a hospital wing and a couple of middle class houses the pace is dull the tension <UNK> the last bit of its credibility to the musical score for every appearance of the murderer is <UNK> by a tedious menacing melody followed by <UNK> <UNK> during the murders which or largely suggested and in any case as <UNK> as a small budget can make them the sex scene is gratuitous but not in the least appealing the couple from <UNK> could have made it work though while dealing with the couple subject the whole subplot between <UNK> and the girl does not work a more effective emotional connection could have been established on screen if they had just been fellow victims to be who <UNK> their nerves halfway through physical <UNK> i will not even grant the other cast members the dignity of a mentioning for they should all have been chopped up into tiny <UNK> pieces as a matter of fact most of them do the ones i recall where obvious for the genre a pretty nurse and two cops br br hence in a slasher the <UNK> only comes in time to need rescue itself the anti hero has to take out the villain mostly through clever thinking for former red <UNK> don't often get parts in these films they might overcome the illusion of <UNK> that <UNK> the killer translated to the events <UNK> kills the doctor and saves the dame in distress br br no people i am not finished this is not how the story goes <UNK> makes his heroic attempt but gets beaten up with a fury that comes close to a clockwork orange so it is up to the girl to pick up the <UNK> killer act and pierce through the doctors brains though this method <UNK> the killer's death more than the usual rounds of <UNK> bullets the doctor survives in order to <UNK> <UNK> to reach the 80 min mark br br i should have made my point by now <UNK> care is a bad movie which can only be enjoyed by bad taste lovers who can <UNK> <UNK> catchy statements and make some up for themselves and that way try to sit through it for example the <UNK> parody value of the doctor's clown mask halloween and the final confrontation in the park the chase at the end of friday the 13th br br however let me conclude by giving an <UNK> by a few <UNK> elements which give <UNK> a little credit george kennedy is not one of them all he has to do is endure a horrible monologue by a fellow doctor french actor and look horrified when they let him go down in flames in order to tag his big name on a stand in he could have played his naked gun part again to end up as <UNK> but with a longer screen time the finale may be one of them i had never seen a maniac being brought down by <UNK> fireworks into his guts in order to crush him against a <UNK> fence it is good for a laugh br br name one good truly point about <UNK> care <UNK> <UNK> learned his lesson and devoted himself entirely to his musical career it makes me wonder how many <UNK> of the paris <UNK> race he has to <UNK> before coming to his senses br br
<START> i found <UNK> at the <UNK> an entertaining and stimulating experience the acting while not generally brilliant was perfectly acceptable and sometimes very good as a film obviously aimed at the younger <UNK> it is certainly one of the better works in the genre children's sci fi normally i would say that canada the united kingdom and australia produce the best movies and tv shows for children and <UNK> at the <UNK> does nothing to <UNK> this theory i don't think that continuity and great acting are important to younger people a good plot and an imaginative screenplay are far more important to them both are in abundance in this film the special effects are good without <UNK> from the story or closing the viewers off from their own <UNK> it would have been very easy to <UNK> an over load of <UNK> in this film but it would have totally destroyed its entire <UNK> <UNK> br br the settings and camera work are of a very high standard in this movie and <UNK> the fine wardrobe and historical accuracy overall this film is highly satisfactory and i recommend it to all viewers who can see the world through children's eyes or those that try to like myself now i really must read the original book as soon as possible
<START> i have to agree with mr caruso jr lanza s was the finest voice god had to offer if only he could have found the courage to go for broke leave hollywood and head for the opera he could have been the american caruso everyone says he could have been but in any case he is a fantastic introduction to the art form no bones about it and if thats the way its gonna be so be it see the film you'll see why mr lanza still come up in discussion even in my house someone says pavarotti i say mario lanza as for the film itself when will it be on dvd they must have it restored and vhs isn't good enough but this should also be the only lanza film put on dvd the others are down right bad and boring
<START> if this is supposed to be a portrayal of the american serial killer it comes across as decidedly average br br a journalist duchovny travels across country to california to document america's most famous murderers unaware that one of his white trailer trash travelling companions pitt is a serial killer himself br br rather predictable throughout this has its moments of action and pitt and lewis portray their roles well but i'd not bother to see it again
<START> the color purple is a masterpiece it displays the amazing acting abilities of whoopi goldberg oprah <UNK> and danny glover not only is steven spielberg the most incredible director of all time but his <UNK> shines through in this film if you ever want to see what a movie can do watch this it's a beautiful portrayal of one of the most moving stories of all time
<START> i was not entirely impressed by this film it was originally named sin eater and should have stayed that way considering that is all that was talked about for the last half of the film i'm not even sure what the first 20 minutes of the film had to do with any of the rest of it it was very slow and what was with picking <UNK> peter <UNK> as one of the main actors that was a sad point br br all in all i would say check this out if you are into things dealing with the catholic religion but don't expect an exorcist or <UNK> from this film it will surely flop after a few days and word gets out
<START> i rented this horrible movie the worst think i have ever seen i believe a 1st grade class could have done a better job the worse film i have ever seen and i have seen some bad ones nothing scary except i paid 1 50 to rent it and that was 1 <UNK> too much the acting is horrible the characters are worse and the film is just a piece of trash the <UNK> house scenes are so low budget that it makes a b <UNK> look like an oscar candidate all i can say is if you <UNK> to waste a good evening and a little money go rent this horrible flick i would rather watch killer <UNK> from outer space while sitting in a bucket of <UNK> than sit through this flop again
<START> i found <UNK> almost unwatchable while only 70 minutes in length i still found myself hitting the fast forward button again and again the acting was of the if i scream and say k a lot i'm <UNK> school and the story was at best a scenario that had yet to be fleshed out br br while i never go to full moon for great film making i have never seen them produce as bad a piece of junk as this
<START> i'd have to admit that the draw of this movie is director <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> the wildly popular and successful blair witch project besides this is an alien movie of sorts and sounded something like stephen king's <UNK> one of those movies that the critics hated but i enjoyed br br but nope unfortunately i felt that for the most parts altered is a waste of time so i shall keep this review short premises are always promising and <UNK> no different it tells the story of a group of men who experienced strange encounters when they were younger and as usual others will take you as a <UNK> imagining stuff stories about alien <UNK> always have to deal with <UNK> into the <UNK> so i shall not go into details but you get the drift it's damn uncomfortable and something you'd like to forget br br what if you're given a chance for revenge that is you manage to successfully hunt down and capture one alive what will you do for this group it's a <UNK> <UNK> time or so they thought and this is where the movie begins to develop into a <UNK> with bad uninspiring dialogue and even worse acting even if it's low budgeted there aren't many redeeming factors be it strength of storyline or any help from the cast in making their characters just a tad interesting it's the standard cardboard fare from a vanilla plain script coupled with some cheap scare tactics employed br br what's good though is the makeup much effort has been put into making some of the stuff which i <UNK> mention because that'll spoil just the few elements of what makes this movie tolerable other than that there are the usual cheap special effects blood and gory moments which is nothing you've never seen before br br watch this only as a last resort compared to the other monster movie in town feast this one is less fun and takes itself too seriously <UNK> down by an uninspiring direction you've been warned
<START> if you enjoy seeing what must have started as a 2 hour movie in <UNK> bursts of <UNK> you'll love this film otherwise you'll just wonder how they could have made such a film from something so simple to translate to the big screen as inspector gadget br br in the previews for the film many scenes were shown which were not in the film and within the film some scenes just don't make sense while the movie is slightly less than 1 hour and a half i can only think of one truly memorable moment and that is just before or during the credits br br
<START> i first saw this film when i was about 13 it blew me away then and in many respects it still does now but i am less inclined to see it as an accurate historical piece now there is precious little effort made to examine and interact with the racism and thus fails to <UNK> that the most potent anti racism weapon is to understand it at its very core in those who commit it what we get instead is a <UNK> on the one side <UNK> and woods in 3d <UNK> <UNK> vision on the other two dimensional characters are portrayed as <UNK> <UNK> evil br br this all makes for a great film story but it <UNK> me that people see the portrayal as <UNK>
<START> my parents took me to this movie when i was nine years old i have never forgotten it i had never before seen anything as beautiful as elizabeth taylor she was twenty two when she made elephant walk remember i'm nine so the feelings aren't sexual i just couldn't see anything else on the screen i just wanted to sit at her feet like a puppy and stare up at her she has begun to show her age she's almost <UNK> four but i still believe her to be one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women to ever have lived br br i have seen the movie several times since and it is a sappy melodrama what saves it is of course miss <UNK> beauty magnificent scenery the very impressive elephant <UNK> and a well made point on human arrogance in the face of nature br br all in all a well spent couple of hours watching the movie channel or a rented video
<START> a young woman jean simmons is convinced by her scheming and dangerous aunt <UNK> <UNK> and uncle barry jones that she's losing her mind and in very delicate condition that requires their <UNK> which turns out to be more like manipulation as they try to keep her as far away from outside human contact as possible the only other person she sees is the estate caretaker a <UNK> character played by <UNK> reed whose caught the <UNK> eye of the middle aged aunt all of this the aunt and the caretaker the <UNK> expert uncle who has a serious <UNK> to him and the <UNK> niece in the middle would have made for a darker and more sinister film as it is a frame up for a murder sends <UNK> howard a fired government secret service agent who took a job at the estate <UNK> <UNK> and simmons across the countryside escaping police catching <UNK> of police net closing in over her front page photo <UNK> on <UNK> and <UNK> up in <UNK> where they meet some wonderfully cast characters and finally face down the greedy and murderous aunt and uncle
<START> richard farnsworth is one of my favorite actors he usually gives solid performances such as in the straight story and the grey fox he also does fairly well here but the rest of the film suffers from a low budget poor writing and so so photography the miller movie formula gives it a 4 richard gets a 5
<START> wonderful romance comedy drama about an italian widow cher who's planning to marry a man she's comfortable with danny aiello until she falls for his <UNK> angry brother nicholas cage the script is sharp with plenty of great lines the acting is wonderful the accents i've been told are letter perfect and the cinematography is beautiful new york has never looked so good on the screen a must see primarily for cher and olympia dukakis they're both fantastic and richly deserved the oscars they got a beautiful funny film a must see
<START> this is one of the best animated family films of all time moreover virtually all of the serious rivals for this title came from the same creative mind of <UNK> miyazaki and his studio <UNK> specifically other great films include my neighbor <UNK> and <UNK> delivery service spirited away is quite good but a bit too creepy for typical family fare better for teenagers and adult the one thing that sets laputa castle in the sky apart from other films by miyazaki is that it is far more of a tension filled adventure ride br br why is this film so good because it's a complete package the animation is very well done and the story is truly engaging and compelling br br most japanese anime is imaginative but decidedly dark or cynical or violent and the animation itself is often jerky stylized and juvenile none of these problems plague castle in the sky it has imagination to burn and the characters are well drawn if slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people none of those <UNK> coat wearing <UNK> there is plenty of adventure but not blood and gore the animation is smooth detailed and cinematic ally composed not a lot of flat shots the backgrounds are wonderful br br the voice acting in the dubbed english version is first rate particularly the two leads <UNK> james van der <UNK> and <UNK> anna <UNK> the sound <UNK> is great too use your studio sound if you've got it br br one aspect that i particularly enjoyed is that much of the back story is left unexplained laputa was once inhabited and is now abandoned why we never know we know as much as we need to know and then we just have to accept the rest which is easy to do because the invented world is so fully realized indeed it is fair to say that the world is more fully realized than most of the minor characters who are for the most part one dimensional stock characters e g gruff general silly sidekick <UNK> old <UNK> etc highly recommended for people aged 6 to 60
<START> i would have given this movie a 1 out of 10 if it weren't for ms <UNK> <UNK> performance and i will take this time to overlook that kris <UNK> here and end br br i really avoid watching <UNK> horror movies because stories lack originality and i really think that some writers don't give enough attention to the characters and their progression in their stories redundant it was as if they <UNK> the movie <UNK> when their storytelling <UNK> and my goodness creative <UNK> led them to rip off other movies why why did this movie get a good review i wouldn't give it that much merit the movie was kind of scary but the movie seemed more freaky as it deals with <UNK> <UNK> it goes into my list of <UNK> likely to <UNK> category i just wished they spent more time <UNK> the story lines and fix those flash back sequences never mind if the lighting sucked it wouldn't matter much if the content would blow you away <UNK>
<START> <UNK> bollywood and men directors br br really this is the ultimate limit in utter sacrifice made by indian woman br br viewing the current state of affairs in india where the wives are becoming more vicious day by day and are very <UNK> about their husbands the directors also can be called uncle <UNK> refer movie the lion king came up with a very new concept on how both the kept and the wife can live together happily ever after sharing everything between themselves including the <UNK> br br story line married couple very happy but accidentally a <UNK> happens and wife has a <UNK> lost the <UNK> along with the capacity of ever becoming a mother br br now in in india the in laws usually drive away the daughter in law if she fails to give them an heir so the wife hits upon a major plan surrogate mother but the scientists <UNK> sure artificial <UNK> no said the artist director actually <UNK> will come to know that the daughter in law is <UNK> so they are going for surrogate mother br br <UNK> society gosh the same ones who watch fashion tv day and night watching girls between the age group of 14 to 40 al in <UNK> and <UNK> well those neighbors suddenly take an upper hand in family planning and decision making br br so the wife sends away her husband to a beer bar where girls are dancing on the stage all mostly <UNK> and illiterate but men love such women as they can satisfy their <UNK> a lot br br he hires the lead dancer in the pub asks her to bear his baby in exchange for money she agrees she comes home becomes pregnant wife and kept both co exist in the same house in the mean time the prostitute also gets a taste of household life so much caring people around she misses them all and cries <UNK> in the mean time no one in the family comes to know that the real daughter in law is <UNK> around with a <UNK> beneath her <UNK> the mother or other elderly people never took her for check ups nor did they try to feel the <UNK> movements in the <UNK>
<START> i really did not watch this show as often when i was a child but the first episode i remember ever seeing is the episode where <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> stephanie ears when i started high school back in 2000 i had problems all through out high school and i'd rather not get into that but i used to always watch saved by the bell but that show really reminded me of the problems i faced at school and it rarely showed the kids parents saved by the bell is okay but not a good family show a few days after i <UNK> high school in 2004 i turned the tv to the family channel and day after day i got addicted to full house i could even push the info button and see the year it came out and i would remember what i was doing during that time period the episode was about to come on and it was titled birthday blues and to this day it is most favorite episode it's sad with a happy ending and you see <UNK> <UNK> in a way she doesn't act in other episodes she actually shows her serious side i have seasons 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 on dvd and i am waiting for 7 and 8 i wished somehow they could have a documentary and some <UNK> from the cast members i don't why some people have a hatred for this show because you don't see trash and violence on this show and for those who hate this show i pray for you because you might have grown up in a dysfunctional family where there was no love but full house in my opinion is a family living in heaven where everyone is happy and good things always happen and the characters are so awesome danny <UNK> reminds me of my mother and grandmother joey is good natured and is always in a good mood when i was a child i used to be just like jesse and he is the first actor on tv as a guy that is so obsessed with hair somehow you can actually tell that dj is a california girl i really like the episodes with <UNK> <UNK> because she always makes me smile and <UNK> my day when i watch her and stephanie is so cool also i have a hard time telling the olsen twins apart i want my kids to watch it one day but full house is my 1 favorite show and sabrina the teenage witch is my 2 favorite one day sometime before i die i would really like to meet all the cast of full house in person the first 3 seasons are kinda boring but they start getting better in the 4th season i just wished they could have made a <UNK> season they stopped making full house in 1995 and in the fall of 1996 sabrina the teenage witch came out which is a similar family show but full house is a very loving show and they have their good times and bad times and yes i understand if your a wild trashy type person your going to hate this show but this is a show for happiness and it is also moral show also i would like to say that the first 3 seasons is good kid shows but around the 4th and <UNK> seasons dj and stephanie become teenagers also i noticed not only with full house but a lot of shows they never talk about the problems in the world and politics like when full house was on the air during the <UNK> war in 1991 and during the time of the <UNK> city bombing in 1995 they never mention anything about it also steve was my favorite <UNK> boyfriend the ones with <UNK> and nelson <UNK> very interesting but season 5 and 6 i think are the best i just wished they would have made a <UNK> season because it left a big question mark in my head because on the last episode in the last minute dj gets a surprise and goes to her prom with her ex boyfriend steve i always wondered if they got back together and i liked how in the final seasons dj was always the <UNK> one and stephanie was always wanting to do something daring like in the episode <UNK> wild ride
<START> warning i advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment br br although i haven't seen them all the <UNK> sure did deliver one <UNK> piece of entertainment which it did not entertain me at all i thought that in common with the semi bad acting stupid plot scheme and the twist at the end of the movie which was very retarded this movie sucked okay so <UNK> these are people who eat other people yeah notice i said people not humans not because they aren't human or wait i think they are oh no wait they didn't tell you so okay are these people cannibals or are they <UNK> or what are they i mean maybe they're just things that came here to see what people taste like or are they cannibals who have eaten people for a long time now or maybe this movie was <UNK> which it was so if you think the <UNK> is good i ask of you why why why why why was it so awesome because to me it was just flat out terrible one big <UNK> for the <UNK> go see the <UNK> tooth nail or <UNK> for a piece of entertainment
<START> this video <UNK> eddie is one of the funniest comics i have ever seen not only does he have class he makes some of the funniest observations on history and culture that i have ever seen eddie is the most original and most intelligent comic i've seen in a very long time tell all those other stand ups to get off the stage and let this executive reign
<START> i <UNK> felt on this movie on tv and i wasn't able to leave it it's really an excellent movie which makes people learning about <UNK> history with the vietnam war the flower <UNK> time the <UNK> fight it illustrates the conflict of generation of political opinion of race which took place in the 60's i'm born in 1980 so i didn't know all that stuff before in france <UNK> history is not a <UNK> and that movie really learned me a lot of facts by the way i think all the actors are great especially <UNK> <UNK> josh hamilton and jerry <UNK> now i can see this film more then 1 time each day it's really great what a shame it only appeared on tv not in cinemas br br
<START> my god this movie was awful i can't complain about it too much i went to see it just to be <UNK> out it did suffice sort of it's funny that the most disgusting part of the movie was in the very very beginning where the woman is extremely vividly forced to give birth to a horribly mutated baby br br i also think that it's funny that the most notable actor in the movie was the hispanic soldier who was a supporting actor in next friday everyone in the movie did a horrible acting job it was some of the worst acting i've ever paid to see br br i also expected that it would be much more gruesome than the first one it wasn't i expected it to be more gruesome because it's a sequel and horror movie sequels are usually much less successful than their predecessors i expected it to be more gruesome since gore and violence usually sell a horror movie these days grudge 2 saw 3 <UNK> <UNK> 1 2 dead silence but it actually wasn't nearly as gruesome as the first one which was yet another disappointment br br the mutants in the first one were kind of disturbing but the filmmakers were trying so hard in this one to make them creepy that they were absolutely hilarious br br i also hated the entire concept of showing the clip of the female <UNK> son on her camera phone saying i love you <UNK> four times it was stupid to show it in the first place because they were just trying to make us feel worse for the vulnerable mother than the rest of the soldiers and it was even more stupid to keep trying to make us feel even worse for her by showing it three more times for no reason this movie was a joke
<START> for a science scare movie to work well it has to be either truly original or a very good retelling this movie is neither sure there is a pseudo original twist in that the guy kills people because of a <UNK> and not because of a disease but that is a very minor twist there is the government conspiracy angle the <UNK> protagonist who has personal experience br br and one real <UNK> of this movie is that the <UNK> man has no pathos although the character is scripted to be someone who should be <UNK> he is not without the pity the movie is pointless the other characters are so cookie cutter they are ridiculous the subplots are convoluted and annoying and the saddest thing is the movie is too flat to even be enjoyed as mock material make the movie a 45 minute short and it might be worth watching
<START> always enjoy the great acting of drew barrymore and her great performance in this film where she plays a very very complicated young gal holly gooding <UNK> parts 2000 who leaves new york and travels to california and shares an apartment with a up and coming writer george <UNK> patrick <UNK> far harbor <UNK> many strange things start to happen to holly and she seeks to find her brother in a mental institution after he killed her father if you look close enough you will actually see the mother of drew barrymore in real life appear as her mother in this picture if it was not for the good acting of drew barrymore and george <UNK> this film should be seen only on halloween night however it sure has it's surprises in the end
<START> my family and i screened underdog the night before and as bad as underdog is my four year old loved it hot rod makes it look like oscar worthy material the only thing that could have saved this movie was if <UNK> himself had come out of retirement to slap <UNK> in the face for making this movie i will admit however that the soundtrack was good i wasn't sure if the movie was set in the 80's but with the majority of the music coming from europe who knows if i were you i would take a pass and just stay at home and watch the test pattern on your local tv station or if you are dead set on watching this people under the influence might enjoy it
<START> i liked this movie when the guy who was in on a bank heist of 40 million in gold dies his cell mate is used as bait to lead them to the high tech crazy killer partner by having a <UNK> device <UNK> in his jaw without his knowledge it's an action spy type film with enough comical scenes to keep it light it reminded me of enemy of the state well acted and good enough plot
<START> my friends and i rented this for bad movie night with high hopes but the brain was something of a letdown the brain itself is <UNK> goofy looking but it mostly just sits on its little platform who thought that it would be cool that the brain only gets to <UNK> on three people throughout <UNK> drawn out minutes this movie has a number of things going for it at first including an <UNK> <UNK> lead playing a rebellious genius we're told that his enormous intellect is <UNK> into his elaborate pranks and school stunts which include putting <UNK> <UNK> on someone's chair it also has some great lines a hilariously out of shape and out of breath henchman who just barely manages to be everywhere and yeah some chick gets naked however the director desperately needs some <UNK> in the art of pacing during the last half things just start to drag on and on with at least 3 or 4 pointless boring chase scenes making up the middle third of the plot the scenes inside the <UNK> complex are especially bad at least 15 minutes of this movie are people running up and down the same <UNK> i could've fixed the screenplay to this thing in half an hour more cheese more gore more nudity more brain action if you're going to make a bad horror movie at least give me something cool to look at while my <UNK> <UNK> down maybe the director was trying to really bring the audience into his movie i started feeling like one of the <UNK> <UNK> by the end of this <UNK>
<START> michael jackson would have claimed a spot for the top billed character in the golden child and because he loves kids that didn't work and why should it so instead we have eddie murphy out to save the world by <UNK> kid <UNK> i would strongly suggest all future <UNK> to please thoroughly study the actor's inane dialogue in this quirky fantasy adventure comedy that's a step closer to <UNK> whatever murphy says or does can be best liked but don't get me wrong about his exquisite comical talent he doesn't belong in this movie and the same went for dr <UNK> the violence and visuals combined are reasons to <UNK> it as a cult camp classic and that wouldn't have made any sense as hollywood and movie fanatics kept <UNK> in on the guy speaking of visuals they were pulled off amazingly well at the time of ronald <UNK> presidential fame murphy is far better at coming to america and 48 <UNK> but this stale movie isn't my touch of golden honey for a sweet <UNK> taste
<START> i can't believe that this movie even made it to video and that video rental stores are willing to put it on their shelves i literary asked for a <UNK> take away the fact that the movie has no historical truth it and it is still the worse movie ever found in a video store it is not even good enough to be called a b rated movie do not waste your money or your time on this movie just listing to the voice over and the horrible music made me sick anyone involved with this movie should be pulled from the union gives the industry a black mark but after watching most of this movie i really don't think anyone involved is a union member
<START> terry west had a good idea w this movie he just didn't flesh it thru there are endless shots of the creepy looking <UNK> <UNK> that go on forever and probably to pad the film's running time also at this school there are only 2 students misty <UNK> is good as usual but this film will always belong to ruby <UNK> which is the only reason to watch the film in the beginning if the script centered on her interesting character we'd have a movie to watch she is so gorgeous good news for dvd <UNK> terry <UNK> earlier and better film blood for the <UNK> is a special feature one thing i'd like to say is that this movie feels like someone who's not good at delivering the punch line at the end of a long joke for the ending feels that very same way then again just watch this for ruby <UNK>
<START> this is complete and absolute garbage a fine example of what a bad movie is like this can't be appealing to anyone not even b movie fans do not i repeat do not waste precious time of your life on this piece of trash bad acting bad directing horrible but i mean really horrible script and complete lack of an idea as to what entertainment of any form is i bought the dvd for 3 dollars i swear i could almost pay someone to take it burning it would not be enough for what this movie did to me i like b movies the killer toys the weird <UNK> monsters but this is nowhere near you know those movies that are so bad they are funny not even just plain old pathetic
<START> this is a very interesting project which could have been quite brilliant gathering 11 prominent international directors and <UNK> each of them 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 frame to create a segment of their choice each short exploring the global <UNK> of 9 11 without using any spoilers i would say that ken <UNK> piece is the jewel in the crown and mira <UNK> short segment india based on a true story deserves to be made into a full feature film one also realizes while watching his short why <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is one of the best directors in the world today  he simply is a master of the medium who has also a profound understanding of the subject matter unfortunately not all 11 parts are made as well <UNK> <UNK> in his segment egypt assumes the arab stance of the self inflicted collective guilt which piece could have potentially been the most interesting one he fails miserably <UNK> short is poorly written and badly executed at least enough to stand out amongst other superior chapters of the film despite the <UNK> in quality i would still give the film 7 10 for concept if not for execution
<START> this game is very <UNK> i kept playing it for hours straight until late at night but also the fact that you can't save a game when you are in space contributed to this at times i just had to play on in order not to loose any game data br br so yes <UNK> is <UNK> but also quite flawed also for instance something that extremely bothered me was that you couldn't skip any of the cut <UNK> with as a result that at times you had to watch the same few minute cut scene time after time a great opportunity for me to <UNK> to check my e mail or have a chat with my friends and more things like that while i had to wait for the cut scene to be over br br the story starts of promising but the further you get the more ridiculous it all gets also the game also ends quite abrupt at least it did so for me it is quite obvious that they are <UNK> at a upcoming sequel i don't know if a sequel is in the works at the moment but i am sure that most likely i will pick one up once it will be released br br the <UNK> is very easy even for those who are not familiar with flight games to put it <UNK> every fool can play this game yes some levels are quite hard and require lots of effort it took me about 1 2 weeks for me to finish this game which might be a bit too short but thank god for the multi player option it allows you to keep playing short missions just like the single player game once you have completed it by the way br br even though <UNK> of mission are the same it just simply stays cool to be in the middle of the at times massive <UNK> br br the graphics are good but just not anything revolutionary or anything br br <UNK> game but beware of its flaws br br 7 10
<START> i think scarecrows are creepy so it's a pity this movie doesn't make more of them br br a bunch of robbers do an <UNK> <UNK> from a plane into a enormous field with scarecrows one of them goes missing with the <UNK> and so the rest chase him down while being set upon by inexplicably evil scarecrows the acting is hammy and the scarecrows unimpressive when they move on the positive side the director does get some suspense out of the static scarecrows it is as alfred hitchcock says a bomb under a table goes off and that's surprise we know the bomb is under the table but not when it will go off and that's suspense
<START> the most misogynistic movie of all time not to mention by <UNK> shouldn't they have moved beyond white people in brown face playing the indians my favorite parts though have to be when the girls giggle and <UNK> as the <UNK> drag them off to gang rape them rape is fun who knew let's see then there's the blatant rip offs of the hustler fat boss character actually plays pool while scheming to destroy the indians with the lead rebel dude the horrific acting the so on the nose they might as well have just told you what to think music <UNK> the lack of anyone who's actually indian in this movie and who are we supposed to be rooting for i have to say it figures that quentin tarantino loves this movie even though his movies tend to champion strong women i've heard from at least one source that in real life he's a misogynistic idiot why did i watch it you ask don't ask
<START> a terrorist attempts to steal a top secret <UNK> weapon and in the process of trying to escape he is infected when the case containing the deadly agent is <UNK> soldiers are able to retrieve the case but the terrorist makes his way to a hotel where he attempts to hide out they eventually make it to where he's hiding and <UNK> the hotel and its <UNK> unfortunately they <UNK> of his body by <UNK> and if you've seen return of the living dead you know what happens next br br zombi 3 has been widely <UNK> by critics and zombie fans alike as a complete mess of a movie while that's a fair <UNK> it's not without it's high points for one thing it has plenty of bloody deaths to keep gore <UNK> happy there's an abundance of zombies that seem to come out from everywhere possible they're in the water the <UNK> of houses hiding in trees and for some reason they like to hide under a bunch of dead brush only to spring out to attack as the heroes try to escape there's even a flying zombie head that hides inside a <UNK> you have to see it to believe it as that scene alone makes zombi 3 required viewing imo it may have some terrible editing and some very questionable acting especially from the doctor who has to be one of the worst actors i've seen but zombie 3 is still a very entertaining movie sometimes it's nice to sit back and watch a movie that doesn't require anything more than your time and an open mind zombi 3 fits that bill and then some it's even more enjoyable if you pop open a few beers and watch it with some like minded friends i give it an 8 10 just because of sheer enjoyment
<START> i was so disgusted by this film i felt <UNK> to warn off others this film has no story plot or hint of purpose the film starts after the standard lets be scary movie intro which by now every film watcher has become <UNK> so we can ignore the beginning completely we are soon introduced to the main actress and from this point it becomes clear to all that you have just wasted your hard earned and would be better off watching static unless you have seen white noise <UNK> acting is a disgrace and all of them should return to the travelling <UNK> from where they came having said that even the best actors in the world would struggle to make this film remotely watch able their poor performances merely contribute to the disaster senseless violence and what i can only assume is the written word of yet another <UNK> up eccentric writer who probably considers himself to be an artist has resulted in a film which will test your patience it was not until my fellow watcher turned to me and said we have been watching this for 45 mins did i realise that this film is as thin and tasteless as a cup of tea without a tea bag clearly something was missing and unfortunately it wasn't the audience rather than suggest what the film is missing let me tell you what it has dumb blonde surprise surprise victims bad monster guy thing about 2 mins of storyline which is stretched over hours days weeks months and credits br br want a silver <UNK> well the blonde girl is a bit <UNK> looking in some of the scenes but expect to want to see her face ripped off for the rest of the film
<START> i could not agree more with the quote this is one of the best films ever made if you think vanilla sky is simply a re make you could not be more wrong there is tremendous depth in this film visually <UNK> and emotionally br br visually because the film is soft and delicate at times early scenes with <UNK> and at other times powerful and intense times square post climactic scenes br br the music and sounds tie into this movie so perfectly without the music the story is only half told nancy wilson created an emotional yet <UNK> score for the film which could not be more suitable for such a dream like theme although never released i was able to get my hands on the original score for about 60 if you look hard you may be able to find a copy yourself <UNK> other musical <UNK> such as the beach boys josh <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are also perfect fits for the film <UNK> has an ear for great music br br more importantly the emotional themes in this film i e love sadness regret are very powerful and are <UNK> <UNK> by the visual and musical experience as well as the ingenious dialogue i admit the elevator scene brings tears to my eyes time and time again br br the best part of this film however as if it could get any better is that it is so intelligently crafted such that each time you see the film you will catch something new so watch closely and be prepared to think sure a theme becomes obvious after the first or second watch but there is always more to the story than you think br br this is easily cameron <UNK> best work and altogether a work of brilliance much of my film making and musical inspiration comes from this work alone it has honestly touched my life as true art has a tendency of doing it continually surprises me that there are many people that cannot appreciate this film for what it is i guess to understand true art is an art itself br br bottom line vanilla sky is in a league of its own
<START> yet another movie about a group of less than intelligent individuals on a road trip who wander off their original travel route for either a short cut or in this case to visit a run down side show attraction the results as expected are not at all good as this particular side show is home to a bunch of lunatic in <UNK> residents who were escaped prison inmates from years before the father who is apparently a <UNK> photographer just has to stop and take pictures of the place only to find that it still inhabited the various members of the family wander off to view the various <UNK> only to be scared away thinking they made it safely on their way the van tire explodes surprise leaving them to seek <UNK> and <UNK> in the small town which we find out is inhabited solely by the freaks surprise br br this film plays out as expected with the family being stalked and killed by the freaks there is some fighting back on the families part but these are probably among the worst scenes in the film as they are badly executed there is nothing remotely original here unless you count the totally inappropriate soundtrack that is played during particular scenes that completely ruins the atmosphere and mood of the film the acting is about as bad as i have seen in quite some time by everyone involved it is pretty bad when your cast is out acted by the cast of camp blood the special effects are lousy and the ending made me want to punch my television br br still though despite all the <UNK> i somewhat enjoyed this film it definitely has a so bad it's good vibe to it i made it through the entire movie and was even pleasantly entertained once i got past the ridiculously clichéd plot terrible acting and cheesy special effects though the ending left me feeling cheated and angry particularly because the film is not that great to begin with and the ending makes the entire film pointless br br bottom line i can list countless films that if you have seen them you have seen this the difference is most of those film are better though not a complete waste this film is pretty bad and not remotely scary br br my grade d
<START> if i watch a movie and don't once look at my watch or clock to see how much longer it will be running or when i hope that the last scene wasn't the end of the movie it's got to be pretty good i'm not an movie <UNK> or cinema <UNK> i watch movies and if they keep me interested till the end then they are pretty good because some of the most <UNK> acclaimed films bore me to death the english patient shakespeare in love <UNK> crash this movie kept me interested and absorbed beginning to end acting is great story is absolutely original flash back technique very <UNK> there was a bit of citizen kane thrown in tho when hoffman <UNK> his apartment after tomei leaves him but i forgive that cause i see it as a homage to rather than a rip off of orson
<START> this is the best movie i've seen since white and the best romantic comedy i've seen since the <UNK> husband an <UNK> beautiful <UNK> from kenneth branagh and helena bonham carter it is a tragedy this movie hasn't gotten more recognition
<START> this was a pretty good movie i liked it i thought it was a pretty accurate look at <UNK> and how it's not about <UNK> it's about having a pain so deep that they have to find a way to deal with it and they choose this beth was a very accurately drawn character and in the scene where she confronts her mom about the eating disorder you can see the pain inside her and hear it in her voice and you know how deep the pain is that she is feeling i also think one of the best lines in the movie is where beth yells the words it's not about you to her mother those words were so true and added so much to that scene in the movie i think that that scene was definitely the most important scene in that movie
<START> this is a film about deep and <UNK> human relationships br br eventually they do become spoken but is there a chance to change anything about the situation br br originally made in shanghai 1948 and quite free of propaganda the film introduces us to the <UNK> family there is still some weight about the history that <UNK> the family history usually has weight in chinese literature and serious film br br a young married couple <UNK> an <UNK> and his wife <UNK> live in a once great family compound that is partially ruined br br a bright contrast is <UNK> young sister who cannot really remember the past of the family but accepts everything in quite a natural way her spirit is as bright as the other two are reserved br br into this apparently stable world comes an unexpected visitor br br i ended up feeling quite sad but definitely a superior film
<START> with adam sandler br br this is without a doubt one of the most idiotic films ever made it's about cruise ship <UNK> <UNK> sandler wanting to be a comedian on the cruise ship first off there is not one funny or clever line in the entire movie honestly it is so unfunny it's pathetic there is surprisingly not much crude or sexual humor but the f word is <UNK> the budget is really low and that also ruins the film it takes place on a cruise ship but it seems they only had money to rent out a small boat and only had money for 10 ship extras one of which is billy bob <UNK> the opening credits are animated <UNK> cheaply and it is just pathetic i hate this movie and everyone else that sees this will hate it too br br <UNK> mins rated r for language
<START> i just realised i've been using imdb for years now and i've never reviewed my favourite film by favourite i don't mean something i like for now i mean this film is so <UNK> perfect that there is never another animated experience going to touch it this is obvious because i am never going to be a child again i saw this film on <UNK> in the early nineties i was 12 which is the age group this film is directed at i'm also male the gender that this film is intended for the overwhelming majority of miyazaki's protagonists are female consequently this film <UNK> inspired my childhood psychology and i am forever <UNK> to carl <UNK> <UNK> for producing the english dub of this film which is far superior to the <UNK> <UNK> production which is not even funny i've never even been able to watch that one of course subtitled is the only way ultimately however the <UNK> version is so good the voices almost exactly <UNK> to the original japanese actors that this version is available on the japanese dvd it's not available on any distribution in an english speaking country go figure br br there are hundreds of competent reviews so i'm going to put some trivia here not that i'm the definitive archive of information for this film br br first up i'd like to agree with the reviewer who stated that you need 20 out of 10 to review miyazaki's films they are so in their own league that they make almost the whole <UNK> on imdb combined pale into <UNK> br br the fascinating story with this film is that miyazaki based the countryside around <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> town area on the <UNK> mining <UNK> he visited <UNK> for a few months in the early 80s might be late 70s just after one of the great mining strikes being an avid <UNK> of the student <UNK> movements in the sixties he felt their plight the fight between the <UNK> and the pirates at the beginning serves to illustrate this empathy with the working man the countryside and the clouds especially in this film remind me of where i grew up as his film depicts a <UNK> version of the rolling hills of the <UNK> british <UNK> br br the island is of course from <UNK> genius satirical novel of the <UNK> century the story in <UNK> book is deliberately ridiculous in castle in the sky miyazaki weaves together <UNK> such as atlantis and the tower of <UNK> i think the architecture in addition is based on <UNK> ruins though i'm not sure someone told me that br br anyone who gets round to reading this review and who likes this film really will want to check out miyazaki's epic series <UNK> <UNK> conan future boy conan based on the short sci fi novel 'the incredible <UNK> by alexander key novel is available online conan is basically a prototype for <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in addition you may not be familiar with his earlier work for masterpiece theatre some of his key frame animation he also did key frame for sherlock <UNK> this has some of the finest backgrounds i've ever seen too also check out miyazaki and <UNK> first feature film <UNK> prince of the sun 1968 amazing by today's standards in fact what else <UNK> the <UNK> and the flying ghost ship though they're pretty rare br br this film is such a gift i don't know what we'd do without it with all this other crap storytelling around this is like an <UNK> <UNK> miyazaki <UNK>
<START> i haven't yet read the kurt <UNK> book this was adapted from but i am familiar with some of his other work and was interested to see how it would be translated to the screen overall i think this is a very successful adaptation of one of <UNK> novels it concerns the story of an american living in germany who is <UNK> as a spy for the us his job is to <UNK> himself with high <UNK> <UNK> and send secret messages to the <UNK> via his weekly radio show but when the war ends he is <UNK> as a war criminal but escapes to new york where various odd plot twists <UNK> br br if mother night has a problem it's that it tends to get a little too sentimental at times but for most of the film the <UNK> is kept to a minimum and the very strange plot is carried through with skill and <UNK> and there are some fabulous moments of black comedy involving three right wing christian <UNK> and a very highly <UNK> nazi in a prison cell very much recommended
<START> except for the brady variety hour this was some of the <UNK> television i've seen in a while the video production qualities weren't too bad but the overall look and feel were <UNK> early 80's and marie <UNK> looks like she did battle with the <UNK> lady and lost big time way too much <UNK> br br it was kind of embarrassing to watch veterans danny <UNK> and eric <UNK> take part in this even more interesting was watching alex <UNK> talk about the african <UNK> in world showcase that would be opening <UNK> about a year ' br br as of this writing it is 17 years later and it hasn't opened yet unless you count disney's animal kingdom all in all though for all the shortcomings this still an interesting visual piece of disney history
<START> a highly atmospheric <UNK> showing great <UNK> in the use of props sets and effects fog lighting focus to create an eerie and moody <UNK> the story is <UNK> the acting is merely <UNK> but it shows how imaginative effects can develop an entire visual narrative this movie is recommended for its mood and <UNK> not for its story
<START> i thought how the grinch stole christmas was a pretty good movie it wasn't horrible nor was it great but it was enjoyable to watch i felt as if jim carrey got a little annoying at times they made the grinch seem like a special education person when all he needed to be was evil and <UNK> but yet he turned out kind of retarded i did think the scenery when not inside the <UNK> cave was beautiful and there was a few parts where i laughed but most of the time i thought it was just annoying this movie could've been so much better if they had changed the <UNK> personality and they had included some more laugh scenes because most of the humor wasn't funny i liked how the grinch stole christmas anyway but it's not anything to get excited about seeing
<START> at first this looked like a boring comedy like the odd couple but when i got into it it turned out to be a really funny film basically <UNK> ex comedians willy clark golden globe winner and oscar and <UNK> nominated walter matthau and al lewis oscar winning and golden <UNK> nominated george burns were a great comedy duo and a brought back together to revive their hospital sketch for a tv show <UNK> nephew ben clark golden globe winning richard benjamin is confident they can get together again with no hard feelings for each other how wrong he is they cannot get on all the time they are both <UNK> especially during conversation but they do it eventually also starring lee meredith as nurse in sketch miss <UNK> carol <UNK> as mrs doris green <UNK> daughter <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> nurse and muppets from <UNK> f murray abraham as mechanic i think the best line of the film is burns mentioning that matthau called him a son of a bitch bastard it was nominated the oscars for best art direction set decoration and best writing screenplay adapted from other material it was nominated the <UNK> for best screenplay and it won the golden globe best motion picture musical comedy and it was nominated for best screenplay very good
<START> i didn't expect much when i first saw the dvd cover i mean pierce brosnan as grey owl br br ah but then the story got <UNK> <UNK> in a beautifully photographed and paced film i was surprised and delighted at this basically true story made me want to read more about this fascinating character which means the director <UNK> his purpose and the film was a success
<START> the only enjoyable thing about this highly <UNK> movie is playing guess that location what toronto landmark will stand in for what american international location br br who knew that the anti christ would be russian obviously he can't be american since we need the <UNK> to save the day oh buck you'll tell us all the truth you'll show us the light and the way outta the building should those nasty anti <UNK> get their way br br five golden <UNK> faith is not enough to hope they don't make another of this <UNK> we don't gotta <UNK>
<START> more of a mystery movie with some gratuitous horror elements thrown in mediocre overall br br it starts with a woman having a nightmare in which her sex partner gets out of bed goes into the room of her crying child and kills it she wakes up then that man is dying in a hospital spitting up blood his estranged daughter arrives and he manages to contact her through her dreams i think and he wants her to find out who killed him before his body entirely <UNK> in its grave br br there's not too much mystery about who did it or even how most viewers will have figured that out long before it is revealed i'm not sure the way he was killed would really have worked br br anyway the horror elements get in through a gory <UNK> the recurring dream of the man killing the boy a nightmare in which a plate of eggs turn into eyes which are then cut and several shots of the <UNK> man both in nightmares and actually in his grave br br i was a little surprised to see a dedication in the end by fulci to clive barker interesting
<START> a little girl lives with her father and brother in the middle of the countryside this little girl <UNK> has some psychotic <UNK> as the movie opens with her feeding <UNK> to some kind of creatures in the cemetery and she has recently lost her mother who went crazy but whilst alive enjoyed staying in the woods all night the premise of the film has a new young lady coming to <UNK> to take care of her she is introduced to the evil of the woods while driving and imagine the suspense here experiences a huge blue barrel falling over the side of a cliff to somehow stop her car dead in its tracks from there she walks to the nearest house and discovers mrs <UNK> who then goes into a whole lot of explanation about <UNK> and her family the <UNK> <UNK> by the mrs <UNK> character has to be seen to be believed well the young lady meets up with the child and we soon learn that not only is she strange but everyone in the film is very bizarre as well they all do share one thing in common which is none of them ever heard of an acting school none of these people can act as <UNK> by the few vehicles any of them in the entire film appeared in before or since and all of them look like they have little idea what is going on pause to remember lines and have all the conviction of a paper bag the director <UNK> through the material in a slow pace with this horrible piano music <UNK> here and there at things that are suppose to be scary it takes us a bit before we get to a couple of murders by the creature friends but by that time i didn't care the murders are not convincing either and truth be told the whole film looks like someone through it together on their friend's farm with the people and things on hand there that all being said the ending does have some creepy aspects to it though we don't learn one darn thing about why <UNK> is like this or more importantly who the creature with the cheap masks are cheap doesn't even begin to describe the budget here with it basically is a couple old <UNK> and some <UNK> at the end and of course the woods someone <UNK> the director a couple old cars too no special effects of any kind and only the most minimal make up there are so many <UNK> ridiculous moments to list but i will just list a few here that at the very least made me chuckle from the lack of <UNK> from the creative powers involved 1 watch the <UNK> body well after he has been <UNK> <UNK> comes in and sees him butchered and you can see his fat belly <UNK> with life 2 the dying scene at the end where the actress playing <UNK> is killed she looks like she is listening to directions and takes her sweet time dying considering the method 3 how about the guy playing <UNK> father giving us a <UNK> poor man's andy griffith the scene where he is laughing about boy <UNK> dying was a weird hoot the child is indeed a very bad film and is very bad even for the standards of 70's cheese if you will this isn't a b film but more like a z film with producer harry novak making some money on virtually nothing
<START> this is an excellent film about the characters in a adult swimming class their problems relationships and interactions with each other it should have managed a wider distribution as it's much better than similar films from major studios out at the same time br br the swimming <UNK> is an almost <UNK> reduced to teaching adults basic lessons and often the target of <UNK> from his female students he attempts more or less to <UNK> them off with varying results br br the students characters are mainstream u s a teachers policemen college students and retired people all of whom haven't learned to swim for some reason the movie covers their relationships including friends relatives and romantic <UNK> as they go through the class several subplots provide amusing fodder including a teacher going through a divorce some high school students making a documentary and a girl who is only in the class to meet guys br br this is a good date movie or just one to watch when you're in the mood for a romantic drama with overtones of reality
<START> <UNK> film with a <UNK> slow start give it a chance to start cooking story builds in interest and complexity characters and storyline <UNK> expectation and cliche at all the right moments superb new york city locations gritty real are a fantastic <UNK> to the commercial <UNK> of sex in the city in fact the entire film is an <UNK> to the hbo hollywood notion of new york city sex and relationships it's a rare film that treats its characters so honestly and <UNK> loved it great cast with notable performances by steve <UNK> rosario dawson and her love interest forgot his name
<START> i really enjoyed the first episode and am looking forward to more a little soft on the crime front it's almost an <UNK> and not terribly suspenseful or fleshed out but thought the romance angle was wonderfully charming will be watching again for sure br br i'm hoping that they'll have a bigger role for the aunts who are wonderful actresses and were somewhat underused this time around the actress who plays the assistant waitress also from <UNK> i think is very sweet and <UNK> and comes off as nicely <UNK> and sweet instead of dumb and annoying which is very nice br br check it out
<START> i loved october sky the thing i loved most had to be the music it worked two ways in the first hour of the film it gives the viewer a time frame this is done by playing songs from the late fifties in the second hour an <UNK> score takes over the music now fits the mood of the film perfectly br br i did not only enjoy the music i also quite enjoyed the cast jake <UNK> as homer <UNK> was especially a surprise for me he gave off a first class performance as did chris owen quentin and chris cooper john <UNK> br br i've seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now and both times i thoroughly enjoyed myself
<START> honestly i can't be bothered to spend my time writing about this <UNK> of cinematic incompetence life is simply too short what i will say is that alone in the dark succeeds in only three things 1 it will make you laugh but for all the wrong reasons 2 it manages to throw several useless plots into the air but dropping all of them br br and br br 3 it utterly <UNK> the classic pc game on which it is supposedly based by being a complete failure in all aspects of film making br br doctor boll if that is indeed what you are i'm thinking <UNK> here what on earth are you doing in a director's chair
<START> izzard was both hysterical and insightful in his humor he definitely represents his own little <UNK> in the comedic world br br it's a pity more americans won't see this stand up routine due to its pal only <UNK>
<START> i don't know why but after all the hype on <UNK> i thought this was a new movie all the best footage has been used for bbc <UNK> and <UNK> projects that you have seen if you are interested in nature programs it has been <UNK> with sappy narration and over dramatic music for disney to take advantage of earth day there are great moments and it is always nice to listen to darth vader <UNK> james earl jones speak but i had hoped for a ground breaking movie considering the new camera technology used in the making of this film it has been <UNK> for a child audience so one can actually see better footage for free on youtube i feel that we are due for something as ground breaking as <UNK> <UNK> and this movie is certainly not it
<START> one wonders why anyone would try to rehash successful movie plots that have already been seen like it's the case with this movie the wedding date is one of the best examples of why not to even try to remake under the <UNK> of a new story something that should have been let alone if a project like this goes ahead with the studio big <UNK> <UNK> then go all out with big stars and glossy production values that way people will come for the stars br br alas that's not what happens in this misguided attempt at comedy the problem seems to be the way the screen writers have <UNK> the story to london when basically this seems to be a typical american situation that not even the setting will be able to fix then there is the problem with the stars debra messing and <UNK> <UNK> they have as much chemistry as oil and <UNK> br br since the <UNK> and nick have no conflict from the start the viewer is not pulled into the film the way the creators thought they would be it's clear that <UNK> will fall for nick and vice versa in this predictable story amy adams who was the best asset in <UNK> comes across as a shallow girl who is willing to keep her lie going on and not come clean to the man that loves her and is going to marry her br br for anyone interested the credits at the end of the film run for almost seven minutes
<START> it's a very nice movie and i would definitely recommend it to everyone but there are 2 minus points the level of the stories has a large spectrum some of the scenes are very great and some are just boring a lot of stories are not self contained if you compare to f e coffee and <UNK> where each story has a point a message a punchline or however you wanna call it but well most stories are really good some are great and overall it's one of the best movies this year for sure br br annoying that i have to fill 10 lines at minimum i haven't got more to say and i don't want to start <UNK> the single sequences br br well i think that's it
<START> brainless film about a good looking but brainless couple who decide to live their dream and take people on diving <UNK> the pair almost instantly make the wrong choice of customers and get mixed up with some people seeking to recover the items that we see falling to the ocean floor during the opening credits sequence great looking direct to video movie could have been so much better if it wasn't so interested in primarily looking good performances are <UNK> and the plot is actually not bad or would have been had the director and producers not <UNK> the plot into making sure we see lots of <UNK> people in bathing suits or in what i'm guessing the reason for the <UNK> <UNK> a few fleeting bare breasts the film never <UNK> any tension nor rises above the level of a forgettable tv movie if you get <UNK> in to seeing this you won't <UNK> your eyes out since the eye candy is pleasant but we really need to stop producers from making films that are excuses to have a paid vacation
<START> dr seuss would sure be mad right now if he was alive cat in the hat proves to show how movie productions can take a classic story and turn it into a mindless pile of <UNK> we have mike myers as the infamous cat in the hat big mistake myers proves he can't act in this film he acts like a <UNK> show girl with a thousand tricks up his <UNK> the kids in this movie are all right somewhere in between the lines of dull and annoying the story is just like the original with a couple of <UNK> and like most movies based on other stories never <UNK> with the original story bringing in the evil neighbor <UNK> was a bad idea he is a stupid villain that would never get anywhere in life this movie is like a rejected comic strip from the newspaper if you think about it the film sure does look tacky sure there are a funny adult jokes like where the cat cuts of his tail and the <UNK> goes off before he says a naughty word mildly funny at least the grinch had <UNK> and the film was actually good this film is a cartoonish piece of <UNK> with bright colors and bad mediocre acting was mike myers even in this movie actually and another thing the fish what is with that stupid fish first time you see him he's an actual fish next time you see him he's all animated and talking but he looks like an animated piece of rubber play <UNK> this film is a total off target wreck good joke bad joke bad bad bad good joke i'm surprised it even had good jokes like the water park ride joke that was good so please if you have the choice watch the grinch instead of this mess
<START> i wasn't alive in the 60's so i can't guarantee that this movie was a completely accurate representation of the period but it is certainly a moving and fulfilling experience there are some excellent performances most notably by josh hamilton of with <UNK> jerry <UNK> <UNK> who play brothers divided by the war bill <UNK> a character actor who has been long ignored by many gives a heart filled performance as their strict father who is forced to question his own beliefs and values as one of his sons makes him proud by going to vietnam but returns empty inside while the other is exactly the opposite all in all this is a powerful and heartwarming film that i hope everyone gets a chance to experience
<START> december holiday <UNK> like the original <UNK> ought to be richly produced with quality music and a wholesome yet lighthearted storyline they should have a touch of the mystical magic of the holidays basically they should look sound and feel well special and they should have a decent and appropriate december holiday subtext br br so when i saw legend of <UNK> the snowman in the tv <UNK> i got my kids 6 and 8 <UNK> up for it by telling them the story of the original <UNK> and <UNK> relating how much i enjoyed it as a kid as my wife and kids <UNK> up on the couch to watch the movie the expectations were high but 10 minutes into it my kids were <UNK> and my wife and i were giving each other the look and rolling our eyes after 35 minutes my kids were actually asking to go to bed i guess they were fed up with the <UNK> language and pointless <UNK> segments i was actually embarrassed about their and my disappointment with this movie br br unfortunately legend of <UNK> the snowman is more like a bad episode of fairly odd parents crossed with a worse than normal episode of <UNK> bob than a classic holiday movie don't get me wrong those shows are fine and i like them as much as the next guy but when i watch fairly odd parents or <UNK> bob my low expectations for mediocre off color zero subtext mind numbing episodes are always satisfied br br we picked out some good books and spent the rest of the evening reading together a much better choice than the embarrassingly bad legend of <UNK> the snowman
<START> i just finished watching this on tv and what can i say but this is the worst film i have ever seen i'm embarrassed to be from melbourne where the film was made diabolical acting amateurish makeup effects and a really bad soundtrack as for the plot well thats even more stupid some of the scenes just left me stunned as to how bad it was there's a reason they put these types of films on late night tv because they're utter rubbish avoid at all costs
<START> this masterpiece of lesbian horror comes from exploitation master joseph w <UNK> it features plenty of soft core sex really hot lesbian sequences plus a lot of naked women the acting is pretty good and the film is quite atmospheric and well made marie <UNK> is one of the <UNK> chicks i have ever seen in a horror movie it's a visual pleasure to see her wonderful body <UNK> really knows how to pick up hot looking ladies a must see for fans of <UNK>
<START> perhaps one of the most overrated so called horror classics ever made halloween does feature the memorable michael myers and some great acting by jamie lee curtis br br however its <UNK> factor is very close to zero as there is an unforgivable amount of time spent on <UNK> <UNK> to the actual events br br this is the sort of movie you can walk away from to <UNK> popcorn and not miss anything at all br br how it <UNK> so many sequels i will never comprehend br br thank god rob zombie is <UNK> this and generally i hate remakes br br surely he will more than compensate for all the random time filling gaps with some quirky points of interest that the original severely lacks br br this is a movie we feel we have to like much like the way we're taught that we should enjoy dickens br br don't assume this is a classic
<START> stephen king movies are a funny thing with me i either really love them or i <UNK> them some of the <UNK> productions such as desperation and storm of the century i didn't enjoy some of the smaller ones i really loved <UNK> is one that i really do enjoy and watch it regularly br br the story revolves around charles brady and his mother mary they are <UNK> shape shifting creatures who although human like in appearance shift into a <UNK> like creature they are <UNK> to the scratch of cats and whenever they move to a new town lay out traps to catch and kill the animals when they move to their latest town they need to seek out a virgin and when charles finds one he actually falls for her but his mother needs to feed from her to keep up her strength the story revolves around what will happen with the girl will charles spare her or use her to save his mother br br although this story has overtones of incest which some may find unappealing it does actually play a part in the story and is therefore not just <UNK> in the movie for <UNK> sake like most stephen king stories it's based in a small town with lots of interesting characters the acting isn't the best nor are the special effects however somehow the whole thing tends to <UNK> and is very watchable and enjoyable adaption br br for uk readers this production has most recently been shown on <UNK> sci fi and sky thriller horror channels
<START> i first saw this film around ten years ago and i thought it was very funny indeed it was not as bad as some critics were making it out to be the fact that it was written by the usually <UNK> john hughes shows that you can at least expect some funny dialogue by the way i also think weird science is quite good which was also penned in lightning speed by hughes br br the film has a very <UNK> look to it using all the primary colours <UNK> <UNK> etc which makes it look quite unique the cast are also quite good the <UNK> bunny <UNK> and the devil possessed <UNK> <UNK> are a stand out br br the film has certainly dated a little but i personally prefer it to all the other <UNK> series
<START> yet another example of the complete waste of uk <UNK> money just how commercial did this film prove the film <UNK> who <UNK> this miserable garbage should be stranded on one of the london <UNK> <UNK> stations for allowing this clichéd dismal <UNK> to be committed to film a half mutant thing made up of all the horror movies the director has seen and felt fit to imitate most notably <UNK> amongst its many sins is the quite obvious failure to make the lead character remotely sympathetic until the last minute it's a little bit too late then surely all those development executives at the uk film <UNK> could have noticed this at the script stage add to this the terrible acting and the laughable appearance of the creature and you get a prime example of how not to scare
<START> martin <UNK> who directed the solid <UNK> will be taking the heat with wes craven for another <UNK> the hills have eyes 2 the memory of the legendary original which <UNK> an unbelievable storyline and a dog having a flashback will be <UNK> forever by this more technically polished remake in name only a bunch of national <UNK> and women are sent to a desert research area surrounded by hills filled with mutants one by one the weekend soldiers are picked off that's it there is some hardcore violence and a reasonably brutal rape scene but there is precious little else to get excited about the film's heroes are the usual bunch of clichés and the mutants a far cry from craven's original family mostly resemble brian thompson from <UNK> coupled with some creatures stan winston had left over from the wrong turn shoot much of the action takes place in <UNK> ala the descent and is well shot by sam <UNK> a laughable aspect is wes and jonathan craven's addition of a sympathetic mutant who <UNK> around his cave like <UNK> in <UNK> original chainsaw <UNK> will be blamed for this dull <UNK> but he's not really at fault because he does his best to maintain suspense and squeeze some <UNK> out of the contrived situations not a fan unfortunately
<START> possibly not but it is awful even the fantastic cast cant save it ok i admit it started off quite funny but it seemed to <UNK> downhill as soon as they jumped those girls in the <UNK> house bill murray turned from being a quick witted humorous guy into an <UNK> who was shouting things at people in the street that just weren't funny its like he was trying too hard to be funny his character stole a weapon an <UNK> come on and ends up being a national hero after <UNK> another country and killing god knows how many soldiers for a laugh one good point is that this film shows the <UNK> and incompetence of the us army and shows how arrogant and <UNK> they really are albeit unintentionally i actually felt disgusted that this kind of propaganda crap could really be released
<START> let's see in the st elsewhere finale we found out that there was no hospital and that every thing had been in the mind of an <UNK> child <UNK> ended by telling us that it had all been a dream and <UNK> ended by telling us that it all had taken place in her mind very creative annoying was more like it yes it was just a tv show and wasn't at all reality it's just that when you get caught up in a great movie or tv show you end up at least wanting to believe that it's all real at least as far as the reality it portrays on screen this type of series finale had been done twice before and was old hat frustrating and simply not fun to watch now <UNK> being all a dream at least done in a creative way that far <UNK> the expectations of anyone who loved the show the idea itself was not too engaging but it was so brilliantly done that its arguably the best series finale ever <UNK> left me feeling cheated after being such a loyal fan
<START> it says that a girl named susan <UNK> both wrote and directed this movie no wonder she has no other credits to her name for writing or directing she made a severe <UNK> error in choosing this as her career this is one of the worst human creations of this millennium br br the fundamental thing wrong with this movie other than its ridiculous story of a woman running away from four weak thugs is the blatant and complete lack of logic br br after she leaves the mall she gets approached by four thugs as they surround her tell me what woman would <UNK> <UNK> a potential <UNK> while being surrounded and insult them <UNK> i don't mean after an attack had already started because then of course it's completely normal for someone to fight back but she shoved that guy and pretty much <UNK> it to the next level no woman would do that unless she 1 had a weapon 2 has the confidence of knowing that <UNK> is very close and so is relatively safe from harm or 3 the <UNK> are so young and weak looking that she's pretty sure she can take them none of that applied in this situation so she was just acting like someone that's asking to get raped or <UNK> and by the way when the security guard approached as soon as he came within viewing distance of kim basinger why wouldn't she immediately either run towards him for help or scream br br when she drives off after the security guard gets shot in the head she drives into a deserted part of town and crashes she had a good three minute lead on the <UNK> instead of simply running off on foot in a <UNK> direction behind houses and climbing <UNK> and continuing she gets out her red <UNK> and starts messing around under her hood i understand she was trying to fix her car but she should've ran br br i didn't even mean this to be a <UNK> summary of the movie because i <UNK> people who do that in their reviews but it just so happens that every main sequence of this movie has something so blatantly stupid that i have to comment on it br br why would she carry a loud red <UNK> as she's trying to sneak away in the dark when she does get caught one of the <UNK> demands for her to open the <UNK> first she <UNK> then eventually opens it and takes out a <UNK> this scene here is so rich in subtle overtones of the complete failure of dramatic effect i have to break it down it's one of the dumbest scenes in the entire movie when asked to open the box she's <UNK> at first as if it were her plan to somehow get one of the thugs to open it themselves out of anger after she didn't open it in the same way that someone in some action movie might have some device that an enemy demands that person to touch push open manipulate and once that hero refuses to open it the enemy grabs that device only to have that device automatically <UNK> a chemical shoot him in the face render him unconscious which was the hero's plan all along it feels like that's what they tried to do with kim basinger here as she opens the <UNK> dramatically and quickly takes out a <UNK> and <UNK> one of the thugs and somehow gets away from him and the three other thugs br br throughout the rest of the movie basically what you see is this suburban house wife <UNK> around the woods as she carries her red <UNK> taking out various tools used as weapons to kill her <UNK> br br when she was running away how did she end up moving back to where the thugs were i think it was the scene where they had that radio playing <UNK> in tribute to the dead dude she somehow <UNK> up on them when i thought she was moving away from them br br finally this whole premise is so weak because the whole reason she's being chased in the first place is because from the <UNK> perspective she was a witness to a murder they committed against the security officer earlier and so they felt they had to kill her how ridiculous as one of the thugs even said they could've just left town and returned back to whatever city they drove from no one but her had seen them anyway and she probably didn't get the license plate even if these possibilities wouldn't work in their favor how is raising hell and hunting down someone to kill them <UNK> your chances to get away with the original murder
<START> as someone who lived through and still remembers that decade vividly if the actual '70s had been half this funny and semi normal they would have been so much more enjoyable actual kids in that era did not act or behave anything close to as bright eyed and normal as these kids did the country's youth was still under the influence of the hippies and the drug culture all that '60s rebellion that it <UNK> especially in the behavior department the <UNK> the <UNK> the self <UNK> the <UNK> the <UNK> of them none of the characters exhibit any of that br br someone compared to happy days and i can see why they were both sitcoms that take place 20 years before the current time they were broadcast and they both offer only surface cliched depictions of the actual <UNK> not even close to the full scope of it just showing the obvious things the fashions toys music <UNK> etc and that's it for those too young to remember or weren't born then trust me the '70s weren't like that any more than happy days were like the actual <UNK> as m a s h didn't accurately portray life at a us army medical base during the korean war etc
<START> while this movie has many flaws it is in fact a fun '80s movie eddie murphy peaks during his 80's movies here while his character is <UNK> from earlier movies his timing is almost flawless with perfect partners and <UNK> br br couple this with the hypnotic beauty of charlotte lewis this makes for a fun rainy day action comedy flick br br
<START> richard tyler is a little boy who is scared of everything he doesn't like riding his bike or climbing on his tree house because he knows what kind of <UNK> might happen to him so one day he is riding his bike and because it is starting to rain he decides to wait in the library until it stops <UNK> in there the whole story takes place he experiences all kinds of staff and in the end he is not scared any more but the whole story is unbelievable and even good actors like <UNK> culkin could not make the story better than it is
<START> how can the viewer rating for this movie be just 5 4 just the lovely young <UNK> porter should automatically start you at 6 when you decide your rating james belushi is good in this too his first good serious role i hadn't liked him in anything but about last night until this he was pretty good in gang related with <UNK> also kelly lynch you gotta love her well i do i'm only wondering what happened to miss porter br br i gave curly sue a 7
<START> every scene was put together perfectly this movie had a wonderful cast and crew i mean how can you have a bad movie with robert downey jr in it none have and ever will exist he has the ability to <UNK> up any movie with his amazing talent this movie was perfect i saw this movie sitting all alone on a movie shelf in blockbuster and like it was calling out to me i couldn't resist picking it up and bringing it home with me you can call me a sappy romantic but this movie just touched my heart not to mention made me laugh with pleasure at the same time even though it made me cry i admit at the end the whole movie just <UNK> up my <UNK> on life thereafter i suggested to my horror action and pure humor movie buff of a brother who absolutely <UNK> this movie this is a movie with a good sense of feeling it could make you laugh out loud touch your heart make you fall in love and enjoy your life every time you <UNK> walk past this movie just be aware that you are <UNK> making the choice to live and feel this inspiring movie who knows what if it could really happen to you and keep your mind open to the mystical wonders of life
<START> lies tells about an affair between an 18 year old <UNK> female student and a <UNK> <UNK> year old married man with the pair of <UNK> spending about half the screen time engaged in naked sex and hokey <UNK> and the other half meandering through the <UNK> naive storyline which seems little more than an excuse for the sex scenes with very poor production value including obvious <UNK> <UNK> and phony <UNK> sex to a story which is a messy mix of comedy and drama lies quickly becomes redundant ad <UNK> with an almost 2 hour run subtitles and so little substance lies is simply not <UNK> c
<START> hello this movie is well okay just kidding its awesome it's not a block buster smash hit it's not meant to be but its a big hit in my world and my sisters we are <UNK> <UNK> go ramones this is a great movie for me
<START> please humour me if you will for a minute while i read you the back of the alley cat vhs box it says that br br in this part of the city every street is a dead end on every corner something to buy in every alley another way to die to survive you're got to be the best just like the alley cat alley cat this lady owns the night on the streets where even the <UNK> become victims she knows how to survive cross her and you've run out of luck alley cat this animal is <UNK> br br now isn't that one of the most pathetic <UNK> you've ever heard in your life whoever wrote that must be insane if they thought such a awful description could <UNK> us into viewing the video yet unfortunately <UNK> <UNK> individual was responsible for that tragic use of english was doing their job only too well the movie contained within the little plastic case is as bad as it sounds and then some br br <UNK> <UNK> plays the title role and the script basically tells her during every given scene to either a <UNK> like a <UNK> b kick male butt or c show off her feminine <UNK> no complaints about the latter but in terms of the other two let's just say she isn't much of an actress and is even less convincing as a martial arts expert but even meryl streep with <UNK> <UNK> body what a scary thought would fail to save this movie the unfolding of the plot is boring beyond belief as we get one <UNK> directed fight sequence after enough <UNK> only for hysterical courtroom <UNK> and the occasional gag inducing love scene with the interestingly named robert <UNK> the camera work also follows a similar path of shame with far too many <UNK> close ups and continuity errors abound br br the part that i think really sums this <UNK> bucket of a movie up is where our heroine is sexually <UNK> and finds herself <UNK> in front of a corrupt judge while her rich kid rapist <UNK> at her from the box not only does he get off <UNK> free despite the overwhelming evidence against him but she herself is then <UNK> for daring to protest about the verdict in front of his honour behind bars she then has a group shower a lesbian crush a couple of cat fights and a nice <UNK> game of <UNK> before being released on <UNK> to continue her battle this ten minute section has nothing to do with the rest of the movie and the screenplay <UNK> to a halt to <UNK> it i can only imagine the producers wanted to add a bit more t a to the mix and came up with this needless sub plot as a means to achieving that end br br which kinds of begs the question is this an exploitation film or a serious drama neither is my response to that it isn't sleazy or camp enough to appeal to fans of troma style cinema and it certainly doesn't make the grade as an exploration of one woman's fight against the system purely because it is so <UNK> made so who on earth would want to see it <UNK> i guess or imdb reviewers who stay up till <UNK> and watch any old rubbish on the box while trying to get to sleep sadly on this occasional i failed and the horrors will stay with me for quite some time don't make the same mistake i did have a hot milk or something 1 10
<START> i wouldn't recommend this unless you're keen on david <UNK> and want to complete the set there are some good performances e g <UNK> <UNK> and well directed moments e g the beating but on the whole it really <UNK> in comparison with the 1999 bbc version as well as earlier versions br br there are inexplicable changes to the story that really serve no great purpose except possibly to dumb it down the stolen <UNK> being a case in point the american cast were poorly chosen sally field is a good actress but she is wrong as <UNK> <UNK> and her english accent is only slightly better than dick van <UNK> cockney i can see why michael richards was chosen to play mr <UNK> he <UNK> it up rather too much however and becomes irritating he also speaks his lines in an accent that goes beyond eccentric and becomes simply preposterous anthony andrews is menacing as mr <UNK> but one almost expects him to don a black cape and tie david's mother to a <UNK> line though this is perhaps partly the fault of dickens br br i got this for free with a newspaper it helped pass a sunday afternoon but i felt more disappointed than <UNK> at the end of it
<START> featuring a fascinating performance by will smith and a story that <UNK> at your <UNK> harder than a rock <UNK> mid solo seven pounds races past the director's previous collaboration with the actor the pursuit of happiness a flick which i also loved remember <UNK> <UNK> name because some of his movies may skip by <UNK> if the actor attached to the project isn't quite so high profile br br too bad i figured out will smith's scheme early on i put two and two together when he calls in his own suicide in the first scene and the scene when rosario <UNK> character is introduced as having an <UNK> heart disease br br however i still think the writer director made the right choice putting the <UNK> <UNK> are the first and the last scene in that way it's the source of urgency and tension in the movie finding out gradually how exactly a man can be driven to that ultimate sacrifice and it was heartbreaking to see the relationship between smith's and <UNK> character <UNK> and develop knowing in the back of the mind always what was in store for these unlucky two br br one of my friends with whom i saw the movie thought smith's character could have a divine gift and i understand why his performance is almost <UNK> when in the presence of his seven elected ones yet at other times he could be harsh and scary and when he's alone the full weight of his situation got too much for him and he breaks down completely it's quite a versatile performance br br lastly i can't forget to mention the crash scene re <UNK> which was really quite stunningly done in terms of cinematography paired with music put this on your list
<START> so far after week two of the lone of beauty i am a little disappointed br br some of the acting is good as long as we except that it is only drama br br i am unsure how people can feel that this fictional drama is factual coverage of the <UNK> years it is okay as drama but i feel the award winning book is still much better br br i wonder if the bbc will ever give us the follow up and the next part of the drama and the years that follow with things can only get better finishing with 2006 and the fact that we are still waiting with that promise from a government that is full of sleaze
<START> i can remember seeing this movie as a kid in 1977 or 1978 hbo would show it late at night back when they were they one and only movie pay channel in existence back then it was <UNK> and was the only movie of its kind ever shown on pay television especially back then i would love to see it now as an adult where i would be more apt to understand the adult theme of it it was probably the closest thing i had ever seen to pornography at the young age of 7 or 8 luckily i had stupid <UNK> and party going parents on the <UNK> most of my memory of this movie was the completely <UNK> sexual behavior of these two guys breaking into houses to <UNK> underwear feeding on a <UNK> breast milk on a public bus and <UNK> in a cab at the request of one of their female subjects were just a few of the whacked <UNK> these guys were pulling off a very <UNK> film for the early '70s until i checked imdb i had no idea this movie had such a following most people i talk to have never heard of it
<START> comparable to fight club the matrix a i sixth sense among others this film approaches the psyche in a way never done before the first 30 minutes builds a interesting love story between diaz cruise <UNK> the rest of the movie is well confusing you'll pick more every time you watch it i've gone to the movies to see it 3 times now
<START> you know you are in trouble watching a comedy when the only amusing parts in it are from the animal cast it is a pity then that the parrot cat dog were only in support not the other way around as the humans in it were pretty abysmal throughout br br if i were you paul eva lake what sort of name is that jason lindsay i would forget this acting <UNK> do something else as all of you are as funny as watching paint dry awful actors to boot br br the main gag in the film is one of the characters shouting me not gay which is funny as if you weren't you might change your mind if you had to put up with the three <UNK> tedious dare i say very plain women leads in the film br br the worst film i have seen in years hopefully never see one as bad again though i expect not
<START> this film had such promise what a great idea an underdog <UNK> team struggling for recognition and personal glory only to lose it's speed due to bad <UNK> poor editing and a half written story the characters in the beginning were interesting only to lose steam half way through to become one dimensional people <UNK> out tired one liners br br maybe if they spent some more time on the story and <UNK> it would have been a great movie instead of a almost <UNK> effort
<START> professor paul <UNK> is doing research in matter <UNK> he has developed a machine that he can use to make an object like a <UNK> watch or <UNK> disappear only to have that object re <UNK> in a different location but there are those at his research facility that do not like or <UNK> of his experiments and will do whatever it takes to see that he doesn't succeed after a failed <UNK> that might have saved his funding professor <UNK> decides to test his machine on himself as expected things go horribly wrong and he is transformed into a heavily scared madman whose mere touch will kill br br in <UNK> maybe it wasn't such a good idea to re watch the projected man in the same week i watched the fly return of the fly and curse of the fly there seems to be only so many movies about matter <UNK> and the potentially horrendous effects it can have on the human body that one person should be made to endure in a three or four day period i'm not sure what those responsible for the movie list as their source material for the projected man but much of it is so similar to the fly movies that it cannot be mere coincidence however the projected man isn't even nearly as good as the worst of the fly trilogy br br besides being terribly unoriginal the projected man has several other problems that really hurt the enjoyment of the movie a big issue i have is with <UNK> <UNK> in the lead he's such a <UNK> ass that not only do i not care about his suffering i actually root for it supporting cast members mary <UNK> and ronald allen are almost as bad they're so bland and dull they hardly matter in fact there's very little to get excited about while watching the projected man the soundtrack  not very memorable the look  i would describe much of it as <UNK> the plot  predictable the action  there isn't any overall this is one to avoid br br fortunately i watched the projected man via a copy of the mystery science theater 3000 episode funny stuff while not an absolute very often the <UNK> the movie  the better the mst3k <UNK> the guys hit almost all of their marks with the projected man i'll give it a very enthusiastic 4 5 on my mst3k rating scale
<START> this version is pretty insipid i'm afraid jane eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood but william <UNK> weary throwaway acting style is completely <UNK> to the bold passion of edward rochester and poor charlotte <UNK> looks like a bored <UNK> teenager whose dental <UNK> hurt i also can't believe that they eliminated <UNK> great marriage <UNK> scene from the end of the book one of the most moving moments in literature i do appreciate that they finally used such a young plain woman to play jane a character who is supposed to be a <UNK> 18 but if you want to see a version that closer <UNK> the personalities and passions of the novel please see the 70's version with george c scott and <UNK> york york was too old tall and pretty to play jane but no one has touched <UNK> character the way that scott did
<START> i'm a fan of tv movies in general and this was one of the good ones the cast performances throughout were pretty solid and there were twists i didn't see coming before each commercial to me it was kind of like medium meets <UNK> br br did anyone else think that in certain lights the daughter looked like a young nicole kidman are they related in any way i'd definitely watch it <UNK> or rent it if it ever comes to video br br <UNK> was great haven't seen in her in a lot of things and she did her job very convincingly br br if you're into to tv mystery movies check this one out if you have a chance
<START> i got to see this just this last friday at the los angeles film festival at <UNK> on beverly this movie got the most applause of all the films that evening considering that two music videos opened first i didn't know what to expect since they were very fast and attention grabbing i wasn't sure i was ready for a short immediately but to my surprise i really enjoyed this i thought the main actor demon guy was really good i was so impressed with his performance that i checked out his name i was surprised to see that this was the <UNK> guy he's gotten really good especially since then either that or he was given lousy roles or had been pushed by the director really hard for this short the girl did an okay job i guess its hard since it was her first performance and being so young the dad did well also there was a lot of really nice cg work for a short both for this and the short playing next mexican hat which was also nice but i enjoyed this the most because it had the most depth and emotion and i actually cared about the characters the other was a very simple story the story was quite <UNK> and dark it dealt with real topics using a more fantasy like approach to keep add people like me interested we won't even talk about the last film in the block which i left my only complaint is that i only wish i had seen more of the demon character and a little less of getting started which is why i gave it a 9 out of 10 i also thought the end credits went a little slowly otherwise it was beautifully told directed and edited the timing was very nice with a complete change from the fast mtv editing done on everything nowadays there will be more coming from this director in the future as well as the actor i now will think of him as the <UNK> lost actor not the <UNK> guy
<START> <UNK> laurence probably didn't intend on having any of her novels adopted for film let alone the stone angel <UNK> as a character was one who constantly challenged the social norm <UNK> who dare anyone and ended up nearly <UNK> her humanity in the process the symbols in the book the stone angel silver thread etc etc are constant <UNK> of this struggle of the old and new and the carnage so to speak along the way br br while the film is reasonably faithful to the plot of the book but it isn't really a plot kind of storytelling is it i think it missed the point on capturing the spirit of the film <UNK> <UNK> for the sake of <UNK> was not there <UNK> could have been a lot more crude than portrayed and <UNK> father could have been played more <UNK> so to speak if the filmmaker would insisted on stronger portrayals the film would drive the point straight to home br br along the same vein why should we see cell phones <UNK> produce and other <UNK> are we trying make some points for the sake of making some points e g the muslim girlfriend and the native people <UNK> and co are everything but politically correct in the book so why should we see that in the film version <UNK> may be an excuse for a low budget operation but using that as an excuse to send <UNK> politically correct messages that are totally irrelevant to the novel and the film seems like throwing punches below the intellect br br there is also the audience it seems that we have been <UNK> to see bitter old people as cute and lovable why should be laugh every time <UNK> is at her <UNK> i doubt <UNK> laurence wanted her readers to laugh at or with <UNK> these people are frustrated and are full of angst and all we do is to laugh at them i don't think it did <UNK> and other folks in her situation any justice
<START> faith <UNK> better known as dr ruth in this island earth is the only reason to watch this film the story is very thin and once the air force buddies return to the states with a <UNK> curse upon them the action is just a waiting game see faith the snake woman and try to pretend the rest isn't happening
<START> if this movie was about a fictional character the movie could stand on its own and be judged <UNK> unfortunately for the viewer the movie is based on facts that are <UNK> very unfairly toward <UNK> carter many of the smaller facts were <UNK> carter was not number one <UNK> at the time of the murders there is no proof at all that he saved a friend from a child <UNK> in his youth but some of the larger facts like apparently being robbed of a decision to joey <UNK> because of racist judges is <UNK> to those of us who have seen the fight on tape and completely <UNK> to <UNK> why hollywood feels the need to make a hero out of someone who at best was in trouble and around trouble much more than any normal person should be was arrested multiple times for beating women is strange to me <UNK> carter was never by viewing his actions in the 60's and even now when he refuses to speak to his son a person that people can look up to everyone knows that <UNK> can direct and washington can act but why they chose this story as their vehicle is beyond me is hollywood so much in need of a black hero that they need to bend the truth in all of their bio <UNK> to make them believable <UNK> a suggestion how about denzel playing a movie about himself now thats inspirational based on all of the inaccuracies in the movie i would suggest passing on this one
<START> sitting on the front <UNK> of his <UNK> home ted <UNK> told me that he and reed hadley wore the exact same size in every item of clothing except hat br br ted one of the greatest of the stunt men said that every time zorro put on his mask he was the one on the screen br br that was a little bit of an exaggeration there were times that zorro was obviously reed hadley but in the stunts we can be satisfied it was ted at work br br and what stunts <UNK> fighting legion is as witness the comments here one of the greatest of serials it is exciting and generally very well made br br reed hadley was a fine actor and as someone else commented he made a very good <UNK> br br but admittedly it is the action that makes this movie so great br br and what else could we expect with direction by that excellent team <UNK> and english with great music from the amazingly prolific william <UNK> the listing here says he was uncredited but that is incorrect those other <UNK> listed here were indeed uncredited and i don't know if they did write any of the music it sounds like <UNK> and with <UNK> from among others the great charles king and with dozens of bit parts br br also noteworthy was a villain played by the radio tarzan jim pierce who was edgar rice <UNK> son in law i urge you to read his mini bio br br there is one chapter that slows things down <UNK> but heck it's only a few minutes long maybe 20 and when you <UNK> through it well you're back to the excitement br br turner classic movies deserves a great big thank you for presenting this excellent serial and we should ask tcm to bring us more br br and we should thank everyone involved that we get to see it as a chapter play or serial and not as a re cut feature
<START> i have seen all the films directed by robert redford and appreciated his love of the american people and the land in a river runs through it redford displays the <UNK> <UNK> and visual <UNK> of the high rocky mountains of montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the <UNK> of thomas <UNK> or albert <UNK> this film makes love to the visual and the word with text by author norman <UNK> and stunning camera work by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kiss <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> cast is perfect tom <UNK> is the <UNK> <UNK> a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the bible brenda <UNK> the mother and his sons craig <UNK> and brad pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons and later complex young men both <UNK> and pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever it is the relationships between men father and sons brothers and their women to the outside world that grounds a river runs through it to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of hollywood films produced in recent years br br what makes these relationships special however is the attention redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue this is a <UNK> script beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning montana rivers and mountains the words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material while the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story it is not so implausible in <UNK> directorial hands given the material <UNK> <UNK> to a simpler time and life is worth <UNK> again and again
<START> this movie is the worst i've seen in the last 5 years it is surprising how brilliant actors like two main characters in this movie has accepted to act in such worthless peace of trash the film is rape beating and revenge genre couple has gone to party and on the way back they hit a deer and he went out to finish it when a <UNK> full of bad guys comes he didn't go to their car instead he has been kicked and well beaten while she tries to run the car engine which <UNK> her and she has been gang raped then somehow she is in her fathers house and one of bad guys is her neighbor so she took shotgun and wanted to kill him so stupid scenario <UNK> hollywood he was against that revenge but she is raped they laugh to her so she must kill them all but once inside the house she was satisfied by pushing <UNK> top in bad guys <UNK> and went away while he has gone crazy and <UNK> bad guy personally i think that director run out of money before finishing this because movie ends before they <UNK> anyone else involved in this gang rape and beating which is not big surprise because <UNK> obviously has seen this and wanted to take back his money lol this movie is not even for people who enjoy watching rape because they won't see anything they are looking for this director should be banned it is for <UNK> that this peace of trash has been made by british cinematography which i personally like and that is the reason i've watched this don't do it yourself you have better things to do that watching stupid scenario film
<START> if you were brought up on a <UNK> of <UNK> you'll understand that you gradually need a bigger and better fix well in the world of the running man your needs will be <UNK> for in this game show prisoners compete for freedom and the ultimate prize their very lives br br i loved this film it was such a parody on the mind numbing tripe that we watch on a daily basis it isn't one of <UNK> best performances but on the whole it is a very good film the underlying idea that television <UNK> will one day be the real <UNK> of the planet is very believable and is very well portrayed in this film of course there are the usual arnie one liners my favourite is when he is about to be <UNK> into the <UNK> the <UNK> host asks any last words arnie says yeah i'll be back but the host <UNK> only in a re run and <UNK> the <UNK> button i give this film a 10 for sheer originality i must have watched it 30 or more times the only film apart from the die hard series that i watched this often br br in short do not for a minute think that you own the t v it owns you
<START> having been forced by my children to watch this at least 10 times for each of the last 2 <UNK> i feel adequately <UNK> to pass judgment on this version of dr <UNK> classic tale and well it's not very good first off following a classic act like chuck jones' animated tv special is going to be difficult for anyone but this interpretation is so heavy handed and padded as to be positively numbing i will <UNK> that there are a handful of inspired gags but overall the film comes off as a <UNK> cash grab at the same time as it is supposedly <UNK> the <UNK> of christmas jim carrey is typically over the top here but that is completely at odds with the character of the grinch as <UNK> by boris karloff he was a slow burn <UNK> and sly there is no method to <UNK> madness and that is only the most obvious error made talented actors like jeffrey <UNK> and christine <UNK> are utterly wasted here why universal why i mean i understand that tony hopkins will take just about any role offered much like his <UNK> michael caine but this one needs to be <UNK> under films that should never have been made this does not <UNK> well for the cat in the hat an even thinner <UNK> that universal is <UNK> for this christmas i get the feeling that i will be making the same recommendation for that one as i am with this one skip it and either read the book or watch the tv special this is 2 hours you can never ever get back
<START> i watched about 30 minutes into this film before i finally got sick of getting <UNK> over the head with this movie the soundtrack the so called <UNK> and each and every actor it's like they all think they're the main part of the movie and scream notice me over and over again the bad guy has his bad guy music going on and says sinister bad guy like things just in case you didn't quite catch on the good guy does brave and noble things just in case you didn't know he was the good guy and oh lord the plane scene my husband is missing oh my god it's impossible that he got up to stretch his legs or go to the toilet or anything he must be missing and yes i know his clothes were still there but honestly she woke up and started to panic before she even had time to look at the damn seat he'd been in br br as a religious girl i want to apologize to the world for wasting the film this was <UNK> on br br and i want my 30 minutes back
<START> <UNK> i am working my way through the chilling classics 50 movie pack collection and <UNK> is the seventh movie in the set released in 1990 <UNK> seems to be a remake of the <UNK> age vampire which also featured a scientist <UNK> for similar results set in modern times <UNK> is not my kind of horror movie br br a university <UNK> is working to crack the human <UNK> in order to create a serum that would prevent aging <UNK> by the administration to <UNK> his papers and produce some results or risk losing funding the scientist decides to use himself as a guinea pig at first thinking that he suffered no <UNK> side effects he eventually discovers that the serum has indeed altered him in the most unexpected manner br br the acting is stilted and the performances left me with a much <UNK> interest in the film the score is <UNK> and the science behind the experiments and their <UNK> is not only <UNK> it's absurd it's ridiculous  at best br br as others noted the end turns into a 30 minute gag which is seemingly endless without giving too much away i'd call this one dr <UNK> and mr hyde meet the creature from the black <UNK> meets home alone
<START> this story had a different angle that intrigued me enough to buy a previously viewed vhs sight unseen that was a mistake br br in what could have been a very nice story about badly crippled people at a hospital and their various personalities turned quickly into a very <UNK> soap opera with unlikeable characters br br we have <UNK> william forsythe the stereotype racist white person who says the f word every other sentence and is so despicable they didn't give him a first name in the movie he's a lot of fun to be around then there is raymond hill wesley snipes a fast talking <UNK> snipes must have liked those fast talking hip arrogant roles because he played in a number of them like in white men can't jump then there is sweet helen hunt playing anna that wonderful caring loving person who is having an <UNK> affair with the leading character in the film joel garcia eric <UNK> br br <UNK> this is heartwarming feel good type stuff it just makes my heart melt watching these nice folks but if you are one of those who loves sleazy characters portrayed by sleazy people in this sleazy film you might really like this add in a dose of hollywood political correctness and there you go what more could anyone want
<START> this is not a movie you watch for entertainment at least most people i know would not br br it's <UNK> the cruelty to both body and mind that happen in a war pretty well the characters seem plausible especially because you read their minds something more often found in books and rarely in movies however done very well in this piece i would place it next to all quiet on the western front and die <UNK> in terms of leaving a lasting impression br br i wish i could screen it at school along with the other two movies however finding a copy of it showed to be pretty hard which is a shame
<START> bela lugosi plays dr <UNK> who loves his wife so much that he will do anything to keep her young this film starts off with a wedding as the bride is about to take her <UNK> she suddenly <UNK> she is <UNK> dead and taken away by <UNK> trouble is that these are not real <UNK> but body <UNK> a wave of bride deaths at the <UNK> and their body disappearing <UNK> the police enter reporter patricia hunter to solve the case she does track down dr <UNK> but he also decides to use her youth to keep his wife young also
<START> this movie is simply incredible i had expected something quite different form the film that i actually saw however it is very insightful in that it shows the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its <UNK> with animal behavior let me warn those among the readers of this article who are easily offended by content that is all too sexual for the explicit sexual nature of this film feels like a high brow sort of pornography it even features a scene that comes extremely close to rape br br meanwhile i strongly suggest seeing this rare work of sexual art every minute of the picture <UNK> the sexual spirit of the seventies by the way one should not forget how times have changed br br go see it it´s worth your money and time
<START> i am a great fan of the batman comics and i became disappointed when i could no longer find batman the animated series on tv anymore i was excited to learn that there was going to be a new batman cartoon on tv i watched the first episode the day it premiered and i was very disappointed br br first of all the animation is very poor it looks like a cheap crappy japanese anime then again just about every modern day cartoon is like that br br the character designs are even worse batman looks more like <UNK> <UNK> looks more like <UNK> <UNK> looks more like a red version of the hulk the penguin is a kung fu master mr freeze is some undead thing with an iceberg on his head and the <UNK> is a gothic marilyn <UNK> look alike which is funny because i don't expect people who are obsessed with <UNK> and <UNK> to be gothic br br the worst character design is that of the joker they turned him into a monkey demented bob <UNK> kung fu fighter the joker is supposed to be <UNK> <UNK> enemy but in this show he hardly poses a threat because his crimes are so stupid and pointless in one episode his plan was to put his joker <UNK> in dog food oh how evil batman is a fascinating and complex character because he is haunted by the deaths of his parents which is why he fights crime this version of batman doesn't seem haunted by his parents' deaths and is not interesting at all he's also not a detective just a fighter if there's an enemy he can't defeat he won't study the enemy to find out their weak points like a detective would he'll just build a giant fighting robot to defeat them a lot of times this show doesn't even feel like a batman show just another brainless anime that's nothing but pointless fighting br br what i hate the most about this show is what they did to the villains they've taken away everything that makes them likable and <UNK> and turned them into stereotypical evil bad guys man bat is the biggest example in the comics he's a tragic scientist who studies bats to find a cure for his <UNK> when <UNK> on himself he accidentally transforms himself into a giant bat creature in this show he's a mad scientist who wants to <UNK> <UNK> himself into a giant bat creature for no apparent reason just about all the villains are like that none of them with the exception of about one or two have an actual motive for their crimes br br the worst characterization is that of mr freeze in the comics freeze was a just a mad scientist until the genius writer paul <UNK> wrote the <UNK> episode heart of ice which gave freeze a new origin that made him a more tragic three dimensional and likable villain the episode was so popular that fans accepted it as his actual origin and it was even used in the comics as his origin even that crappy movie batman robin used it as his origin in this show he's a petty jewel thief before becoming mr freeze after becoming mr freeze guess what he's still a petty jewel thief great origin no wonder they used it over the one <UNK> created br br as a batman fan i don't dislike this show just because it isn't like the comics because i also liked <UNK> the batman cartoons that came after it tim <UNK> batman films and obviously the superb christopher nolan batman films none of them were 100 loyal to the comics but they were still very good the problem with this show is not that it's not exactly like the comics or <UNK> it's that it lacks any sort of depth that makes other batman media so popular br br i've given this show so many chances but the more i watch the more i find that disappoints me i miss the good old days back when batman cartoons were something everyone could enjoy
<START> i just watched this movie last night and i had to put a warning out for anybody else considering to see this film in a word don't i seriously feel like this is something that a <UNK> student would have written in a quentin tarantino eddie murphy phase i e every other word was a curse word i don't have a problem with <UNK> <UNK> as in good will hunting provided it helps to delve more into the characters in this case it was just hollow banter with the attempt to draw an <UNK> gasp or laughter from the audience the three lead characters are all their own unique stereotype the wall street jerk the coffee house jerk and the i'm not gay just in touch with my feminine side slightly less of a jerk you just don't give a damn about any of them they are all shallow <UNK> losers who you want to see lose for those who dare this film does have a couple funny moments the very beginning and the very end the toilet <UNK> scene is funny in a sick kinda uh yeah way really though i would only recommend this film to my worst of enemies
<START> an enjoyable batman animated film not on par with return of the joker or mask of the phantasm but solid nonetheless i liked how the movie kept you guessing as to who batwoman was there was nice twist nice action sequences i've always been of the opinion that the batman cartoons are better then any of the pitiful batman live action film sequels the trend continues here br br 7 5 out of 10
<START> what a loss the passing of director <UNK> <UNK> was he could take a light script and with the right casting and editing put a <UNK> in it and make it shine like a star this particular star may not be the <UNK> in the sky as great romances go but it is definitely one that keeps you tuned in to the end you really want to know how things are going to work out br br the script is perfect for <UNK> shepherd who at the time needed to capitalize on her <UNK> success for the new generation who was fortunately for her probably unaware of how many big screen major <UNK> she had after a very promising start in this film she's every bit back in form as a still <UNK> widow living <UNK> through her daughter mary stuart masterson on the <UNK> of stardom which would peak with fried green tomatoes two years later she may have looked too young for the role but that works well for the way the story unfolds this is her film but she doesn't <UNK> her <UNK> as a lead br br shepherd <UNK> allows robert downey jr to carry much of the film and shows a more mature comic flair than he had in his previous films to that point and there's ample support from ryan <UNK> in his best role in years and christopher macdonald <UNK> natural charm pretty much <UNK> on its own either that or she has a way of making her character seem like a breath of fresh air with every word br br <UNK> makes good use of his <UNK> sex appeal the same way he did with dirty dancing but this film is not quite as <UNK> so you could still watch it with your parents if they happened to be in the room use your best judgment they're your parents after all i give this film a high mark because it is very user friendly romantic comedy <UNK> will find it sublime and those who are just watching along with them should find plenty of humor to enjoy as well br br again credit goes to <UNK> <UNK> for making the most of a charming script by randy and perry <UNK> where are they now <UNK> next film would be the <UNK> in sequel to three men and a baby but his final theatrical release sister act would finally give him the nine figure <UNK> smash hit he deserved mr <UNK> your cinematic touch is missed
<START> this should have been a movie about sam and his wife the glorious peter falk and equally glorious olympia dukakis that would have been a movie worth seeing instead it's a paul reiser vehicle with a little falk thrown in the wonderful elizabeth <UNK> is also in this movie but you'd hardly know it i presume reiser is under the impression that he's a giant movie star who needs an appropriate vehicle he's not even more <UNK> is that reiser took the trouble to hire some of the best women character actresses on the screen today and then shoved them all into his background dukakis does not show up until the last 15 minutes but when she does the screen <UNK> the story is about falk and dukakis really but we're subjected to a pointless silly preposterous road trip in which reiser gets to show how very cute precious and oh so deep with psychological insight wrong he can be for instance in a restaurant scene that i imagine reiser had hoped was cassavetes like there's a laughably false confrontation between reiser and falk that is so <UNK> ridiculous i was embarrassed for falk
