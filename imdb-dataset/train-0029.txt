<START> warning spoiler i have to agree with you it was almost there this was such a bad movie about such and interesting true story it had such promise but the acting was ridiculous at best some sets were beautiful and realistic others are something out of a theme park i found myself laughing as i watched what was suppose to be serious scenes i really wanted to like this movie but i couldn't the best part was the fight between friends that ended with the king dying i liked the <UNK> punishment and the final shot made a beautiful picture though there are so many better movies to watch i don't recommend this
<START> my husband and i were intrigued by the spectacle a strong <UNK> southern lady with a messy personal life <UNK> crimes for the <UNK> the first season was must see tv for us unfortunately the stories of her personal life in the second season became so tedious and <UNK> of the strong character that we stopped watching br br my husband and i were troubled by the episode where she tries to hide from her mother the fact that she is <UNK> up but the deal <UNK> was the episode where she hides her possible <UNK> from her boyfriend but tells her boss why would a strong middle aged woman do those things the answer is she wouldn't additionally my husband and i pick out the bad guy with almost perfect accuracy it is almost always a white male or female introduced in cameo at the murder scene or in an <UNK> family can't the script writers do something original from time to time as i mentioned we are no longer viewers we prefer shows that don't <UNK> the characters and insult our intelligence
<START> i have read many comments on this site <UNK> the blob for being cheesy and or campy the movie has been <UNK> for amateurish acting and weak special effects what would you expect from a group of folks whose only experience has been in the production of low budget <UNK> produced valley <UNK> <UNK> christian shorts let me tell those overly critical reviewers that this film never took itself all that serious that fact should be evident from the <UNK> theme music complete with silly lyrics played over the opening credits for what it was meant to be this film is excellent i have seen a few of the recent ultra low budget attempts blair witch project was one of them that have absolutely no entertainment value or intelligent thought behind their plot <UNK> was pure <UNK> the blob on the other hand was well thought out well scripted and thoroughly entertaining the scene where the old man comes across the <UNK> and <UNK> the mass contained within with a stick was excellently done and genuinely creepy the scene in the doctor's office with the blob slowly moving under the <UNK> on the <UNK> while it consumed the old man was a cinematic horror masterpiece bottom line is i love this movie i challenge anyone out there to take <UNK> 000 00 <UNK> for today's dollar value and make a film anywhere near as entertaining and or as successful as the blob it just can't be done period br br thank you for taking time to read this review
<START> it's this sort of movie that you try and imitate by attempting to realise something then flying through the air almost immediately i'd like to do that and i know you would too br br great stuff
<START> 7 if you're a kid 6 if you claim to be an adult this semi sequel to the lion king sees to spin off side characters <UNK> and <UNK> retelling the original story through their eyes including the story of how they met in the grand tradition of disney inferior sequels are made and occasionally tv series featuring the adventures of minor characters from their biggest hits you can be as <UNK> as you want about this but kids and fans of the series will likely not care their are enough jokes and songs and interesting things to ensure that this is one of the few above average sequels this works because of the charm of the much loved central characters the quick pace the in jokes involving the first film and for older viewers there are some funny gags the animation is as good as ever if a little less flamboyant than the original but the plot here is all about taking it easy <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> and <UNK> decide to watch the events of the first film frequently stopping mid film to joke about parts of it like a real audience we see how <UNK> is a near <UNK> he feels he does not fit in and decides to go looking beyond what he sees to find his ideal home on the way he meets <UNK> another <UNK> and they become friends soon they meet <UNK> a lion <UNK> natural predator of t and p but they form a trio however when <UNK> realises he must follow his own destiny and leave the group it is up to the others to decide whether to help or not and how of course the usual disney elements and themes are here friendship good versus evil etc the plot is simple but works on many levels making it smarter than your average animated movie as the cg movies appear disney's traditional form must become smarter but not forget the roots which made them popular toy story and all that have come since have been clever with jokes to suit all ages and it seems this is the way the market is shifting however there will always be a place for films like this and you cannot go wrong buying this for the youngsters br br 7 out of 10
<START> an update of the skits and jokes you would have seen on a <UNK> stage in the first half of the 20th century it's a string of several jokes acted out some of them you could tell your grandmother some of them not but it's a fairly safe bet she's heard them all before for what it tries to be it's not too bad before you rent it remember that it's an older style of entertainment and has more value as history than as comedy or <UNK> robin williams has a couple of bits but he's <UNK> with the other players
<START> this doesn't quite <UNK> the depths of <UNK> 3 but it comes close it also uses the same technique of using some of the same actors in multiple roles throughout the anthology which is distracting to say the least br br it also rather irritating rips off the twilight zone with the <UNK> being comparable to <UNK> later night gallery unfortunately the producers writers forgot that <UNK> would build up sympathy for his characters before messing them over none of the characters are particularly sympathetic or interesting until the last segment br br framing story adam west is well himself he doesn't go the bruce wayne batman campy 60s route but he rarely does he simply plays the not particularly enigmatic jay there's an ominous spine chilling name to compare to the likes of dr terror <UNK> and the <UNK> and makes some mildly awkward creepy statements br br <UNK> seen rod <UNK> a stop in <UNK> then you've seen this the red <UNK> of the <UNK> wife is introduced to no purpose but even the main character's friend <UNK> him as a <UNK> as well directed as can be expected but basically incoherent br br <UNK> diner reminiscent of various <UNK> time travel stories mixed with steve allen's a meeting of minds most of the actors aren't too bad except for josh <UNK> as <UNK> who manages to walk talk and even breathe <UNK> and the idea is mildly interesting but like <UNK> it doesn't go anywhere the main character raises some relatively reasonable questions bugs out a bit who wouldn't and for some reason he ends up <UNK> to a nuclear <UNK> br br life replay not a bad little piece and manages to <UNK> both click and <UNK> 3 i suppose it says something that people are fascinated by the magical <UNK> of remote controls the main character is mildly sympathetic nothing <UNK> innovative here but it's okay br br fighting spirit you see the twist coming a mile away but like the main character it has some heart and it's a decent story of defeat and redemption br br finale so why do people end up in cold <UNK> in silver lame suits don't know and doesn't make sense so all the protagonists <UNK> into the <UNK> and became trapped kinda <UNK> the happy ending with the boxer thanks guys and the guy in the first segment died so how did he get trapped did he visit the <UNK> before he died got trapped and didn't die what huh i <UNK> this isn't expected to make sense because it's supernatural but still br br overall basically not <UNK> from the two newer twilight zone series or some episodes of tales from the <UNK> or monsters the last two stories and part of the second are probably worth your time but there's nothing really spectacular here
<START> it's a good show and i find it funny finally the bad latin <UNK> types are over <UNK> <UNK> lopez i love this show and i just started watching it about three months ago the whole concept about a latin family tv show really amazed me i am surprised that finally <UNK> have a good shot to be on tv this show is probably one the best i've seen it's funny heartwarming <UNK> and nice
<START> now i myself am a lover of the b movie genre but this piece of trash insults me to no end first of all the movie is starring <UNK> <UNK> brother as the annoying little kid that goes looking for his lost 3 <UNK> dog now please what kind of dumb ass mistakes a three <UNK> dog for a god damn mutated crocodile please i ask you and <UNK> another point for <UNK> why do they show the <UNK> on the back of the movie box being enormous and actually in the water i believe if memory serves the thing spent about 2 6 minutes in the water and was just shy of 6 feet tall that was a heart <UNK> but redeeming qualities to this movie were that it was so bad that i almost died laughing because believe me the bad acting made me wish for death but the fact remains that once again this thing is created by another military testing site to train super <UNK> for military combat or something like that from the source of all things evil e v i l corporation and let's not forget the characters let's see we have jerk off 1 as the male lead and half way decent chick who doesn't know how to act as the female lead to that i say wow the only thing worse then the acting was the end of course the heroes spend about what seems like 2 hours talking and planning some long elaborate way of killing the <UNK> only to have it fail and kill it in an ordinary way that could have taken about 15 seconds to come up with all in all this movie was beyond gay with its random opera music in the background and the fact that it was probably the <UNK> of all cgi monsters ever made along with the fact it of course was <UNK> to bullets and bombs otherwise it wouldn't have been made for the military duh by far the best scene was when <UNK> <UNK> brother runs into the shack and the <UNK> eats him causing his head to pop clean off with a popping noise i might add i believe that you would be better off shooting yourself between the eyes then to watch <UNK> and as for the director i believe that we should get a bunch of people to hang him by a <UNK> and all take turns kicking him in the <UNK> for wasting an hour and a half of our lives until he finally dies and then i can go on living
<START> this is one of those landmark films which needs to be <UNK> in the context of time darkness in <UNK> was made in 1993 it was a period of chaos confusion and gross disorder not only for ordinary <UNK> of <UNK> but also for countless citizens of other former nations which were a part of mighty soviet empire it was in such a tense climate that a young country named <UNK> was born as newly established <UNK> are known to encounter <UNK> problems <UNK> too faced numerous troubles as some corrupt officials manipulated state <UNK> for filling their dirty <UNK> by making use of their selfish means this is one of this film's core themes darkness in <UNK> appears as an <UNK> film but it was made by a <UNK> director <UNK> <UNK> he has tried his best to <UNK> as many possible doses of <UNK> humor this is why one can call it a comedy film of political undertones as ordinary people are involved in this film we can say that this film <UNK> good versus evil this is not a new concept as it is readily available in most of the religious books of different <UNK> darkness in <UNK> shows us as to how ordinary <UNK> can also be <UNK> by corrupt people a nice film to watch on a sunny day
<START> it's hard to imagine a director capable of such <UNK> crap as <UNK> <UNK> pulling off something as sensitive and as attractive as this but well here's the evidence and it's quite compelling several have <UNK> to tv drama and yes this does have a seventies play for today feel at times but is always a cut above mainly i think <UNK> to some quite <UNK> acting from anne reid and to a fine script which shadow boxes with cliché without ever getting one on the nose except maybe right at the end i didn't like either the tracking shot of indifferent <UNK> through the <UNK> nor the oh what a beautiful morning final scene she deserved a more studied finale than that i think after all that hard work the <UNK> business was a bit <UNK> too on reflection br br what i mean about avoiding cliché well i for one had a sinking expectation that the mature man <UNK> daughter tries to set her up with would be cast in 2 <UNK> as a repulsive old bore so as to point the contrast more painfully with the attractive <UNK> young <UNK> he is <UNK> competing with instead we get an unexpectedly subtle and sympathetic cameo of a lonely clumsy not entirely unlikeable and very human fellow who nevertheless doesn't have much of a clue about entertaining a woman it was around that point i started to sit up and pay more attention here was a script that let the actors breathe and do something interesting with fairly minor parts almost mike leigh in that respect minus the contrived <UNK> that the latter inexplicably goes in for br br and of course i was as everyone probably was <UNK> by what anne reid does with her character and with her body she's not the repressed <UNK> housewife discovering herself for the first time this is far too simplistic for the character we have again and again there are <UNK> to her having been a bad housewife not to mention that thing she does with <UNK> trying to look <UNK> and <UNK> and only <UNK> in looking awkward the daughter <UNK> her of having sat in front of the tv all day instead of well whatever her <UNK> duties might be presumed to have been she has no answer she never was a model wife and mother at least not to herself that's where a lot of the <UNK> comes from the sense of someone having wasted a life trying to <UNK> a role she simply wasn't good at ever
<START> is there any other time period that has been so <UNK> covered by television or the media in general as the 1960s no and do we really need yet another trip through that <UNK> time not really but if we must have one does it have to be as shallow as the '60s br br i like to think that co writers bill <UNK> and robert <UNK> had more in mind for this two part miniseries than what ultimately resulted especially given <UNK> involvement in the superb hbo movie dear america letters home from vietnam which <UNK> little original music and no original footage letting the sights and sounds of the time speak for themselves this presentation <UNK> file footage with the dramatic production but it doesn't do anyone any <UNK> by trying to do too much in too little time like so many of its <UNK> it's seen from the point of view of one family but the children of the family seem to be involved <UNK> with almost every major event of the '60s it's amazing that one of them doesn't go to the rolling stones gig at <UNK> making it seem less like a period drama and more like a cliff notes version of the decade br br the makers rush through it so much that there's little or no time to give the characters any character with the stick figures called our protagonists off screen for ages at a time the children's father is especially clichéd and then when they're back on <UNK> it's something else <UNK> <UNK> could teach the filmmakers a thing or two about doing this kind of thing properly in fairness jerry <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jeremy <UNK> julia stiles and charles s <UNK> give their material the old college try but they're wasted especially the latter two it's undeniably good to see david alan <UNK> in a rare straight role as <UNK> fred <UNK> and <UNK> arquette in an uncredited cameo in part 2 is always welcome br br what isn't welcome is how the '60s <UNK> the soundtrack with so many period songs that it ultimately <UNK> its already minimal effect and this may well be the only time an american tv presentation about post 60s america never mentions the british invasion no beatles no rolling stones then again there's only so much tunes you can <UNK> into a soundtrack album right <UNK> its surface <UNK> approach to both the time and the plot with an almost out of place happy ending american dreams and the wonder years did it all much much better nothing to see here you can't see elsewhere people except for julia stiles doing the twist that is
<START> <UNK> made close to a good half dozen of these horror <UNK> in the 70's and this from leading horror <UNK> robert <UNK> is one of their best efforts there are four stories all worthwhile but two <UNK> for the sweet and method for murder <UNK> themselves as highly effective <UNK> into fear br br in <UNK> christopher lee plays an <UNK> widower whose lovely daughter chloe <UNK> becomes <UNK> of his neglect and <UNK> <UNK> so she <UNK> a voodoo doll with which she expresses her <UNK> for his methods <UNK> is a beautiful figure of mischievous evil and delivers one of the greatest child performances in a horror film since martin <UNK> in the <UNK> this installment is directed with great subtlety and the final outrage occurring off screen is a moment of <UNK> horror br br method of murder is about a horror novelist <UNK> elliott who is <UNK> by one of his own creations the creepy dominic this episode is striking for its simplicity and stark terror dominic may or may not be real so director peter <UNK> has a great time playing with our expectations the brief shots of dominic reflected in a pond or seen as a fleeting phantasm in a <UNK> are truly haunting br br the original poster art featuring a <UNK> figure <UNK> a <UNK> holding peter <UNK> severed head was a rich <UNK> for <UNK> fixed on fear
<START> i love julian <UNK> and will at least attempt to watch anything he's in but this movie nearly did me in i'm hard pressed to remember when i found any other movie to move so slow <UNK> <UNK> br br pop it in the vcr when you've run out of sleeping <UNK>
<START> the premise may seem goofy but since murphy's character doesn't take it seriously it helps ease the audience into this mix of <UNK> and modern day hard boiled child <UNK> excellent cast particularly charles dance and charlotte lewis and murphy is at the height of his 80's peak in comedy action there's also some great f x a very surreal dream sequence and a fairly original plot often overlooked in the <UNK> of murphy flicks but this one is worth a look
<START> poor robert englund makes another flop and to the expense of tobe hooper who usually makes pretty good horror movies but he failed pretty bad at this one englund plays the well known <UNK> de <UNK> who in the <UNK> century was <UNK> for his obsession of pain and the pleasure of bringing pain upon himself as well as watching others also be in pain the story is so confusing with the flip flop from one century to another and i became confused as to what was going on and what was the purpose of this movie all i saw was a young lady that became <UNK> by a strange lesbian who <UNK> to keep her to herself and the young lady became fascinated by this <UNK> with alot of money and finds out that he's out to have her killed and then englund steps in from one century to another claiming to be a <UNK> of the de <UNK> and tries to kill her because she reminded him of the <UNK> <UNK> spelled that wrong or whoever it was in the picture above de <UNK> wall the movie was terrible i am surprised at hooper for <UNK> englund in this film and the special effects were so fake and laughable especially the part about the eyes englund tries to make a comeback from his once hit move nightmare on elm st by using these pull in and out <UNK> to put out peoples eyes terrible absolutely terrible
<START> music that <UNK> on the nerves like <UNK> on a <UNK> acting that is so <UNK> it was a shame to waste the cast by not making a second movie casting everyone in it as true zombies with the cast of sabrina the <UNK> witch as the heroes a movie so downright awful that if <UNK> were still around it might be considered a cult movie but oh so amateurish the scripts might as well have been carried around by the actors their lines read as they slowly <UNK> through the movie banal illogical sets <UNK> after la <UNK> props straight from <UNK> was a movie ever made that is so completely and totally inept logic flies to the wind in this plodding senseless pointless and with a monster so stupid and <UNK> that it couldn't catch a turtle in an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and amazon it kept my attention all the way through the way a terrible ongoing chain accident in the fog involving multiple vehicles keeps one watching to the very end as after a ridiculous ray gun fight in a prison on another planet a <UNK> <UNK> sexy and mentally <UNK> bounty hunter chases a retarded extra <UNK> fugitive to earth don't let anybody p s on your popcorn you might actually enjoy watching this one it's that bad
<START> <UNK> most notorious film is this 1974 <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> it features many highly sexual scenes <UNK> on an x rating including one of <UNK> <UNK> doing a hot 1970s version of her jules and jim <UNK> a <UNK> with the two hairy french hippies depardieu and <UNK> there is no such thing as a sacred territory in this film everything is fair game br br it's very odd that americans tend to not like this film very much while many french people i've met consider it a classic something about it goes against what americans have been <UNK> to <UNK> ' br br gerard and the late patrick <UNK> are two bitch <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with many sexual <UNK> going around <UNK> women and committing petty crimes they're out for kicks and anti <UNK> euro <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ' <UNK> <UNK> the hell out of these two guys while at the same time making <UNK> society itself look ultimately much more ridiculous best of all though is the way the wonderful <UNK> <UNK> score conveys the restless soul of the <UNK> the deeper <UNK> awareness or <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> all the <UNK> they engage in
<START> i think the movie was pretty good will add it to my <UNK> collection after all this time i believe i saw other posters who reminded some of the <UNK> people that it is still just a movie maybe some of the more <UNK> points defy logic but a great many religious matters accepted on faith fail to pass the smell test if you're going to accept whatever faith you <UNK> to you can certainly accept a movie is it just me or has anyone else noticed the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is the same possessed knife <UNK> <UNK> had so much trouble gaining control of in the shadow no mention of it in the trivia section for either movie here imdb but i would bet a dollar to a <UNK> it's the same prop
<START> the summary line above spoken by james cloud robert preston to his brother tom robert sterling just about says it all jim aka kid <UNK> has a way of making things happen only trouble is he usually leaves dead bodies where he's been not the sort of <UNK> tom <UNK> for younger brother jeff who likes what he sees in jim especially when defending their ranch against local texas <UNK> br br the opening credits state <UNK> john barrymore jr as the younger <UNK> in this his very first screen appearance that seemed rather odd to me particularly since he was addressed as jeff almost immediately into the story approximately <UNK> at the time of this movie he bears a passing resemblance to sean penn no stranger to personal and legal problems throughout his career as well as <UNK> from his family i was left wondering if his daughter drew barrymore might have ever seen this picture i'm inclined to think not br br on the subject of <UNK> i was also struck by the thought that the young robert sterling looked a bit like roy rogers early in his career knowing sterling previously only from his role as george <UNK> in the early 1950's tv series <UNK> i thought he looked out of place in a western but that might just be me his character becomes <UNK> by his brother's <UNK> at creating trouble and provides some of the <UNK> to this not so typical story minor subplots abound including the relationship <UNK> john <UNK> john <UNK> has with his son the sheriff who kid <UNK> kills and the troubled marriage between kathleen <UNK> cathy downs and her husband earl who kid <UNK> kills chill <UNK> rounds out the main cast as one of tom <UNK> hired hands and figures in the somewhat predictable finale br br what's not quite predictable is how things eventually wind up there and for that reason this western earns points for following a less traveled hence not quite as formulaic a plot as a lot of good brother bad brother westerns do combined with the <UNK> casting of the principals it's one i'd recommend even if you have to endure some of the jump cuts and sloppy editing that i experienced with my copy
<START> i want to say the acting is bad but i think it was the directing that made it so i never thought much of <UNK> same director but that one could be blamed on the 80s br br this one however has no excuses people get shot while <UNK> <UNK> with a man in front of him those kind of mistakes along with an unclear time line weird battle tactics sub par cutting and poor visual effects makes this one a sub par film over all br br then like so many other have commented all this american <UNK> the german general being practically scared of his captured american private be prepared to swallow a lot of it although in small doses br br to sum it up a not horrible but still definitely sub par war movie in all aspects
<START> this movie is horrible in a <UNK> bad it's <UNK> kind of way br br the storyline is <UNK> from so many other films of this kind that i'm not going to even bother describing it it's a sword <UNK> picture has a kid hoping to realize how important he is in this world has a <UNK> <UNK> an evil <UNK> <UNK> a princess a hairy creature you get the point br br the first time i caught this movie was during a very harsh winter i don't know why i decided to continue watching it for an extra five minutes before turning the channel but when i caught site of <UNK> i decided to stay and watch it until the end br br <UNK> is a white <UNK> creature akin to <UNK> but not nearly as useful or entertaining to watch he looks like someone glued a bunch of white <UNK> <UNK> together and forced the actor to wear it there are scenes where it looks like the actor cannot move within or that he's almost falling over although he isn't in the movie that much the few scenes are worth it watch as he attempts to talk <UNK> to bo <UNK> taking the solo <UNK> <UNK> to an even higher level br br i actually bought this movie just because of that character and still have it somewhere br br <UNK> may look like sh t but he made this movie the only reason i've never seen the sequel or even sought it out was because of his absence perhaps should there be a final film <UNK> the trilogy <UNK> will make a much anticipated return
<START> the motion picture was in all <UNK> made in the year 1930 and released in 1931 i would <UNK> that talking motion pictures had great difficulty in making the transition from the silent era nevertheless this particular zane grey plot appears to be very weak also gary cooper was probably just learning to act the result is something that would not be acceptable by today's standards for 1931 maybe for 2004 not acceptable some of the actors performed well sadly the indians always get the short end in these early westerns they were living on the land long before the white man came but according to twisted history they had no right to defend themselves
<START> although it got some <UNK> press after playing at the toronto <UNK> film festival there were a number of reasons not to expect too much from this one it's an ultra low budget canadian film two it's written directed and starring the same person usually a bad sign unless it's woody allen george clooney or one or two other respected filmmakers but despite my watching it with <UNK> expectations it still turned out to a far bigger disappointment than i thought possible br br in a nutshell bad script bad acting terrible directing don't waste your time or money on this turkey it claims to be a comedy but i only laughed twice plus there is awful music <UNK> throughout how this got any attention i'll never know
<START> oh a vaguely once famous actress in a film where she plays a mother to a child it s being shown on bbc 1 at half past midnight i wonder if <UNK> it s a <UNK> br br you <UNK> got to hand it to <UNK> producers not content on making one mediocre movie they usually give us two mediocre movies where two themes are mixed together and nowhere to hide is no different the first theme is a woman in danger theme cross <UNK> with a woman suffering from the pain of a divorce theme which means we have a scene of the heroine surviving a murder attempt followed by a scene having her son sam ask why she divorced and being a <UNK> she answers that the reason is that people change rather than say something along the lines like i m a right <UNK> or your daddy <UNK> <UNK> public <UNK> for sex as does happen in real life divorce cases and it s young sam i feel sorry for not only are his parents divorced but he s as thick as two short <UNK> actually since he s so stupid he deserves no sympathy because he s unaware that a man <UNK> stuff down a toilet is a drug dealer unaware that you might die if someone shoots at you and unaware that i love lucy is painfully unfunny if only our own <UNK> were so innocent ah well as <UNK> said ignorance is strength oh hold on sam is suddenly an expert on marine life is this character development or poor scripting i know what one my money s on and strange that sam the boy <UNK> <UNK> t noticed that if the story is set in 1994 then why do people often wear clothes drive cars and ride trains from the 1950s but as it turns out during a plot twist it s the mother who s the <UNK> then there s a final plot twist that left me feeling like an idiot for watching this
<START> what a waste of time i've tried to sit through <UNK> captain about 6 times and every time within about 3 minutes i start doing something else anything else it's a downright boring movie the acting is terrible the writing dull and obviously a first time director because it's stiff and i wanted to love it i love sci fi the old <UNK> and i can appreciate the attempt at <UNK> to flash gordon and metropolis but my god what a waste of money i used to work for paramount pictures and i had written <UNK> <UNK> in 1993 about using blue screen for screen <UNK> she told me they'd never have an interest or need to do it 10 years later paramount releases this piece of crap <UNK> was right in 1993 but must have forgotten her own advice when she <UNK> this dog blue screen an effect shot but not an entire movie let's not forget neither jude nor jolie are terrific actors but easy on the eyes <UNK> performance reminds me of a high school effort too bad it could've worked but only under a skilled director the funny thing is sky <UNK> director will keep getting work even after this dreck it's <UNK> not art
<START> fans of the hbo series tales from the crypt are going to love this <UNK> episode those who know the basic <UNK> stories that most of the classic <UNK> comics were based on will recognize this one right off the bat br br underrated indie favorite martin <UNK> also an excellent writer co author of the screenplays for apartment zero and death becomes her is the kind of guy whose <UNK> good looks can go either way he could play a really nice if misunderstood guy next door or he can play the same role with a creepy <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> in the case of right to die he takes the latter approach and it definitely works br br <UNK> is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his <UNK> office <UNK> robin sydney much to the <UNK> of his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> julia anderson when the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an <UNK> weekend of making up and she's horribly burned in a fire he's reluctant to pull the plug on her not without some enthusiastic <UNK> from his even <UNK> lawyer and best buddy corbin bernsen looking the worse for wear these days br br but <UNK> never been one to give up without a fight and that's where the <UNK> theme of the episode comes in <UNK> husbands and wives have always been the <UNK> favorite subject matter for some spooky and <UNK> supernatural <UNK> and this case is definitely no exception if anything the <UNK> up <UNK> of sex and gore must have bill <UNK> <UNK> with glee in his <UNK> somewhere br br and that's not to mention that john <UNK> original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist you don't realize as you're watching that you only know half the story until close to the end think what lies beneath with more guts and <UNK> and you're there br br not a bad effort but not the best of the lot either at least rob <UNK> does display touches of flair here and there with the direction especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture <UNK> into a truly horrifying experience indeed as with most <UNK> episodes this one is following a prevalent theme this season of <UNK> and <UNK> so the extremely <UNK> need not apply
<START> one of my favourite films first saw it when i was about 10 which probably tells you a lot about the type of humour although dated the humour definitely has a charm about it expect to see the usual <UNK> <UNK> banter so popular in its day with lots of interesting quirky co characters the lady with the parrot the couple due to get married and are in trouble from <UNK> and my favourite the <UNK> nobody knows where it comes from nobody knows where it goes interestingly the ghost train was written by arnold <UNK> of <UNK> army fame private <UNK> the <UNK> watch it on a rainy sunday afternoon after your lunch and smile
<START> for me this is one of the best movies i ever saw <UNK> racism struggling through life and proving himself he isn't just an ordinary cookie carl brashear is an amazing character to play who puts cuba in his best light best performance in his life de niro who is a living legend gives that something to the movie hated his character in movie but he gives so much good acting to this film great performance and appearance of beautiful <UNK> was and as always is a big plus for every movie so if you haven't seen this movie i highly recommended for those who love bravery greatness who seek inspiration you must look this great drama my vote 9 10
<START> this movie is really not all that bad but then again this movie genre is right down my alley sure the sets are cheap but they really did decent with what they had br br if you like cheap futuristic post apocalyptic b movies then you'll love this one i sure did br br
<START> i have to say that the events of 9 11 didn't hit me until i saw this documentary it took me a year to come to grips with the <UNK> i was the one who was changing the station on the radio and channel on tv if there was any talk about the towers i was sick of hearing about it when this was aired on tv a year and a day later i was <UNK> my eyes out it was the first time i had cried since the attack i highly recommend this documentary i am watching it now on tv 5 years later and i am still crying over the <UNK> the fact that this contains one of the only video shots of the first plane hitting the tower is amazing it was an accident and look where it got them these two brothers make me want to have been there to help
<START> yes there are great performances here unfortunately they happen in the context of a movie that doesn't seem to have a clue what it's doing during the first 45 60 minutes of this all the music takes place as realistic performance suddenly about an hour in the characters who until this point had always spoken to each other suddenly start singing to each other to further confuse things a little further in out of nowhere they actually do about 15 minutes of sung through dialog then seem to drop that idea and move on to other things such as a number that begins in a jazz club with a drummer and two electric <UNK> suddenly turning into a fully <UNK> piece with a massive unseen string section on top of all this <UNK> in how the music is used is the <UNK> clear inability to actually write music in the style that is supposedly being portrayed while the first couple of pieces do sort of <UNK> the 1950s <UNK> sound the rest of the film is just bad broadway show music then there's the pure silliness of snippets of a group doing a bad jackson family imitation and eddie murphy <UNK> from little richard to james brown to lionel <UNK> when he started <UNK> <UNK> wonder i couldn't help laughing out loud this was clearly one of those films that make me appreciate how little time i have on earth and <UNK> that i wasted two hours of it watching this film
<START> this film would usually <UNK> as the worst movie production ever ever but in my opinion it is possibly the funniest the horrifying direction and screenplay makes this film priceless i bought the movie whilst <UNK> through the bargain dvd's at my local pound shop me and some friends then watched it admittedly whilst rather drunk it soon occurred that this wasn't any normal film instead a priceless <UNK> of what will probably be james <UNK> last film at first we were confused and were screaming for the dvd player to be turned off but thankfully in our <UNK> state no one could be bothered instead we watched the film right through at the end we soon realised we had found any <UNK> dream something that you can <UNK> laugh at for hours whilst laughing for all the wrong reasons we soon showed all our other friends and they too agreed this wasn't a work of abysmal film this was a film that you can truly wet yourself laughing at this was a film that anyone can enjoy this was genius
<START> shut it off the prologue with fu <UNK> birthday and the opening credits of the <UNK> training is amusing then it drops off faster than hair <UNK> with neat look for a cameo by <UNK> in the beginning with a <UNK> <UNK> at the audience
<START> decent animation and some <UNK> character development keep this animated horse fable from <UNK> at least watchable however it remains somewhat slow paced and the storyline is a bit on the silly side it is interesting to see a <UNK> of the typical <UNK> and indian roles but here it just seems like a nod to political correctness rather than a proper storyline decision grade c
<START> black angel is minor <UNK> with june vincent as a woman trying to save her husband from the electric chair after he is found guilty of killing an old <UNK> dan duryea the husband of the murdered woman decides to help vincent find the real <UNK> peter lorre has one <UNK> role as a suspect this film noir looks and plays like a cheap <UNK> never achieving anything special it is pleasant enough but then at some point it stops making sense and the solution to the mystery <UNK> one of those big give me a break reactions that ending alone could have <UNK> the film completely but what <UNK> the conclusion is not very good either vincent is a <UNK> heroine and duryea was never very good at playing good guys i love film <UNK> but this one was a real disappointment
<START> its hollywood imitating <UNK> soap operas at its finest its the fun that we never see great characters and great lines whoopi is hilarious sally field is so over the top gary <UNK> lines are a riot this is what i love about good comedies never afraid to poke fun at themselves the sets were great wardrobe was on point and the <UNK> montana <UNK> was a <UNK> delight <UNK> <UNK> as dr monica <UNK> didn't have enough lines but none the less still gorgeous and fun when on screen i would love to know how the idea for this movie came up never have i seen a cast of people have so much fun in making comedy work <UNK> is a must have and i am waiting for the dvd
<START> i'm sorry to report that i have seen this film several times when it bombed at the box office it was repeated <UNK> for about a month on hbo and i watched it over and over because television in general is so bad or was at that time i no longer watch so it might be wonderful now like samuel l jackson says about <UNK> it might taste like sweet <UNK> pie but i'll never know because i wouldn't eat the filthy <UNK> let's see dudley plays arthur wandering in the desert always a few steps behind <UNK> it came out right after life of bryan so you can guess where the inspiration for this came from the few mildly funny bits go on way too long until you just close your eyes and <UNK> your teeth there's one scene where arthur and dom <UNK> meet in the desert both of them dragged out and <UNK> dying of <UNK> then they meet like old <UNK> who didn't really know each other very well promise to do lunch it could have been funny br br but the scene that i remember most clearly is a meeting with <UNK> in which <UNK> is a black street kid done up in full king <UNK> <UNK> he must have read the lines straight because at some point before the release they <UNK> his scene with the hollywood equivalent of black street <UNK> voiced by a jimmy walker wannabe kid <UNK> wannabe or it might have been jimmy walker who knows who cares they managed to turn an essentially boring scene into a very racist very unfunny very long piece of <UNK> one of those legendary things that just won't <UNK> no matter how many times you try so you leave it there for someone else to deal with br br well that's my review if you rent this movie don't buy it whatever you do prepare yourself with a bottle of <UNK> and a six pack of <UNK> br br now that they've remade the <UNK> adventure this one is probably high on the list for remakes maybe they'll hire a comedy writer this time
<START> having no knowledge of this film prior to seeing it on <UNK> channel i found it to be a pleasant poignant and <UNK> film br br the casting was excellent i loved all the characters they were a little exaggerated in places but this is a film the way it looked and the <UNK> <UNK> ride the main character took until it turned badly as real life can and does yes i thought andy <UNK> was great i was particularly interested to watch this film once it began because people so often joke about her acting abilities i find this quite <UNK> because she's always a solid actress in my opinion br br i loved the bit at the end where <UNK> character said sometimes i feel he was never here etc it was so completely how it really is in a situation like that which i can personally identify with then there was that gorgeous classical piece <UNK> i think by <UNK> which was a beautiful way to end bar the light comedy at the end which was probably unnecessary br br i say well done to the film makers i have seen 1 <UNK> of worse films
<START> yes marie <UNK> drinks <UNK> juice that she thinks is poison and she <UNK> running br br <UNK> is good never my cup of tea but she is a solid performer who surely holds the screen br br i watched this for polly <UNK> whom i've seen elsewhere here <UNK> is ok just ok as <UNK> <UNK> friend <UNK> too bad she has sunk into nearly total oblivion br br the plot is good hearted bad guys try to rob the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and all ends well br br i do wonder about the central plot <UNK> bonds this came out during the depression so maybe everyone was familiar with bonds and what they can do if used well and if used wrongly i however not of that era am vaguely familiar with them they're like <UNK> only different right it seems odd to build a story about the little man around a somewhat sophisticated <UNK> <UNK>
<START> perhaps it's because i am so in love with the william <UNK> kim novak version or because i'm not a gen <UNK> but this was absolutely the worst remake i have ever seen without the <UNK> soundtrack it just seemed like another typical tv movie yes about as bland as <UNK> cheese
<START> you know what you are getting when you purchase a hallmark card a sappy trite <UNK> and that will be 3 99 thank you very much you get the same with a hallmark movie here we get a ninety year old ernie <UNK> coming out of retirement to let us know that as a matter of fact he is not dead like we thought poor ernie he is the poor soul that married <UNK> <UNK> several years ago and the marriage lasted a few weeks in this flick ernie jumps in feet first and portrays the grandpa that bonds with his long lost <UNK> we have seen it before you might enjoy this movie but please don't say that you were not warned
<START> not everything is said in this excellent first feature from <UNK> <UNK> the friendship the wanting to fit in the first sexual feelings all this and much more is <UNK> through the underwater <UNK> swimming scenes br br all three girls in the movie try to find and express their personality in a very different way it is a much less violent approach to the understanding of the teenage years compared to say thirteen but a very worthwhile trip nonetheless br br a must see and please leave all american cinematographic <UNK> at he door the soundtrack is a by the way br br bon <UNK>
<START> excellent comedy starred by dudley moore supported by <UNK> minnelli and good speaking john gielgud moore is arthur a man <UNK> to a <UNK> family who was near to get <UNK> million dollars provided that he marries to a lady susan from another <UNK> family in principle arthur accepted the conditions but he finally refused when he met nice and poor linda <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> arthur was just a <UNK> because he did not work he only enjoyed himself drinking hard and having fun with prostitutes after several serious thoughts in his life and for the first time arthur decided not to marry susan only few minutes before their wedding the end was happy for linda and arthur although the latter knew that his life will change in the coming future this comedy is a good lesson for life for anyone rich people are not usually happy with their ways of life
<START> the fine cast cannot <UNK> this routine tale of a secretary murdered by her married <UNK> in fact there are more questions than answers in this one sided tale of romance and murder and since we are only provided with the <UNK> side none of these questions will be answered this is the type of fare that appeals to the he woman man <UNK> <UNK> of america as presented it is the tale of an innocent woman who just happens to be caught up in a romance with a married high profile attorney is it possible that if she had not been two timing her boy friend and having an affair with a married man the whole nasty murderous <UNK> incident could have been avoided when you watch this don't worry about going to the <UNK> you won't miss anything
<START> i first heard about this film about 20 years ago when i was a kid in grade school it just so happened that i was <UNK> through the <UNK> in the <UNK> one day and under the entry for movies or cinema i don't remember were several stills for different movies from mainstream to experimental and one of them shown on the page was a still for <UNK> it really intrigued me since it stood out the most on the page it was a still from the film of the scene with the eye with other elements <UNK> over it br br about 18 or so years later the public library here where i live had available for <UNK> the whole 4 dvd set of <UNK> of american film <UNK> released by the national film <UNK> foundation so when i was reading the notes on the dvd cases for the set i was quite pleasantly surprised to see that <UNK> was on one of the <UNK> after all these years i could finally see the film after viewing it it slightly wasn't was i was expecting it to be it tended to be a more <UNK> looking film not that that's a bad thing but i was expecting it to have a more electronic aesthetic but it was still an impressive film imho considering the techniques scott <UNK> used to make the film including hand <UNK> the film itself and using video equipment for some of the film's scenes filmed off of a video <UNK> giving it a more <UNK> lo <UNK> look br br don't get me wrong the techniques used in this film were quite ground breaking for 1972 that's why it's still one of my favorite short experimental films and a creative inspiration for me as well
<START> now here's a film straight out of my childhood my family used to taped but it kind of got <UNK> over and <UNK> over the years now i was fortunate to watch the whole film on youtube com i had love this wonderful film when i watched it as kid and after watching again online i still do today my favorite song from the movie is candy hearts and paper flowers i will always remember that sweet song forever br br i was surprised when i looked at the opening credits on who animated who that some of the animators date back to 1930s wow that's like <UNK> years
<START> i saw this film a few years ago and i got to say that i really love it jason <UNK> was perfect for this weird role that he played the director i don't too many things about him and i don't care the screenplay is good that's for sure in just a few words i have to say about this movie that is weird strange even dark but it's a good one i saw it a few years ago and never saw it since then i want to see it again and again i know that i'm not gonna get sick of watching it the scenes the atmosphere the actors the story everything is good the movie should have lasted longer i think <UNK> minutes should have been perfect i was hoping for a part 2 for this movie too bad it <UNK> happened jason <UNK> you're the man very good movie the end
<START> as a kid i did think the weapon the murderer <UNK> was cool however i was a kid and so i was a bit dumb even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people what <UNK> me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it what script did they read when <UNK> to be in this movie as it is most <UNK> boring and only a means to show off a light <UNK> on a very small scale the plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic the whole film seems to <UNK> around aliens and the one weapon the plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree seriously you just have to wonder why this movie was made if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light <UNK> thing and if you are going to have light <UNK> then call yourself star wars
<START> beginning with the poster featuring only morgan freeman and kevin spacey the entire movie was a fraud one stereotype after another this movie was about nothing or nothing new at least after 10 15 minutes you realize that you've just paid to see justin timberlake and ll cool j <UNK> their way through another cop flick br br basically the story is about the corrupt system in some city all secretly supported by the <UNK> business and in town under the <UNK> eye of some hot shot politician the almighty and above the law organization is called frat and guess what they've got a kick ass loony cop shooting and beating at will suspects girlfriends you name it frat cops are corrupt and greedy so they end up making mistakes that get discovered by a young and talented journalist one hour later after a series of unbelievably bad made shooting scenes and more stereotype lines everything ends happily and we get served the final line you can't beat the system <UNK> don't see this waste of film roll freeman and spacey barely have 10 min altogether
<START> the cast is different and now they took a different approach we have the street smart team <UNK> vs the supposed professional team <UNK> but boy if you think the street smart team would have trouble you'd be right while the <UNK> team has <UNK> at times the street team has simply <UNK> week after week br br first some things to <UNK> as far as the apprentice 3 first of it continues the same absurd mentality from <UNK> and the game in this series if your a good project manager but you lose the team will turn on you and you will be fired despite the fact that your <UNK> <UNK> are often the ones who do half ass jobs simply absurd that a game show that claims to hire the best candidate actually <UNK> out the best while the dysfunctional candidates stab each other until one is left and that person is the best lol br br anyone this season <UNK> seen a total of <UNK> <UNK> and even gay offensive stereotypes carried out as teams try to do <UNK> br br the list of victims so far cast tara <UNK> audrey evans danny <UNK> those three are the only that i feel were unfairly fired by <UNK> the rest really had it coming as they only <UNK> conflict anger and suffering it's just amazing as one candidate audrey evans said as how she who did a good job was fired and how some of her worthless <UNK> are still in the game br br yes its the game it's the apprentice where manipulation <UNK> and always popular everyone gang up on the project manager mentality rules br br it has been an entertaining ride though the candidates are given a wide array of <UNK> from photo shoots to the construction of mini golf <UNK> to building of new apartments br br still though it's still the apprentice though so all you can do basically is laugh the whole time as the insanity and chaos <UNK> until lucky person is the winner
<START> i rarely make these comments but i felt compelled to spare others the pain i endured in watching this movie it's so stupid and implausible both in the overall story and in the details that you simply can't suspend disbelief the problem starts early when you see a government <UNK> <UNK> around in a new <UNK> and <UNK> with his team in a <UNK> that looks like a castle <UNK> the <UNK> building in washington d c that kind of life on a government <UNK> <UNK> it only gets worse toward the end when the bad guy starts killing off the good guys the latter group act so <UNK> that you want them to die in order to <UNK> the gene pool the special effects are pretty good any <UNK> money can buy that and the lead actors have been great in other films but the screenplay and direction here are moronic many people have wondered whether there was some deliberate intelligence behind paul verhoeven's previous <UNK> stupid movies <UNK> starship troopers but this movie should stop the wondering he's just plain bad
<START> i can't believe that they took this off the air especially when they only had a few more episodes left my daughter sister and a few of my friends loved watching this show we were so upset when they stopped showing this because of so called ratings it is not fair to the people who were watching this show since the beginning we had a right to see the end i wish they would take an overall vote from all people with a 3 times a year voting system they could send out papers in the mail and we as viewers could give an overall vote on all programs that we watch or have heard about this could also help promote a new show people would see it and wonder what it is not only could you see what the viewers are watching you could also use this as a tool for free <UNK> for tv and cable channels we want to see the other episodes bring it back
<START> hello i am from <UNK> and one day i was having a film evening with my friends one brought this movie with him russian terminator and it was extremely awful after watching less than half a minute we decided to fast forward only stopping at some laughable highlights or should i say <UNK> in the movie i was actually mostly surprised to find out that this film was produced here in my <UNK> <UNK> that must have been the biggest mistake this country ever made
<START> i did not really want to watch this one it seemed to be an old raj <UNK> movie which disgusted me even before i started watching it because i don't consider him even close to being mediocre as a filmmaker the only reason i took this one is obviously the <UNK> khan appearance in the film i had not even known what the film was all about because i was sure it would be just an ordinary fairy tale so i just imagined a love story between <UNK> khan and <UNK> <UNK> with a substantial supporting role by <UNK> kapoor who i thought would be playing her father or uncle and to my complete shock <UNK> kapoor is actually the hero he is the one who romances the young <UNK> i was <UNK> to find out that <UNK> had a small part of no substance and that too only in the second part of this idiotic film br br just let me repeat the question why would a 17 year old lovely <UNK> have fallen for a 40 plus long haired <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> like <UNK> kapoor <UNK> kapoor should be ashamed of taking this part the only thing he did is <UNK> himself he <UNK> a girl who could <UNK> be younger than his own daughter and to make things worse acts like a teenager at his forties on top of that just to make himself more pathetic he plays a pop star br br to make things clear i have no problems with actors <UNK> ladies much younger than they themselves are as long as they make a convincing couple there should be no problem in fact leading actors have always been cast opposite young girls amitabh bachchan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> khan <UNK> salman khan <UNK> <UNK> and made the pairing pretty well also i have nothing against <UNK> kapoor i think he is a good actor and his act in bobby is still well <UNK> in my heart but it's not that he looks in this film like say <UNK> khan salman khan or <UNK> khan look today br br that was such a disappointment oh and as for the reason every person actually watched this film <UNK> khan made a good debut he <UNK> in the very little his part allowed him to do the late <UNK> <UNK> made a promising debut as well if you want to watch this film go for the second half only personally i would not do even that
<START> i'm a horror gore movie freak and this flick was so bad i felt embarrassed for not only the actors but also the director and the poor <UNK> of a producer who actually put his money up for this schlock br br from the title you'd expect some great carnage somewhat of a storyline and at least some direction or dialog instead you get what looks like a slightly more violent and sexual three stooges episode at least i laugh at the three stooges while watching this crap i turned another tv on and started watching howard stern until something interesting happened br br needless to say i kept watching stern br br watching this film i realize that i could produce a film with three monkeys 2 <UNK> cameras 50 dollars in loose change and a broken pc this film is my inspiration to get into no budget film making watch this movie if you dare but be warned there is a lot of nothing in here but a whole lot of talking and very little action this makes <UNK> look like a meryl streep film br br i'm sure germany didn't <UNK> it due to sex or violence other countries need to take <UNK>
<START> not a bad film somehow i was made to actually root for the <UNK> to win the game played in the movie even though i don't know anything about soccer and am not a fan the ending on the bus was <UNK> br br the film itself deals with the issue of women in iran and how they are not allowed to go into sporting <UNK> amongst men because their swearing is inappropriate for women to hear despite this law some women try to sneak in but many of them get caught and <UNK> it's really astonishing that any society could still have such <UNK> notions of gender in an interview <UNK> says his films are documents of history and its <UNK> and that one day in the future we can watch these movies and see how iran once lived one hopes that future will come sooner rather than later
<START> i almost called hbo and <UNK> my money back for the month just because they've been airing this movie i can just see the movie <UNK> sitting around going okay we need to come up with something that's just like home alone only we'll add a bunch of cash for the kid hire cut rate actors and oh yeah we'll make it a lot less funny br br okay maybe not the last part but that's basically what you've got here not even worth seeing if someone else <UNK> it and as a movie for kids forget it i wouldn't let my kids see this not necessarily because of bad taste jokes but because i wouldn't want them to say what were you thinking showing us that lame piece of garbage dad
<START> all dogs go to heaven is a movie that i have always liked when i was a kid i used to watch this every other day it is underrated if you look at its imdb rating and the comments of many people in general this isn't a bad movie like many say it is a very good movie this is good and your kids will probably like it even though it's rated g some parents may find this to be a bit violent it is actually a pretty dark story where the dogs are similar to <UNK> who are involved in gambling <UNK> and even cold blooded murder the movie follows a dog named charlie who had escaped from the pound is killed by his old friend goes to heaven but ends up coming back to earth many younger kids watching this movie may feel as though they are watching a big kids movie br br there are some scenes that may scare little kids but i'm sure they'll do fine every time i watch this movie it reminds me of when i was a little kid i'm sure everyone has a movie that reminds them of when they were younger this is the movie that makes me feel that way the performances from burt reynolds and dom <UNK> are great and this is the last movie that a little girl named <UNK> <UNK> was in unfortunately she was killed at a young age which is a shame because she had so much potential and didn't deserve what happened now that i know her story i can't watch this movie the same way anymore because her voice sounds so sad br br the animation in this movie is great the voice work is great and the story is good but a little bit different from many other kids movies this was popular at the time of its release but was over <UNK> by disney's mega popular the little mermaid this is a movie that isn't conceived as well by adults but if you're a kid or if you grew up with this movie as a kid then i'm sure you will enjoy watching it
<START> black and white film good photography believable characters br br just awful br br i have wasted another perfect evening watching a film that other rated as worthy and very good there is some good acting here and the back ground setting for the plot is good more should have been done with this but it is very slow to grow and never develops it is totally <UNK> on sex without much romance with much un needed nudity more could have been done with the main characters if you are looking for something to watch with you family this in not the movie and if not you will have trouble sitting through it though this film is long its only about 1 inch deep
<START> <UNK> was not my favorite type of movie i found it overly sentimental and the acting was below par harvey keitel and <UNK> <UNK> were good but some of the other actors weren't at all believable i also did not believe that paul's parents would go away and leave him with the <UNK> family especially when they had a <UNK> living in the home their social classes were too far apart to consider this believable it seemed the <UNK> lifestyle was too exaggerated there was a scene in the beginning of the movie that showed <UNK> <UNK> getting out of a car after having sex with someone who was it her son what was the scene supposed to show us why was the scene even included it had nothing to do with the rest of the movie and was in fact never <UNK> to again it seemed gratuitous and not fitting into the story at all there were too many inconsistencies in the movie for me the story concerning <UNK> was nice but i wasn't convinced that the <UNK> would have been as kind and generous as they were portrayed
<START> i first saw this film 40 years ago on n y television and thought it was a depressing look at the future wells sees <UNK> of private <UNK> as a good thing no private <UNK> the 30 year plus war in the film was the reason this film was not shown to british film goers doing the war the concept of the future and the <UNK> an co concept of the the machines of the future are the real stars of the film the very best acting performance is that of ralph richardson as the boss a combination of winston <UNK> and <UNK> from absolutely fabulous comedy series it is interesting to note that the <UNK> negative personality is somewhat similar to the war time <UNK>
<START> national lampoon goes to the movies is the worst movie ever made <UNK> even the witless plan 9 from outer space at least that movie was just inept the lampoon film on the other hand is both inept and mean once upon a time movies used to respect their <UNK> intelligence this one however holds a <UNK> rotting <UNK> up to our faces and then tries to rub our <UNK> in it br br another reviewer on this site wrote that the only good parts of the movie are the nude scenes and i agree misses <UNK> and <UNK> do flash a bit of flesh and very nice flesh it is but the directors seem not to realize that even t a needs a good story to surround it there's none of that here br br <UNK> the film makers save the worst for last the third of the three segments is the <UNK> of the trio in this <UNK> <UNK> benson plays an eager <UNK> young police officer <UNK> for duty on his first day on the job he is paired with a weary cynical <UNK> played by richard widmark for just a moment we are given hope that this film will end <UNK> surely we think the <UNK> <UNK> attitude will rub off on the <UNK> and change him for the better br br <UNK> hope instead the <UNK> wins the day and the <UNK> spark is <UNK> forever national lampoon goes to the movies and heads right for the toilet asking us to follow it down the drain <UNK> this is a comedy but where's the humor
<START> br br the movie slugs is unique because the titular <UNK> are actually the good guys in this horrific tale of nature gone awry you see these poor slugs have been mutated through the <UNK> of evil humans and don't mean to do anything <UNK> they're just slugs slugs with sharp teeth who eat flesh and <UNK> poison but slugs none the less the real bad guys are the humans who either <UNK> try to destroy our beloved slugs or <UNK> when they encounter them br br for example take the scene where the guy puts on the <UNK> full of slugs they were just hanging out in a comfortable work <UNK> when out of nowhere this giant hand came at them and they <UNK> <UNK> defending themselves and biting the guy now instead of seeking medical attention for his slug bite this guy runs around his <UNK> screaming like an idiot <UNK> some highly <UNK> <UNK> starts a fire knocks a <UNK> over on himself and cuts off his own hand then the fire and <UNK> <UNK> mix and his house explodes how can you blame that on the slugs br br this movie paints a portrait of humans that is less than <UNK> the characters in this movie include the dumb sheriff who hates everybody the drunk <UNK> who's mean to his dog and the <UNK> sidekick whose wife is at least forty five years older than him there's also a set of drunken teens br br that get attacked while <UNK> and we have to see the skinny long haired <UNK> <UNK> meanwhile there's a guy who looks like a demonic leslie <UNK> who yells you don't have the authority to <UNK> happy birthday for some reason finally this parade of <UNK> is rounded out by the guy from the mst3k classic <UNK> people whose face explodes after eating a slug <UNK> <UNK> another easily avoided fate blamed on the helpful harmless slugs br br humans are portrayed as greedy stupid racist alcoholic and in one pointless scene as would be <UNK> in the movie's climactic scene the villainous humans try to burn the slugs who are <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> well since they're idiots the humans succeed in blowing up the entire town they alone do more damage than the slugs ever did br br if you hate humans and i know i do you'll appreciate slugs if you're a fan of bad cinema you'll also appreciate this <UNK> from the director of pieces and <UNK> people there's enough bad acting silly dialog illogical plot twists lame special effects pointless scenes and poor dubbing to hold your attention
<START> aside from the horrendous acting and the ridiculous and ludicrous plot this movie wasn't too bad unfortunately that doesn't leave much movie not to suck do not waste your time on this film even if you find yourself suffering from insomnia as i did watch an <UNK> instead
<START> avoid the usa version it is with added us footage and the worst dubbing you've ever heard probably done by new york amateurs the dubbing is so bad that it sounds like mystery science theater 3000 i think a black guy from the <UNK> does <UNK> voice i couldn't watch the entire film it was that bad instead of this <UNK> version watch <UNK> other <UNK> like the <UNK> or karate warriors
<START> nicely and intelligently played by the two young girls <UNK> barton as frankie and ingrid <UNK> as <UNK> although the plot is rather a stretch of the imagination young <UNK> running for mayor seems out of place to be honest br br while the acting is well done by all concerned the movie tends to lack a genuine atmosphere of drama perhaps we've grown to expect gritty reality in movies rather like comparing <UNK> to how green was my valley never mind each of them are good in their own way br br i do admire joan <UNK> even if her role is somewhat subdued here middle of the road entertainment well suited for younger viewers and how nice at times to be exposed to fine classical music which is almost a <UNK> br br i find this movie to be a welcomed change as it reflects <UNK> thoughtful values for the growing up years and no violence thank goodness a warm family film to enjoy
<START> i do regret that i have bought this series i expected more action more objective picture and more <UNK> this is just a pure propaganda series very dark without any charm or <UNK> it is just boredom itself i find the actors work quite weak as well <UNK> might seem charming as robin with batman but in this picture he lacks any charm probably while he becomes older he is <UNK> his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up it comes as no surprise that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the uk for 40 of the recommended price and was not even released in the <UNK>
<START> two <UNK> right up front i actually think joe don baker can be good or even great with the right material and the right director the cape fear remake a small role in <UNK> walking tall and i even liked baker in mitchell because he was playing an anti hero who was supposed to be unlikeable yes <UNK> coverage was hilarious but they took a lot of cheap shots at baker that he didn't deserve to keep things lively and entertaining he was appropriate to the level and tone of the movie and he was the best part of the movie br br final justice seems to be more of the same but in spite of the exotic locations and the cowboy frontier justice theme it is quite a bit weaker than mitchell and the main reason is that <UNK> character as written is an idiot the movie has the <UNK> that because baker <UNK> old style frontier <UNK> he challenges his opponents to old style <UNK> a <UNK> quick draw <UNK> and because he's so tough and macho he always wins even when he's hurt wounded <UNK> etc br br that's a <UNK> with a lot of potential it worked for gary cooper even if it <UNK> the film to b movie status but baker is so <UNK> stupid and obsessive that he needlessly challenges three of the bad guy's henchman to a showdown in a public market with civilians all over the place he could have simply <UNK> them to the chief bad guy's <UNK> which was why he was following them in the first place and they never would have noticed or he could have gotten the drop on them and forced them to surrender and gotten one of the henchmen to take him to <UNK> at gun point but no he has to be a bush league hot dog and a macho <UNK> and so he gets a child taken as a hostage in the ensuing shootout br br this is a guy we are supposed to admire br br the whole movie is basically like this most of the supporting actors are somewhere between ok the henchmen to pretty good the chief bad guy and his father who are two well known european actors they just go through the motions but they are pros and even <UNK> it up they are decent but through it all <UNK> character pulls silly <UNK> stunts and mistakes that get at least two relatively innocent people killed plus a couple of bad guys who might have been taken alive without the use of deadly force br br on the positive side since 90 of the movie is set on <UNK> or in the <UNK> you get to see lots of pretty scenery and lots of nice and exotic looking extras and really baker himself may be on the heavy side and slightly <UNK> but he isn't that bad certainly not the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that this films critics including mike and the <UNK> in their hilarious coverage seem to think br br in short this movie is good for video <UNK> but the viewer should not pay any attention to it
<START> it's the nature of <UNK> to try to capitalize on <UNK> success here we have a movie taking elements from the earlier <UNK> 1931 and <UNK> 1931 in a <UNK> town the village leaders believe that vampires in the shape of bats have been the cause of recent deaths of <UNK> victims even though shot at universal and at the bronson <UNK> it's a poverty row feature it's not fair to compare it with those earlier more <UNK> made and superior films br br from the familiar and exciting chilling music of the main titles which must have been by <UNK> <UNK> through the talky but well done opening sequence we <UNK> the arrival of lionel <UNK> fay <UNK> and dwight frye to give us a good 30s mystery film unfortunately it doesn't happen that's the disappointment br br we get little more than the formulaic elements of such films but with slow pacing low budget not enough of dwight frye the overdone presence of <UNK> <UNK> aunt <UNK> and the premise for lionel <UNK> dr von <UNK> to require human blood or how he <UNK> mind control over his servant <UNK> robert <UNK> never made very clear br br do not watch the technicolor <UNK> <UNK> 1932 which also stars lionel <UNK> and fay <UNK> but as father and daughter before watching this the way i did it's an oscar winner by comparison so watch this one first <UNK> 'the vampire <UNK> still isn't that good it <UNK> along with too much talking or unnecessary comic relief without focusing strongly on the <UNK> <UNK> br br besides <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> of the wax <UNK> both 1932 and co starring fay <UNK> lionel <UNK> most famous appearances are as the one armed <UNK> in <UNK> of <UNK> 1939 and as <UNK> in <UNK> holmes and the secret <UNK> 1943 dwight frye steals all his manic scenes in <UNK> 1931 as the <UNK> lovers ' <UNK> douglas and fay <UNK> have a nice kissing scene but that's about it he can be seen in 'the old dark <UNK> 1932 and fay gets dragged around by joel <UNK> in 'the most dangerous <UNK> 1930 then there's her 1933 classic <UNK> ' too bad more time money and <UNK> weren't available for this film to better showcase the talents and chemistry of lionel <UNK> fay <UNK> and dwight frye sadly then this <UNK> disappointing film only gets a 4
<START> the best of times is one of the great <UNK> of all time the setup does not tax your patience the development is steady the many <UNK> relationships are lovingly established the gags and bits all work and all are funny there is lots of sentimentality kurt russell playing reno <UNK> puts in one of his best performances and robin williams playing jack <UNK> is sure <UNK> as ever the cast also includes many great supporters jack's wife is played by jack <UNK> daughter who is lovely as is <UNK> wife who is a great comedian i can't tell you how many times i've watched this movie how many times i have enjoyed it and how often i wish that more people could see it
<START> although others have commented that this video is just an edited version of the two shows fire in space and living legend if you watch the original shows you'll find that dialogue from this video edition was edited out i found this video version much better because scenes and lines were added to it i would say if you want to see the show in its original version see the video versions on vhs they have more to offer the fan than the original episodes being offered on dvd now another good video is conquest for the earth which had more scenes from galactica 1980 than did the actual <UNK> themselves overall i rate this as a 10 because it gives you more to enjoy than what the networks wanted to show in the time <UNK> they gave the producers
<START> to describe this film as garbage is unfair at least rooting through garbage can be an absorbing <UNK> this flick was neither absorbing nor entertaining br br kevin bacon can act superbly given the chance so no doubt had an irs bill to settle when he agreed to this dire screenplay the mad scientist story of <UNK> man' has been told before been told better and been told without <UNK> to so many <UNK> expensive special effects br br most of those special effects seem to be built around the transparent <UNK> dolls of men women and dogs you could buy in the early seventies in the uk they were <UNK> as 'the transparent man woman dog ' which is maybe where they got the title for this film br br clever special effects dire script non existent plot br br
<START> i just got done watching kalifornia on showtime for the fourth time since i first saw it back in july of 2001 you would think that with the recent wave of serial killer films that kalifornia would be amongst some of the earlier films worthy of mention but hasn't perhaps if this film had been released sometime between like 1996 1999 maybe it might have been more successful in my opinion kalifornia is much different from most serial killer films released during the late 1990s it has an almost completely different atmosphere from most of today's serial killer films like seven or the bone collector many serial killer films have shown a killer but that person is always behind a mask or we never see enough of them to actually learn anything about them kalifornia is a film that actually tries to break through that <UNK> and actually understand the criminal mind it tries to answer questions like why do they do the things they do is it because of something that happened in their past does it make them feel superior or powerful or do they do it because they like the thrill of the kill these are some of the things that kalifornia tries to answer but also leaves room for us to try and figure things out for ourselves brad pitt makes an <UNK> impression as early <UNK> when we first meet early in the beginning of the film we see that he is obviously one disturbed individual when we first see him it's late at night early is possibly drunk we then see him pick up a rock throw it off a bridge and it later lands on the <UNK> of a passing car pitt is fierce in this film it is always good to see him when he plays <UNK> or really bad people it's funny that this would later lead him play a true <UNK> like in 12 monkeys and that he would be on the other end of the spectrum in david <UNK> seven
<START> two years before he wrote and directed arthur steve gordon had a minor hit with his screenplay for this <UNK> comedic vehicle for henry <UNK> then tv's the <UNK> a 1950s college <UNK> and all around jerk <UNK> a co ed and gets married without any <UNK> <UNK> on the horizon to make ends meet he turns to the flamboyant world of wrestling eventually becoming a gorgeous george like celebrity turning likable <UNK> into an obnoxious goof off probably sounded like an interesting idea at the time and a sure way to separate him from his television alter ego but the jokes and situations are often wrong headed and mean staged rather <UNK> by director carl <UNK> particularly crude is a <UNK> bit involving <UNK> <UNK> of fantasy island putting the moves on polly <UNK> <UNK> from alice as <UNK> beloved kim <UNK> looks a little out of her element particularly when surrounded by all these tv <UNK> rendering the romance aspect of the script <UNK> 1 2 from
<START> terrible i don't want to be too negative but this film has an iq of stupid monkey what a disaster i just couldn't believe how bad this movie is the dialogs are just very strange and off topic the camera work at times just horrible the music at times like a soundtrack for lawrence of <UNK> i just watched this film to see how much worse it can get some of the side kick actors are total disaster sorry but all my thumbs and <UNK> and anything that can hang <UNK> on my body is falling to the ground harvey <UNK> is a great actor but who knows maybe he is in financial <UNK> to take a part in such a fiasco film this movie should have been presented to all the students in all the film schools just to teach them a lesson of how not to make a film
<START> br br presenting lily mars is one of a genre of film that sadly seems to have disappeared with the studio system ok now that you know my bias here are some reasons i think this movie does stand out br br 1 although the basic plot lily mars judy garland goes to new york becomes a star and wins the heart of her director van <UNK> is a pretty stock hollywood story of the period the writers do <UNK> the theme her a bit more than usual although lily gets her big break when the star <UNK> she isn't successful and has to swallow her pride and go back to playing a minor role in the show br br 2 judy garland enough said br br 3 the supporting cast includes some really great performances spring <UNK> as <UNK> mother is <UNK> wonderful as is fay <UNK> the mother of the director john <UNK> van <UNK> the standout supporting performance though goes to character actress connie <UNK> as frankie a one time actress turned theater <UNK> br br worth a watch for sure one of those movies that are designed to make you feel better about the world and your dreams
<START> if it were possible to <UNK> the heart and soul of the sport no the pure lifestyle of surfing to its perfect form this documentary has done it this documentary shows the life isn't just about the waves but it's more about the people the <UNK> and the modern day <UNK> that are pushing the <UNK> of big wave further than it's ever been br br <UNK> <UNK> a virtual legend from my early '80s <UNK> days as a <UNK> teen has edited <UNK> of amazing stock and interview footage down to their essence and created what is not just a documentary but a masterpiece of the genre when his heart and soul is in the subject matter and clearly it is here his genius is <UNK> with a pure vision that doesn't <UNK> hype or <UNK> his subject he <UNK> surfers and the surfing beach lifestyle but doesn't <UNK> it either there is a gritty reality to the sport as well br br there is so much that could be said about this documentary about the surfers the early history of the sport and the wild big wave surfers it <UNK> greg <UNK> the first big wave personality who arguably <UNK> the sport jeff carter an amazing guy who <UNK> virtually alone for 15 years on northern <UNK> extremely dangerous <UNK> big surf and the <UNK> of the documentary <UNK> <UNK> big wave <UNK> present day <UNK> br br there is tremendous heart and warmth among all these guys and a few girls who show up on camera and a deep and powerful love for surfing and the ocean that comes through in every word i found the story of how <UNK> adopted father met him and how hamilton as a small 4 or 5 year old boy practically forced him to be his dad especially heartwarming and again stripped of <UNK> sentimentality br br if you like surfing or even if you don't this is a wonderful documentary that must be watched if only because you're a student of the form or someone who simply <UNK> incredibly well done works of art
<START> or more precisely so bad that you are going to have the time of your life laughing your ass off when you watch it james <UNK> deathstalker of 1983 is certainly one of the most awful productions the sword <UNK> sub genre has brought along but it is highly amusing the acting is terrible the plot is pure crap and the effects and photography couldn't be more amateurish but it is the bad acting the cheesy effects and the many errors that makes this movie so hilarious br br spoilers ahead br br deathstalker rick hill is an extremely strong and skilled warrior one day a good witch tasks him to <UNK> the three powers of chaos and creation a sword an <UNK> and a <UNK> in order to free the country from its brutal <UNK> the evil king and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the sword is quite easy but the <UNK> and the <UNK> are in <UNK> possession fortunately the evil king has arranged a <UNK> in which the <UNK> most skilled warriors fight each other until death the winner is then to take the king's place of course the king doesn't want anybody to take his place an therefore he has planned to kill the winner instead of just not <UNK> the <UNK> in the first place deathstalker is not only to obtain the the three powers of creation but also to save the old good king's gorgeous daughter <UNK> <UNK> from the <UNK> of evil <UNK> luckily he doesn't get bored on his way to the <UNK> since he is allowed <UNK> the gorgeous female warrior <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the meantime br br the film has many great incredibly stupid and funny scenes some of my favorite scenes include br br deathstalker <UNK> a bad guy with his sword the head that falls down however is not that guy's head the falling head has a red <UNK> while the guy <UNK> by deathstalker had dark hair and no beard br br when the character of female warrior <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is introduced she is first seen in a black <UNK> hiding her face and body <UNK> traveling companion <UNK> richard <UNK> fights her and during the sword fight her <UNK> under which she is of course topless opens exposing her breasts her breasts are the first thing we see of <UNK> <UNK> even before her face br br the last warrior deathstalker has to fight in the <UNK> is a giant guy with the body of a man and the head of a pig br br evil <UNK> has an ugly little creature locked in a chest he <UNK> that little creature human <UNK> and fingers br br there are many other unintentionally funny hilarious and great scenes the acting is terrible but <UNK> <UNK> and the late <UNK> <UNK> are eye candy and although i described this movie as <UNK> <UNK> i sometimes had the impression that some of the actors were absolutely aware of how crappy the movie is there is a fair amount of gore and lots of female nudity to keep the viewer entertained deathstalker is an incredibly awful movie but i still highly recommend it people with a sense of humor will have the time of their lives
<START> i think jason lee has huge potential but this was the wrong vehicle in which to attempt to break out as a star the plot is awful the comedy is awful i laughed twice i think for relief because in retrospect they were fairly lame jokes i found myself scared for the future of <UNK> and had to <UNK> myself that it was the film that was flawed not lee br br julia stiles and <UNK> blair are hot but i recommend looking at the still photos on this website to figure that out instead of this film save your time 1 star
<START> i watched this movie last night and already i am struggling to <UNK> very much about it the story is about a group of criminals who escape from a space <UNK> colony they fly to the moon in a space age <UNK> <UNK> when there they <UNK> the <UNK> men who work on the <UNK> br br it strikes me that rubbish low budget sci fi films often involve either desert planets or like this movie criminals escaping from <UNK> <UNK> why this is i have no idea but i can say with some <UNK> that such films are always diabolical this one is really no exception it begins reasonably well with a decent credit sequence and a half way alright dance music soundtrack it then <UNK> into a boring sci fi thriller so little of consequence actually happens in this movie that i am literally struggling to write a helpful review so if you're reading this i <UNK> for not being able to <UNK> you to the film's subtleties and nuances for the record i recall a tedious bunch of baddies a tedious bunch of <UNK> some nuclear <UNK> and a <UNK> of a naked woman other than that i'm struggling br br if you feel you could be interested in the activities of <UNK> <UNK> men then i would not hesitate to recommend this film i would also recommend it to those of you who wish to send their friends to sleep and steal their <UNK>
<START> eddie murphy spends his time looking for lost children so when a very special magical child is kidnapped in <UNK> the sexy charlotte lewis asks for his help to rescue this child from the <UNK> of evil itself br br although the story is a bit silly it never quite feels corny despite the hilarity of the comedy throughout the film charles dance off sets the comedy with his very serious and dark characterisation of the evil that holds the child hostage br br the golden child is very funny action packed and really quite compelling in a charming almost magical way br br 7 10 great for all generations
<START> not only was he <UNK> annoying to listen to but he had no jokes i swear some <UNK> asian guy telling <UNK> <UNK> jokes would've been funnier than <UNK> crap well maybe funny for a couple minutes but at least i'll be able to laugh at least once <UNK> claimed he stopped taking drugs during one of his jokes apparently he was still high on something he was just some <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mostly drug related one of his jokes was something like 'i wouldn't use crack especially having the same name as between my <UNK> oh man how did he come up with that one i swear the only guy that needs to shut the f k up is denis <UNK> thank god i didn't have to see him live this guy totally sucks br br if you're easily amused by swearing and jokes where you can come up with yourself then waste your time with this junk
<START> one of the those coming of age films that should have nostalgia for adults and promise for the kids this movie has neither it is a poor excuse to let sylvia <UNK> body double <UNK> with a <UNK> eric brown to make matters worse the movie is either silly or stupid when it tries to be funny sexy or dramatic laugh <UNK> as we are supposed to believe that a teenager would go alone with <UNK> a dead woman in his front yard <UNK> <UNK> on why a woman famous for <UNK> needs a body double as the movie went on and on i started to imagine a hybrid of private lessons and little miss millions that had sylvia <UNK> seduce jennifer love <UNK> as howard <UNK> makes us nostalgic for <UNK> watch this to laugh at other people's stupidity or for ed <UNK> jr 's committed performance or to wonder what sylvia <UNK> would look like with jennifer love <UNK> but i can give you an idea of your lesson stay away from movies staring sylvia <UNK> that are not <UNK>
<START> <UNK> doctor <UNK> has developed a new theory how to produce energy knowledge that might <UNK> the world he keeps his knowledge <UNK> and secret and desperately wants out of the soviet union <UNK> on the other side desperately wants the new technology so they sets a scheme in motion during a rescue attempt to free <UNK> <UNK> steps in takes <UNK> to a secret location and <UNK> him to reveal his secret by saying they are in sweden and working for the un as a <UNK> <UNK> kidnaps <UNK> estranged daughter cia now send their best agents a team of swedish ninjas to <UNK> <UNK> and rescue <UNK> and his daughter br br comments a cult movie that despite not being very good needs seeing the movie is quite ambitious but lacking in many areas first off is that it is very dark probably to <UNK> locations and bad effects that some scenes are hard to comprehend you can't see what is happening the second thing that it is lacking is martial arts despite being a ninja movie sure there are some of quite poor quality but mostly the ninjas fires automatic guns or sets of explosions the automatic guns pose a problem too as they seem to have a endless supply of <UNK> and the ninjas seem almost <UNK> to bullets while soviet guards die like flies br br what does it have that speaks for it then the idea and ambition foremost some actually and especially for a swedish movie decent action scenes albeit not of martial arts some nice slow motion scenes and pretty much blood and gore and some very interesting new weapons technology that makes the victims heart or brain explode mostly all parts that you look for in a b movie br br because it definitely is a b movie no mistake could be made there but if you expect it and watch it like a b movie it is entertaining but don't forget it is not only a b movie it is set in the eighties some girls for example besides wearing lets say interesting clothes have lethal doses of eye shadow and makeup br br in all see for the cult status and the ambition enjoy it and then forget it br br 4 10
<START> raw force is like an ultra sleazy and perverted version of love boat with additional kung fu fights demented <UNK> monks white slaves trade energetic zombies and a whole lot of lousy acting performances no wonder this movie was included in the recently released <UNK> experience 20 movie box set it's got everything exploitation fanatics are looking for blend in a totally incoherent and seemingly improvised script the production values are extremely poor and the technical aspects are pathetic but the amounts of gratuitous violence sex can hardly be described the film opens at a <UNK> sunny location called warriors island where a <UNK> of <UNK> monks raise the dead for no apparent reason other than to turn them into kung fu fighters the monks also buy sexy slaves from a sleazy hitler look alike businessman supposedly because the women's flesh supplies them with the required powers to increase their zombie army tourists on a passing cruise ship among them three martial arts fighters a female la cop and a whole bunch of ravishing but dim witted ladies are attacked by the hitler guy's <UNK> because they were planning an <UNK> to warriors island their <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the island anyway and the monks challenge the survivors to a fighting test with their zombies okay how does that sound for a crazy midnight horror movie mess it's not over yet because raw force also has <UNK> wild boat <UNK> cameron mitchell in yet another embarrassing lead role and 70's exploitation <UNK> <UNK> keaton i spit on your grave in an utterly insignificant cameo appearance there's loads of badly realized gore including axe <UNK> and <UNK> hammy jokes and bad taste romance the trash value of this movie will literally leave you speechless the evil <UNK> background remains naturally unexplained and they don't even become <UNK> for their questionable <UNK> maybe that's why the movie stops with to be continued instead of with the end the sequel never came unless it's so obscure imdb doesn't even list it
<START> for those of you who have read <UNK> <UNK> highly respected novel this film will definitely impress you because of how honorable an adaptation it is with the exception of one minor subplot <UNK> <UNK> feature film debut is an almost dead on recreation of the book down to the last line br br for those of you who have not read the novel this movie might be a little <UNK> it is certainly not a large cinematic drama story instead it has a strong element of realism to it but i would not have it any other way the best way to describe such a long journey to movie fans would be to say that it is a small scale <UNK> version of <UNK> on the <UNK> instead of a jewish russian <UNK> the protagonist <UNK> noble is a <UNK> in 1970's <UNK> during the time of the muslim hindi war with <UNK> he is forced to deal with a number of unexpected problems in his life including his sick daughter his <UNK> <UNK> son a distant friend who gets him involved with some dirty money and an <UNK> neighborhood the ending is not a happy one nor is it a sad one but that is essentially what realism involves br br such a long journey is a fine little movie but if you want to see it then good luck finding it unlike the novel it has received very little release
<START> this movie is an eye opener for those who can only the glamorous <UNK> of the stars it tells you how people who would like to do good are not able to plus the bomb blast scene is very real br br what you read and are taught just does not happen br br can raise your <UNK> level by 10 br br all actors played their role very well br br some scenes may could have been avoided to include teenagers br br this movie is quite adult in nature br br not a movie that can be seen with family br br casting is great
<START> let me start out by saying that i used to really like betty <UNK> particularly from down <UNK> way but by the time she got around to this disaster she had also got round and frankly the whole film was an embarrassment <UNK> with douglas fairbanks <UNK> who must have been fairly desperate the story was bad the colours good and the film far too long it had some of the old <UNK> in it like harry <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> to try and <UNK> interest but with no success the music score was <UNK> and i have to say not one tune was memorable in any way as i was such a fan of miss <UNK> i always wish i had never seen this one
<START> i watched this film because i noticed that it had <UNK> <UNK> in the cast i have long had a theory about her that she is a talented actress but never seems to get to prove that because she is always in this sort of low budget b movie she is still beautiful and she is still trying to act over the unfortunate material i always see her in this is no different the film is often ugly and disturbing but that doesn't make it good george <UNK> played against type and that was so jarring that he gets recognition for his role another note about ms <UNK> her breasts seem to have <UNK> <UNK> since i saw her last perhaps <UNK> surgery or more likely <UNK> of <UNK> this not a bad thing she still looks great i would like to see her in a better movie
<START> it is an excellent thriller from turkey which can make sense great job from <UNK> brothers br br first of all i want to point on screen play generally screen play in most films from turkey is not enough but gen has the best shots to be said perfect and also transition parts are really excellent br br on the other hand gen has a great topic that influence everyone especially a woman who wants to be a <UNK> in a <UNK> has a mother that is a <UNK> insanity principal causes and psychological consequences are given in gen the only thing you have to do is to combine all the hints br br there is an impressive <UNK> part <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> played this performance may be more realistic than <UNK> monica <UNK> br br the last thing i want to say is watch this movie you'll get confused
<START> oh god what a horrible horrible film meant to be a comment on the state of society it's just a reflection of the worst of the worst in reality tv <UNK> <UNK> by jason jones and don <UNK> are the most obnoxious part written in a tone that is perhaps meant to be <UNK> and insightful rather these moments are mind numbing as they speak to the camera with dialogue written by someone with a love for insulting condescending speech that <UNK> the meaning of the film down the viewer's throat br br also a point to would be filmmakers long takes and quiet scenes do not equal art neither do extreme angles or logic stretched to the point of absurdity br br if anyone out there is interested in watching this film please don't seriously please you have better things to do
<START> i saw this film for the very first time several years ago and was hooked up in an instant it is great and much better than j f k cause you always have to think <UNK> it happen to me can i become a murderer ' you cannot turn of the tv or your vcr without thinking about the plot and the end which you <UNK> miss under any circumstances
<START> this is the best picture about baseball since redford whacked the natural our way dennis quaid and rachel <UNK> light up the screen with a great story and a cast that seemed real enough to pull you into their lives br br laced with dreams dripping in reality the american dream <UNK> after 9 11 with a true story about the devil <UNK> mid life rookie jimmy morris australian born actress rachel <UNK> plays a native west <UNK> better than a lot of <UNK> i know and dennis quaid was perfection  cast as the wannabe <UNK> and humble winner with as much psychological <UNK> as the average viewer in the audience it's real the on screen chemistry works if you like baseball heart <UNK> you're going to love this film the ingredients for <UNK> and apple pie were all in there my popcorn became the <UNK> la <UNK> br br and hey buy the cd the music rocks and carries the story <UNK> <UNK> words and music pushes the story forward exactly the way it should an area that disappoints me more often than not br br criticisms i'd have given the baseball to somebody else but quaid has something to teach us all about <UNK> and heart st rita and the nuns were a nice decoration but they never really found their place in the story to open and close around them a little long worth every minute in the last analysis 8 10 br br
<START> this is almost like two films one <UNK> and engaging the other stupid and clichéd it's really a shame all the problems weren't worked out with the writing but considering how quickly most b movies were written and produced this isn't too unusual it's a real shame though as this could have been a very good film br br first the good the movie is original and involves wwii code <UNK> this is pretty fascinating and i liked watching the leading man lee <UNK> go through his <UNK> as a master code <UNK> in fact the first two thirds of the film was very good but now for the bad the film just went on way too long and lost steam at about 50 minutes additionally jean <UNK> role as the <UNK> girlfriend must rank as one of the worst written and distracting roles in film history for every smart move made by <UNK> the idiot rogers then stepped in to screw things up as some sort of misguided comedy relief if her role had been intelligently written the overall film would have improved immensely instead watching her it's hard to understand how we actually won wwii
<START> i watch cold case because of the real life experiences depicted this one was very close to me and touched me deeply so beautifully handled thanks <UNK> all the characters are well developed 3d especially coop the material is still difficult to approach the us is far behind the developed nations of the world only this kind of honest actual <UNK> portrayal and treatment makes an impact on the population of course not everyone sees things the same way but i am <UNK> that 3 4 of the men <UNK> in the under 30 crowd voted the same as me 10 you're reaching the hard ones i will forever <UNK> the best episode place for this episode please continue taking chances and accept my heartfelt <UNK>
<START> <UNK> again from the darkness what a relief a thriller that actually is thrilling new it girl rachel mcadams wedding <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> screen time in this nice little classic suspense thriller from famed horror film director wes craven scream movies and a nightmare on elm street craven even has a cameo as one of the passengers on the plane br br what makes this one work is the realism of the first 15 20 minutes as we see mcadams interact with 4 or 5 people either in person or on the phone she is a natural when she meets cillian murphy the scarecrow in batman begins in what appears to be <UNK> the film really takes flight watching the two <UNK> types <UNK> while the audience knows something evil is <UNK> is <UNK> film making the plane <UNK> sequence is mesmerizing and the 30 plus minutes <UNK> is excruciatingly claustrophobic craven keeps us guessing as to the involvement of others and if anyone will come to her rescue br br as with many thrillers the only letdown occurs during the climax when the <UNK> turns into a superhero an interesting plot device leads us to believe little rachel has the necessary <UNK> up frustration to see this through but we can't help but cringe a bit the most overdone scenes involve <UNK> hotel guests an annoying <UNK> passenger <UNK> injury and the fx at the hotel the strength of the film is in the character development and psychological games between the leads sadly the fine screen veteran brian cox is under <UNK> but overall this is an above average suspense thriller worth seeing for all but the finale
<START> as a <UNK> i'm proud of the handful of good danish movies that have been produced in recent years it's a terrible shame however that this <UNK> in quality has led the majority of danish movie critics to lose their sense of criticism in fact it has become so bad that i no longer trust any reviews of danish movies and as a result i have stopped watching them in theaters br br i know it's wrong to hold this unfortunate development against any one movie so let me stress that villa paranoia would be a terrible film under any circumstances the fact that it was hyped by the critics just added fuel to my <UNK> of <UNK> with danish film furthermore waiting until it came out on dvd was very little help against the <UNK> feeling of having wasted time and money br br <UNK> <UNK> is an accomplished director with a knack for social realism in <UNK> settings i particularly enjoyed de <UNK> 1993 as an actor he is usually funny though he generally plays the same role in all of his movies namely that of a working class <UNK> who's down on his luck partly because he's a <UNK> but mostly because of society and who <UNK> himself by doing something good for his community br br this is problem number one in villa paranoia <UNK> casts himself as a chicken farmer which is such a break from the norm that he never succeeds in making it credible br br it is much worse however that the film has to make twists and turns and break all rules of how to tell a story to make the audience understand what is going on for instance the movie opens with a very sad attempt at <UNK> the near death experience of the main character with the use of low budget effects and bad camera work after that the character tells her best friend that she suddenly felt the urge to throw herself off a bridge this is <UNK> of the whole movie there is little or no motivation for the actions of the characters and <UNK> <UNK> to the lowest form of <UNK> whatever motivation there is telling instead of showing thus at one point you have a character talking out loud to a <UNK> <UNK> person about the way he feels because the script wouldn't allow him to act out his feelings and later on voice over is abruptly introduced quite possibly as an <UNK> to convey feelings that would otherwise remain unknown to the audience due to the director's <UNK> fortunately at this point you're roughly an hour past caring about any of the characters let alone the so called story br br the acting which has frequently been a problem in <UNK> movies can be summed up in one sad statement <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> whose only other claim to stardom was as a contestant on big brother is no worse than several of the <UNK> actors in the cast br br i give this a 2 out of 10 rating
<START> now i had the best intentions when watching this one i like some of tony scott's work also a friend of mine told me it was a great movie even though i heard otherwise from other people but this was simply hopeless br br in my humble opinion tony scott was trying too hard it was all just too much allow me to elaborate br br miss knightley was overacting and not in a good way the people who did perform well were mickey rourke edgar <UNK> and christopher walken but their screen time just wasn't able to save the movie br br there were a few scenes that jumped out in their originality yet somehow it felt like they were written by someone other than the main writer a certain tune was used around 4 times which really started to bug after the second time i'm a firm believer of not using the same tune more than once br br also the editing really went out on this one as the cutting rate is rather high oh and the repetitive <UNK> of some of <UNK> lines simply sounded cheesy after hearing it for the second third fourth time and so on br br basically my opinion is that if you want to see an action flick that is high paced and somewhat funny and you don't care about everything i mentioned above you might like it br br on a side note i'm not a <UNK> knightley fan
<START> mr mike was probably the most <UNK> comedian of all time so i was interested to see what he'd do with total creative control over a movie sadly it is unwatchable though not because the jokes aren't funny some i won't say most of them are and in fact mr mike did a good job <UNK> his mentally <UNK> <UNK> into visual gags the trouble is that the technical quality sets lighting sound editing you name it is so god awful the movie is <UNK> some outfit called <UNK> productions gets the producing credit but it doesn't look produced at all it looks more like mike stole one of the cameras from the snl set and made the whole thing in an afternoon i realize <UNK> goal was to torture the audience but even that deserves some basic standards such as the ability to actually see hear or comprehend whatever it is that's supposed to be shocking still the dvd isn't a total waste it includes a <UNK> for <UNK> by bill murray and three mr <UNK> least loved <UNK> stories from snl plus the cat swimming section of the movie is a great scene to be caught watching if you want to freak someone out 3 10
<START> the ladies man suffers a common problem among movies based on saturday night live skits and that is a sketch that usually succeeds in five minutes will not do so well in ninety minutes although this movie does have its laughs like tim meadows as leon <UNK> a sex maniac straight out of the '70s and will ferrell as a wrestling obsessed husband <UNK> by leon so this movie is funny enough but it's no wayne's world
<START> seed is torture porn no doubt about it but strangely uwe boll has written produced and directed a more polished film than any other he has made in recent memory br br every time i watch a boll film i feel that some pages of the script must have gone missing there are simply huge gaps in the story and dialogue of course nothing makes much sense either the films are somewhat surreal in this respect br br spoilers br br why do the six cops who go to arrest seed split up and go their separate ways when they get to the <UNK> <UNK> unlike real cops who would enter and clear the house in <UNK> or by <UNK> why don't the cops ever use their <UNK> how can the bodies <UNK> so quickly a process that would normally take many months i know it's time <UNK> photography but seed would never be able to stay on schedule killing people if he always waited around for the previous victim to <UNK> to the point shown how come seed gets to wear <UNK> <UNK> and a mask while he's waiting on death row instead of typical prison uniforms how can seed enter a maximum security prison <UNK> around the cell block and then walk out again without being stopped or even noticed if nearly 80 people according to some newspaper <UNK> shown in the movie have been murdered why is there only one investigator working on the case why did the investigator suddenly decide that he should go look for seed at <UNK> house where he was originally arrested and where he murdered his victims didn't he think of doing this sooner why does the police detective go it solo without back up and without even letting <UNK> know what he was doing and where he was headed br br this is particularly frustrating when boll obviously goes far out of his way to make sure we understand why the electric chair fails to work properly he spends several screen minutes in setting this up when he could have spent them making other aspects of the film at least a bit more logical br br end spoilers br br in short the film just sort of serves as a <UNK> for a few <UNK> scenes perhaps boll would think of these as his visions of a brutal death by <UNK> <UNK> to the head execution by <UNK> and the <UNK> of live animals raised for their <UNK> the opening scenes of animals being skinned were indeed unnecessary and disturbing but i understand their purpose in the context of the film the <UNK> is undoubtedly the <UNK> death of a middle aged woman by seed using a <UNK> it's obvious that much time was spent on this and it vaguely reminds me of the classic scene in <UNK> dogs though without the <UNK> dan soundtrack br br is this a good movie no is it worth seeing only if you are a dedicated fan of the torture porn genre or if you are absolutely determined to see a <UNK> of torture porn as i said at the start of this review even though this movie is pretty disgusting and can be sickening at points it is truly much more competent than most of <UNK> movies perhaps he will continue to improve as a filmmaker i can only hope that he progresses beyond torture porn and continues more in the vein of <UNK>
<START> jim carrey is back to much the same role that he played in the mask a <UNK> guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being <UNK> by a bunch of <UNK> and of course they have to be mexican obviously his good will towards his fellow man <UNK> in that case it wasn't too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry <UNK> but i like that the movie suggests that things like that shouldn't be ignored i'm reminded of the episode of michael moore's brilliant the awful truth when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay the results were not very promising so it's nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example br br jim carrey plays the part of bruce nolan the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart or even better it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an <UNK> entering the atmosphere a little metaphor that comes up when bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film bruce is nearly 40 years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local <UNK> that's seeking to <UNK> the world's biggest cookie he's desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the tv station but he loses his cool on live tv when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague you have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report needless to say he loses his temper on live tv in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film br br morgan freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the man himself displaying a god whose <UNK> wisdom is somewhat reflected through <UNK> massive talent as an actor he is the kind of god who takes his job very seriously but in such a way as to advise his followers as well as the viewers of this movie that there are times when you need to slow down and do some <UNK> labor in life i love his line that some of the <UNK> people in the world come home <UNK> to high heaven at the end of the day there are a lot of people in the world maybe more than our share in america who are so absorbed by their money and their <UNK> and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans br br one of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about <UNK> their lives and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewer's religion i for example tend to reject organized religion in all forms and i see god and satan to be <UNK> for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live but despite the fact that i don't believe that god exists as an <UNK> <UNK> the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who <UNK> the floors of his downtown office in his spare time i was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie br br jim <UNK> movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he's come if you compare bruce almighty with movies like ace <UNK> both of which i loved by the way or a lot of what he did before he got into film it's amazing how far he's come he has moved from cheesy tv comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like the truman show man on the moon and the <UNK> easily one of his greatest films ever jim carrey has <UNK> moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today br br jennifer aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie as she did in the side splitting office space as <UNK> girlfriend who becomes increasingly <UNK> by <UNK> growing stress about his life as well as his <UNK> to ask her to marry him there is definitely some low brow comedy in the film that doesn't really fit with the importance of the film's meaning or the quality of the delivery such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene but it was definitely pretty nice to see ace <UNK> friend spike make a cameo appearance as stephen king very well knows it's always nice to see familiar characters it's almost like seeing family again br br bruce is <UNK> with the powers of god for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him the thing i love about this is that like i said before religion is absent from my life but i was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things i would have done had i been <UNK> with such powers the movie allows us to learn <UNK> this way which <UNK> the message even more br br the scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film such as the scene when bruce loses his temper about the anchor position the jimmy <UNK> scene who was conveniently buried with an original birth <UNK> and a complete set of dental records the scene where <UNK> rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera and my favorites the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local <UNK> cooking the movie has plenty of time for carrey to deliver some excellent jokes such as when he says to god who reveals that he's the janitor the <UNK> the <UNK> etc that his christmas parties must be real <UNK> and to be careful about drinking because on of him might need a ride home i also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes a little too true and as <UNK> would add behind every great man is also an amazed mother in law br br bruce almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while and is probably the only directly religious that i can remember seeing that i am anxious to buy on dvd to add to my personal collection it is a comedy written and performed in good taste but with enough relatively low brow humor to keep the kids entertained this is a meaningful comedy for the whole family which is becoming <UNK> and <UNK> these days in a world that is about to be <UNK> with yet another american pie film and another scary movie which are only scary because of their sheer <UNK> idiocy it's nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching don't miss this one
<START> very badly made film the action violence scenes are ridiculous br br 1 point for the presence of burton and mastroianni 1 point for the real tragic event of the massacre of the innocent italians 2 10
<START> <UNK> is the only show <UNK> from the experimental theatre movement in new york in the 1960s the origins of off off broadway though it's not for everyone it is a genuinely brilliant darkly funny even more often deeply disturbing tale about love sex personal liberty and revenge a serious morality tale even more relevant now in a time when <UNK> wants to outlaw gay marriage by <UNK> our <UNK> the story is not about being gay though it's about love and sex that don't <UNK> to social <UNK> and therefore must be removed through violence and hate on the surface it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig but like any great fable it's not really about animals it's about something bigger <UNK> <UNK> in america br br the stage version won international acclaim in its original production it <UNK> the u s and europe and with others of its kind influenced almost all theatre that came after it luckily we have <UNK> here the show pretty much as it was originally conceived with the original cast and original director tom <UNK> who also directed hair and jesus christ superstar on broadway br br this is not a mainstream easy to take studio film this is an aggressive unsettling glorious deeply emotional wildly imaginative piece of storytelling that you'll never forget and it just might change the way you see the world
<START> dire just dire the script is contrived the acting painful and the story just drags along it is without a doubt a celebration of sally potter and little else this wouldn't be so bad but she's the director writer and star of the film and so is just self <UNK> i found myself not caring about the developing romance between the principal two characters and the ending came not a moment too soon it has two redeeming features first is that a lot of the shots are really quite lovely particularly in paris and look rather good in black and white secondly whether you're a fan of tango or not the music is by and large excellent except where sally starts singing watch this film at your own risk or if you need an unintentional laugh i am sure it appeals to someone <UNK> it has to
<START> this was awful <UNK> <UNK> is a terrible actress so wooden she makes a <UNK> horse look like it could do a better job but then remember that turn in four <UNK> equally as excruciating another film that portrays england as full of chocolate box <UNK> and village <UNK> i mean that school how many schools apart from maybe <UNK> look like that the <UNK> police station looked like the set from <UNK> a nauseating british series set in the 60s this film just couldn't make its mind up what it wanted to be a comedy or a serious examination of the <UNK> in women's friendships if it had stuck to the former then the graveyard sex scenes and the highly stupid <UNK> of the wedding might just have worked i say just but those scenes just didn't work with the tragedy in the second half i also find it implausible that kate would ever speak to molly again after her terrible behaviour a final note what is a decent actress like <UNK> doing in this pile of poo not to mention anna <UNK> <UNK> should stick to advertising <UNK> cream
<START> having just watched this film again from a 1998 showing off <UNK> 1 i just had to comment br br the first time i saw this film on tv it was about 1981 and i remember <UNK> it off of my mother's <UNK> it wound up <UNK> in black and white for some reason which gave it a period look that i grew to like br br i remember very <UNK> the film beginning with the song my bonnie as the camera <UNK> over a scene of <UNK> i also remember the opening scene where paul gestures to some girls and says look talent so it was with great <UNK> that i popped in my 1998 taped version and remembered that the film opens with she loves you instead of my bonnie when you see how slowly the camera pans vs the speed of the music you can see that she loves you just doesn't fit also in this later version when paul sees the girls he says look girls and somehow having remembered the earlier version that word just didn't seem to fit either why they felt they had to <UNK> this film for american audiences is beyond me personally if i'm going to watch a film about a british band i want all of the british <UNK> and such that would be a part of their speech mannerisms etc br br another <UNK> was how choppy the editing was for television just after <UNK> gets beaten for example the film cuts to a commercial break lots of 'em yeah i know it depends on the network but it really ruins the effect of a film to have it <UNK> apart as we all know what some people might find as insignificant in terms of dialogue and thereby okay to edit may actually go the way of explaining a particular action or scene that follows br br my point is the best version of this film was probably the earlier version i taped from 1981 which just so happened to include the shake <UNK> roll scene that my 1998 version didn't i started to <UNK> that there had to have been two different versions made for television and a look at the alternate versions link regarding this film proved me right that the american version had some shorter cut different scenes and or dialogue is a huge disappointment to me and something worth mentioning if one cares about such things imo ones best bet is to try and get a hold of the european version of this film if possible and probably even less possible an <UNK> version sadly i had to <UNK> my old <UNK> european version because i didn't know how to <UNK> it br br all that aside i found this film to be perhaps one of the best films regarding the story behind the birth of the beatles being well aware that artistic and creative license is often used in movies and tv when portraying events in history i didn't let any <UNK> <UNK> my enjoyment of the film sure you see the beatles perform songs at the <UNK> that made me wonder did they even write that back then i don't think so but nevertheless i thought it was a great film and the performances wonderful br br the real stand out for me in fact was the actor who played john stephen <UNK> i just about fell in love with him his look mannerisms personality and speaking voice seemed to be spot on he looked enough like a young john for me to do a double take towards the end of the film when you see the beatles performing on ed sullivan for the first time i actually found myself questioning whether or not it was actual <UNK> footage until i saw the other actors in the scene br br if you're looking for a dead accurate history of the <UNK> life and <UNK> you can't get any better than the <UNK> anthology as it was written by the <UNK> themselves however if you're looking for a fun <UNK> of their pre <UNK> days leading up to their arrival in america and you leave your <UNK> critical <UNK> at the door you can't go wrong with the birth of the beatles a must for any real or casual <UNK> fan
<START> i knew nothing of this film before i was convinced to see it by a friend who had heard it was a non stop epic battle scene from beginning to end that couldn't have been further from the truth this was one of the most boring poorly written <UNK> directed horribly acted films i've ever had the misfortune to lay my eyes upon i'd rank it up there with the movie i consider to be the worst film of all time battlefield earth there basically is no story it's hard to believe that the makers of this film thought that this cheesy soap opera crap would be taken seriously as actual historic fact it also features some of the worst dialogue i've ever heard like this little gem guy tells girl you smell like the moon girl replies what does the moon smell like <UNK> you have to be kidding me the scene where the guy was drawn and <UNK> got some good laughs from the audience since it looked so ridiculously cheap and the sound fx of the guy being ripped apart reminded me of someone making a fart sound with their mouth if this is playing at a theater near you avoid it at all costs this movie is so bad that i actually made the decision about 45 minutes through that i needed to catch up on my sleep and i did awful
<START> from rainy dreary late winter england of early 1920s br br where there is still sadness and many young <UNK> and disabled vets from the great slaughter of men and killer of their <UNK> dreams known now as world war i br br four women share this lovely small sunny italian castle on a hill one a young widow who is drowning her sorrow in frantic <UNK> two women who will <UNK> their own husbands and a fourth woman who is tired of her famous dead friends br br these four women will come together with two husbands and a former soldier almost blind to get a spiritual <UNK> for one great april vacation in early <UNK> italy br br note to would be filmmakers study this film for how mood and beauty can tell a story probably not a film to please many men br br note stock up on coffee hot chocolate and invite the girls over on some dreary late winter day spring is coming enchanted april promises you
<START> a very good adaptation of the novel by amrita <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> have given their best br br there is a natural flair in the movie and i felt it right through it looked like bollywood finally gave away it's <UNK> and had some quality artists performing on screen br br content wise the movie depicted very much what exactly happened during <UNK> by showing the <UNK> of a particular family and also shows that trust in one's life goes beyond religion br br the best part was they did not make it a drama with a lot of tear <UNK> and melodrama br br i simply loved it
<START> let me state at the outset that i have cerebral <UNK> and i went into this film expecting to have to make <UNK> for the lead performance i left the theater half convinced that they'd cast an actor who had cerebral <UNK> in the role even though i knew that was not the case the performances were generally excellent with a special nod to brenda <UNK> and to hugh <UNK> i believe that's his name as the young christy brown christy is talented <UNK> arrogant at times vulgar and <UNK> in other words human this film along with <UNK> a true story and the documentary king <UNK> are excellent portrayals of life with <UNK> by no means a complete portrait but fine examples of the disabled as human beings most highly recommended
<START> <UNK> mister tom begins in an <UNK> exquisite village in the south of england where the sun always seems to shine before we have much idea of the period we hear a radio <UNK> of the <UNK> of world war ii soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings <UNK> children from london and when shy little william is <UNK> with reluctant gruff old tom who you just know will turn out to have a heart of gold our tale begins br br and what a load of sentimental <UNK> it is in fact it's just the old odd couple buddy formula aren't any new stories being written br br as i suggested there's hardly any period feel in the village and not much more in london apart from the odd old <UNK> <UNK> around and certainly no hint of the horror of the <UNK> as <UNK> citizens file <UNK> into air raid <UNK> even when the local <UNK> husband is <UNK> missing presumed killed he is later restored to life br br i found <UNK> mister <UNK> cliched and obvious and john <UNK> accent <UNK> up a picture of <UNK> barker of the two <UNK> with a straw in his mouth doing his country <UNK> accent br br incidentally my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons that i disliked it and looking at fellow imdb reviewers i seem to be in a minority of one br br
<START> in anne of green <UNK> 1934 <UNK> <UNK> helen <UNK> and matthew <UNK> o p <UNK> middle aged siblings who live together at green <UNK> a farm in <UNK> on prince edward island decide to adopt a boy from distant <UNK> to help on their farm but the orphan sent to them is a <UNK> girl of 14 named anne shirley dawn evelyn paris a veteran of disney's series of alice shorts who later would adopt her character's name br br anne was only 11 in lucy <UNK> <UNK> source novel but the same actress could not <UNK> go from 11 to college age during the course of the story the movie suffers somewhat from this <UNK> as many of <UNK> reactions and much of what she says are more entertaining coming from an eleven year old that from a teenager as in the book anne is bright and quick eager to please but <UNK> with her name her build her <UNK> and her long red hair being a child of imagination however anne takes much joy in life and <UNK> quickly to her new family and the environment of prince edward island br br in fact anne is the original teenage drama queen and the film's screenwriter elected to focus on this aspect of her character which transformed the basic genre from mildly amusing family drama to comedy a change that delighted audiences and that continues to <UNK> reader <UNK> br br since the comedy is very much in the spirit of the <UNK> story i can see no reason to take issue with the changes but let this serve as fair warning to anyone expecting a totally faithful adaptation the comedy element is the strength of the film as it is one of the earliest self <UNK> parodies of hollywood conventions the actress anne shirley was one of hollywood's all time <UNK> and the film is in black and white so much of the amusement is in seeing the title character's endless <UNK> about her appearance and hair color <UNK> by what is appearing on the screen anne regularly <UNK> her no nonsense rural companions with melodramatic lines like if you refuse it will be a <UNK> sorrow to me perhaps the funniest moment is when she <UNK> the spelling of her name on the <UNK> <UNK> br br tom brown does a nice job as <UNK> love interest gilbert <UNK> and sara <UNK> steals all the scenes in which she appears as the <UNK> pompous neighbor br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> i suppose jedi is now <UNK> to be considered the very last entry in the popular saga and it's a very good one as were several of these i liked how directly this sequel took off after the empire strikes back and i appreciated the maturity of luke skywalker as a character and also mark <UNK> as an actor after hearing so many negative things about the ewoks they weren't so bad i enjoyed the thrilling chase within the woods and i felt there was a lot of well realized emotion with this chapter the ending with some new <UNK> i presume successfully weaves all 6 chapters into a wonderful tale of fantasy i know many true star wars fans hated george lucas for changes he made to the original films but being a relative <UNK> to these movies rather late in life and not missing what i didn't already know i think he made these 6 movies work perfectly as a whole <UNK> oh and <UNK> carrie fisher looked quite delicious in her skimpy outfit
<START> since the day i saw this film when it came out in 1981 it has been one of my top 3 favorites the <UNK> i wrote for amazon is below and i'm just thrilled that it's finally coming out on dvd on 10 17 <UNK> the film's <UNK> <UNK> br br the last credit in this film explains its appeal thank you to the people of manhattan on whose island this was filmed a charming and witty romantic comedy it is a love story written to new <UNK> peter bogdanovich is a native who can identify every location west <UNK> street the <UNK> the old <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and city limits which was a country western club one gets the impression that the entire ensemble cast <UNK> as well off screen as they do on and this <UNK> is clearly <UNK> i laughed i cried it was better than cats not only an <UNK> to dorothy <UNK> it was also audrey <UNK> last feature appearance she had a cameo subsequent to this film and her inner beauty <UNK> from the screen buy it make a big <UNK> of popcorn and <UNK> up with someone you love
<START> let me start off by saying that after watching this episode for the first time on dvd at 10 <UNK> p m one night i could not fall asleep until about 3 00 a m br br this brief review may contain spoilers br br i'm a long time fan of the sopranos and i can safely say this is the best episode i've seen i'm not saying everyone should feel this way but i do this episode is identical to the weekend i spent with my family watching over my own father <UNK> in the <UNK> before he passed br br the episode begins with tony in an alternate reality he is a salesman who's identity has been mistaken for that of a man named kevin <UNK> br br by the time ten minutes had gone by i knew either tony was dreaming or i was watching some other show it wasn't like the normal sopranos and i loved it br br option 1 is confirmed when anthony or kevin looks into the sky at a helicopter spotlight and we see <UNK> through it a doctor with a <UNK> we see this only for a moment and the sequence plays out until we go back to real life in a situation similar to the one i just stated br br tony has come out of the coma for only a moment his boys take a j home and <UNK> overcome by stress breaks down in the <UNK> a signature moment in the episode br br for the remainder of the episode we cut in between the real world the family dealing with the potential negative outcome of this coma and tony's alternate reality which parallels what's going on both in his mind and in the real world around him br br then comes the stellar point in the episode after a j finishes telling his mother he's <UNK> school she walks in to see <UNK> sitting at <UNK> side br br she approaches tony and <UNK> the best line of the episode anthony can you hear us in tony's world he enters a dark hotel room and turns on a light he takes off his shoes and goes to the phone he tries to <UNK> but he cannot as if he were trying to say something back to <UNK> but couldn't physically bring himself to do so not yet br br he sits down and looks out his window a <UNK> light that has <UNK> throughout the episode now seems to call to him from the other side of the city br br when it's cold i'd like to die by <UNK> marries perfectly with these last images and helps in creating an emotional roller coaster of an episode br br 10 out of 10 br br p s watch the next episode you find out what the light is it's wonderful
<START> did the movie makers even preview this before they released it the script jumps from place to place without giving much explanation the beginning doesn't <UNK> if its a prequel or not it starts with <UNK> <UNK> on earth and then jumps to a point after the last movie but doesn't really alert the viewer of this very confusing superman himself is weak and in need of <UNK> he is portrayed as a potential home <UNK> a stalker and someone who is clearly depressed and confused this type of character rarely makes for an interesting hero the ending is absolutely ridiculous superman ending up in a hospital just made me want to kill him off myself i'm seriously waiting for a snl skit where superman appears on <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> says the results are in in the case of the child superman you are the father to sum up ok acting by this superman and kevin spacey but horrible script the movie is basically unwatchable
<START> nathan detroit frank sinatra is the manager of the new <UNK> longest established floating <UNK> game and he needs 1000 to secure a new location confident of his odds he <UNK> the city's highest roller sky masterson marlon brando that he can't woo uptight <UNK> sarah brown jean simmons <UNK> and dolls 1955 ' is such a great musical because it <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> styles of film and stage during a dazzling opening sequence crowds of <UNK> move in rhythm stopping and starting as though <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> even the walking movements themselves are <UNK> and <UNK> halfway between a walk and a dance <UNK> new york city is a <UNK> <UNK> of art <UNK> colour and movement a fantasy world so completely removed from reality that even the business of underground gambling and criminal <UNK> seems perfectly <UNK> br br as i write this review i've just received word that jean simmons has passed away age 80 this unbelievably was the first time i'd seen her in a film yet she <UNK> me from the beginning her idealistic and sexually repressed sarah comes out of her shell following an alcohol <UNK> in <UNK> letting loose with an <UNK> playful rendition of if i were a bell even though both simmons and brando were non singers producer sam <UNK> decided not to dub their <UNK> <UNK> that maybe you don't sound so good but at least it's you despite <UNK> <UNK> confidence the pair both do well to carry entire musical numbers themselves simmons suggests the same child like <UNK> that audrey hepburn might have brought to the role and brando exudes such self <UNK> and charisma that it doesn't matter that his singing voice isn't quite there
<START> the first half of the film is ok the second half one of the most tedious experiences imaginable quite possibly the most overrated movie of all time pulp fiction was robbed for best picture this is one of those films that people feel required to love because the main character is slow
<START> i remember watching this movie several times as a very young kid and there were parts of it many in fact that i did not understand i think i have seen it once as an adult and i then understood those parts the only problem with viewing it as an adult was that it was not entertaining to me at all so what kind of movie is this is it a kids movie not hardly it contains language and subject matter not suitable for kids is it a <UNK> of what every parent feels like they are going through with their own children maybe but then why wouldn't it focus more on john <UNK> character instead of junior when a film has a 7 year old as its main character in order to do well with it's audience it should be a movie for the seven and under crowd otherwise people older than that will have no way to relate even 8 year olds wouldn't want to see a movie about a kid who is whole year younger than them i'm pretty sure this film did not do well in the box office and the reason has to be because it was unable to find a <UNK> in the market
<START> do not bother to waste your money on this movie do not even go into your car and think that you might see this movie if any others do not appeal to you if you must see a movie this weekend go see batman again br br the script was horrible perfectly written from the random horror movie format given a place in confined spaces a madman with various weapons a curious man who manages to <UNK> all of the clues that honest police officers cannot put together and an innocent and overly curious yet beautiful and strong woman with whom many in the audience would love to be able to call their girlfriend mix together add much poorly executed gore and what the hell let's put some freaks in there for a little spin to the plot br br the acting was horrible and the characters unbelievable <UNK> was more believable than this br br spoiler and can someone please tell me how a <UNK> <UNK> can make a bullet <UNK> from the person after being shot without even making the person who was shot <UNK> i'm in the army we need that kind of stuff for ourselves br br 1 out of 10 and i would place it in the <UNK> of that rounded up to give it the lowest possible score i can
<START> ok it's not a perfect movie by any means but i disagree with the overall imdb opinion that it's really really bad i watched a lot of hong kong <UNK> in the 1990's and loved the era <UNK> i never saw <UNK> <UNK> at the time and only saw it last week for the first time apart from the embarrassingly poor dubbing which my dvd copy didn't give me the option to turn off the movie contains the raw energy and <UNK> that <UNK> hong kong movies during this time i still stick to my guns in the opinion that when it comes to action these guys no matter what their budget add an element of magic to the screen no bourne supremacy casino <UNK> or mission impossible i'm not knocking these movies i just <UNK> they lack the <UNK> of this one and feel too <UNK> will ever achieve what is it it's the feeling that the film makers were <UNK> as they shot and edited not afraid to leave in some <UNK> so as to learn lessons for the next time for me this makes watching movies all the more fun and dangerous
<START> this is an amazing film to watch or show young people aside from a very brief nude scene it gives an interesting glimpse into colonial rule in africa that you'll rarely find in other films it does bear a superficial similarity to out of africa but without all the romantic fluff the white french people in <UNK> are fascinating because they don't even seem to regard the natives as people the whites are all the bosses and they expect black <UNK> without question however unlike real servants you only once hear any of the whites say <UNK> <UNK> and no other regard is given these people again and again it's like they are pets or slaves as the feelings of the people are never even considered br br the central <UNK> of this <UNK> is the relationship between the mother <UNK> and her servant <UNK> although at times they spend a lot of time together and it is only normal that they might begin to have sexual feelings towards each other the white woman never considers <UNK> or the existence of his feelings a good example of this <UNK> is when she has <UNK> <UNK> up her dress and it's obvious that he is very sexually frustrated by this apart from this relationship while almost all the whites are completely oblivious to the fact that the <UNK> are people a few go so far as to <UNK> abuse and treat them like garbage br br also interesting is the relationship between <UNK> and the little girl who is the one who is grown at the beginning and end of the film while they are very close at times he's more like a <UNK> or pet and the girl never plays with native children br br there is one bizarre white character who seems at times to regard the blacks better but unfortunately his character is very inconsistent and confusing one moment he's doing hard work along side the blacks or eating with them something the other whites would never have done and the next he's trying to beat up <UNK> i could only guess as to what motivated him perhaps he was just a jerk or was crazy or perhaps was a communist <UNK> trying to stir up the blacks against the whites who knows in fact other than a few good scenes this character seems pretty much wasted br br while i really enjoyed the insight this movie gave i wish it had instead been more than just a few snippets of this world through the perspective of a child during one small period of her life the context and what happened to rid the country of <UNK> is never addressed and the film left me wanting more the film appeared to begin in the early 1980s since she's wearing a <UNK> style <UNK> and when the film went back in time it seems that it was set about 1960 more or less but there was never any mention of the 1950s anti <UNK> violence or independence for the nation in the early 1960s i am guessing that some of this confusion might be that the makers of the film screwed up and should have made the beginning of the film earlier such as the 1970s and had the lady think back to her life there in the early 1950s before the country experienced political change br br apart from the missing context and a confusion over time periods using the prologue and <UNK> that showed her as an adult traveling the country was a good idea and i also appreciated the ending as it was a pleasant surprise when you find out more about the nice man who offers her a ride but overall it just feels like something is missing there just isn't any sort of resolution or message other than showing that <UNK> is <UNK> and cruel
<START> pretty incoherent movie about a man who <UNK> to and left a 1960s <UNK> hippie religious cult who fights them sixteen years later the man has a child with one of the other <UNK> who during a raid by the police is hidden away and taken by another man named <UNK> who lives in a small cabin by the river the cult kills some of its followers or some of the people in town it's hard to keep track of who characters are or what time period the scenes are supposed to be taking place the leader gets <UNK> sixteen years later i got that from the box i missed the amount of time in the movie nobody is made to look any older not <UNK> anyway br br one murder is done with a large <UNK> <UNK> saw others are done with knives or a <UNK> i never heard the title character's name mentioned in the movie but he's the one who overacts the most <UNK> and <UNK> br br the movie is <UNK> together pretty poorly with voice over helping not much to explain what is going on some of the sound effects were pretty bad a man is getting <UNK> and we hear the sound of a whip cracking a woman fires a gun and we don't hear it fire but hear a <UNK> instead it doesn't seem to have been done for comical effect
<START> a year after losing gorgeous jane parker maureen <UNK> to love rival tarzan hunter harry holt neil hamilton returns to the jungle to have another bash at winning the brunette <UNK> heart mixing business with pleasure he also plans to grab himself some <UNK> from the elephant graveyard that lies beyond the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ground br br accompanied by his slimy <UNK> pal martin <UNK> and a group of <UNK> <UNK> harry finally arrives at his destination having <UNK> avoided death at the hands of savage natives and rock <UNK> apes only to find that jane is still <UNK> with her <UNK> <UNK> and worse still that tarzan is <UNK> to let the hunters take any <UNK> from the graveyard br br nasty <UNK> decides to resolve matters by <UNK> and shooting the ape man and then telling jane and holt that tarzan was attacked and eaten by a crocodile of course tarzan isn't <UNK> wounded after being <UNK> back to health by <UNK> he <UNK> back into action just in time to rescue jane from a tribe of vicious lion eating <UNK> who have attacked <UNK> expedition br br tarzan and his mate the second movie to star <UNK> as the jungle man of few words is often <UNK> by fans as the best of the series although i slightly prefer the original i can definitely understand the film's popularity it's damn sexy and there are some great action sequences the <UNK> chemistry between <UNK> and <UNK> is fabulous and leads to some pretty steamy scenes and with both stars wearing <UNK> <UNK> outfits throughout there's eye candy <UNK> for viewers of both <UNK> to enjoy despite <UNK> much <UNK> underwater nude scene actually being performed by a body double the lovely <UNK> still shows plenty of skin even threatening to do a <UNK> <UNK> at one point as her <UNK> cloth <UNK> to one side br br the film's most exciting moments come in the form of a wonderful underwater fight between tarzan and a crocodile and the spectacular <UNK> where jane is attacked by lions and natives but is rescued by her beau his monkey pals and a load of elephants in full on lion <UNK> mode once again the violence is surprisingly nasty at times although as far as i am concerned there is nothing quite as shocking as the vicious <UNK> and their gorilla pit from the first film <UNK> also has his fair share of excitement <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and big cats riding on <UNK> back as he crosses a river and even <UNK> onto an <UNK> for a ride br br like it's predecessor tarzan and his mate does suffer slightly from some bad effects and unconvincing <UNK> back projection a few laughable monkey suits more indian elephants <UNK> as their african cousins and poorly disguised <UNK> <UNK> these shouldn't spoil your enjoyment of this very entertaining film if anything they make it even more fun br br 8 5 out of 10 rounded up to 9 for imdb
<START> would someone tell <UNK> to stick to what he is good at basketball this movie was not even entertaining on a stupid level in this movie <UNK> plays a genie who lives in a boom box is that not <UNK> a genie in a boom box instead of a <UNK> he is supposed to help a little boy played by the equally annoying <UNK> <UNK> this movie had the most flimsy storyline since water world the acting was awful and i think that anyone who likes this <UNK> would be afraid to admit it
<START> jack black can usually make me <UNK> simply by breathing but in this movie br br besides the direction writing lack of plot constant <UNK> aided and <UNK> by constant straight on camera shots and a <UNK> joke <UNK> average it was still an utter waste of time the idea sounds promising but what potential there was gets wasted with an utter lack of comedy and some of the worst direction i've seen this side of you tube br br i kept hearing that this film portrayed <UNK> very <UNK> while that's no doubt true i really don't think this movie is meant to be racist i think that's it's more a result of a creative team desperately trying to find something funny in this mess you can almost hear them crying out from behind the camera hey look it's an ugly mexican laugh people please for the love of all things <UNK> laugh br br but put the racism charges aside when you get down to it it's anyone who <UNK> down good money and time to watch this pile of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that should be offended imo
<START> tho 35 years old groove tube looks a lot like actual tv today <UNK> <UNK> networks nude sports a tv show about <UNK> drug dealers called the dealers ala <UNK> and even <UNK> <UNK> cheech chong up in smoke weird beer commercials <UNK> beer no less bizarre than bud <UNK> dirty minded kid's clown <UNK> shades of pee wee herman even chevy chase doing slapstick humor a violent <UNK> vocal duo a year before his 1975 debut on saturday night live and thanks to the infamous opening sequence that earned groove tube an initial x rating i still can't hear curtis <UNK> move on up without thinking of naked dancing <UNK> hippies for similar sketch style movies see <UNK> kentucky fried movie amazon women on the mood monty <UNK> beyond the <UNK> dynamite chicken and the <UNK> <UNK> everything you know is wrong
<START> how can a movie be both controversial and gentle this one does it with a near perfect structure no one wants their daughters to be <UNK> apparently most cultures don't want their daughters to be small <UNK> either here we see a bunch of superb actors we've never heard of before portray folks of different cultures living fairly <UNK> lives until their female children want to and have the potential to become professional soccer players the structure around the <UNK> of the two cultures is wonderful there is no <UNK> both cultures are seen as modern and valid and yes both are silly too one flaw the <UNK> wedding ceremony seemed to involve hundreds of relatives but not one child among them
<START> and how they bore you right out of your mind the <UNK> lake monster is one of the classic bad films from the 70's made with no actors of any note an embarrassing script <UNK> direction and a <UNK> desire to <UNK> horror with light comedy this movie introduces a <UNK> who finds drawings of an <UNK> dinosaur underneath <UNK> lake a meteor falls from the sky and an <UNK> dinosaur of the <UNK> variety begins to <UNK> and eat the inhabitants surrounding <UNK> lake the whole matter is taken care of by steve our local sheriff much of the film when not showing <UNK> of blood left behind from what we imagine must have been the beast <UNK> is spent following the bumbling <UNK> of two guys named arnie and mitch who run a boat rental place they try so bad to be funny that we get lines like looking at a business sign mitch saying to arnie you spelled bait wrong it's spelled b a t e the laughs were rather <UNK> here we then see them get drunk together and imagine a tree <UNK> to be the dinosaur laurel and hardy watch out the dinosaur looks fake but the movie is fun in a bad way and at the very least the lake is beautiful
<START> don't be fooled by the silly title folks this is one sweet ride a true <UNK> to <UNK> the iron man and <UNK> the killer this gem starts with a bang and lays the gore on thick until the credits roll it seems that aliens are taking over people's bodies and <UNK> them into war machines which are then used to fight each other in a twisted game for the amusement of their species the winner of the battle eats the loser alive that's mostly it for plot but who cares when the gore is this good i have no idea how many <UNK> of <UNK> were used but it's disgusting to behold there is interesting and effective use of stop motion when the <UNK> are in progress and loving care is <UNK> on all of the creature and make up effects the cgi is a bit limited but that actually doesn't detract from the overall quality one bit at least for me this was truly a fun and stomach turning film that deserves much praise and has truly earned its place in the stack of cult classics find it and watch you won't be disappointed
<START> i am not one of those people who just go online after i see a movie and decide to call it the worst movie ever made if you doubt me please look at my other reviews however for the first time ever i have seen a movie so horrible that i wanted to write about how bad it was before it was even over br br i love bad movies to me ed wood is a genius i thought bloody murder <UNK> <UNK> and most horrible horror movies were good however there is not a single good thing i can say about this film br br the plot is basically non existent if someone reading my review wastes their money to see it they can <UNK> for themselves what the plot might be but i advise you that a <UNK> would be worth more than watching this movie br br the special effects are bad br br the acting is bad br br the two leads are attractive but that's all there is br br i am not the type to spoil a movie for anyone but i invite anyone to email me at <UNK> <UNK> com to ask for my opinion on this movie before they waste a dime on it i will tell you anything br br i love bad movies and i love horror and i love new inventive movies i even love horror porn stuff like hostel which some reviewers claimed this was like but obviously they only thought so cause roger bart was in this and hostel 2 but this may be the number 1 most worthless and stupid and <UNK> movie ever made br br and before you disregard this review this is coming from someone who not only sat through the entire premiere of house of the dead but actually bought a copy of it
<START> listening to the director's commentary confirmed what i had suspected whilst watching the film this is a movie made by a guy who wants to play at making a movie the plot is the kind of thing that <UNK> teenagers <UNK> out when they're going through that i could write a book screenplay award winning sitcom phase there's a <UNK> of an interesting idea buried in there probably because its a sequel to some one else's movie but it is totally buried under an <UNK> badly executed and laughably un thought out script br br the lines are dire and the performances are un engaging though again i'm inclined to blame the director he does not appear to have <UNK> the actors at all about what is required rather <UNK> the script in their hands pointed the camera at them and told them to get on with it who knows with a little <UNK> these actors could have <UNK> themselves better say what you like about musicians in movies jon bon <UNK> was excellent in row your boat and more than acceptable in the leading man br br as it stands the cast have no chemistry whatsoever a beautiful opportunity to use the classic sex and <UNK> parallel is passed up when in order to <UNK> bon <UNK> character with vampire blood from his <UNK> co hunter he is given a <UNK> she should have bitten him mind you they should have looked vaguely interested in each other throughout the rest of the film too the only real moment of sexual tension between the two female leads is by the directors own <UNK> accidental he had originally intended to use this silent sequence as an excuse for more pointless plot exposition so i suppose the finished product could have <UNK> been worse but not a lot br br frankly as movies go this is badly plotted silly and forgettable even as trashy movies go it's not sexy enough or gory enough to be entertaining it could have been a fun and bloody little romp but the director has left with more of a comedy for all the wrong reasons
<START> once upon a time there was a science fiction author named h <UNK> <UNK> who wrote a classic book named little fuzzy which was about a man discovering a race of adorable little fuzzy <UNK> on another planet mr <UNK> died in 1964 but hollywood and many of today's authors starting <UNK> his grave before his <UNK> got cold this is the book where they got the idea for ewoks from br br <UNK> is such a blatant ripoff of little fuzzy i can wonder why i'm the only who's ever noticed br br but don't take my word for it here's a link to project <UNK> where you can <UNK> a copy of little fuzzy for free http www <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> thank you hollywood yet another movie classic utterly ruined by a cheap shallow effect heavy and redundant remake the original planet of the apes was an intelligent and thought provoking movie with a very clear message it was a movie that focused almost entirely on dialogue which sounds very dull but was in fact very interesting br br this movie on the other hand seems to have done away with pretty much all the dialogues instead of a great movie we get an incredibly stupid two hour chase movie dialogue has been reduced to a mere minimum character interaction and development are non existent and most of the time it's extremely hard to figure out what's going on instead we get a bunch of pointless action scenes some <UNK> funny one liners and some very hollow quasi intelligent conversations br br the only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic the make up of the apes is magnificent and the sets and backgrounds are beautiful too however this does not distract from the fact that planet of the apes 2001 is a very shallow and simplistic movie filled with paper thin characters stupid dialogue and a nearly non existent plot please hollywood stop ruining great movies by turning them into senseless blockbusters br br oh yeah the ending did not make any sense whatsoever br br out of stars mainly for the visuals br br
<START> i was interested to see the move thinking that it might be a diamond in the rough but the only thing i found was bad writing horrible directing the shot sequences do not flow even though the director might say that that is what he is going for it looks very uninspired and immature the editing could have been done by anyone with 2 <UNK> and the stock was low budget video i would say that it wasn't even something as simple as mini digital video br br there are some simple ways to fix a film with what the director has like through editing etc but it is obvious that he just doesn't care there is as much effort put in to this movie as a ham <UNK> it could be made better but that would mean extra work
<START> after having seen and loved <UNK> yes i actually loved <UNK> i decided to try another uwe boll film and i picked out seed because i happened to stumble on it in a local dvd store and it's supposed to be one of his better films br br while the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film were very promising and seemed like the beginning of a not too mainstream psychological thriller it soon went downhill from there and eventually <UNK> into one of the most generic slasher films i've seen so far including a massive amount of plot holes unrealistic emotional <UNK> and sub par acting it seems like boll tried his best to come up with a decent plot but after a while just gave up on it maybe he should stick to comedy the few good things about this film is that he does manage to create an overall creepy atmosphere that the special effects are better than i expected and the soundtrack does go well with the overall atmosphere but the <UNK> pacing of this film combined with the utter generic nature thereof makes he last half hour quite tedious to watch which ruined my experience altogether there are a very fairly well done shocking scenes but they seem to be there for the shock value alone and let's not forget the camera work that was pretty nauseating at times br br i hope uwe boll will one day learn what makes a good film because between a lot of horrible films he does seem to make a decent film every now and then seed just isn't one of those
<START> someone release this movie on dvd so it can take its <UNK> place as on of the greatest films of all time in ten to twenty years when critics and film historians look back on the so called films of the 1990's and see how vapid they were for the most part and how lars von trier tried to <UNK> and <UNK> the international film world with this masterpiece as it stands <UNK> or europa as it is referred to outside the us is one of the most fascinating and artistic views of the <UNK> and almost psychotic <UNK> that <UNK> out of post wwii europe namely the <UNK> german landscape whose physical horrors were matched only by the damage to the psyche of its people von trier brilliantly paints his vision on screen you will feel like you are watching some lost espionage noir classic from the late 1940's with the perfectly <UNK> black and white scenes while at the same time feel you are on the brink of something beyond the cutting edge especially in scenes like the assassination aboard the train literally when you see this movie you are witnessing the evolution of an art form br br for some reason von trier got caught up in his own dogma movement shortly after this and while his breaking the waves and dancer in the dark are classics in their own right it is with <UNK> that he truly lifted the art of film making to new and exciting heights 10 10 ages like a fine wine and begs for a dvd release
<START> it's made in 2007 and the cg is bad for a movie made in 1998 at one part in the movie there is a stop motion shot of a dinosaur that actually looks good but this just makes the extremely amateur work on the cg stuff look even worse br br the writing acting directing and everything else in this movie is just terrible this is as bad as if not worse than <UNK> island and 100 million <UNK> pure crap again as with the other movies the only scary part about this movie is that it actually got made and is now being aired on the sci fi channel br br i still can't understand how they somehow get people who do have some acting skills to act in these movies and then somehow get them to act as terrible as everyone else in the movie br br for those of you who are unsure the other poster is obviously being sarcastic in his review or he is one of the people who worked on this movie
<START> this is one of those films that explore the culture clash of eastern born people in <UNK> cultures br br loving on tokyo time is a sad film about the inability of <UNK> to attract due to major cultural differences ken rock <UNK> fanatic marries <UNK> a japanese girl so that she can stay in the united states when her <UNK> <UNK> the marriage is only expected to be temporary that is until <UNK> <UNK> legal status again but ken who seems to be lost in every relationship takes a liking to <UNK> and tries very hard to make things work out this despite his friend's <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> and getting rid of all <UNK> to girls is bad for rock <UNK> roll except to inspire some song writing about broken hearts and all of that br br but <UNK> comes from a strict traditional japanese upbringing and doesn't expect to be married to ken all that long not only that she is <UNK> and wants to return to japan it's sad in that this is finally someone ken thinks he can love and be with and all that except the one time he thinks he's found someone to feel that way about the girl isn't expecting to stay that long it's not that she doesn't like ken it's just that she's used to a whole <UNK> way of life she says i can't tell him the way i feel in english and ken can't tell me the way he feels in japanese it's a rather sad love story with a killer 80s <UNK> <UNK> soundtrack br br i picked up loving on tokyo time because it reminded me of one of my favorite 80s films tokyo pop and for those of you who enjoyed loving on tokyo time check out tokyo pop a new york singer goes to japan and joins a japanese american cover band except it's a movie with a happy ending br br
<START> it's amazing to see how <UNK> <UNK> manages to attract people to the theater till the very day of the release i mean look at the cast here the promotion is superb good enough songs and the trailers are fine this makes it a house full on the first day but it's only when people go and see the film they realize that there is no way their money is <UNK> house full the first day the movie is out the next week br br this film inspired by <UNK> <UNK> is what they say didn't manage to handle the whole cast well they tried to put in big stars but ended up by not even managing to bring out even an average performance by any one the stories are hollow and cheesy so the audience can't connect with any single one of them it's a big disappointment to all those who like big stars or for that matter <UNK> <UNK> after his big success of <UNK> ho <UNK> <UNK>
<START> a wonderful film by powell and <UNK> whose work i now want to explore more the film is about what we perceive as real and what is real and how the two can be so difficult to <UNK> from one another beautifully shot and acted although david niven doesn't seem to be 27 years old as his character claims to be fun to see a very young richard attenborough this film made me think while i was watching it and afterwards
<START> also known as the big <UNK> war the great yokai war is miike's attempt at a family film and damn fine job he does as well the problem is that i can't imagine many parents wanting to subject their children to this movie the best kids movies are the ones that are scary or have mildly disturbing imagery <UNK> story and return to oz spring to mind but in the case of the great yokai war miike probably takes things a little too far in fact at the screening i was at the person introducing the movie <UNK> to the two families there that it was probably not very suitable br br the film kicks off with the young hero of the piece introducing himself and explaining about his current family problems this brief moment of <UNK> is <UNK> broken as a cow gives birth to a <UNK> with the face of a human whom screams that something horrendous is coming before falling dead like the abomination it is it is quite possible that the sheer <UNK> of the creature is some bizarre <UNK> homage br br following an incredible introduction for main baddie <UNK> and his <UNK> <UNK> a surprisingly attractive <UNK> <UNK> by way of an apocalyptic army raising the story <UNK> to normal for a while but it doesn't take long before any and all logic goes down the drain and the young boy teams up with a group of miyazaki rejects to take out the evil <UNK> br br the plot of the movie is fairly basic and surprisingly hackneyed at times the entire chosen one just seems completely out of place in a movie which so regularly breaks clichés but is aided by a simple awe inspiring vision of a magical world this really is a miyazaki movie made into a live action movie albeit a much <UNK> and more vicious than usual miyazaki movie br br the film is simply a joy to look at the designs of the yokai is colourful and largely practical while the evil robotic <UNK> while not displaying the best cgi in the world have a <UNK> and menace to them which gives them far more of a <UNK> threat than you would imagine br br the cast is uniformly excellent they just make their characters seem perfectly natural which is commendable when you consider that most of them are in full body makeup or <UNK> suits even <UNK> <UNK> with a ridiculous <UNK> comes across as <UNK> and deadly thanks to surprisingly excellent acting from <UNK> br br while the film does have many elements which put it firmly into family movie territory cute creatures junior heroes a thoroughly evil villain a sense of <UNK> and adventure and a telling lack of violence there are elements which make you question whether miike should have directed such a movie br br the robot army is a genuinely terrifying menace everyday items <UNK> into monstrous <UNK> that look like t 101 sans skin and with added <UNK> these <UNK> rip characters to pieces suck creatures into their blood <UNK> mouths and <UNK> children from their homes by <UNK> them right from under their <UNK> nose before <UNK> in a little <UNK> br br the creation of the creature is equally <UNK> for young minds the yokai essentially the heroes are feed into a giant <UNK> full of a <UNK> form of hate which <UNK> the <UNK> flesh and forces their angry souls to possess <UNK> of metal if kids thought <UNK> <UNK> was bad wait <UNK> they see a man sized <UNK> burning to death in a <UNK> of <UNK> hatred for a minute before being turned into an abomination of a motorcycle there is also <UNK> <UNK> in one case a severed hand <UNK> in front of the camera dripping with blood a fair amount of sexual energy <UNK> wears one dress designed specifically for fan service and seems to only have sleeping with <UNK> as motivation while the princess of the rivers wears next to nothing and gets her <UNK> <UNK> by the young hero in several scenes and general humour which will go right over the heads of those that this <UNK> wonder was seemingly designed for br br spoilers an example of this being that the yokai only become interested in the final battle when they think it is a big party the subsequent battle more of a festival than anything complete with beer crowd surfing and <UNK> also a scene where <UNK> beats the <UNK> out of a cute <UNK> creature seems designed to appeal to the masses jaded by pokemon <UNK> br br end spoilers at the end of the day the great yokai war is easily on of miike's stronger recent films while it lacks some of the perverse charm of say <UNK> or <UNK> it is just continually pushing the audience down a road of general insanity in fact this is easily miike's most deranged movie in that he <UNK> the sheer magic of the subject so <UNK> br br well worth a watch just for the occasional flash of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> what's in a name if the name is jerry bruckheimer expect it to be filled with action br br in producer <UNK> latest film gone in 60 seconds its all about the <UNK> with character <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> and cars <UNK> with names like diane sue and the <UNK> <UNK> it's only the non stop action that keeps you from wanting to just play the name game br br not a deep script by any means but it is a great vehicle for action as nicolas cage as <UNK> raines along with angelina jolie and robert duvall comes out of car <UNK> retirement to save his brother's life by stealing a list of 50 exotic cars in one night a remake of the 1974 cult hit this film may not be destined for the same cult status but it is entertaining br br surprisingly it's the action that keeps you watching not the acting although loaded with stars none of them have standout performances including a very weak performance by one of my favorite up and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> even jolie coming off her recent oscar win is just a token love interest with hardly any screen time br br can a series of beautiful cars and the car chases they become involved in make a great film i think so the film is a pleasure to look at and although one particular scene takes you into the realm of <UNK> the action is non stop and the suspense is compelling just be <UNK> of other drivers fighting for a pole position as you leave the theatre br br 3 1 2 out of 5
<START> one <UNK> for the greatness of a movie is <UNK> it came on t v right now would you want to sit there and watch it again ' my answer for the grand canyon is as powerful a yes as it would be for nearly any movie i have ever seen there are just so many powerful moments such an intelligent and moving story such incredible performances br br it perfectly captures the confusion and violence that were so rampant in the early nineties but it also dramatically <UNK> the capacity of individuals to love think and care in a slight way the movie was of its time it partly portrays society as a balloon about to burst because the country was in a <UNK> and so void of <UNK> this was true of that time but the movie is also timeless i think it could honestly stand up against any movie that has ever been made and it is the most overlooked film of all time
<START> <UNK> hold a tiny bit of cult value simply because it was written and directed by george <UNK> this italian bloke is more or less the <UNK> of male sleaze and starred in pretty much every <UNK> joe <UNK> production during the late 70's early 80's wouldn't it be interesting for avid euro cult <UNK> to own the only movie directed by the guy who walked around bare <UNK> in erotic nights of the living dead all the time i thought so now unlike the movies he starred in <UNK> own <UNK> is kind of disappointing in the gore sleaze <UNK> there are a handful of nasty murders cheesy monster effects and naked female bodies a guest appearance by sleaze queen laura <UNK> on display but it's mainly a <UNK> movie the handsome <UNK> dr <UNK> is on the verge of a scientific breakthrough with his research on human <UNK> <UNK> when suddenly the university he works for threatens to <UNK> his <UNK> he developed a theory to <UNK> <UNK> and block the human <UNK> process but if he doesn't come up with detailed reports any time soon his research will be stopped so dr <UNK> does what any intelligent scientist would do and <UNK> the <UNK> serum into his own <UNK> needless to say and like the title implies he slowly turns into murderous monster that actually ages much <UNK> in other words his research sucked like the other reviewers already mentioned this movie borrows a lot of ideas from david <UNK> the fly  the dramatic romance sub plot included but doesn't add any originality from its own the big difference is that you constantly feel connected with jeff <UNK> character in the fly whereas dr <UNK> becomes just another monster that needs to be destroyed as fast as possible the rapid <UNK> syndrome aspect also reminded me of <UNK> <UNK> sadly underrated giallo phantom of death only the protagonist in that film inherited the disease and didn't <UNK> it on himself the physical <UNK> of the <UNK> is very similar in both films though few scares or excitement to discover here instead the movie features loads of bad acting poor lighting lousy editing and a completely retarded climax to boot feel free to skip this one
<START> it was considered to be the swiss answer to the lord of the rings but it is much more than that it isn't an answer to anything it's in itself something new something funny and sometimes it's downright stupid and silly but was monty python any different than silly br br the beginning immediately makes the statement that this film is low budget and not meant to be taken entirely seriously cardboard clouds on strings knock into the airplane in which the main character is <UNK> but to compensate the missing special effects the landscape does the trick it is absolutely beautiful and stunning who needs new zealand switzerland has it all br br what i liked about the film was the simple approach and the obvious passion and energy that went into it it isn't brilliant yet it's got some good humorous parts edward <UNK> as <UNK> is absolutely convincing it would be enough to go and see the film because of him there are some good jokes some of them are very lame some of them won't be understood by people outside of switzerland i liked the idea of having <UNK> instead of <UNK> <UNK> i loved the scene where <UNK> decides to take <UNK> a <UNK> with him on the journey also very funny is the scene when <UNK> the sword fighting knight decides to show off with his sword and subsequently <UNK> it into a wall breaking it and there is this one scene where the <UNK> ish characters do a wonderfully comic scene that includes a toilet brush i didn't <UNK> of the idea of the ring being used by <UNK> the <UNK> character in order to seduce the ladies that was a bit far fetched the idea of lord <UNK> wanting to cover the lands with <UNK> wasn't that brilliant either original certainly but not brilliant but most of all did i dislike the idea of a gay dragon that really wasn't necessary all in all i recommend to see the film simply because it is so crazy and totally trashy don't expect a lotr parody like <UNK> was for star wars but if you go to the flicks thinking that this is going to be an amusing evening out with absolutely no ambitions then you'll enjoy i am not sure if it works in other languages because it does live from the swiss <UNK> as well as from the jokes and actors br br all in all hat off to the courage of the swiss crew who did that
<START> the film my name is modesty is based around an episode that takes up about one page in the <UNK> modesty blaise novel called night of the <UNK> it describes an incident in which the young modesty 17 in the book mid <UNK> in the film <UNK> her <UNK> in a war over a casino as this is set before the actual blaise adventures her trusted sidekick <UNK> <UNK> is not in the film that is one of the main problems as the relationship between blaise and <UNK> was certainly always one of the fascinating aspects of the novels and the long running comic strip the other problem is that the film is quite simply incredibly boring because it really is just one small episode blown up into a screenplay the casting is okay but alexandra <UNK> is not really convincing as the heroine and actually too old for the role to play the young modesty i get the impression that this film was a quick and dirty solution as not to lose the rights to the blaise franchise
<START> being born in the 1960's i grew up watching the tv movies of the week in the early 70's and loved the creepy movies that were <UNK> shown including <UNK> farm bad ronald <UNK> school for girls kolchak the night stalker etc but this one is just plain dumb this is obviously the writer's trying to capitalize on the horrific <UNK> murders from a few years earlier the movie stars dennis weaver of <UNK> and duel fame as a father who takes his family camping on a beach the family encounters some hippies who for some reason decide to <UNK> the family the reason for this is never explained and <UNK> <UNK> stance is hard to swallow for god's sake call the police beat the hell of them or something just don't sit there and <UNK> about it the acting is pretty lame the story unbelievable etc susan <UNK> looks cute in a bikini but that's about it ignore this if it ever <UNK> on tv
<START> good for an <UNK> entertainment but the plot was unconvincing <UNK> affair with the first lady was unreal and <UNK> the president was a cardboard cut out and who were the real villains anyway nothing was developed or explained <UNK> i still don't know why they wanted to kill the president or how the mole got involved the villains were <UNK> and undeveloped so you never felt involved in their plot michael douglas and <UNK> sutherland did their best to <UNK> some reality into the story the chase and confrontation were good but kim basinger and eva longoria were both unbelievable in their roles basinger totally lacked character and no way could longoria have been a secret service agent this could have been a very good film but somehow it missed the way with too many unanswered questions disappointing on the whole despite some very good scenes and did they use the <UNK> <UNK> set for the white house scenes i kept expecting <UNK> or charlie to appear
<START> what a powerful start to a film when julia roberts character is <UNK> in the face by her abusive and <UNK> husband played by patrick <UNK> and i felt ready to experience a powerful film on the same level as farrah <UNK> the burning bed well as the summary says i was <UNK> lead this film was nothing like the burning bed which had power and farrah played the part of a woman you truly felt for and felt her pain and her need to survive sleeping with the enemy <UNK> off after the first act into cheap thrills with roberts <UNK> her death to escape her husband and goes to live in <UNK> her husband at first believes she is dead but starts to grow suspicious that she may still be alive and sets off after her the rest of the movie is basically a cat and mouse game with julia getting a house in this small town in <UNK> and changing her identity there is no mention of course how she got the money for this but at this point in the film i did not care all that much she meets a guy mr nice <UNK> and falls for him and her husband does finally catch up to her but not before he re <UNK> her soup <UNK> and <UNK> up the kitchen this was i assume to provide a cheap thrill to the audience but i did not care much if she was an abused wife because the film as i have said cheated the audience if it had stayed the course i might have felt for her and her situation of course the husband is killed and all is well for little <UNK> ms roberts if only the real world was anything close to this see the burning bed and you understand what a film is suppose to be like on the subject of domestic abuse
<START> the fact that the movie is predictable is not a problem this movie is like a beautiful painting to be enjoyed the museum scene is like a nice music video the <UNK> sex scene is an all too familiar scene in all of our adult lives but the movie would not hold any interest for me without keith gordon keith gordon is maybe one of the most underrated actors of our time almost everything i know about acting came from studying mostly his eyes he had the most compelling face his character possesses the qualities i look in a guy sensitivity and dedication keith gordon is gorgeous btw i kinda wish he'd <UNK> his beard now as his lips <UNK> and <UNK> apple were his <UNK> set next to his eyes
<START> the five or so really good westerns that mann made are <UNK> as an ensemble in hollywood even john ford never made that many with so much quality the curious thing about them all is how uneven they are ford's my darling <UNK> is worth about two and a half of any of them or at least two br br the real hero of them besides mann and stewart is chase chase being responsible for the brilliant red river chase wrote far country bend of the river and probably some others but none of them are as finished as my darling <UNK> but then very few films western or otherwise are br br each of the five films of mann have huge gaps or is it six lets see bend far man of the west <UNK> winchester 73 and yep six naked <UNK> each have magnificent scene after magnificent scene with fairly glaring <UNK> yet so does red river which is still the single greatest western ever made so perfection isn't everything br br but the far country has huge huge holes it's <UNK> and really comes alive only when stewart and <UNK> entire are <UNK> <UNK> the rest is pretty pedestrian with the usual exception of <UNK> camera <UNK> camera is a one man course in cinematography it is about as good an eye as anybody who ever got behind a strip of moving film it is almost never in the wrong place never br br the far country has one amazing moment and as usual it comes from stewart nobody in the history of cinema ever received physical punishment with the authority of that man he is absolutely amazing look at him in bend far winchester and man from <UNK> in bend has been beaten up and is hanging by a thread so <UNK> and with such <UNK> hatred he looks like somebody <UNK> from <UNK> in far he is shot off a raft with such violence it looks so convincing that you <UNK> and of course when he is dragged through the fire in man well you find yourself looking for the burn marks what an actor not to mention the moment in winchester when he is beaten up early in the hotel room also as well as anybody ever did it br br but that was <UNK> territory look at gary cooper fighting with jack lord in man of the west as painful as any fight scene ever recorded cooper while not being quite as convincing as stewart nevertheless is somehow his equal in looking exhausted at the end of the fight in short nobody but nobody but nobody ever showed the human being in <UNK> as well as mann br br what a great great director br br see every western he ever made they are his real <UNK> even if all are <UNK> but so what when he gets roaring with his great scenes they are as good as anybody including ford and his six westerns as an ensemble are the best ever done by anyone period br br thanks anthony
<START> oh dear oh dear i started watching this not knowing what to expect i couldn't believe what i was seeing there were times when i thought it was a comedy i loved how the <UNK> plan to capture the terrorist leader is to air drop in one man who is <UNK> and expect him to capture him and escape with a rocket pack if only it were really that easy i've finally found a movie worse than plan 9 from outer space
<START> perhaps the worst thing about carlos <UNK> comedy is that every joke needs to be followed with an insult at the people in the crowd that aren't laughing if there's anybody who's insecure it's a comedian who won't shut up about his audience br br then again perhaps the worst thing about carlos <UNK> comedy is that he doesn't get off his free speech high horse if you want to be funny just make a joke don't explain all the reasons why you're saving the american way with your failed attempts at <UNK> laughter br br hmm actually the worst thing about carlos <UNK> comedy is that it <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> for legitimate humor avoid this like the plague
<START> this is a bad movie not one of the funny bad ones either this is a lousy bad one it was actually painful to watch the direction was awful with lots of jumping around and the green and yellow <UNK> used throughout the movie makes the characters look <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was not convincing as a tough chick at all and i cannot believe lucy liu and mickey rourke signed on for this criminal waste of celluloid the script was terrible and the acting was like <UNK> across a <UNK> if you haven't seen it don't you are not missing anything and will only waste two hours of your life watching this drivel i have seen bad movies before and even enjoyed them due to their faults this one is just a waste of time
<START> definitely one of funny man eddie murphy's lesser films is this nonsense about a kidnapped mystical child three hundred year old dragons and a chosen one br br murphy is the chosen one in question and as the opening song suggests he is the best man in the world a <UNK> of lost and missing children he is approached by a mysterious <UNK> woman charlotte lewis who tells him he is the chosen one and that it is his destiny to find and rescue the golden child for if the child were to die compassion would die with him as he is the <UNK> of compassion br br if all this <UNK> <UNK> rubbish hasn't ruined it for you now it surely will once the movie begins suffice to say the plot is <UNK> and destroys the whole film meant to be another vehicle for murphy's <UNK> brand of humour the comedy isn't so great mind you the movie fails on many levels even charles dance as the evil <UNK> <UNK> can't do much for proceedings very silly and disappointing br br sunday december 12 1993 t v
<START> i remember this movie in particular when i was a teenager my best friend was telling me all about this movie and how it freaked her out as a kid of course being the blood <UNK> gal that i am i had to go out and find this movie now i don't know how to put this without <UNK> credibility so i'm just going to say it i actually had fun watching this movie i know that it's stupid not the best story and beyond bloody and gruesome but that's what i was looking for and the dentist delivers in the scares blood sex and crazy <UNK> sometimes i just need a fun movie like this to just let loose and get <UNK> out by br br dr alan feinstone is obsessed with order and <UNK> on the day of his wedding <UNK> he spies his wife brooke having sex with their filthy pool man matt at his dental practice <UNK> first patient of the day is young <UNK> <UNK> there for his very first dental <UNK> feinstone begins to clean <UNK> teeth everything goes smoothly at first until he <UNK> that <UNK> teeth are brown and rotten his dental pick slips stabbing <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> mother picks up her crying bleeding child and leaves <UNK> feinstone sees his second patient beauty queen april reign alone with april feinstone <UNK> her with <UNK> <UNK> so that he can fill a <UNK> in one of her <UNK> as she <UNK> off into <UNK> feinstone <UNK> that she has transformed into his wife he begins kissing and <UNK> her on the dental chair then begins to choke her april starts to <UNK> and half wakes up from the gas feinstone <UNK> out of his <UNK> and quickly re buttons <UNK> <UNK> feinstone decides to end the day early and sends his staff and patients home later that night brooke meets feinstone at his practice he reveals his new italian opera themed patient room he encourages brooke to try out the <UNK> dental chair when she does feinstone <UNK> her to the chair and <UNK> her with <UNK> <UNK> with operatic music <UNK> in the background he begins to pull out <UNK> teeth feinstone has gone off the deep end and is definitely not going to let anybody stand in his way of <UNK> br br honestly as silly as this movie sounds i did have a lot of fun watching the dentist the best scene without a doubt is when he teaches that nasty irs agent a lesson in <UNK> that i'm sure he'll never forget man i don't think i've <UNK> my teeth so much after i watched the dentist yeah i am going to warn you this movie is in no way for the faint of heart it's very bloody there's stabbing gun shots and just these brutal dental torture scenes that will make your stomach turn yet somehow i just enjoyed this movie if i ever want just a good gore movie that was made for true horror fans i slip it in my dvd player and that's the tooth lol i am so funny um yeah i try give me a little credit br br 7 10
<START> i <UNK> with everyone above who said anything that will convince you to not waste even a <UNK> of moments watching this amazingly amateurish movie very poor acting <UNK> production values utterly pedestrian direction and a script so inept and inane it should never have been written let alone produced even hollywood professionals apparently go to work just for a paycheck although no one should have been paid for this bad work careers should instead have ended over this <UNK> drivel br br <UNK> there is something fascinating about watching something so jaw <UNK> bad and <UNK> lowe is <UNK> and consistently bad
<START> i wasn't expecting this to be a great movie but neither was i expecting it to be so awful i hated the mother character so much i had to turn the channel i turned it back hoping it was just one part of the movie but no and for the daughter to sit there take being embarrassed or almost done out of a job or driven to madness inside her own home are you kidding me i was raised to respect and even fear my mother but i'd put her up fast in the nearest hotel if she proved that annoying in my house i was expected to follow a set of rules in my mother's house after all br br i didn't buy any of it i tried giving it several chances i really did sorry
<START> i just saw this film at the 2001 toronto international film festival the working title there was <UNK> <UNK> the audience reaction was mixed some people found the graphic sex and realistic violence to be too much for them others seemed to genuinely appreciate how good this film was br br this film isn't for the faint of heart it's like <UNK> with explicit sex and a less optimistic view of humanity there's animal <UNK> a strip <UNK> from a senior citizen an <UNK> <UNK> in a shopping centre <UNK> candle <UNK> and the <UNK> of the mentally incompetent br br if any of this sounds like too much to handle then this film isn't for you this film shows humanity at its most desperate and pathetic the <UNK> of our existence is shoved in our face with <UNK> glee br br <UNK> has no interest in redeeming humanity here and why should he this film features excellent performances from all involved is always interesting and is probably the most intelligent social statement to be made on film in awhile
<START> after watching this thing then reading the summary on the back of the dvd then thinking back to actual movie i became a bit <UNK> i thought maybe i fell asleep and <UNK> i was a down syndrome baby <UNK> through a never ending forest where people drive 11 miles an hour and stop for no purpose other then occasional tasteless <UNK> where zombies come out of nowhere and vampires who seduce pure hearted citizens on their way to save the world neither zombie nor vampire notably encounter each other the only fighting i remember was getting that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> off <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> fat all of them maybe that was because we were watching it widescreen stretched and were too lazy to change it to its native resolution but that actually made it more entertaining in conclusion my <UNK> thought <UNK> had more continuity plot character development <UNK> subject matter and acting then the entirety of this film it made <UNK> look like citizen f ing kane
<START> the movie was a suspenseful and somewhat dark look at the severe results of a genuinely human mistake connery and fishburne work very well together in this thriller about murder and redemption keep your boots on for the strange <UNK> at the end of the movie you'd never expect it
<START> i am watching the series back to back as fast as possible i am attempting to watch all things star trek this is month 3 and i am now on season 3 of <UNK> and i have already gone thru <UNK> in its entirety star trek is the greatest television phenomenon ever achieved br br shades of grey is the first <UNK> episode in the <UNK> series having just watched the shows these clips were fresh in my mind but i noticed how a couple of them were re shot because the film looked better season 1 always seemed real dark and ugly to me and the actors looked silly like they didn't fit in their own <UNK> br br the show is essentially just made of up a greatest hits of the <UNK> and saddest moments in <UNK> life on the enterprise up until this point the data and <UNK> scene in the <UNK> deck is a classic moment of new friendship my other favorite is when the 2nd officer on the <UNK> ship challenges <UNK> authority as first officer and <UNK> beat the living crap out of that <UNK> then the <UNK> kicks his a but good this entire episode is a heck of a reminder that a lot of crazy great things have happened already in a mere 2 seasons with 5 more to go and a handful of movies at this point in the series they are really starting to develop the emotions that tie <UNK> to deanna <UNK> as <UNK> up until this point they have mentioned the fact but they have yet to exploit it let the record show that the st <UNK> memory <UNK> claims that <UNK> means first and <UNK> that she has had intimate relations with <UNK> and also remains deeply close on an emotional one this episode further proves there will be a tense romantic interest in each other for a long time to come br br here is the article http memory <UNK> <UNK> en <UNK> <UNK> by this point in the series production value is up to speed and star trek <UNK> is <UNK> into the sci fi <UNK> it was destined to become watching this again as an adult i see now what great actors the star trek universe provides they really need to make a new st show set after all the current shows a <UNK> movie would have been nice too
<START> the <UNK> for tree of <UNK> try to pass it off as a sort of allegory for a fairy tale with actual meaning then immediately start raving about the animation i should have known what that meant br br the main character <UNK> is a good example of the whole movie's problem one minute <UNK> is a humble hero in search of himself the next a violent psycho with an <UNK> <UNK> on a girl he once took care of br br like all of the characters in the movie <UNK> is poorly defined you do not bond with the characters at all although <UNK> has acquired a couple of fan girls it seems that the writer was more interested in <UNK> all the drama and complexity he could into this movie than actually exploring his characters' motivations and personalities br br new useless story lines were being introduced in the last fifteen minutes of the movie the writer seriously needed to <UNK> his story perhaps he was trying to be epic but it was simply too much information for a two hour movie however i can't help but wonder if a plot with so many <UNK> and characters would have been better suited for a tv series or graphic novel br br in the last five minutes of the movie i simply could not endure the sheer lack of quality any longer and began laughing at how contrived the characters the relationships and the whole plot was i touched my companion and he started cracking up too as did a young man <UNK> behind us we tried so hard to control ourselves but we simply could not take the terrible quality of this movie br br on the bright side the animation is incredible and viewers will find themselves <UNK> the lush backgrounds and charming character designs the animation almost <UNK> you when you don't care about the characters it tells you how to feel
<START> i just came back from el <UNK> playing here in <UNK> <UNK> and i have to say i was very disappointed the film is very slow moving don't get me wrong i enjoy slow moving films slow to the point of driving you crazy all you hear is <UNK> chavez breathing heavily throughout the whole film this is a poorly made film but more importantly it is a film without a <UNK> of inspiration i felt nothing for the story or its characters br br el <UNK> was made only for the sake of making a film making it <UNK> i would advise you to pass on this one if you want to see good <UNK> films look for films by <UNK>
<START> this film has a powerful philosophical ending but that ending has meaning only if you watch the movie from the beginning br br youth alienation in the late 1960's from the viewpoint of a young man and a young woman is the obvious theme of zabriskie point neither mark <UNK> nor daria <UNK> had much acting experience a fact that actually enhances the film's message having <UNK> actors conveys a sense of realism as both players seem emotionally detached from the turmoil around them br br this is not a script driven film except for the first ten minutes it is mostly visual with stunning cinematography the beautiful <UNK> images seem other <UNK> and perfectly in sync with the emotional <UNK> of mark and daria br br i would have replaced the <UNK> weak pink <UNK> music with the more <UNK> music of the doors many scenes cry out for riders on the storm br br even so i like this film it's different it's unique it is artistic and imaginative and the desert <UNK> are beautiful br br as the years go by zabriskie point seems more and more attractive it conveys the mood of the late 1960's in america it is amazingly artistic in a <UNK> sort of way and the film's last eight minutes are <UNK> mesmerizing
<START> movie didn't have much plot and was uninteresting basically you spend a lot of time watching people paint also it's very difficult to hear or understand the dialogue partially because of the accents but also because words are <UNK>
<START> was this the greatest movie that i have ever seen no was it the worst no br br as a mother of four kids it is nice to watch something that was light and amusing it was great but it was cute br br i think that it definitely had some room to improve but it tried br br i am not sure if this movie deserves the extreme level of abuse from the other reviewer they obviously do not care for eva longoria i think that she was better in this than in the sentinel i think that movies are a matter of opinion the actors play a huge role in whether it is a hit or a flop br br maybe the cast did not work out maybe there were too many things going on br br i just wanted to speak up for an average movie not a terrible one it could just be a chick flick kind of like the movie the split up or french kiss my husband still talks about those
<START> valentine is now one of my favorite slasher films the death scenes are elaborate and the most of the acting is good <UNK> <UNK> did great as the female lead much better than jennifer love <UNK> in the i know films david <UNK> whom is the main reason i saw this movie had a pretty small role but he played it well the exception to the list of good actors is denise richards she was horrible in this the only scene i was glad to see her in was spoiler her death scene all in all it's a good movie to watch you should definitely watch this before you watch scream or i know again
<START> after seeing you've got mail and feeling disappointed i decided to see the original movie which inspired this one the shop around the corner i was amazed at this movie it's a true gem and from this moment one of my favorite movies of all times the acting is so perfect the story is so beautiful that if you haven't seen it i wish to urge you to see it today i'm not against re makes and sometimes i like the new version more than the original one but this time have to admit that you've got mail is a poor adaption of this classic don't miss it go to your video store and rent the shop around the corner today
<START> i have no idea what the other reviewer is talking about this was a wonderful movie and created a sense of the era that feels like time travel the characters are truly young mary is a strong match for byron claire is juvenile and a tad annoying <UNK> is a convincing beaten down <UNK> all are beautiful curious and <UNK> not the frightening <UNK> they are in gothic br br gothic works as an independent piece of shock film and i loved it for different reasons but this works like a <UNK> and <UNK> film and was from my <UNK> the best capture of what the summer must have felt like romantic yes but completely <UNK> my interest in the lives of shelley and byron every time i think about the film one of my all time favorites
<START> i watched dvd 1 only the program proper may have 10 minutes of good information otherwise it's <UNK> <UNK> of religious people it's as if director brian <UNK> only recently discovered both <UNK> and sarcasm and feels with these tools he can easily <UNK> his opposition br br also <UNK> wanders <UNK> into his own personal issues and they take over the movie it never gets back on topic br br religious people are prone to <UNK> <UNK> when their <UNK> to religion are obviously <UNK> in abusive <UNK> arguments from such <UNK> people seem irrational and therefore unconvincing br br anti religious people will want more data we don't need to be told that religious people are nutty any more than american jews need to be told how annoying christmas music gets by mid december br br in the best scene the <UNK> of <UNK> childhood christian school rather <UNK> confronts the director on his motivations that seems like the most honest part of the movie and it was too short br br if <UNK> were a bit more self aware he might have a good story in him about his own past current relationship to christianity and the abusive <UNK> that <UNK> him in his youth br br and perhaps he could lend his christ never walked the earth material to a more serious <UNK> i'm not studying the <UNK> of <UNK> paul to find out how air tight this all is but a quick <UNK> of <UNK> suggests most of these arguments are <UNK> br br the bonus interviews are pretty good tho they don't <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> much sam harris is a good <UNK> for the anti religious <UNK> and he doesn't go light on those other non christian <UNK> harris also has some good and easily <UNK> interviews on <UNK> com amazon com and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> <UNK> the whore <UNK> is another example of what happens when you get a bunch of <UNK> people together to make an extreme horror film any sort of acting production storyline fx etc go out the window in an effort to create shock value now don't get me wrong i consider myself a <UNK> of shock films and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the better but it's still nice to see some sort of talent from someone involved in the film br br <UNK> chronicles the life of harry russo a drug addicted freak show who takes orders to kill from his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he goes on a few <UNK> killing <UNK> and other random people and screaming about how much he hates <UNK> <UNK> that's <UNK> for those of you that don't speak new york <UNK> and how he wants to rape them in the ass there are a few weak <UNK> scenes very little gore and some nudity to mix things up a bit but nothing that you haven't seen in a better film br br the only redeeming thing that i can find in this retarded film are the often unintentionally hilarious screaming fits from our main man harry he goes on and on and on about wanting to kill everyone and do them in the ass and it really becomes quite comical after a while in fact i'm almost tempted to believe that there's supposed to be some sort of <UNK> erotic <UNK> to this film with all the ass talk and constant shots of harry running around with his <UNK> <UNK> out in all honesty that joker is <UNK> more in this film then the few chicks that show some t and a and some full frontal for good measure <UNK> is mildly amusing as a 1 time watch but i can really only recommend this to those that want to be able to say that they watched a film called <UNK> the whore <UNK> to be honest the title by far is the best thing about this trash a generous 3 5 10
<START> i've seen this film at least 4 times since <UNK> and it's still great every time i see it it's a very compelling version of the opera carmen with amazing flamenco dancing bare bones sets and of course wonderful music br br this telling of carmen is a story within a story with each <UNK> the other until the <UNK> tragic ending obviously a low budget spanish production the film contains dancing by some of <UNK> <UNK> flamenco dancers the combination of the <UNK> opera music and the sound of the dancers boots on the wooden stage makes the telling of the story even more powerful br br it's independent movie making at it's best and probably my all time favorite foreign film
<START> this wasn't the major disaster that i was expecting but that is about as positive as i can be in my description of the movie i'm not sure what was meant to be funny about this movie but i suppose it's all a matter of taste personally i don't find it funny to watch morons living their idiotic lives or making fools of themselves on television but then again i'm not a fan of jerry <UNK> pathetic daytime talk show i didn't get too bored watching this but i was definitely never enjoying it either if you're in the mood to see a bad movie but one that isn't too painful to sit through this is a good choice
<START> a very unique sci fi animated film and frankly i love <UNK> no matter which way it tends to be better or worse this french film is quite interesting to watch the technique part is <UNK> like waking life i recently watched br br it took me quite a long time to get used to the black white style but eventually i love it the <UNK> images are really fancy the <UNK> future world is a symbol of human <UNK> final destination which i adore it very much br br the whole plot is fine for a sci fi not so intriguing but it's ok like some hollywood's products a giant conspiracy about <UNK> eternity a little bit cliché and the twisted ending is not so convincing some development is just too plain and insipid and the whole movie is too long br br so i think i'm just in love with the style this film shows others are not so good br br about the eternity of life i think most people have come to a <UNK> that we don't want eternity because it <UNK> the meaning of life we treasure our lives because they are limited and meaningful if everyone can live forever thus the world world will become a disaster and chaos leaving someone you love is hard and heartbreaking but that's also a way to show our lives are genuine and all the emotion <UNK> one's life and make the world colorful and lively
<START> if you like movies about creepy towns <UNK> houses states ala the <UNK> hotel california etc that possess the people that are just passing through read almost any stephen king novel instead if you like the setting of disappearance start by reading king's desperation but also check out the shining <UNK> lot and <UNK> things br br the crow <UNK> the desert the family driving in desperation to escape or avoid possession are tired why didn't they just make the film from the desperation novel maybe they approached king and he <UNK> must be br br susan <UNK> and harry <UNK> look happy to be reunited and they have both worn well over the years but they're still tv and direct to dvd caliber actors
<START> after having watched <UNK> two or three dozen times and loving every second of it i finally had a chance to see it's sequel life in transformation i was truly <UNK> as it did not nearly stand up to the high standards of the first 90 minutes of people with <UNK> on their head is not my idea of a good movie the philip glass score for this one had neither the beauty nor the <UNK> strength of the first compared with <UNK> this movie seemed slow and pointless a watered down version of <UNK> which is the same idea but done better i truly hope the third movie in this series will not follow the example of this waste
<START> a recent post here by a woman claiming a military background contained the comment a woman's life is no more valuable than a man's br br this <UNK> of the politically correct is not true as history as well as <UNK> show societies have managed to recover from heavy <UNK> of their male population sometimes with astonishing speed germany was ready to fight another war in 1939 despite the <UNK> <UNK> war in which over two million of her men were killed in south america's war of the triple alliance <UNK> <UNK> took on three <UNK> countries until virtually her entire male population was wiped out but fought to a <UNK> in the 1932 <UNK> war against much larger bolivia br br no society however has or ever could survive the loss of its female population only when the very life of the nation is at stake are women sent to fight israel faced that situation in 1948 but since then has never considered <UNK> combat <UNK> for its defense forces despite the popular image of the israeli girl soldier br br g i jane is hollywood fluff
<START> arthur has always been a personal film for me for two reasons a good friend of mine who worked on the film as an extra and to help out with the horses during the stable scene just recently passed away if you look fast you can see frank graham during the restaurant scene in the background while dudley moore and jill <UNK> are in conversation frank was a champion <UNK> and will be missed by all who knew him br br secondly though i actually knew a real life arthur bach he was not quite as wealthy as arthur but spent <UNK> years of his life basically as a kid his parents tightly controlled his purse strings but his rent and <UNK> were paid for in a basement apartment in <UNK> village he spent a good deal of his time getting himself <UNK> on various spirits and making a public spectacle of himself just like dudley moore does br br the wonder with arthur is why anyone would bother with him wealth of not but that's the other half of the <UNK> my friend was a most charming person when you got to know him in fact it was almost a <UNK> to be charming he couldn't buy a newspaper or magazine without trying to establish some level of relationship with the <UNK> he spent his life being a perfect party guest the term <UNK> which was in common use in the 19th century would apply to him br br and that's what dudley moore is a <UNK> unlike my friend moore has john gielgud to clean up after him that's a full time job as we see demonstrated in arthur my friend also never found a <UNK> minnelli a male <UNK> minnelli in fact because he was gay still moore's portrayal of arthur bach is deadly accurate and so real for me br br arthur 20th century <UNK> is being forced to marry another trust <UNK> baby in jill <UNK> since he won't work for a living the threat of being cut off is quite real for him he only has his butler <UNK> played by john gielgud and <UNK> <UNK> played by ted post to pour his troubles out to we should all have such troubles br br john gielgud in his nearly century of life certainly did better work than in arthur on film and in fact gielgud is more <UNK> known for his stage performances yet 1981 was a year of sentiment at oscar time the academy gave henry fonda and <UNK> hepburn oscars for on golden pond and gielgud the best supporting actor award essentially for the work of a lifetime that man was amazing still at his craft almost to the end br br so to frank graham who worked in the film and to jackie <UNK> a genuine real life arthur i <UNK> this review
<START> this film takes you on one family's impossible journey and makes you feel every step of their odyssey beautifully acted and photographed <UNK> real its last line with its <UNK> hope is one of the more powerful in memory
<START> it's actually a good thing sean connery retired as james bond as i'm sure he wouldn't be able to keep up in the nowadays <UNK> business where fast cars have been replaced with hi tech <UNK> techniques and gorgeous women are considered to be less sexy than advanced computer equipment cypher is a pretty inventive sci fi thriller that often evokes feelings of fright <UNK> despite being utterly implausible you know the trend in these types of movies nothing is what it seems and just when you think figured out the convoluted plot the writers make sure to insert a new twist that <UNK> everyone again the events in cypher supposedly take place in the most prominent <UNK> of the computer world where the major companies don't really do a lot apart from trying to steal each other's thunder company <UNK> literally spends millions <UNK> people and providing them with a new identity only to let them <UNK> as spies in their biggest <UNK> the <UNK> corporation <UNK> on the other hand constantly tries to <UNK> the <UNK> rats and <UNK> them again as double spies in between this whole <UNK> business stands morgan sullivan a seemingly <UNK> thirty something employee who's been selected by sebastian <UNK> the <UNK> spy to <UNK> the secret <UNK> of both companies trust me it's actually less complicated than it sounds and director vincenzo natali the dude from tube carefully takes his time to introduce all the important and less important characters the first half of the film is rather reminiscent to the sadly underrated john <UNK> gem seconds  starring rock hudson  as it also deals with <UNK> identities and drastically <UNK> your former life style even the set pieces seem to come straight out of that 60's film with loads of empty white rooms and eerie corridors that seem to be endless there's also plenty of great action and suspense most notably when morgan <UNK> experiences how the <UNK> crew <UNK> the results of their <UNK> techniques during boring conventions the middle section of the film drags a little mainly because you already realize that it's all just building up towards multiple misleading plot twists and i hoped for a slightly more grim portrayal of the not so distant future jeremy northam is perfectly cast and the adorable lucy liu is convincingly mysterious as the <UNK> lady who appears to be on his side regular director's choice david <UNK> has the most memorable supportive role as the <UNK> eccentric <UNK> engineer <UNK> c <UNK> cypher is well made and <UNK> <UNK> sci fi entertainment highly recommended to people who fully like to use their brain capacity from time to time
<START> a struggling actor finds the best way to break into hollywood is to start knocking off the competition but what makes break a leg a real gem is the <UNK> look into the existence of the struggling and not so la actor it brings us into that world with <UNK> irony and wit it's also got a polished look and very <UNK> direction under <UNK> mitchell break a leg is one of those rare independent films that doesn't compromise its production values at any level the writing is tight the dialogue first rate <UNK> is an actor's actor and the role really shows off his talents the climactic scene between him and <UNK> garcia is an instant classic and may go down as one of the funniest hollywood scenes of all time i saw it at an advanced screening and everyone in the audience laughed <UNK> and <UNK> about it afterwards
<START> this is a dry and <UNK> feature filming on one of most interesting events in wwii and in history of <UNK> behind the front line bad drama composition is worst about this film as plot on killing hitler suppose to be pretty dramatic event there is no character development at all and idea that tom cruise suppose to play a high rank commander that questions his deepest inner thoughts on <UNK> and <UNK> is completely insane i believe that mister bin would play it better generally speaking film pretty much looks as a <UNK> copy of good german tv movie <UNK> from 2004 but can't get close to that film regarding any movie aspect whatsoever however movie obviously gets its financial goal with pop corn audience that <UNK> hollywood fast mood blood and shallow art values
<START> mix exotic <UNK> locations babes in skimpy <UNK> explosions good looking dudley do right <UNK> a movie star with his best years behind him martin sheen a little martial arts and a sexy <UNK> tracy <UNK> er sorry tracy elizabeth <UNK> and you'd think you'd be in for some <UNK> fun not so this is a dreary tv movie and even though it likes to promote itself as a charlie's angels deal it is nowhere near as good as the original series or even the <UNK> <UNK> stupid recent c a movies this abomination is best described as a third rate andy <UNK> film nowhere near as much fun as <UNK> hard ticket to hawaii although some of the fight scenes are decent enough the girls spend too much time posing and trying too look <UNK> and it gets annoying after a while there's better genre stuff that this out there oh yeah and the babes aren't as hot as they like to think they are terrible soundtrack when it's there
<START> i'm among millions who consider themselves cary grant fans but i can't think of a single reason to recommend this movie i don't understand the casting of <UNK> drake and it appears no one else did if we're to judge from the small number of films in which she played afterwards br br most fans will agree that <UNK> hepburn was superb at chasing and catching cary grant in bringing up baby here the director or writers try to rehash the idea but it fails miserably i've read comments about how creepy drake was but i thought that was far too mild a description <UNK> tone walked through this one as if he were <UNK> a casting disaster is one thing this film is a total disaster br br this one doesn't deserve 10 lines of comments and i don't know why that's a <UNK> too bad this one was <UNK> when so many worthwhile films lie rotting in <UNK> br br unless you want to torture someone give this one a wide <UNK>
<START> here's the kind of love story that i do enjoy watching and mostly it's for two reasons one it concentrates of young people very young people people who are still in their teens and are experiencing love for the first time or at least think they are all of us have been there in our lives and the man in the moon is a magnificent reflection upon our memories maybe adding on a few more details and <UNK> it further than any of us have experienced the second reason is that is a love triangle and i do believe that as teens it's the most dramatic and the story is so well developed that you believe the characters could really be in love or are just so new to love that they just strongly believe they are and after a tragedy or so occurs will believe it for the rest of their lives br br the cast of the man in the moon is full of great talented names it stars sam <UNK> who is truly a versatile actor well capable of playing tough district <UNK> as well as strict yet caring and wise fathers as in this film also there is tess <UNK> jason london and a young young reese <UNK> you look at the young talented actress as she is at age <UNK> and you think that about ten years down the road she's going to win the academy award all members of the cast pull off great performances and with the dialogue of the compelling screenplay they are enhanced into looking like real people in real situations as if it all really happened this the kind of movie that i would like to see come out more often love story or not i would love to see films that make everything look real and is not phony or <UNK> in any way
<START> i probably give this more credit than it deserves because it's halloween i was just at <UNK> scary farm and i was in a mood to watch a really cheesy halloween movie br br oh and it only cost me one dollar br br usually i'll <UNK> through a movie like this to get to the good stuff but i <UNK> the urge here and i'm still not sure why it was obvious from the opening shots this wasn't a real movie not even a b movie it's more in the category of the <UNK> horror movies like the <UNK> that are shot on film look video for about 50 cents in fact i was half afraid any minute one of his <UNK> college boys would <UNK> out <UNK> himself in his <UNK> or something there were no <UNK> shots too expensive to do multiple camera <UNK> and flat lighting but it's hard to <UNK> there's something refreshing about watching a director with no money pull off a half decent movie the fact that he's doing even a half decent job is commendable and this movie has it's share of merits the acting isn't bad the photography is pretty good if too bright to be scary there are some surprises and the whole thing is sort of different somehow br br a bunch of college kids are for some unknown reason stuck in the warehouse where they are <UNK> the <UNK> haunted house a creepy old man gives them a satanic book and they accidentally <UNK> up the powers of hell this results in the <UNK> people in the haunted house becoming who they are made up to be and causing a lot of mayhem and human suffering along the way we are treated to an oddly complex and thoughtful lesbian relationship subplot it's interesting that this couple seems to be the most well rounded in the movie yes there's a sex scene but it isn't <UNK> or at least no more so than you'd find in any <UNK> movie about lesbians that shows them having sex it's rather unusual for a horror film to take the time and effort to do this without <UNK> to cheap exploitation br br the other thing about this that held my interest was how it was clearly trying to <UNK> the stupid kids have sex and get killed vibe of the 80's slashers it's hard to take that on because there are so many of those films that already exist the genre has been done to death i'm not sure if it's good or bad that these filmmakers simply tried to make another entry in that genre without irony as if it was still a living genre but i appreciated the attempt br br which is why i sat through it sometimes you just want to watch a mindless no budget a for effort horror film there really was too much set up not enough gore endless plot holes dead ends and clichés and the unfortunate overall feel of a movie that simply did not have enough money behind it to be the film the producers <UNK> but at the very least the haunted house scenes were pretty cool i'd pay to go to that haunted house if it existed and didn't mind paying a dollar to see it on dvd even if i'll never watch this again br br oh and possible spoiler but there was great brief business with the vampire girl in the coffin i used to be claustrophobic but i've changed ha ha good one
<START> i'm always surprised about how many times you'll see something about world war 2 on the german national television you would think they don't like to open old wounds but there isn't a week that goes by without a documentary or a movie about the horror and atrocities of this war perhaps it's a way of dealing with their past i don't know but you sure can't blame them of ignoring what happened and it has to be said most of those documentaries are really worth a watch because they never try to <UNK> over the truth and the same can be said about their movies think for instance about der <UNK> or the downfall as you might now it which are also very realistic br br one of those movies is rosenstrasse it tells a true story and deals with the subject of the mixed <UNK> during the war even though the movie starts with a family in the usa at the present day after <UNK> father died her mother all a sudden turned into an <UNK> jew even though she hasn't been very religious before she doesn't know where the strange behavior of her mother comes from but as she starts digging in her mother's troubled childhood hannah understands how little she has ever known about her mother's past br br the fact that this movie deals with the subject of the mixed <UNK> during the nazi regime is already quite surprising for as far as i know there hasn't been another movie that deals with this subject for those who didn't know this yet being married to a so called pure <UNK> man or woman meant for many jews that they weren't immediately sent to one of the concentration camps but that they had to work in a factory but it does not only tell something about the problems of the mixed <UNK> it also gives a good idea of how these people were often seen by their own parents and relatives how difficult it sometimes was for them during the nazi regime and how these people most of the time women did everything within their power to free their men once they were captured and locked away in for instance the rosenstrasse br br the acting is really good and the story is very well written although the way it was presented in the beginning didn't really do it for me and that's exactly the only part that you'll get to see in the trailer perhaps it's just me but i would have left out a big part of what happens in the present day at least of the part that is <UNK> in the usa because the part where hannah goes to berlin and talks to someone who knows more about her mother's past definitely works br br if you are interested in everything that has something to do with the second world war and if you aren't necessarily looking for a lot of action shots than this is definitely a movie you should see this isn't a movie in which you'll see any battles or <UNK> but it certainly is an interesting movie because it gives you an idea about an aspect of the war only little is known of i give it an 8 10
<START> despite pretty bad reviews i just had to give this film a go  it does after all star hk super babe <UNK> <UNK> plus 6 other oriental <UNK> as a team of all action cat <UNK> surely that's worth checking out well as babe <UNK> go martial angels is hard to beat the eye candy is top quality <UNK> <UNK> looks as fantastic as always and of the rest of the girls <UNK> <UNK> and amanda <UNK> caught my <UNK> eye in particular br br unfortunately if one is to judge this movie by any other possible merits it is an absolute stinker the story is weak the action shoddy and the special effects downright pathetic director clarence <UNK> and producer wong <UNK> have given us a <UNK> cast and little else br br if <UNK> <UNK> is the only reason you're <UNK> seeing this one you would be better off watching sex and <UNK> 2 again
<START> this movie serves as a <UNK> warning to anyone who thinks they can both write and direct their own movie face it you can't because that way there's nobody around to tell you when you hack great holes in your plot have meaningless transitions trite <UNK> dialog and manage to turn a fairly cool korean legend into a steaming pile of celluloid turd br br i wanted to like this movie as a trashy popcorn movie really i did i like lots of crappy movies but once i've been forced to ask myself what the hell just happened and why dear lord why more than a few times i really can't take it any more br br also i would love for someone to explain how la became <UNK> for the last scene
<START> perhaps disney was hoping for another mary <UNK> but this is a very different story and while angela is delightful she was a very different performer to the great julie andrews having said that lansbury is perfectly cast and delivers a magical performance there is something deliciously <UNK> about her character and she is given wonderful support by david <UNK> <UNK> can carry a tune but he is certainly not much chop as a singer it does not matter he was such a gifted actor you hardly notice there are some great cameos from much loved stars of another time like <UNK> <UNK> who gives a winning performance and the much loved <UNK> <UNK> who does very little but its nice to see the old gal again its also lovely to see sam <UNK> and the king of english television bruce forsythe in small roles the score has a couple of beautiful songs especially the <UNK> sea and the age of not believing the big number <UNK> road is stretched to the limit but it has plenty of <UNK> the effects look a bit cliché today but the scene with the german <UNK> being attacked by the <UNK> army in film is pretty impressive the kids are not as annoying as other movies but one does struggle to understand what the youngest boy is saying i loved the <UNK> song of the home army the home guard were very important to britain and this is a warm tribute the animation is delightful much better than pixar which i find grotesque a warm happy film and its a wonder its not done on stage
<START> don't drink the cool aid br br this is an opinion piece disguised as a documentary and to title it as a truth is just plain crap the debate over global warming is far from over and will only be over when the <UNK> zombies start <UNK> the mountain of evidence contrary to their beloved theory just <UNK> global warming and <UNK> or junk science and you will find a river of information <UNK> nearly every link in the chain of logic that gore sites the reason it is so important for people to <UNK> themselves is the disastrous economic impact that global warming <UNK> <UNK> would have wake up people anyone with a computer a little time and some common sense can find many many reasons why this theory is not even close to credible don't just read <UNK> that support your present opinions read everything you can find there is no in depth analysis to make really there is simply too many alternate possibilities and counter evidence for the theory to have even the most basic level of scientific credibility it is so <UNK> in fact that it may be the single biggest <UNK> in the course of human existence it's time for people to start speaking out against this kind of propaganda and it's time for people to admit to themselves and others that you can be a both a <UNK> and recognize the glaring conclusion that global warming <UNK> is a big lie
<START> i <UNK> up this title by accident with the <UNK> <UNK> 1 collection of pure euro trash movies but this movie has a nice <UNK> of <UNK> and should deserve a better transfer than what is out there <UNK> it is not satisfying it is watching this movie i couldn't help to wonder how come sergio martino didn't make this flick this has his signature all over it and <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> alas not as well known as she should be but she did get a nice cameo in hostel ii double crosses and triple crosses <UNK> and <UNK> this film from beginning to end with lee van <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> under pressure from the 1st second did this guy have to go to italy to finally reach his potential or did the studio system let this guy slip through besides lee's more recognizable films film goers should try this on for size and see how if sergio <UNK> would've <UNK> his epic scale down on once upon a time in america to half the running time and 1 4 of the budget this is what it would've turned out to be like so refreshing it should be taken in during the day at home and make it for an couch <UNK>
<START> this 1970 hit film has not aged well but frankly it was not that good when it was released yet it was a hugely popular success perhaps because the idea of <UNK> young love must have <UNK> to audiences <UNK> by constant tv coverage of the vietnam war the plot is pure drivel as it concerns oliver <UNK> iv a <UNK> <UNK> hockey player who meets and falls in love with jenny <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK> music student proud of her working class background his old school father naturally <UNK> of jenny and in a typical act of rebellion that means the young couple gets married in one of those hippie era <UNK> <UNK> he lands his dream job in new york but she gets unexpectedly ill and dies of her <UNK> disease there is a <UNK> of then contemporary film making techniques displayed by director arthur <UNK> but none of that can hide the old fashioned cliché ridden story at its core the inevitable ending left me particularly <UNK> br br both ryan <UNK> and ali <UNK> became stars with this movie as oliver and jenny but inexplicably so since neither seems able to convey the depth or complexity required to make their characters compelling at least the <UNK> <UNK> is sincere in his <UNK> <UNK> approach but <UNK> is so wooden and <UNK> in behavior that it's hard to see what oliver sees in jenny beyond her sarcastic <UNK> john <UNK> two years before finding the decapitated <UNK> in his bed in the godfather does better as <UNK> <UNK> baker father phil as does ray <UNK> as the seemingly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the overly familiar frances <UNK> music has almost become parody in itself over the years the print quality on the dvd is good though the only extra is a rather <UNK> commentary track by <UNK> the most interesting bit of trivia is that author <UNK> segal upon whose book this movie is based conceived oliver as a mix between two <UNK> roommates he knew  vice president al gore and actor tommy lee jones who happens to have a bit part in the movie as one of <UNK> roommates
<START> i really am shocked to see the number of reviews that <UNK> this movie this movie was not intended to be a deep thought movie which is what the vast majority of the reviewers seem to think it should be in fact it would appear that if any movie doesn't produce a life <UNK> insight and a deep twisted mind <UNK> plot they would rate it a 1 or 2 don't trash a movie because you don't like the genre people br br this movie was an action comedy flick and that's all it was intended to be and for an action comedy it was very well done i was actually rather surprised that i enjoyed it as much as i did having never really been a jamie foxx fan and having the over used plot that it has br br the plot was nothing spectacular using the typical criminal gets out of prison and is thrown into bad guy plot while trying to clean up his act see blue streak hudson <UNK> 48 hours etc etc etc but it was <UNK> over with a bit of a technological twist now the bad guys are actually the good guys and the real bad guy is an uber geek br br jamie foxx actually plays a convincingly humorous while at the same time rather intelligent and serious main character and didn't try to <UNK> the humor side of the film br br if you're looking for a deep underlying plot such as in the matrix or a drama such as of mice and men then this movie isn't for you but if you enjoy the raw action excellent fast paced filming and an occasional twist of humor tossed in this movie won't disappoint you i would normally have rated it about an 8 on the same level as the die hard trilogy but instead gave it a 10 to try and bring the score up to what it should be br br
<START> horrible waste of time bad acting plot directing this is the most boring movie ever there are bad movies that are fun freddy vs jason and there are bad movies that are horrible this one fits into the latter bottom line don't waste your time
<START> <UNK> powerful gangster supreme frankie <UNK> the always terrific lee van <UNK> in fine rugged form has himself arrested and sent to prison so he can rub out a <UNK> partner sans <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> small time hood and <UNK> wannabe tony <UNK> an <UNK> portrayal by tony lo <UNK> gets <UNK> as well frank and tony form an unlikely friendship behind bars tony helps frank break out of the joint and <UNK> him on his quest to exact revenge on a rival group of <UNK> lead by the ruthless louis <UNK> smoothly played by jean <UNK> director <UNK> <UNK> working from an absorbing script by sergio <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> relates the neat story at a constant <UNK> pace <UNK> a suitably gritty but occasionally lighthearted tone throughout and stages the rousing action set pieces with considerable rip <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> shower <UNK> and a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> car chase rate as the definite thrilling highlights van <UNK> and lo <UNK> display a nice loose and engaging on screen chemistry the relationship between their characters is alternately funny and touching the ravishing <UNK> <UNK> alas isn't given much to do as tony's whiny girlfriend <UNK> but at least gets to bare her insanely gorgeous and <UNK> body in a much appreciated gratuitous nude shower scene <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jazz score certainly hits the <UNK> <UNK> spot the polished cinematography by joe <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is likewise impressive a really nifty and entertaining little winner
<START> i was fascinated as to how truly bad this movie was was the viewer supposed to learn something or reflect on anything here what was up with the <UNK> was i supposed to be impressed with the motel shots does it matter that there are some garbage <UNK> on a <UNK> across the street of a hotel why does the narrator <UNK> mock the people he interviews it is so obvious that he edited out the really informative parts of his interviews to achieve mockery the best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be even before it is finished br br i am truly amazed i believe that the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or is trying to impress the intellectual community
<START> this show is totally worth watching it has the best cast of talent i have seen in a very long time the premise of the show is unique and fresh i guess the executives at abc are not used too that as it was not another reality show however this show was believable with likable characters and marvelous story lines i am probably not in the age group they expect to like the show as i am in my <UNK> but a lot of my friends also loved it late 30's mid 40's and are dying for quality shows with talented cast members i do not think this show was given enough time to gain an audience i believe that given more time this show would have done very well once again abc is not giving a show with real potential a real chance with so many shows given chance after chance and not nearly worth it they need to give quality shows a real chance and the time to really click and gain an audience i really loved the characters and looked forward to watching each episode i have been watching the episodes on abc videos and the show keeps getting better and better although i think they owe us one more episode number 13 we want to watch what we can <UNK> abc with <UNK> and letters and see if its possible to save this show from <UNK> it certainly worked for <UNK> some things are just worth saving and this show is definitely one of them sign the online <UNK> to abc at http www <UNK> com <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this 1939 film from director john ford and writer <UNK> <UNK> tells a fictional tale of young lawyer abraham lincoln his trials literally and his <UNK> it's a sentimental film reasonably well made but hardly breathtaking the casting of henry fonda as lincoln seems a mistake for while the actor had the right <UNK> qualities for the part even with several <UNK> of makeup and a false nose he's way too handsome for honest <UNK> who was <UNK> <UNK> it's a good try from fonda who's nothing if not sincere but his <UNK> throws the entire film off the supporting cast is excellent though and includes alice brady ward bond and donald meek but ford is too <UNK> in his treatment of lincoln who is presented as just shy of a saint and in the final scene the movie goes way over the top
<START> this is a great entertaining action film in my opinion with cool characters lots of action and an amazing performance from dolph lundgren however alex <UNK> is awful as the villain the story is very good and i found the kids to be likable for the most part plus dolph lundgren is simply amazing in this the action scenes are excellent and it's almost like die hard except it's set in a school plus <UNK> <UNK> is very menacing and sexy as the sidekick the finale is very exciting and it has a couple of cool emotional moments as well however i just wished it had another villain because alex <UNK> just didn't cut it as the villain way too <UNK> and laughable for my tastes this should be higher then 4 1 in my opinion as i thought it was a great action film and while the kids were very stupid at times they got quite <UNK> as the movie went along plus the <UNK> were pretty cool as well the ending is very amusing and corey <UNK> character was my favorite student plus dolph has still got it this is a great entertaining action film in my opinion with cool characters lots of action and an amazing performance from lundgren but alex <UNK> is awful as the villain still i highly recommend this one the direction is very good sidney j <UNK> does a very good job here with great camera work good angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace there is a bit of blood and violence we get lots of extremely bloody <UNK> wounds knife in the side of the head bloody arrow hits an <UNK> and other minor stuff the acting is fantastic dolph lundgren is amazing as always and is amazing here he is extremely likable kicks that ass as usual had great chemistry with the kids had an awesome character is very charismatic and he may not have shown a great emotional rage he still was a hell of a lot of fun to watch he is one of my favorite actors lundgren rules alex <UNK> is god awful as the villain he is laughably <UNK> was boring and not menacing at all he also annoyed the crap out of me <UNK> <UNK> is very sexy as the side kick and did fine with what she had to do she was the real villain in my opinion corey <UNK> is funny as mick he was my favorite student and i really started to warm up to him in the 2nd half i liked him a lot he had good chemistry with dolph too <UNK> <UNK> willy chris collins <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jay <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> alicia nicole <UNK> <UNK> all do great as the students jennifer <UNK> is very cute and is good as the fiancée rest of the cast do fine overall i highly recommend this one 1 2 out of 5
<START> murder by numbers is one of those movies that you expect is made for tv but isn't considering the only actor of any note is <UNK> although michael pitt seems to be moving onto bigger and better things it isn't a great surprise that this movie quickly fades away from memory to be replaced by more important things like remembering to lock your front door when you go out or putting clothes back on when you come out of the shower br br <UNK> plays cassie <UNK> a cop with personal issues don't they all together with her new partner a wet looking ben chaplin she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman nothing unusual there except that the <UNK> are a couple of teenage students who think they've planned and executed the perfect murder as the investigation continues a battle of <UNK> emerges between cassie and the main suspect <UNK> <UNK> ryan <UNK> br br the <UNK> issue here is that the two leads are hopeless <UNK> though she is very nice to look at is about as believable in the role of a hardened cynical cop as rodney <UNK> actually he'd be better chaplin for his sins is a complete non <UNK> and i feel sorry that he has to put this film on his <UNK> in his attempt to break into hollywood at least <UNK> and pitt as the conniving <UNK> suspects <UNK> themselves adequately as if dodgy leads weren't bad enough a story that would send anybody to sleep and a highly predictable but illogical ending shoot this film in the head before it has a chance to run br br murder by numbers has absolutely nothing going for it even a pointless nude scene by <UNK> wouldn't redeem it well just a little but still not enough to save it forgettable predictable and redundant this is one film that isn't going to move the cop genre forward as cassie probably says on her next case there's nothing to see here people move along keep moving
<START> it ran from 1959 1973 its more than its <UNK> that says a lot for this series its also that it survived changes in fashion and taste from the 50's psychedelic 60's and remained popular in the 70's br br i remember repeats of this series it was a successful combination of all its elements from stories cast and productions that made it exceptional <UNK> green had his defining iconic character from this series its appeal was across generations all members of the family could enjoy this it balanced morality with violence humour with seriousness a cartoon series was made as a spin off from this as a result of its impact the shame is that this series is no longer repeated and many will not know its significance
<START> i have read modesty blaise for several years now collecting numbers of the strip after the fiasco movie made many years ago based on the first book modesty blaise i was surprised the result got this good br br what i got was a movie not based on action or violence the director had focused on history and psychology how was modesty created based on the own tale and what parts in her life was affected by her non childhood i think this <UNK> will give a greater understanding to the next i hope film i simply loved the movies old fashioned style br br however everything wasn't that good the gambling wasn't that good almost boring and unreal the acting could have been improved too i'm not thinking the bad guy in this movie felt real the only reason he was there was so modesty could have someone to tell her story for also they could have expanded the movie showing more about when she builds up the network but i'll guess thats for the next movie br br and please forgive me for my bad english
<START> this thing is horrible the ben affleck character is self centered and <UNK> sadistic punch you in the nose <UNK> sadistic and he's the romantic hero his cartoonish character does not change from beginning to end but his money ultimately allows him to buy happiness br br if i were a <UNK> i would <UNK> beyond belief but i'm not a <UNK> br br we <UNK> like a little christmas magic from time to time this ain't magic i don't know what it is it's just awful and it's a horrible waste of talent o'hara has been making me laugh hysterically since the late '70s gandolfini <UNK> these people were all underused if ben was out of the <UNK> these folks might have <UNK> up something excellent
<START> the idea was awesome the actors were incredible the story could of been very scary but the writing was poor and there was no depth i couldn't really get into this movie i couldn't feel for the characters there were a lot of <UNK> and the movie just ends very <UNK> was it a happy ending i don't know was it a sad ending again i don't know you leave the theater feeling <UNK> the movie had so much to give but couldn't just because you can edit doesn't mean you should right i wouldn't really recommend this movie because you just can't say that you left the movie feeling like it was completed you'll just be confused trust me you will probably thank me if you don't watch this movie br br 3 10
<START> this is a rotten movie the cast seem to know just how bad it was it starts badly and by the end is truly bad the acting is <UNK> the script could of been written on the spot and although the movie is a horror film it has no scary scenes crap 1 out of 10
<START> why didn't this pick up a bag full of oscars it is an amazing <UNK> of an <UNK> filmed performed piece the visuals are breathtaking especially in wide screen the pan <UNK> really kills this film's wonderful cinematography and sets every frame is a painting astounding the play is almost completely intact and branagh's passion for it is clear from the opening titles on no <UNK> here just great storytelling the way only film can but rarely does <UNK> is especially perfect as <UNK> murderous uncle he doesn't play him as a mustache <UNK> evil <UNK> but a charming politician allowing us to see why only hamlet suspects foul play branagh also nails the subtlety of the line between <UNK> fake real madness and the burning revenge inside him and the many cameos come off quite well everyone from billy crystal and robin williams to gerard <UNK> and charlton heston <UNK> if you are sucked into branagh's vision the way i was a mesmerizing piece
<START> this was a less than exciting short film i saw between features on turner classic movies recently while the film popped out due to its very intense technicolor the film itself just wasn't that moving and at times the plot looked pretty cheesy like this was made for <UNK> use and capturing the attention of a wider audience wasn't even a consideration in particular i really hated how many times in the film things were <UNK> such as when the characters talked to her they usually said clara barton instead of <UNK> miss barton or clara plus one <UNK> <UNK> soldier said that he was a johnny <UNK> a <UNK> a rebel almost like he was the cartoon character <UNK> <UNK> from the <UNK> girls this was just sloppy writing period br br it was interesting to see john hamilton later perry white on the superman tv show in a beard as president garfield yep it's him under that beard
<START> how low can someone sink while trying to <UNK> an old glory st <UNK> will be glad to show you br br if you are used to seeing what made for a good star trek show do not watch this br br the writing is <UNK> <UNK> the actors' portrayals of their characters weak and most of all the design work is downright <UNK> br br like watching strong <UNK> don't look here like the strong <UNK> attitude forget about it here <UNK> is <UNK> by <UNK> wearing <UNK> in their hair br br while a seemingly mentally feeble captain <UNK> about and within two minutes of the opening show's credits <UNK> <UNK> is attempting to <UNK> a <UNK> with an engineer it just <UNK> from there no not even uniforms match for goodness sake they are too small or too big <UNK> down to their <UNK> and <UNK> seasons one and two uniforms mixed in with season three and <UNK> uniforms the strict discipline and tradition of any of the originals in lacking in this production down to the <UNK> the only good thing about this show is its graphics which seem to improve a bit with each season ok i take that back who uses cg that <UNK> the <UNK> of this show br br don't bother with it it will offend your star trek sense as it did mine not even the throw backs to previous shows can save this catastrophe br br i <UNK> openly when i watched this probably because my eyes were bleeding and my head almost <UNK> that bad
<START> if utterly <UNK> <UNK> self indulgent anti establishment anti <UNK> <UNK> appeals to you then this is the ideal film very poorly scripted with often <UNK> dialogue and <UNK> tiresome hand held camera throughout this is a film that presents the world in <UNK> simplistic <UNK> terms all adults especially teachers parents priests and doctors are <UNK> and bumbling at best and <UNK> monsters at worst the only escape from the horrors of <UNK> as a whole is plenty of primal screaming yawn and <UNK> <UNK> literally in a primitive cave like space in the woods with <UNK> taking the form of a rave party again in the woods naturally displays all the weaknesses of a first film and plenty more besides
<START> <UNK> paperhouse thriller horror 1988 sick in bed with a fever 11 year old anna charlotte burke has only her drawings to keep her company her health <UNK> <UNK> as a series of mysterious <UNK> <UNK> grip her in each of these episodes she dreams of a house in a desolate field with only a <UNK> <UNK> boy named marc elliot <UNK> <UNK> it when a dark unknown danger threatens her <UNK> paperhouse the life of marc is put in <UNK> her life is also in danger as these dreams mirror her own state of health br br critique haunting first debut feature from british director bernard rose taken from a fable <UNK> dreams by catherine <UNK> it leaves plenty of other <UNK> fantasy works in its wake whenever a story deals with dreams and nightmares it is hard to give it the mixture of fable and reality to make it work in film form director rose successfully captures the children fantasy world aspect along with a darkness that seeks to <UNK> them br br <UNK> scored by phillip glass rose knows how to use music wisely with expertly timed <UNK> out of your <UNK> moments most thrillers are very sloppy in this all important aspect of <UNK> the audience into not knowing what the next scene will bring i also like the way he captures suspense and never lets it go or <UNK> <UNK> into the next sequence of events also his <UNK> of placing objects within the frame as in his p o v shots gives the cinematography an added dimension it would otherwise seem to lack only in europe will you find such ominous looking places as the ones presented here the lonely house the fields <UNK> towns <UNK> etc br br rose would follow this film with <UNK> 1992 a true <UNK> <UNK> horror gem and <UNK> <UNK> cult horror favorite
<START> wow rarely have i felt the need to comment on movies lately but this one especially is begging for a <UNK> let's start at the beginning first writer director susan <UNK> puts kim basinger in the tired old victim role complete with the requisite abusive husband and dull suburban existence let it be said right now that almost all content in this dull movie is completely hackneyed and trite <UNK> pathetic attempt at symbolism involving the christmas tree with no star is laughable br br when she goes out for some christmas <UNK> paper one dark and ominous night della is furious that somebody double <UNK> their car on the <UNK> shopping night of the year she decides to do something about it so she leaves a nasty note on the <UNK> <UNK> the next fifteen minutes of the movie are devoted to della walking around <UNK> in the shopping mall when she finally gets to her car the thugs confront her about the note a cop is killed and she runs and they catch up to her and she gets away and they chase her some more and on and on everything is completely predictable and <UNK> the thugs are not scary or menacing at all and they all get picked off one by one in all the usual ways br br this is one of those movies in which all the action depends on the characters being as stupid as you can imagine why the bad guys don't just kill her instead of waiting for her to hit them with a tire iron is beyond me and once just once in a film like this does the leader of the pack have to die last what does it matter that they are all picked off one by one when they are all equally inept much of the movie simply consists of lukas <UNK> running around in the woods screaming della and the inclusion of joy division on the soundtrack of this wretched film is insulting br br the part that really made me run for my computer <UNK> was when della exhausted and hurt cries out to the heavens where are you god where indeed was god when this movie was being made i give it a 2 only because of competent cinematography and lighting and it's not as bad as <UNK> killer ' the ultimate <UNK> for judging any terrible film cheers
<START> not even <UNK> could have pulled off a propaganda stunt like what gore has done with this complete piece of fiction this is a study in how numbers and <UNK> can be <UNK> to say whatever you have <UNK> them to say the scientists gore says have signed onto the <UNK> of global warming include social workers <UNK> and <UNK> would you say a <UNK> is an expert in <UNK> surgery the field research and data analysis <UNK> are involved in do not support <UNK> <UNK> claims of global warming as one of those <UNK> working in the field for the last 40 years i have not seen any evidence to support global warming my analysis of this movie and <UNK> actions over the last couple years brings me to the conclusion that global warming is his way of staying important and relevant no more no less ask any global warming <UNK> or journalist one simple question you say global warming is a major problem tell me what <UNK> is the earth supposed to be
<START> this is the best film the derek couple has ever made and if you think this is a recommendation then you haven't seen any of the others there are the usual ingredients it is just as poorly acted as their other efforts we can watch bo <UNK> or <UNK> for wet t shirt <UNK> quite frequently the story is just laughably idiotic and the film takes itself much too seriously and then <UNK> <UNK> in africa br br but it has a few things going for it bo looks great the production values sets costumes etc are quite good and this greatly enhances its camp value in a strange way it is actually quite funny simply because it tries to be serious and fails so badly
<START> it is projected that between 2000 and <UNK> <UNK> million people will die <UNK> as a result of aids the projected <UNK> is greatest in sub <UNK> africa where <UNK> million additional deaths can be expected beyond the grim <UNK> are personal stories that we rarely hear about <UNK> <UNK> describes one of the most moving in close to leo a film produced for french television as part of a series dealing with issues facing young people though fictional it deals with a situation that is unfortunately too common the effect of a <UNK> of hiv on a loving close <UNK> family br br when twenty one year old leo pierre <UNK> tells his parents and two teenage brothers <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that he has aids the family is <UNK> out of concern for his youth they decide to <UNK> the information from his youngest brother 12 year old marcel <UNK> <UNK> but he <UNK> the conversation and begins to <UNK> and act <UNK> when leo goes to paris for treatment he takes marcel with him but the young boy confronts leo and demands to know the truth leo tells him that he is ill and marcel is sad but accepting when he brings marcel along to meet some former gay friends however tension between them <UNK> to the surface setting the stage for a riveting conclusion br br although i was uncomfortable with scenes in bed involving physical contact between the brothers i feel that the sincerity of close to leo and the brilliant performances by <UNK> and <UNK> more than tip the <UNK> in its favor seeing events unfold from the young boy's perspective gives the film an authenticity that reminded me of the <UNK> film <UNK> and <UNK> the 400 blows unlike some american films that dance around the anguish of aids close to leo tells a harsh truth but does so in a way that is tender and wonderfully real
<START> i have nothing more to say but it was awful i cannot imagine why helen <UNK> and others were part of this <UNK> mess and if certain actors don't want people to question their sexuality then perhaps they should <UNK> from making more of these films there was at least one seen that left me curious just my opinion <UNK> to think what was going on that was cut from the film <UNK> to wonder what went through the minds of the actors who made this film <UNK> to think about the thought process and <UNK> that went on in the directors mind like i stated before its a <UNK> mess its not even funny as ebert said of the film <UNK> with malcolm mcdowell its not a good film not a good story and its not even good porn <UNK>
<START> this is one of those movies that they did too much promoting for if you watch t v then you might as well not watch the movie almost all the funny scenes are spoiled in the previews except one which just happens to be jennifer <UNK> being the funny one it is typical jim carrey humor and it is really funny just don't go see this movie expecting to be surprised all in all if you like jim carrey or comedies this is a must see otherwise just watch the previews and you'll be just as satisfied
<START> my personal vision of hell is being locked in a room without the ability to close my eyes or block my ears and have this movie play for eternity on every available surface in that room the whole notion that streisand plays a boy man only begins to scratch the surface of how ridiculous a premise this movie is the single most important thing about watching any movie is the concept of willing suspension of disbelief it is impossible to do that in this movie
<START> if the answer to this question is yes then you should enjoy this excellent movie i've just seen it a couple of hours ago here in paris where the action of the movie takes place and i can still feel the huge trauma i received in the back of my eyes what a visual shock i've never seen such a beautiful black white photo and such a <UNK> change in the way of doing animated movies i strongly believe there will a before and after renaissance similarly to what we saw with pixar movies or the <UNK> and <UNK> experiences this is a real breakthrough in the small world of animated movies and i hope this french <UNK> a small unknown french studio with a few young folks who had a dream named renaissance will receive the success and recognition it deserves <UNK> la france
<START> this is one of those movies that should have been way better than it turned out to be i dread to think what the blockbuster <UNK> edit must have looked like because the director's cut on dvd was a bore of the epic proportions naturally you don't expect it to be the godfather but an acting class or two might have come in handy br br also there were so many cute guys in this movie but they were woefully under exploited i like watching a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> around in their <UNK> as much as the next guy but even i have a right to expect a little more it wasn't a total loss though at least we got a <UNK> a drew <UNK> covered junk and truly <UNK> <UNK> and there's <UNK> ritter looking even <UNK> than he did in bring it on and acting about as well there's always a silver <UNK> kids you just have to look really hard for it and occasionally you have to make use of your pause button
<START> this was my first and probably the last <UNK> movie i was eager to get into it as it featured mastroianni one of my favorite actors and was a film by theo of whom i've heard a lot the opening was promising a long shot over a <UNK> of soldiers across the <UNK> greek border ok but that was all nothing left the movie had big holes and i don't know which to mention first the main plot of the story is revealed to the journalist by the old woman during a long walk it's like a 15 minutes monologue killing the action and viewers patience nothing happening on screen for 15 or even 20 minutes apart this old lady telling a story all that is presumed to be shown through action was simply told to the camera by the old lady in a moment the <UNK> of tv was heading to the bar they turn the corner and immediately the winter begins probably shot in different days continuity <UNK> a lot of problems with the story telling it went from absurd to irrational never sticking to a style making the viewer asking questions that never got answers poor mastroianni given a role which lacked integrity or charm on the other hand as many <UNK> or <UNK> or <UNK> people would agree with the movies showed lot of historic ethnic or politically <UNK> just for the sake of making a movie about humanity as a red in another review a lot more to say but no time to lose on a poor movie which was not movie at all but <UNK> of a person impressed on film and paid with state money
<START> <UNK> manipulative <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> drake sets out to trap her ideal man aided by her co worker julie <UNK> <UNK> madison brown cary grant goes from <UNK> to <UNK> in the space of 90 minutes on film but to the viewer it's all eternity can a movie receive less than one star this one is a prime candidate
<START> i teach japanese for an online high school and i include cultural activities so that the students can learn about the country as well as the language and watching <UNK> ho is one of the <UNK> the students can either buy or rent the movie stereotypes or not this helps the students to see that other people view the world and their lives differently than we do many of my students have told me that they enjoyed the movie so much they are going to get a copy for themselves it is really interesting to see what we value in this culture and what they value in their culture i just wish i could get a <UNK> up tv version i'm not really into the crude language the auto workers use all the time
<START> jane <UNK> former love interest harry holt neil hamilton and his friend martin paul <UNK> come to <UNK> hidden away jungle <UNK> searching for the <UNK> gold mine that is the <UNK> graveyard first seen in tarzan the ape man only we soon discover both men have hidden intentions namely jane will tarzan stand for that not likely in fact tarzan won't even stand for any <UNK> done to the <UNK> graveyard and knowing this martin attempts to take tarzan out of the picture only he later finds himself in a world of trouble later he and his party including jane who leaves with them after she believes tarzan is dead is captured by a native tribe intent on feeding them to the lions will tarzan be will and able enough to get to them in time br br this film is adventure filled with loads of scenes involving tarzan and other facing down wild animals and a climax that grips the viewer's interest and doesn't let up the cruelty displayed towards animals and the portrayal of native people may <UNK> some today but all should remember this is basically fantasy adventure entertainment and shouldn't be taken so seriously
<START> my god this movie is awfully boring i am a big fan of gina <UNK> when i rented this movie i expected a romantic drama and some great performance from <UNK> <UNK> is great as always but she is not right actress for this role she is too good for <UNK> <UNK> the romance between <UNK> and <UNK> characters is too unconvincing and i absolutely hated <UNK> character a <UNK> <UNK> he is not charming in anyway in the movie how did dr lauren graham <UNK> is beyond my <UNK> maybe sean connery robert deniro or harrison ford would have done a better job on this role but they don't have the european ish looking i guess any way i was so bored <UNK> the movie if you are looking for a good gina <UNK> movie check out bound her best film so far if you are looking for a romantic film about a younger woman and an older man try some harrison ford or sean connery movies gina <UNK> is so underrated and she deserves better chance than this i wish her to make better choice in the future
<START> i think this movie got a low rating because it got judged by it's worst moments there is a <UNK> joke and an embarrassing nut scratching scene but apart from that there are actually quite a few moments that made me laugh out loud jason lee is performing some wonderfully subtle comedy in this movie and julia stiles manages to be pretty damn funny herself apart from that this movie behaves like most romantic comedies after about 40 minutes into it you know how it is going to end which is better than most of them where you already know after 5 minutes anyway better movies to watch but definitely not the worst pick cheers
<START> it looks to me as if the creators of the class of <UNK> 'em high wanted it to become a cult film but it ends up as any old high school b movie only <UNK> the satire feels totally overshadowed by the extremely <UNK> characters it's very un funny even for a turkey
<START> i was so disturbed by the real footage at the beginning of the film that i felt sick to my stomach and ended up <UNK> the movie off how any can give this film more than a rating of 1 <UNK> me i know that the intent of the movie is to shock but showing actual footage of a dog that had been skinned alive holding back vomit as i type please i shut it off after the scene with the <UNK> baby i had had my eyes covered most of the time up to that point no wonder this movie was found at the bargain bin in <UNK> i really have no desire to see any other movie by this uwe person anyone who enjoyed this needs therapy period
<START> very entertaining and a great cast as noted i'd like to add that bruce dern did a fine job also as is usually the case worth renting if you can find it which has proved difficult for me also note that the amazon link from this page currently goes to a different movie of the same name
<START> this <UNK> to 1933 germany looks hardly like a post wwii czech <UNK> oh sorry it is the czech <UNK> and it is 2003 how funny br br this is one of the most awful history movies in the nearest past <UNK> is a head higher than <UNK> and looks so damned good <UNK> looks like 40 when he just is 23 and the <UNK> always seems to look like <UNK> and the buildings folks even buildings have been young sometimes especially <UNK> were a lot of houses in germany nearly new the wwi does not reach german cities no <UNK> <UNK> then the <UNK> there have never been urban <UNK> around this building never and this may sound to you all like a miracle in the year 1933 the greater berlin fire <UNK> owns a lot of vehicles with <UNK> some even with <UNK> <UNK> but none with a hand <UNK> br br one last thing what kind of <UNK> castle was this at the final sequence for me this was a kind of <UNK> adventures in wonderland
<START> this movie is pretty awful but i have some interesting information about it br br it was filmed in 1976 at northern arizona university in <UNK> <UNK> as well as at <UNK> creek canyon near <UNK> <UNK> a good bulk of the extras in the film are then drama students from <UNK> i was a <UNK> there that year <UNK> in theatre but for some reason i didn't get involved with the production i did however know several people who did and can supply this rather odd fact br br there is a scene in this movie where two of the principals as part of their <UNK> ritual have to run naked into the woods they are seen from behind in the movie doing just that the thing is those aren't the actors at all but two guys i knew from the theatre department the identity of these stunt <UNK> will remain anonymous at least to this website unless they decide to um reveal themselves
<START> problem child is one of the <UNK> movies ever made it's not the worst though some people will disagree with me on that but it's not the best either it's about a <UNK> 7 year old boy who <UNK> comic havoc on a <UNK> couple john ritter amy <UNK> who <UNK> <UNK> him this film is too silly and unbelievable because i don't buy for one second that a child could act as <UNK> as the kid does in this film it's <UNK> and preposterous although i did laugh several times throughout i really don't know why but i can't recommend this film i know i'm being too kind to it if there is one positive thing about problem child is that it's better than the sequel which was just awful br br out of four
<START> this show made me feel physically sick and totally detached from british society as a whole it was <UNK> such as this and blue peter that <UNK> that there were are no class <UNK> in britain they'd always say things like go into your <UNK> and you may find this or go into your back garden tonight and what about us <UNK> working class kids who never never had a <UNK> and a back garden which was nothing more than a 1 <UNK> square of balcony on the <UNK> floor of a <UNK> block public service <UNK> yeah right and on top of that it was awfully depressing to see those stupid middle class up their own <UNK> kids mess about with bits of old plastic having <UNK> do me a favour and why don't you go and <UNK> your <UNK> or do a coke <UNK> on mama and <UNK> money you make me sick
<START> <UNK> ii the new order is just as good as david <UNK> classic <UNK> <UNK> was made in 1980 and <UNK> ii in 1991 so <UNK> an eleven year gap between the two movies the film captures the style of <UNK> which is a good thing it wouldn't be <UNK> without a head explosion so <UNK> ii has a head explosion scene that's just has gruesome as the first <UNK> ii the new order has some other imaginative gory scenes that are done well the plot to <UNK> ii the new order is a new take on the series since it has the <UNK> being used as a vigilante force for a police chief and a group of scientists until a young <UNK> named david <UNK> discovers he's being used and decides to get revenge br br <UNK> ii the new order is a great sequel to david <UNK> sci fi classic <UNK> and should be seen check this out 10 10
<START> in the process of trying to establish the <UNK> empathy with jake <UNK> <UNK> maguire the filmmakers <UNK> the north and the <UNK> <UNK> never <UNK> from the union and the union army was not an <UNK> force the <UNK> fought for <UNK> rights the right to own slaves <UNK> crooked <UNK> and judges and employ a political <UNK> system there's nothing noble in that the <UNK> could have easily traveled east and joined the <UNK> army br br it seems to me that the story has nothing to do with ambiguity when jake leaves the <UNK> it's not because he saw error in his way he certainly doesn't give himself over to the virtue of the cause of <UNK>
<START> this is a great film from reading other reviews i can see that i'm not the only one who shed a tear <UNK> <UNK> acted with such skill and conviction she made the ending heartfelt and memorable in the hands of a lesser actress her last scene would have seemed trite and corny one would never guess this film was done on a tight limited budget the cinematography is gorgeous and there are a number of big name actors the script is so wonderful i can see why they all wanted to be in it if you watch the long long list of credits at the end you'll see that half of hawaii pitched in to make this film happen and for good reason the soundtrack available on cd is absolutely beautiful and sets the mood throughout the film my only complaint is that i almost didn't want the film to end
<START> this really should have been a one star but there was so many clichés predictable twists seen it all before slasher flick parallels that i actually give it an extra star for the fact it made me laugh although this was never the directors intention im sure br br i don't often write comments about films they have to be either sensational or in this ones case really bad br br to be honest as soon as i saw jeff <UNK> in it i knew it was going to be poor as he has a unique nose for picking out the worst films br br somehow the farce of it all made me watch it all the way through possibly for the hilarious voice of mr t not <UNK> mr t but you'll know what i mean if you bother to watch this if you do watch it make sure you don't pay to see it this may have worked had they actually put intended comedy into it but im sure you'll find the odd laugh here and there at the farce of it all
<START> i saw <UNK> <UNK> what is it at the ann <UNK> film festival admittedly the film was at least <UNK> named because i got the distinct sense that even the writer director could provide no answer at the question and answer session after the screening mr glover said that the film was originally meant to be a short film to show the virtue of using actors with down syndrome however this is in itself not enough of a reason to create a film actors are in my opinion building <UNK> for a larger vision a larger vision that seemed muddled at best and absent at worst br br <UNK> glover also said that he wanted to address taboo subjects well he does do that but why the film seems to have no stance no reason for addressing anything does he feel these things shouldn't be taboo the film doesn't even give me an <UNK> of that taboo for the sake of taboo is not interesting it can't even afford to make the taboo disturbing or <UNK> on any level because he hasn't made the audience care in any way br br ignoring problems with the concept for a moment the thing that actually shocked me most was how poorly the film was put together the editing cinematography and other technical aspects seemed frequently to be extremely amateur glover said <UNK> 150 thousand dollars went into the movie and i feel that the money should have been spent on different <UNK> glover actually did some design himself i know i saw at least sound design in the credits the painted sets are okay not great but used poorly parts feel like a photographed stage play which would be fine if that went to any sort of purpose but in <UNK> hands it just feels sloppy other parts are filmed like a sort of home movie of inferior quality to a lot of the stuff i see first time filmmakers do on <UNK> br br perhaps the biggest problem with what is it is i can't even understand how seriously the film is to be taken there are some parts that feel like glover is screaming at you to think seriously at other points he seems off on his own little joke perhaps he meant for this to be ironic or meaningful in some way but i just felt that glover couldn't even get himself to give his film any sort of serious attention br br glover said he originally wanted it to be a short film if only it had been at <UNK> two minutes the film runs out of imagery and ideas in the first twenty and it is <UNK> if the ideas were <UNK> enough to claim that they were even there for that period of time
<START> i went to this movie expecting a <UNK> movie relating the effect the son of sam had on the society i didn't expect spike lee to force feed me more garbage on racial tension mob justice or the inability of the common citizen to make a choice under pressure by peers lee has presented an extreme opinion br br the entire movie could have been more effective if in a 90 min format with more focus less <UNK> sub plots br br don't even bother renting the video unless you <UNK> enjoy spike lee in such a case the theatre is worth it this is not an <UNK> movie
<START> the screen writing is so dumb it pains me to have wasted 2 hours of my life i'll never get back where have i heard this before the acting is so so things change often enough to keep you watching and waiting for something gruesome to happen nevertheless there isn't a single original thing in this movie while the first cube was a nerdy horror movie which didn't make a whole lot of sense in the end cube zero has picked up on that and tries to <UNK> exactly the same story except this time it makes an obnoxious point of trying to <UNK> feed explanations for every detail that the first movie didn't answer the comic thing is the director <UNK> the exact scenes of the first movie that were somewhat weird and tries to explain them but the scenes are just copied over there is no <UNK> whatsoever this script is <UNK> pointless i can imagine it being written by some half wit 15 year old with a baseball cap and a pack of beer for a class project the best part is in the end they <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> guy and he becomes the retarded fellow in the first movie and you see him when they find him <UNK> room is green ' in cube 1997 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> what a twist first of all what about if you haven't seen the first one this doesn't make any sense you <UNK> director oh another great idea instead of the numbers to identify x y z <UNK> of the room cube 1997 this time it is 3 letters each one giving one of 26 possible <UNK> values duh except now <UNK> don't make much sense anymore so he lets the letters disappear before anybody can use them i want my money back br br i guess i had to write this down since there are just so many bad inconsistent or just stupid ideas in this movie directors writers should be required to possess some talent
<START> as a single woman over 40 i found this film extremely insulting and <UNK> to single women over 40 not to mention every other woman of any age it was a sad pathetic attempt by a man to write and direct a chick flick and it failed miserably andy mcdowell isn't much of an actress to begin with but given the non existent plot i hate to even refer to it as a plot in this she didn't have a chance there was no character development no reason to feel sympathy empathy for any of the characters and no attempt to make the film in any way realistic or believable and then there's the obligatory male fantasy of an attractive straight woman suddenly deciding to give <UNK> a try please br br not only do i wish i could get my money back for the dvd rental i also want those <UNK> minutes of my life back what a ripoff
<START> love it or <UNK> it it's hard to not find warren <UNK> take on dick tracy the 1990 film adaptation of <UNK> <UNK> famous comic strip anything short of a genre classic superhero films have been coming out of the <UNK> in recent years and may soon become a genre all on its own br br <UNK> film <UNK> uses <UNK> source material to full effect shooting in all six of the <UNK> primary colors and thus giving this unique yet familiar world of trigger happy mutant gangsters and loose seductive women a lush visual style and tone br br it can be stated that the film's strong visual <UNK> drastically short change the characters and their acting abilities which i don't think can be any further from the truth br br dick tracy <UNK> in its look and ghastly characters and beatty himself who plays the <UNK> and <UNK> detective of the title is appropriately stoic and ready to bust the bad guys at any and all costs br br other than the visual treats and oscar winning makeup there is a plot and big boy <UNK> al pacino deliciously over the top in an oscar nominated performance seeks to eliminate tracy in one well planned move but also seeks to gain control of all criminal action in the city by <UNK> all the <UNK> gangs under him br br tracy meanwhile is <UNK> his relationship with tess <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who as her name would have it remains <UNK> by his side and cares for the kid charlie <UNK> who eventually finds a father figure to look up to in our crime <UNK> hero <UNK> <UNK> to tess is tested by the <UNK> advances of breathless <UNK> madonna who is also big boy's main squeeze at the same time that all of this is going down things become <UNK> when a new criminal figure arrives in town and decides to play both sides against the middle br br the performances are good as <UNK> focus on the strained and romantic relationships between each of the leads becomes the center of the material as opposed to just <UNK> on pointless action and special effects pacino <UNK> <UNK> up the scenery in a role that's truly standout from the rest br br dick tracy is one of the best and most overlooked of the comic book movie genre i think that if <UNK> <UNK> was still alive he would be proud of warren <UNK> take on his beloved crime fighting detective br br 8 10
<START> some people loved the <UNK> and others hated it frequently walking out in the middle reactions to eddie izzard aren't likely to be that extreme if you can handle a <UNK> comedian who says he likes girls and has a <UNK> that makes shall we say enough use of the f word that his program would be one long <UNK> if presented on network television many of <UNK> fans are so devoted that they see no flaws whatsoever in his performances on the other hand i thought this show was occasionally <UNK> than <UNK> chest but also more often than not funny and in spots absolutely hilarious he has a way of connecting references from routines early in the show to his later routines he's not a story <UNK> he's not a joke maker he's not a frenetic <UNK> like robin williams he plays around with ideas some of which work and some of which a routine with the san francisco cable car and <UNK> for instance are completely unfunny he has a way however of moving <UNK> past the <UNK> routines and <UNK> the ones that connect i gave this performance a 7 and might be <UNK> to raise it to an 8 but a 10 no way
<START> oh man how low serials had fallen as by <UNK> this dull thing is precisely the kind of serial that annoyed annie <UNK> from misery not only the heroes escape the traps by adding scenes that weren't there in the previous chapter and that couldn't possibly be there tell me that when the baddies blow up the plain in episode 7 to 8 they wouldn't see the characters jump but i think this serial has the world's record of stock footage i mean most of it is stock footage and not just from another serials apparently all the flying sequences come from king of the rocket men and the cool <UNK> rocks scenes of episode 2 to 3 is from adventures of captain marvel but from itself the whole trip to the moon sequence which is probably the <UNK> ever it's 30 seconds long and the characters never seem to leave <UNK> atmosphere from episode 1 is repeated in episode 8 and episode 10 is all scenes from previous episodes ever wondered why mst3k never did episodes 10 11 and 12 well they had to stop after 9 so they didn't have to do the whole thing again br br don't get me started on the science factor prepare to see the <UNK> moon ever and moon men that can not breathe on their own world what were they smoking br br and if this is not enough it's too talky and the stunts usually the best thing in serials are few and far visually wise am i the only one who thinks that <UNK> <UNK> bullet shaped or is it <UNK> shaped helmet is totally ridiculous looking the <UNK> was way <UNK> no matter how bad that movie was and man was it awful the tank like vehicle isn't much better it looks like a bunch of kids made it for halloween the only positive thing i can think of about it is that the actor who plays the hero is <UNK> instead of the usual muscular hunk hey everybody has the right to be an hero but then he's so unappealing br br not even worth watching for <UNK> sake see captain marvel instead 2 10 br br btw check out the memorable quotes section for a real women's <UNK> pearl
<START> i meant that in a good way believe me true to life it ain't the whole <UNK> thing gets kinda thick but you do enjoy the cast here flynn smith bond watson <UNK> etc all good i also liked seeing mike <UNK> of course he played a boxer what else typical forties flick <UNK> w familiar faces and fast paced scenes one after the other br br flynn is fine as gentleman jim you never get past a 1 dimensional look at him or the rest here i suppose but it's okay it's a cartoon and meant to please that's all the boxing scenes were pretty good ward <UNK> vaudeville <UNK> act a riot and you <UNK> like seeing all those <UNK> wielding <UNK> come racing into the scene a couple of times br br really <UNK> fun flynn was on a roll at that time and it's clear to see why audiences loved him br br outta
<START> this was an <UNK> pick up for me from the local video store don't make the same mistake i did this movie is tedious <UNK> acted and generally boring the dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly poorly written and delivered i <UNK> at every scene they shared dennis hopper makes a few sparse appearances and is his usual disjointed self his role was clearly not a stretch for him and although the movie is supposedly set in puerto rico it feels a lot more like a hollywood movie lot all of the main characters are <UNK> and several tend to speak english with pseudo irish accents odd anyway when you see this one on the shelf of your local video store keep walking
<START> this movie was <UNK> i was so emotionally <UNK> in every single character that the <UNK> biggest antagonist was in fact myself i played it beautifully throughout promising myself i would walk away but only drinking another beer hoping it would auto magically <UNK> into something engrossing along the way even in this state i couldn't help but notice that <UNK> acting was as flimsy as <UNK> paper his obsessive dedication to his job was <UNK> done as well as his one night <UNK> after the failure of his own idiot standards burt came on the screen as a general that's right a general who wears too much makeup i fell into a <UNK> fast <UNK> to rival <UNK> except mine was real and i <UNK> my toe <UNK> <UNK> my <UNK> toe
<START> i'm not a big fan of <UNK> <UNK> at the best of times a few have been quite good check of dream for an <UNK> but this one is just more of the same but less br br with a running time of <UNK> i expect more than 1 laugh every <UNK> the only real belly laugh are when male strangers and friends <UNK> help out lee's character br br all i can say is avoid i <UNK> there is at least 10 other movies on the shelf that deserve you br br 3 of out 10 and only <UNK> i'm a big lee fan
<START> there's one line that makes it worth to rent for angel fans everyone else this is just a very bad horror flick the female characters are typical horror movies females they are wooden annoying and dumb you are glad when they are killed off long live the strong female character in a horror movie
<START> we laughed our heads off this script is so incredible you either <UNK> to <UNK> or go to sleep br br my dad was a sea captain for 30 years he could not believe his eyes when he saw the movie br br during his experience as an officer he once claimed command over the ship the captain drunk 3 <UNK> of <UNK> daily and sorry s t on his desk of course this was not on a nuclear mission br br for instance the fire in the kitchen fire is the most important thing on any ship nuclear or not to give a <UNK> at that time is just hollywood script when a captain is put under arrest he is under arrest you take all his keys and open the safe where the guns are kept this is <UNK> within minutes in a well <UNK> room he cannot escape it's just like in prison br br funny thing is my dad also had a dog on board however we see how hackman let him pee in the control room this is not done ever my dad <UNK> all the mess the dog made wherever he was br br hackman and washington make the three stars this movie is credited for all the rest is <UNK> t br br when we do know that 23 people were still alive on the <UNK> this film gets an extra dimension br br if you want to see a real thriller about a submarine rent <UNK> boat br br
<START> certain dvd's possess me until i just have to go out and buy it this was one of those movies like many on here i remember seeing it as a child and loved it i never knew there were scenes and musical numbers that were cut so i was intrigued to see what they might be i will agree that the <UNK> road sequence is now a tad long as is the soccer game but other than that i found no <UNK> with the remaining scenes that were put back in their <UNK> place perhaps disney should have had the original version which is the restored version on one side with the restored version on the flip side then people could choose what they wanted to view all in all it's still an entertaining movie that still manages to <UNK> some of my childhood memories
<START> by <UNK> <UNK> br br a gang of crooks the perfect plan it all goes wrong they're in trouble the police are outside they're <UNK> what are they gonna do now br br sound familiar br br the movie seems like it's trying to be a combination of the acting <UNK> the indie film and the theater br br it's the kind of things that actors love it's kind of like a <UNK> or a play because it mostly consists of tight focusing on the actors acting acting angry tense scared <UNK> scheming planning giving the performers a lot of free range to really ham it all up br br a trio of crooks one leader one <UNK> one brother come up with a big heist scheme and a monkey <UNK> is thrown into the works to top things off there's a bit of a <UNK> <UNK> and one of the crooks in <UNK> through the back of the <UNK> br br the cops are on their tail and they stumble into a bar named <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> last chance br br spacey as a director tries to keep the focus on the actors' performances and delivery of <UNK> he pans over to a bright passion red cigarette ad of a smoking and <UNK> bogart and he keeps all the violence off screen really br br i think that was a mistake focusing on the intensity and gruesome violent scenes would have given the movie some edge br br the problem with the movie is that it moves too slow and suffers from <UNK> in almost every role matt dillon <UNK> cowboy and wild things seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang br br gary <UNK> seems to brooding and deep in thought to be a <UNK> tag along with these guys and joe <UNK> is effective as the traditional routine foul swearing mad dog police lieutenant who's all thumbs but he isn't given anything to really do here br br william <UNK> is the only actor who is believable in his role as a brainless <UNK> who just wants to <UNK> blood br br and the crooks are in a tense situation where they either go to jail or they try to think of some way out of this br br spacey lacks the ability to create a lot of tension and keep it going the characters are mostly <UNK> away trying to think of a plan and they're to calm and too <UNK> there's even a scene where the crooks are playing pool with a whole <UNK> of armed cops right outside ready to strike at one point one of the crooks even call the police who are right outside the bar oh brother oh bother br br these cops are going to either blow them away or going to lock them up shouldn't the <UNK> up crooks be a little scared a little uneasy meanwhile all the real action is happening inside br br someone <UNK> out a gun a baseball bat which leads to an ugly confrontation off screen and there's one more <UNK> that happens that's well kinda sad but br br faye <UNK> also should have spent more time with a <UNK> coach <UNK> on her new orleans accent <UNK> <UNK> is fine in a smaller part br br a cop listening in reaches for a pack of matches at the absolute worst time is a nice look and so is a scene where someone goes right through the rear <UNK> br br the <UNK> is obviously trying to go for a david mamet approach and it's as <UNK> but never as realistic or as insightful br br the movie feels like too much of what it really is a really low budget movie with an actor behind the camera for the first time directing other actors from a script that's not bad but needs a few more re writes spacey shows he's not a terrible director but he lacks a sort of feel for <UNK> a movie and it feels like he's just filming actors act br br these actors are all talented and could work with the material but they all feel out of place as i said before the movie really suffers from <UNK> br br i don't mean that the wrong actors were cast i think they found just the right cast but placed them in all the wrong roles i think switching some of the roles would've helped immensely br br having veteran mob actor joe <UNK> play the leader of the pack gary <UNK> as the angry police lieutenant outside on his <UNK> giving orders and <UNK> at his troops keeping <UNK> in his <UNK> <UNK> part and matt <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> that would have been a big improvement br br when some actors direct it works they can even win oscars for it but a lot of the time when actors direct they have a tendency to just focus on the performances just shoot the actors acting br br sometimes it works but they need a good showcase for it an excuse for it br br hostage situations are all pretty much the same in real life just like coming of age stories so it's only natural that movies about them will go from point a to point b as well br br there are a few really great entries into this genre ' spacey himself appeared in a similar movie about hostage situations the <UNK> br br this certainly won't become a cult classic let alone one of <UNK> 100 still it does have a few nice moments and personal touches but in the end it's instantly forgettable and the kind of movie that would play best on regular tv it's just not worth going out of your way to see br br i give a 3 out of 10 br br <UNK> other directorial credit beyond the sea was reportedly a better effort hmmm maybe it's true you need to fail before you succeed br br by <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i would like to know why john <UNK> left the show and how did he die off the show again i couldn't relate to everything but sometimes they hit home with the problems they were facing by the way did they ever make it out of the ghetto i think the episode with the black jesus was my favorite we got to see them experience a few good times something they didn't have very often i wish they would bring the show back during the daytime so people can actually stay up to watch i don't think a movie or a new show would work especially without the original cast they are really what made good times <UNK> these are my questions and comments thank you
<START> this film is about a man's life going wrong his business is failing and he cannot <UNK> his wife despite multiple attempts br br the plot is complete chaos it simply does not make sense in fact nothing in the film makes sense the story is so poorly told that i simply could not understand it it is a shame because the sets and costumes are done well and are visually stimulating enough the shots are well composed throughout the film however these redeeming features still cannot make up for the bad plot and poor story telling i am amazed by the big names who agreed to star in this film it is such a waste of their talents this film is very bad avoid it
<START> saw this in the theater in <UNK> and fell out of my chair laughing more than once <UNK> what do you know about <UNK> <UNK> he's the best damn baseball player who ever lived br br you know how it's going to end but it has a great time getting there the training scenes are very funny but the best scene may be the one when jack and reno are attempting to watch the <UNK> v <UNK> monday night football game while attempting a make up dinner with their wives br br williams and russell seem to have a lot of fun with this one and it's too bad that it's overlooked as a top notch comedy
<START> i like this movie a lot but it's a fact that you cannot understand it unless you're from the ex <UNK> most of the actors are now dead and those were the best actors in ex <UNK> i appreciate that this movie is now on <UNK> and i can have it in my collection <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br all of this was ex <UNK> a melting pot of the <UNK> nations it could be a dream land if <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and other <UNK> wouldn't poison the <UNK> mind with their sick ideas
<START> the <UNK> man is a good film that has a good cast which includes william hurt <UNK> <UNK> peter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> michael brandon <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> arthur <UNK> and christopher <UNK> the acting by all of these actors is very good hurt and <UNK> are really excellent in this film i thought that they performed good the thrills is really good and some of it is surprising the movie is filmed very good the music is good the film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end this is a very good and thrilling film if you like william hurt <UNK> <UNK> peter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> michael brandon <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> arthur <UNK> christopher <UNK> the rest of the cast in the film <UNK> thrillers dramas and interesting films then i strongly recommend you to see this film today
<START> thankfully as a student i have been able to watch <UNK> murder for a number of years now it is basically about a doctor who <UNK> murders with the help of his <UNK> son a young doctor and a <UNK> <UNK> provided 8 seasons of exceptional entertainment what made it different from the many other cop shows and worth watching many times over was its cast and quality of writing the main cast gave good performances and dick van <UNK> entertainer roots <UNK> through with the use of magic dance and humor the best aspects of <UNK> was the fast pace witty scripts and of course the toe <UNK> score sadly it has been unfairly compared to murder she wrote <UNK> is far superior <UNK> more difficult mysteries to solve and more variety now it is gone tv is a worse place gone are the days of <UNK> family friendly cop shows now there is just depressing <UNK> ones
<START> what can i say about seven pounds well i watched on a flight from seattle to tokyo and as that flight was long and boring the movie definitely didn't help will smith's character ben thomas is almost completely unlikable even with his redemption in the end the movie's two hour plus run time wastes most of the screen time with random garbage that just strings the plot along as slow as possible in the movies defense rosario <UNK> character adds a little life to the film although not much i don't understand how anyone could actually cry during this film when all i wanted to do was turn it off also will smith kills himself with a <UNK> at the ended proving that killing yourself with a <UNK> is the stupidest way to die
<START> i am puerto <UNK> and this is one of the worst documentary of i've ever seen of any type you can see that the people on it are clueless they don't know much about puerto rico and its culture they claim to be puerto <UNK> because they are from puerto <UNK> <UNK> but they probably know less than others who are not from there you can see while they are talking that they are <UNK> themselves if you would like to see a real and i mean a real genuine documentary from puerto rico then you must see <UNK> puerto rico that's a serious real documentary not like this piece of junk <UNK> <UNK> based this documentary on herself i thought it was suppose to be about puerto <UNK> they keep repeating i didn't know well that's about the only thing they got right on this so called documentary i hate to see such a piece of garbage being done using the name of the island it brings down the standards
<START> i saw this in detroit in what must have been its original run i literally rolled into the <UNK> of the theater it was that funny i haven't seen it since but would love to where do you get a copy anybody saying anything about it being dated or overdone are for my money just a bunch of <UNK> each skit is either <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> hilarious each one there is not a weak one included the opening sequence for instance which parodies 2001 features gorilla go go dancers with <UNK> breasts <UNK> would have filmed it had he the wicked wit if you come to this film with an open mind and a <UNK> <UNK> heart you'll <UNK> it right into your very best list
<START> for anyone who has seen and fallen in love with the stage musical a chorus line the movie is a shoddy substitute not only are songs cut but unnecessary plot twists added new dance sequences choreographed and let's face it richard attenborough just doesn't know how to film dancers br br <UNK> michael <UNK> a chorus line was just that michael bennett his idea his choreography his direction his gift to broadway and the rest of the world it was two hours of hard hitting in your face realism that really made you feel for these boys and girls the movie however lacks empathy and depth the actors look like they are <UNK> for a chorus line rather than actually <UNK> every move every line of dialogue seems so <UNK> and planned michael douglas especially as <UNK> is too in control for us to believe that he is this extraordinarily bitchy choreographer even when he throws his temper <UNK> you never quite believe him because every gesture every <UNK> word every nuance is so obviously <UNK> and as for him not dancing kevin kline <UNK> for the role of <UNK> on broadway michael bennett loved his reading but kline couldn't dance and ultimately lost the part how i wish they had done the same for douglas a chorus line is supposed to be a show about <UNK> and aside from a few recognizable faces <UNK> <UNK> who played cassie on broadway as sheila and <UNK> alexander of tv's <UNK> as one of the many <UNK> dancers you're not supposed to know any of these people because you do know these people having a star in any of the roles is a terrible decision when you focus on michael douglas and his <UNK> instead of on the girls and boys on the line and their stories you lose something br br it is truly unfortunate that the best sequence in the show montage hello twelve hello thirteen hello love is cut drastically to make way for a terrible new song entitled surprise surprise that surprisingly received a nomination at the oscars <UNK> mirror dance has a new song and <UNK> boring choreography one wonders why they bothered to shoot a movie version at all if they were going to mess with a working formula this much br br for fans of musical theatre and those who enjoyed the stage version this movie is a sad mockery of everything they <UNK> and loved for those who never got to see the original production either on broadway or on tour this movie is the only reference they will have to go by and they'll have to wonder just how it got to be the longest running musical in broadway history until a little show called cats <UNK> it in the late 1990's but that is a different story and don't even get me started there
<START> strange enough all the previous comments merely described the beginning and left the details over i feel a necessity to confirm that this is a family work since <UNK> <UNK> was also robert <UNK> wife and the excellent jazz music was written by <UNK> director's father <UNK> under these circumstances no wonder it was a really good thriller seen when <UNK> and immediately identified with the music the suspense was flawless and <UNK> throughout until the end robert <UNK> at the time one of the best european players managed to <UNK> himself also as a top screen and stage director he's still putting up great stage shows with a <UNK> for religious subjects harry <UNK> paris france
<START> first of all this film is <UNK> slow moving and i can see most viewers losing patience with it altogether in the first thirty minutes br br the film's subject matter was one i think would form the basis of an excellent film what was most lacking here was a plot that would advance the underlying themes br br it's unfortunate because in the hands of a writer like say <UNK> wilson i think symbolism like a mountain lion <UNK> a school campus could take on great tragic proportions without being heavy handed br br i think with a good script supporting the film the same filmmaker with the same tastes and even with the same actors who didn't really even get a chance to impress me might have been able to present a meaningful and touching depiction of the pains and struggles that a boy goes through when he develops a powerful crush on an older boy that he <UNK> br br however i'm sorry to say that without this foundation and armed with a vague dull witted and vastly uninteresting script without any sort of plot in sight and lacking any sort of sensible structure for example after viewing it i believe you will find that you cannot point to climactic scenes and instead will find yourself <UNK> well maybe that scene or that one were <UNK> the result is 95 minutes of tedium br br without a good plot we never get terribly interested in any of the characters their trials and difficulties are simply dull and boring br br without a good plot dramatic devices and <UNK> directorial liberties become puzzling and confusing rather than <UNK> to the story line i never really could believe for example the creation of <UNK> and i think that most viewers would be utterly <UNK> by the conventional way in which her <UNK> calls were filmed br br as the film stands i'm afraid it's one i cannot recommend at all what i can never understand is why a film like this one isn't re made by an <UNK> film maker instead of all the mediocre remakes of films that were <UNK> good in the first release all it needs is a good script written by good writers and i think this film could be easily turned into an unforgettable classic about an aspect of male coming of age that is rarely treated in drama all the elements that were so tedious and seemed so <UNK> in the film the messages written on the boy's belly the <UNK> scenes the television screen fantasies could become rich if <UNK> with a good storyline br br i see in quite a few comments that people are talking of this film as somehow being about a gay subject and i think that's mistaken obviously the crush depicted is that of a newly <UNK> boy on an older adolescent boy but the character of logan is far too young to have settled on any particular sexual choices and indeed in his depicted masturbation fantasies we see all sorts of <UNK> sexual and non sexual as we would expect in a very young boy like him i believe <UNK> such as <UNK> are common among male <UNK> who grow up to have a decided <UNK> for female sex partners
<START> <UNK> movie about a couple of people in <UNK> during a <UNK> this kind of movie has been done more often and most of all better the stories don't really have anything to do with each other apart from the pathetic finale <UNK> are <UNK> ugly flesh unpleasant people and a movie that goes on way too long without really making a point ultra realistic hardly boring indeed not even gorgeous <UNK> <UNK> can save this one 3 10
<START> good movie good music good background and an acceptable plot but the main point again as his movies tend to be the man is the best actor in <UNK> and can turn dust into gold <UNK> <UNK> this may be his second best performance after <UNK> others may disagree although other movies are not far behind one man that will never ever disappoint you br br good movie although i think <UNK> was a luxury this movie could have done without you can see in his movies others try very hard to reach his heights and act out of their <UNK> but this man is really something <UNK> br br the movie is cool the music and direction is excellent plot a bit thin but the screen play and dialog again very good a must watch
<START> most <UNK> consider this to be the best stooges short bar none and they're right curly is a scream dressed up in drag as <UNK> <UNK> and moe and larry are in top form as <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> gusto respectively christine <UNK> beautiful operatic voice is given full <UNK> she actually was a trained opera singer and it's wonderful the great gino <UNK> is hilarious as a pompous italian singer <UNK> by the stooges at a society party some truly funny gags good direction and very tight editing make this rise to the very top of the <UNK> prolific <UNK> what's even more amazing is that curly was having severe health problems at the time and in several of the shorts he made during this period you can see that he is obviously ill his timing is way off he speaks very slowly and <UNK> and has trouble getting around fortunately his health was in an <UNK> when he made this film and it shows classic <UNK> comedy and enjoyed by even non <UNK> fans i had a girlfriend who couldn't stand the stooges but even she laughed at this one a must see
<START> how you could say that <UNK> with its complex narrative dealing with a <UNK> of issues is a small tv idea is beyond me besides i can think of many films that have a small tv idea in their plots your obvious dislike of the tv industry sue smith has failed to rise above her television background is confusing particularly as you are having such a great time working in tv if only we could all be so talented as ms smith no i am not a friend or relative <UNK> award winning brides of christ road from <UNK> etc all made for tv come to think of it what about those other small tv ideas like against the wind <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> of justice blue murder water under the bridge etc i think <UNK> is a good entertaining film which had me interested and most of my friends as well from start to finish it is far from flawless yet i think it is among the best australian films i have seen over the last couple of years who knows with a few more viewings there's so much to think about it might just be up there with classics like the year my voice broke the devil's <UNK> i really did enjoy this film much more than <UNK> and three dollars these films i think had their moments surreal atmospheric realistic and dealing with important contemporary issues but as for sheer entertainment for mr and mrs average movie goer and me it was very ordinary if not boring when i go to a movie i am always conscious of the audience's reaction to a film through in cinemas reactions and <UNK> conversations in the <UNK> and <UNK> some came out of <UNK> shaking their heads some with negative criticisms but many seemed to have enjoyed the experience
<START> this movie is not just bad not just corny it is repulsive something about daphne about the creepy call girl about the whole damn and i use the word literally film <UNK> a <UNK> that would offend a <UNK> mistress this film makes my skin crawl makes me regret having <UNK> organs and makes me feel <UNK> br br one of the things that bothers me most about this movie is that they used such a good concept a creature that makes fantasies with disastrous results rather than the cliché worst nightmare and the overdone twisted wish is a truly fascinating film idea br br thought the reason why hobgoblins need to be killed before day is that they are attracted to bright lights during the day bright lights don't show up well so they could go anywhere br br count the hobgoblins four hobgoblins drive out of the film studio and yet at least nine of the <UNK> <UNK> toys are killed throughout the course of the movie br br discussion question if you had a <UNK> demanding <UNK> girlfriend would you enter garden tool combat with a military <UNK> explain
<START> i've read a lot of comments about the film and how it's so hard for people to believe that it is a sequel to henry fool and even though it technically is i think that fay grim needs to be looked at as an entirely different film just because it is the sequel doesn't mean that it has to be a direct <UNK> of the first and i enjoyed that so much about it the whole point of the film was to change direction from the first which makes sense because the movie isn't called henry fool 2 it's fay grim all that aside the film i thought was so well made and thought out that it actually surprised me i was expecting to rent another nearly released straight to video film and have to endure 2 hours of bad editing and an almost hard to follow story line aka <UNK> last direct to video feature the oh in <UNK> but this was so surprisingly well focused that it almost doesn't seem so which i absolutely loved there are so many nuances in the film making and writing that i <UNK> to see in films but never do the cinematography was brilliant due to it's simplicity and truly making the film seem <UNK> throughout in terms of setting the writing was so well put together as well whoever said this movie isn't as witty as henry fool needs to watch again and actually listen i almost can't even begin to explain how actually hilarious it was and <UNK> and well parker posey who could complain the scene in which fool and <UNK> were talking in the dark was so captivating and emotional and i thought the spy <UNK> throughout the film was just so hilarious and spot on in <UNK> because i do agree that at times during you kind of felt lost the main thing that struck me so <UNK> about the film and i believe the point of the film was <UNK> love and <UNK> about fool which was so endearing and turned yes very quickly from denial to outright passion the last five minutes of the film were perfect obviously there were things that weren't excellent but nothing is perfect some of the acting was poor and at times i did think that some of the new back story and dialogue about terrorism got a little hard to follow and out of hand but in the end you got it and didn't even mind that at the time it may have slipped from your <UNK> this may also have to do with <UNK> tendency to talk extremely fast on the whole i would say that it was probably one of the best films i've seen this year <UNK> pleasing clever and witty writing performances that were so impressive i now have gained new respect for some of the actors and a truly touching film and don't forget a complete departure from fool which was the point
<START> i can't believe i've just spent one and a half hours watching such a weak film if there is only one film you have to miss this is the one br br robert is a teenager whose father's died recently so he starts hanging out with some local anti social teenagers and using drugs all these make him <UNK> more violent and at last such <UNK> explodes br br the first thing is that i don't think i can find any sense or trace of great ecstasy in this film not in any single character if the director considers what i saw in the last couple of minutes as great ecstasy i have to say that that's not even close br br the use of cinematography is also not mature most of the time i couldn't see any facial expressions from the actors and i didn't feel the body language was sufficient enough to make an impact maybe the crew was just so tired that they fixed the camera there to include everything in the settings everybody happy except the audience br br the plot is particularly weak there are a lot of unrelated scenes and talking which might be supposed to be related but they are really so random that you can never pull them all together perhaps unless you're the one who wrote them br br in the one and a half hour you may find less than 5 minutes of real acting and all other time there are just people walking talking and moving so i really can't comment on acting here br br nice choice of music in the last couple of minutes though maybe this is the only good thing br br i have never given a film a 1 but this film certainly deserves it at least you laugh when you watch scary movies this is a film about when a failed attempt to portray troubled teenagers meets extremely disturbed audience hope you fall into neither group
<START> wow and i thought that any steven segal movie was bad every time i thought that the movie couldn't get worse it proved me wrong the story was good but the actors couldn't carry it off also they made a lot of mistakes on how proper <UNK> <UNK> are done for instance you don't handle <UNK> <UNK> they are <UNK> and <UNK> for the biggest crime in casting was the <UNK> girl she is a weak actress and i felt that her acting really made the movie less realistic then it already was the whole concept of the knights <UNK> being underground all these years seemed pretty stupid to me i like the idea of how they disappeared and stuff so that almost seemed depressing i thought that the characters <UNK> explained well enough you didn't find out much background and that made it harder to relate to them
<START> this movie has taken a lot of stick it was <UNK> by critics when it came out and was blamed for <UNK> nicolas <UNK> career the thing i don't think people get is that it's not meant to be an epic oscar <UNK> of a movie it's just some brilliant <UNK> buster action at its best fast cars quick editing and a great soundtrack it does exactly what it says on the tin also for anyone who likes cars its a pure treat it has everything <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> and lets not forget <UNK> i think you'd be hard pushed to find a better action movie and personally a better movie at all then again maybe that's just me
<START> anchors aweigh is the product of the classic mgm musical production unit and on the whole the film is every enjoyable  good music by <UNK> <UNK> and others excellent dancing by gene kelly and even a passable job by frank sinatra and a funny well paced script the only major element i would criticize would be the casting of kathryn grayson whose presence in a film always means the audience will be subjected to endless pseudo operatic <UNK> from the <UNK> miss br br kelly plays a naval <UNK> named joseph brady a man with a <UNK> reputation around the ship as a lover but whose <UNK> charms are constantly being subdued by the presence of his less <UNK> friend with the improbable middle american name of clarence sinatra upon receiving 3 days of shore leave for saving <UNK> life joe reluctantly agrees to help clarence find a girl based on the dubious premise that he owes him something for saving his life they are <UNK> by a policeman <UNK> <UNK> who needs them to help <UNK> a <UNK> young boy dean <UNK> who wants to join the navy into returning home to aunt susan grayson at first it is clarence who is interested in <UNK> aunt susan but eventually kelly's character emerges as the more likely candidate br br there are several standout musical scenes but nothing to come close to kelly's more famous work in films like <UNK> in the rain and american in paris the closest we get is a <UNK> sequence with kelly's character in a fantasy sequence dancing with jerry the mouse from tom and jerry although he seems to be closer in size to a dog or cat here than to a mouse it's a startling sequence for its time but doesn't have enough complexity or emotion to really stand the test of time i actually enjoyed the parts of the sequence that took place prior to the animation where kelly was using semi <UNK> moves to emphasize the transition into the fantasy world and where we see him dance down a tunnel that looks like something right out of alice in wonderland br br eventually the characters find their way to <UNK> favorite bar a somewhat <UNK> mexican restaurant bar in <UNK> there the <UNK> happily allow ms grayson to <UNK> her <UNK> with abandon and the management becomes very excited at the opportunity that clarence and joe have extended for her to sing with their friend jose iturbi playing himself with a light humorous touch of course they've never met their friend iturbi and they spend much of the film's length trying to reach him in an amusing scene sinatra's character meets iturbi but mistakes him for a piano <UNK> and <UNK> him to abandon <UNK> <UNK> and try a professional career <UNK> into the studio and the hollywood bowl where iturbi is <UNK> a surreal <UNK> comprised of dozens of young piano players  you haven't seen anything like this outside of 1000 fingers of dr t iturbi himself is a kind of a god figure in the story  he represents the opportunity for salvation from the <UNK> of <UNK> work and the possibility for fame and artistic achievement for the heroine everyone is 100 sure that as soon as mr iturbi so much as hears ms grayson her operatic career will be a reality the 3 primary characters are desperate to reach him and they think of him as some kind of remote and distant <UNK> figure  a lot of the film's charm and humor comes from the contrast of this perception to the very down to earth real mannerisms of the <UNK> and speaking of <UNK> <UNK> to the film he also provides a very stimulating musical moment with his <UNK> interpretation of <UNK> <UNK> br br when all is said and done this is a film that nobody who enjoys musicals will want to miss the majority of the music was written for this film a nice contrast to recycled <UNK> for other kelly <UNK> like rain and american kelly is still at his early peak adventurous and <UNK> in both his dances and his interpretation of the character sinatra's voice was never in better form and he rarely had better songs to sing <UNK> is a charming addition to the clan and <UNK> character is endearing when she isn't <UNK> on stage iturbi adds that well grounded but sophisticated tone that perfectly matches the atmosphere and style of the classic era mgm musical this is one of the better ones
<START> i saw the <UNK> m showing and i must say that this movie was nothing special although i did not leave the theater wanting my time back as i don't actually pay for movies anymore i didn't really find any redeeming qualities br br there were a few lines and such that made me chuckle but mostly the film seemed to consist of rampant fan service to the younger in mind more than age as this film is rated r male audience the fan service seemed out of place and rather distracting as well i know you all want to hear samuel l say his infamous line but let's be honest it's a whole lot of hype for very little pay off the only truly horrible part of the film was the cg which looked very <UNK> and did not <UNK> well with the live action on the screen br br now i am a reasonable man i knew going into the theater that i wasn't going to be seeing <UNK> and i am at least thankful that this film is an original <UNK> inane idea and not some re make or franchise spin off however to be honest if you are not a part of the cult following you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere and seeing the film either in a second run theater in a few weeks or renting it in a few months
<START> this <UNK> film stars and was directed and written by orson welles with a funky irish accent and also stars the gorgeous rita hayworth with less appealing short blonde hair so i've hung out with orson before in touch of evil and citizen kane and the third man etc but this was my first rita hayworth interaction our first meeting went well she does a superb job playing the frightened <UNK> elsa married to a crippled millionaire lawyer mike welles and elsa fall for each other he wants to run away with her she doesn't know if she can live without the things money can buy elsa her husband and his partner <UNK> and bite just like the sharks mike describes attacking each other and his <UNK> proves just too true several twists and turns follow in this murder mystery as we come to the climax in the fun house think the ending shootout in the man with the golden gun which borrowed heavily from this scene i wasn't sure who the murderer was until the end br br this movie is like <UNK> in <UNK> and <UNK> the dish centers on the sea it is subtle sour and <UNK> all to great effect these might not be the best fresh <UNK> but good quality frozen <UNK> from <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> adds to the <UNK> of the pink <UNK> as you fill up on a healthy but filling alternative to more mundane common fare 7 10 http <UNK> <UNK> com <UNK>
<START> now for all of the <UNK> buffs out there this film may not rank high on your list of things to see but if you know anything about plot development profound truth and the intentions that this film the series had you'd understand my p o v br br granted the <UNK> of the film are <UNK> of the writer who cannot be expected to know what will happen in the end but the film is <UNK> accurate and <UNK> scares viewers into thinking about what may be i'm a christian not due to this movie but due to my personal decision to accept jesus as my <UNK> the film and potential that something similar to the circumstances portrayed <UNK> can remarkably scare someone into thinking about their actions and decisions it's not some cheap attempt to scare people into believing in god but rather a means to get your attention br br as a christian i know i'll not be left behind and thanks to movies like this i can look beyond the <UNK> of entertainment acting and film <UNK> to appreciate the depth that the film has to offer this is a movie you shouldn't not only see but feel with your heart and soul
<START> this movie is the next segment in the pokemon movies which supplies everything on hopes and dreams of a pokemon warrior named ash <UNK> and his friends they go out and they look battle and run into new pokemon and take on new adventures with <UNK> and other pokemon favorites this adventure takes on with a new pokemon called <UNK> a time pokemon go join ash <UNK> and misty to find all sorts of new things
<START> this is easily the most disappointing least <UNK> movie of the entire so called <UNK> genre which by the way are films we generally enjoy a great deal in our home rather than being exploitation or <UNK> these films actually provide a priceless insight into an era well not <UNK> br br in this story duke returns to <UNK> to operate the night club left to him by his recently deceased brother he quickly learns that the city is entirely controlled by a corrupt police force bleeding protection money out of all the local <UNK> duke <UNK> and <UNK> that he will rescue the city from the corrupt police unfortunately he does so by calling in a <UNK> of his friends these people are vaguely explained as some former black <UNK> who have worked with duke on jobs in the past and they simply murder the entire police department in cold blood and literally in the presence of hundreds of witnesses who do nothing to stop it ignorance is not a justification for murder and it would have been much more entertaining to see the cracker police suffer for their actions as opposed to merely getting whacked in the street while revenge is a <UNK> and generally satisfying theme in films of this genre it is a far cry from seeing pam <UNK> track down the thugs who <UNK> her family <UNK> them out give them a <UNK> ass <UNK> and set their <UNK> on fire that has art and a reason for existing and merits a level of respect that is quite <UNK> by simply shooting someone in the back of course in this bizarre tale she is playing a woman completely under the man's thumb afraid of the <UNK> who run her town and <UNK> her people indeed her advice to duke is run man they gonna kill you br br following the sickening and gratuitous violence we are expected to believe that the town's mayor <UNK> <UNK> the actions of duke and his friends <UNK> them and offering to throw a parade in their honor as opposed to say calling the district attorney to press capital murder charges against them and have them taken into custody <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the parade and instead <UNK> to fill the numerous <UNK> on the police force created by their recent killing spree they immediately prove to be even more corrupt than their cracker police predecessors to quote the mayor they are ten times worse than what we had before now duke finds he must again rescue the citizens of <UNK> from corrupt protection <UNK> law <UNK> officials and again make it safe for decent folk to operate a prostitution business in the streets unfortunately duke has already lost all moral high ground and sympathy due a hero as he was a willing <UNK> in the murder of the original police force i wouldn't have cared one way or the other if he had rescued <UNK> or gotten <UNK> himself at this point i suppose we are to be entertained by the clever way duke has to <UNK> the new police <UNK> but in reality the film has now just become an opera of gratuitous violence duke murders all of his former friends and allies in cold blood with the same absence of compassion he had when <UNK> down the cracker police duke is a pig br br finally when everyone in town but duke <UNK> and the employees of the local <UNK> are dead and <UNK> in the street our hero and heroine walk off into the night as though they had some admirable qualities or redeeming values they don't duke is merely a murderous thug and <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> if you are interested in this genre of film by all means i highly recommend them see <UNK> <UNK> brown truck turner <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> if in the process you should run across this dvd throw it as far away as you possibly can drop it like it's hot it should be treated as one would treat a glowing <UNK> of nuclear waste there is no single film in the entire <UNK> era that is not dramatically more entertaining satisfying and populated with more sympathetic and admirable characters than this piece of <UNK> obviously written by and targeted at some <UNK> <UNK> high school <UNK>
<START> i can't believe this movie was made as recently as 1984 it's got some laughable acting not to mention one of the stupidest plots ever who would ever ask fat texas sheriff joe don baker to <UNK> an italian he <UNK> arrested in mexico back to italy not to mention that the title of the movie tells you pretty much nothing about it in fact it's about as generic a title for a wannabe action cop film as i can think of br br i'm glad i only saw this on mst3k with mike and the <UNK> as a shield they remark on the female <UNK> resemblance to <UNK> from seinfeld none of them are <UNK> and riff non stop on <UNK> weight this movie probably isn't worse than mitchell but <UNK> reputation definitely <UNK> him here when his title comes up at the beginning of the film tom says i wish i was illiterate so i wouldn't have to read that
<START> i felt it necessary to respond to the comments posted on the front page of this film's page because some of it was slightly <UNK> br br originally i posted quotes from the original poster but i wasn't sure if it was proper given that this is the comments <UNK> and not a message board though we used to use 'em that way back before imdb added the film message boards so i will edit this to make it unnecessary br br well first of all you may not be aware of this but gene kelly first became famous for playing pal joey on broadway in the original production when <UNK> minnelli decided to make a gershwin <UNK> film he wanted kelly's character to be more sophisticated than the <UNK> two shoes roles he had been playing in most his films with the exception of for me and my gal alan jay <UNK> was <UNK> to <UNK> a new story set in paris based on the story of pal joey this gave kelly a chance to play his famous role from broadway even though <UNK> had <UNK> mgm for the rights to pal joey in my opinion the wb film pal joey is a wreck though sinatra was suitable for the role but other problems sunk the film script changes and poor direction br br you complain that kelly's pictures are not well done even <UNK> your art education to prove the point but you miss the fact that kelly's bad art was clearly designed to be bad and it is necessary for the story characters the pictures are so bad the audience knows that kelly isn't ready for an <UNK> even he knows it though milo has sort of <UNK> him up to the point where he almost believes her but it's important that the audience not be sitting there saying but he's a great artist if he only had the chance you want the audience to be fully aware of his <UNK> br br then you complain that he <UNK> his interest in the show again you are not understanding the structure of the story he refuses because he doesn't want to feel like a <UNK> and because he knows he's not really ready for the <UNK> his enthusiasm for the <UNK> is certainly not as great as <UNK> enthusiasm to start a nightclub but it serves the same function in the plot remember it's essential in pal joey the play that joey gives up his nightclub after he realizes that he doesn't deserve it same with the art show if kelly's paintings were actually good it would <UNK> this whole point br br then you complain that caron and kelly have no chemistry i guess it's in the eye of the <UNK> i agree the chemistry between them is not as strong as it should be but for me it was fine compare it to even worse forced romances like the one between cary grant and sophia loren in the pride and the passion br br when you say that the big dance finale has nothing to do with anything else in this film it just shows that you haven't <UNK> beneath the surface of the film into its symbolism many elements in the dance sequence relate to the story and characters and through the dance the plot is resolved through images and symbolism it's about finding love enjoying love then losing love he looks around and his love is gone the movements of the <UNK> are constructed so that part of each dance scene mirrors a separate phase of <UNK> art and also a separate phase of their relationships if you <UNK> see that it's not the movie's fault it's certainly not a load of crap
<START> anyone who doesn't laugh all through this movie has been <UNK> i have watched it at least twenty times and i still get tears in my eyes at many of the scenes sally field is absolutely perfect as <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> soap star whose supporting cast is trying to get her replaced in hopes that their own star will rise fields at 45 still has that wonderful and beautiful <UNK> quality and a perfect figure that <UNK> her having had three children i'm biased i'm in love with her br br the cast of <UNK> is filled with stars who perform their roles to perfection kevin kline is flawless as are robert downey jr an <UNK> elizabeth <UNK> whoopi goldberg <UNK> <UNK> in one of her early roles carrie fisher as the <UNK> casting director who <UNK> an actor for a small part as a <UNK> without his shirt on kathy <UNK> is wonderful as the hapless costume designer and best of all cathy <UNK> as nurse <UNK> who leads the plot to get fields character removed from the show is hilarious br br this movie should have won oscars for best comedy best leading lady in a comedy best leading man in a comedy and <UNK> other <UNK> including writing directing and supporting actors and actresses get the dvd so you can watch it over and over for the next twenty five years you will still be laughing at it when the disc wears out
<START> well i had to be generous and give this a 2 this was mainly due to the gratuitous holes cut in that <UNK> shirt where her breasts are i found that mildly amusing other than that this movie does nothing more than provide a few good laughs with a friend funny if you're willing to throw mystery science theatre comments at it with someone but it ain't no better than a 2 and a 2 pretty much sucks
<START> this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen if you know the real world and the people from those shows this movie will be top notch if you have never seen the real world you will still think it is an extremely funny movie but you won't get some of the inside jokes about the actors and the tv show
<START> <UNK> and mrs miller takes place in the turn of the century pacific <UNK> into a <UNK> <UNK> mining camp john <UNK> a <UNK> warren beatty comes <UNK> full of <UNK> smoke and big ideas about building a proper saloon <UNK> for the town <UNK> with a trio of the <UNK> <UNK> in movie history he also comes with an <UNK> reputation as a <UNK> too shameful about this to blatantly <UNK> it but not exactly afraid to use it in order to <UNK> <UNK> male <UNK> amongst the locals and thus he <UNK> the boys into building his saloon at the rate of 15 cents an hour br br it looks to be a rather sorry operation until mrs miller julie christie shows up on a startling <UNK> that's half <UNK> car half <UNK> where did altman find that thing mrs miller immediately takes on <UNK> as a business partner with the aim of <UNK> up the new joint with proper <UNK> and an <UNK> that all <UNK> take a bath before entering noting that <UNK> doesn't know how to add she also insists on handling the accounts it's not clear what <UNK> function will be br br the plot <UNK> when a pair of <UNK> <UNK> from the mining company show up in town and offer <UNK> to buy him out for five grand <UNK> tells them to buzz off he's holding out for fifteen thousand the company finds <UNK> <UNK> so they hire a trio of <UNK> to simply kill <UNK> though how they think they can get away with murdering a man in broad daylight in the center of town is as unclear as <UNK> function in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this <UNK> plot hole on the grounds that the locals would be too <UNK> to talk doesn't cut the <UNK> when one considers that any reward money offered by the local <UNK> would be pretty <UNK> br br <UNK> and mrs miller <UNK> classic seventies cinema should be a lot better than it is the movie tells a pretty good story the main characters have the potential to be interesting there are some striking scenes especially one involving what looks to be a 14 year old stone cold killer but it's really really hard to enjoy a movie when you can hardly hear what anyone is saying and when you can hardly see what anyone is doing once again this director <UNK> his own movie with sheer <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> according to the trivia sheet here on imdb the movie's editor <UNK> to altman that the sound was <UNK> altman <UNK> and when everyone said the sound was <UNK> after the movie's release altman blamed the editor nice along with the bad sound the movie has an atrocious look only robert altman can hire a world class <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> and make a movie that looks as if they <UNK> the camera <UNK> with dirty <UNK> reviewers here who praise the dark brown glow of this picture have got to be kidding me the interiors are shot through what appears to be a dark <UNK> the exterior photography is even worse it's as if altman placed 500 fog machines behind the <UNK> trees during the climactic stretch when beatty is <UNK> the <UNK> while the local church is on fire altman insists on pretty much wholly <UNK> the view with an animated snow fall that reminds one of a <UNK> bass christmas special br br look i can't watch a movie under these conditions get back to me when you learn how to place boom <UNK> when you remove all that annoying altman <UNK> <UNK> dialog and when you wipe the <UNK> with some <UNK> or something 3 stars out of 10
<START> this would've been a sure fire classic had they chosen almost anybody else for john abraham this guy is an awful actor be it comedy drama tear <UNK> etc he stinks it seemed like at some point <UNK> realized this too and pretty much had him jumping around like a monkey in order to make his solo scenes a bit funny br br he's the only noticeable <UNK> there are a couple more annoying <UNK> bits of an absolutely hilarious movie otherwise best comedy to come along in bollywood since <UNK> imo like <UNK> it's a <UNK> comedy carried on the shoulders of a brilliant screenplay and of course akshay kumar this is probably his best performance to date he better be a shoe in for best comedian at every award function <UNK> always been good at comedy but he takes it to a different level here the body language the facial expressions and just the way he delivers every line it's a genius performance the packed theater was going nuts for pretty much the entire length of the movie and i don't think i've ever seen such an atmosphere for a bollywood movie here in usa br br <UNK> <UNK> doesn't have one lead heroine it stars 3 incredibly hot beautiful girls who i thought did a fairly good job pretty sure they are all making their <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is solid as usual although his routine wears itself out after a while <UNK> <UNK> is his typical annoying self sick of his over the top act in every movie <UNK> <UNK> has nothing to do br br overall definitely worth a <UNK> i'd say it's funnier than no entry and that's saying a lot could've been even better had they chosen someone a little more competent than john abraham br br 8 10
<START> shame on <UNK> raj films and <UNK> <UNK> who seems to have lost their intelligence over the years and providing steady fare of tripe in this piece of cinematic crap thats not even worth you tube standards i was <UNK> my teeth throughout the whole flick start to finish with the <UNK> direction plot line that never quite <UNK> and on the last scene i just felt ashamed that my country and its <UNK> film makers can throw away <UNK> on such stupidity shame on the actors for taking this work and even commenting on it as some piece of work they can own up to saif ali khan completely disappointed in your choice of film <UNK> shows enough skin for the <UNK> stricken and akshay comes up as the dim wit anil another <UNK> with a <UNK> fascination for english his <UNK> were commendable in their acting and with the bizarre cinematography scattered in the last 15 minutes it was enough to pop a blood <UNK> don't waste any brain cells energy or your money to go see this go see rent <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> instead a beautiful piece of independent film thats ever come out of india intelligent poignant and a wonderful story tale that will touch everyone with intelligent actors and gave me hope that all is not lost in indian cinema making
<START> i do not even want to call this thing a film it is a movie that should not have won any awards the acting was horrible as were the silly scenarios this is exactly the sort of film that so many folks think <UNK> to an <UNK> audience but is in fact <UNK> abroad for its <UNK> and the overwhelming sense of trying throughout the movie br br i find it strange that so many actors <UNK> with the english language have such a hard time doing so convincingly in front of the camera i'm sure many readers know what i am talking about all those token english phrases thrown into a movie in hindi and in <UNK> cinema for cool points there are few indian movies in which the english seems completely genuine being <UNK> was a recent one although not a great film it was a good film and the language did not seem put on br br i feel ashamed that <UNK> was awarded the <UNK> in 2005 the only semi enjoyable parts of this rubbish were <UNK> and a somewhat catchy background score other than that do not even waste your time with this film
<START> i like the movie twisted desire had jeremy jordan one of my favorite and one of the <UNK> actors ever melissa joan hart is a good actress i've seen most of her movies but all of jeremy <UNK> the thing i dislike about twisted desire is when nick gets arrested and jennifer rats him out twisted desire is my second favorite movie my first is the <UNK> but i still love jeremy jordan
<START> before sunrise is romance for the <UNK> generation richard <UNK> romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people the film depicts romance in all it's glory but without any of the <UNK> that <UNK> most couples and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship that's as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to with just one problem the problem of time while most relationships wind down with time this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out before sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental <UNK> <UNK> which is another aspect that puts this film <UNK> ahead of the <UNK> the story follows two people jesse an american and celine a french girl that meet on a train into vienna they instantly connect and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train jesse asks celine to join him for the day in the <UNK> city of vienna br br before sunrise works <UNK> for two reasons realistic acting and an immense script that builds the characters through their thoughts and feelings and thus allows us to get to know them as we do the people in real life this allows the characters to be free and it's easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script this also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are and not merely because they're the protagonists this kind of realism is hard to capture as at the end of the day we as the audience know that they're watching a film and not <UNK> real life but before sunrise represents one of the <UNK> to life <UNK> of realism ever to be seen on screen a truly great script cannot work on it's own and needs great actors to deliver it to an extent that does it justice and although i'm not a fan of either julie <UNK> or ethan hawke on viewing this film there is nothing you can do but give them both respect i don't know whether they were in character or just playing themselves but when a film is this good it hardly matters br br in a film like this it is the writing that's the most important thing and contained within the script are several observations about life most of which i personally could relate to this represents what richard <UNK> has achieved with this script as not only does it create and build the characters but it also manages to expose what true love is along with several other aspects of life the fact that not all the <UNK> are <UNK> to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing everyone is different and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people there could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates and that's the case with the <UNK> in this script adding to the beauty of the film is the city of vienna the city itself isn't really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere but it makes for some lovely visuals and the upbeat energetic romance that <UNK> throughout the movie is matched by the beauty of the location br br before sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating richard <UNK> has created something that is rare in the world of cinema a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental before sunrise is what it is and what it is is pure cinematic brilliance
<START> this is crap utter crap i cannot believe any company could even get people to work on a film like this full moon has a number of awful films but this has got to be the worst first off the plot doesn't exist it's odd it's like they took an idea for the story and kind of never really got around to developing it they seemed to have just wasted a lot of time filming outside shots while the two heroes drove around in the desert and <UNK> talks nonsense for about 10 minutes there were two scenes in the movie when <UNK> and <UNK> are driving and when <UNK> and <UNK> are driving where it just went on and on and on it was almost like 2 music videos in the place where there should have been some dialog or action they just drove for about 5 minutes with nothing but music and shots of the surrounding landscape br br next we come to the acting which is simply horrible first off the girl who plays <UNK> is just a beast she is so scary looking i wanted to look away when she was on screen horrible casting then you have the guy who played <UNK> who couldn't act if his life <UNK> on it his crying is actually funny and his madman antics are even funnier the guy who plays the desk clerk at the hotel is just as bad as is the guy who plays <UNK> there was no acting that deserves any recognition in this movie whatsoever br br the makeup effects hmmm can anyone say pathetic the effects were so fake they were laughable the crazy little robot looking <UNK> thing grabs onto someone they cut away and when they come back the guy has a completely fake looking flesh wound nice did they run out of money on the makeup budget or what i must say the <UNK> chick who is in the one girl's apartment nice makeup there too i think they were going for a drugged look and i think she was supposed to have a black guy but it looked more like cheap zombie makeup for halloween br br this movie is just horrible from the start the story is stupid and very very unoriginal the direction looks as tho it was performed by a 10 year old the acting is the lowest of the low and so on stay away from this movie at all costs it's only 70 minutes long in the first place and <UNK> 20 minutes of that is taken up by either music and no dialog or the character sitting around in the hotel do not waste your time on this piece of garbage
<START> this is the first of a two part back story to the conflict between the machines and mankind in the matrix world and it delivers spectacularly by combining observations on man's fear of the unknown and of being <UNK> with politics extensive religious and historical imagery <UNK> expected portrayals of parties involved and an at least partially believable and thus terrifying vision of our near future it isn't perfect and some plot points and images are at once obvious and contrived but it has the desired effect and impact and tells a visceral and <UNK> tale br br this first part sets the scene human societies have developed advanced and capable robots mostly <UNK> to serve people doing <UNK> <UNK> jobs <UNK> construction etc and thus the <UNK> has become lazy and <UNK> towards them one robot however rebels and kills his owner stating at his subsequent trial that he simply did not want to die he is destroyed but when the robot <UNK> destruction is ordered to protect humanity many robots rise up in protest with many human <UNK> alongside them br br the imagery here is exploitative <UNK> race <UNK> and abuse <UNK> square the holocaust and an overly provocative scene of a robot in a human girl's <UNK> getting <UNK> <UNK> in the head and then shot dead as it <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it lays on the ground clothes and skin torn and breasts hanging out it's an obvious and obscene image designed to present human fear towards <UNK> elements and <UNK> towards groups based on the actions of individuals br br anyway this first portion is much like a <UNK> version of the film i robot but it soon develops into a <UNK> matrix back story as the surviving robot <UNK> is <UNK> and <UNK> in the middle east in the cradle of <UNK> as the narrator informs us there the machines <UNK> and begin to produce new <UNK> and to <UNK> mass technology and trade it with human nations we see a commercial for a car that uses the <UNK> energy <UNK> <UNK> that the ships the rebels in the movies use and we see sentinel type robots flying around zero one the name of their city their goods and trade make their economy <UNK> affecting other <UNK> <UNK> and human <UNK> and authorities establish a <UNK> in response the machines send <UNK> in the form of adam and eve <UNK> to a un <UNK> to <UNK> a peaceful resolution to the <UNK> but they are <UNK> removed and the scene is set for war in the second part br br the animation is by studio <UNK> who work on quite a few of the <UNK> and it's <UNK> and visually stimulating rendering different scenes like imagery montages <UNK> footage and particular scenes of <UNK> distinctive and overall presenting the story perfectly the plot may not be an original concept and it may draw on simplistic sheep <UNK> and plot models and resort to provocative material for impact but after the <UNK> mystery offered by the first film and <UNK> vague brief info <UNK> this is a nice exposition of the <UNK> events that left the world <UNK> and in the hands of the machines that serves as a warning and as a vehicle for many observations and comments on the human condition the development of <UNK> and the importance of harmony and co operation and the devastating consequences of conflict and prejudice themes expanded on in the movies
<START> ok here it is nazi <UNK> befriends the <UNK> <UNK> what we do is first we get a major star with no idea whatsoever how to do a <UNK> accent and we let him <UNK> around between french german american and british for over 2 hours then we <UNK> a series of wildly improbable events and space them apart very widely so that the plot <UNK> along almost <UNK> but just to make sure the viewer <UNK> fall asleep we throw in details which are shockingly absurd such as our hero smoking a cigarette at an <UNK> of 22 000 feet naturally we must also remember that our target audience does not want to read too many subtitles so we have every character even the <UNK> <UNK> in the forbidden closed off city of <UNK> in 1943 speak perfect english also with dubious accents of course the <UNK> part is how to handle the spiritual and political aspects of the story so what we do is this we have the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the now <UNK> nazi because the latter is so good at <UNK> with film <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cars and any other devices with represent the freedom of the <UNK> west in return our hero learns from his young <UNK> a kind of vague <UNK> <UNK> which is never really brought out or treated in a serious fashion we also have lots of scenes with the hero <UNK> all the marks of respects and <UNK> which the rest of the <UNK> society <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> even as we pretend that the hero has deep and profound <UNK> for these people and their spiritual leader in other words we just expect the audience to believe that this guy is now a <UNK> sort of in his own way even though we ourselves <UNK> seem to know what his transformation <UNK> or how far we want it to go and last but not least we hang a <UNK> onto the end of the film about how <UNK> the chinese have treated the <UNK> which is certainly true thus opening ourselves up to charges that we have made a political movie even though it is nothing of the sort so <UNK> <UNK> my idea <UNK> do you <UNK> can <UNK> make <UNK> movie
<START> this movie surprised me it had good one liners and laughs a <UNK> action packed storyline with tons of gun action and explosions this movie surprisingly had a lot of good twists and turns the plot is solid despite what others may think it kept my interest the whole time right up till the very end in conclusion this is a great way for an action movie buff to spend time on
<START> after chicago i was beginning to lose all respect for richard gere and then along came the flock there's just so far a nice smile and a couple of stock facial gestures can get you but he proved to me that he's finally gotten hold of his craft and can act with the best of them <UNK> danes was also super as his <UNK> replacement some have suggested there was too much unnecessary violence but i don't see it that way nothing i saw <UNK> from the power of this film i was really shocked i hadn't heard of it being released in theaters and came across it at blockbuster instead really an exceptional film with just the right blend of action suspense thrills and social consciousness as good as <UNK> well maybe and you'll see better acting out of gere than anyone's ever gotten out of pitt
<START> sort of family parody <UNK> an officer and a gentleman <UNK> <UNK> full metal jacket and without doubt other movies i am not able to remember now into a rather dull movie with some bright spots the gags are always there where you would expect them and damon <UNK> lines are well predictable as i said unfortunately this movie never surprises you
<START> <UNK> survivor series 2001 br br this was among the worst events of 2001 perhaps its biggest flaw was the fact that it didn't follow suit to most of the previous survivor <UNK> there was only one survivor series match and that survivor series match went on for 45 minutes what's more anyone with a working brain would know that it would end with the rock versus austin and the rock <UNK> for his team and don't get me started on the preview before the event no matter who won it was obvious that no one was going to f ing die there was no need for all of that pointless hype whatever the storyline it was just a wrestling event br br and as for the rest of the matches the first match was christian defending his european title against al snow it was a good fast paced match and its good to see a <UNK> winning a match fairly william regal versus <UNK> was boring and we've seen it 2 or 3 times before edge versus test was good but nothing great the tag titles steel cage match was the best match of the evening the battle royal went on for 10 minutes and no one really cared who'd win in the first place the women's title match wasn't great no not in the slightest the main event must have been the most <UNK> match in history the alliance lost but guess what after 5 months every single alliance superstar returned the match itself was poor the rock eliminated 3 of them and <UNK> eliminated 2 the rock was too caught up with his acting to be there when the invasion began <UNK> was the one that <UNK> the whole match if i wanted any 2 to be eliminated in the early going it would be them everyone knew that kane big show and undertaker were just fall guys 7 matches isn't enough for a survivor series if there's ever a survivor series as bad as this again i'll
<START> the great caruso displays the unique talents of mario lanza he shows great acting capacity and is in top form as a lyrical singer paired with dorothy kirsten soprano of the <UNK> opera indeed i dare to say that he performs some songs better than caruso check <UNK> from <UNK> and la <UNK> from <UNK> the mgm art and music <UNK> also did a good job this movie could be perfect were it not for the awkward presence of ann <UNK> we see that she is trying her best dressed in the fifties style in scenes just before <UNK> unforgivable lanza deserved a better leading lady and <UNK> should stick to less demanding productions also notice that ms kirsten sings most of the opera <UNK> of the film with lanza giving the wrong notion that caruso had a kind of permanent leading soprano
<START> i don't hand out ones often but if there was ever a film that deserved this sort of attention it's gas this is self indulgent crap that reaches for some of the ambiance of m a s h and falls completely flat on its face in the attempt br br i see what corman was going for malcolm <UNK> and elliott <UNK> tried to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> role in the original movie version of m a s h with a similar plot in the movie <UNK> look it up here in imdb http www imdb com title <UNK> for more information br br <UNK> and <UNK> got closer to the <UNK> ring with <UNK> than corman did with gas but didn't quite get there neither one of those films even got close to the success of m a s h br br what's wrong with gas what isn't no one comes close to really acting at a level above junior high school <UNK> the production values stink someone else here mentioned the magically <UNK> <UNK> on a <UNK> car and there's more of that lack of attention to detail nothing works the way it's supposed to in this film and nobody cares br br gas actually put me to sleep it's not a sure cure for insomnia but really close on the cinematic sleep <UNK> scale gas falls somewhere between last year at <UNK> and george <UNK> remake of <UNK> which itself was remarkable for being more boring than the <UNK> original despite that <UNK> seeming <UNK> with the idea of keeping the audience's attention by <UNK> editing br br <UNK> editing would have <UNK> gas to about twenty minutes the result would be pointless but no more so than the original film br br certain films are so bad that they have a compelling quality that makes them worth watching anyway this isn't one of them don't waste your time it's not even <UNK> bad
<START> page 3 is most definitely a very enthralling and captivating eye opener that very cleverly exposes the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> elite from the fake kisses to the <UNK> smiles page 3 leaves no stone <UNK> in revealing the shocking lives of the rich and the famous <UNK> <UNK> corruption and scandal <UNK> in every dark corner in the world of <UNK> and <UNK> humanity and <UNK> are <UNK> to an <UNK> in the desert in this world where social <UNK> is the <UNK> mentality everyone is constantly <UNK> for more money more fame and a higher reputation driving them to do the most shameful things imaginable ranging from <UNK> film <UNK> at a funeral to child <UNK> anything is possible in this metropolis where there is a such a wide gap between the social classes the audience sees the <UNK> of both of these classes through the eyes of the protagonist she <UNK> the <UNK> atmosphere and the mind <UNK> frenzy that the <UNK> live in bollywood business <UNK> politicians and the underworld are all <UNK> in a completely convoluted mess <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a nice track as is the <UNK> <UNK> main <UNK> <UNK> terrific film with excellent character development
<START> my wife and i like to rent really stupid horror sci fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh we saw this one on <UNK> com and decided to add it to our netflix list now when i say this movie is awful i mean it in a good way everything about it the acting camera work story costumes is just so <UNK> and low budget but thats what makes it so good i think in one scene the actors looked like they were actually walking in place i really hope that whoever made this film wasn't serious when they made it because if they were then that would just be sad if you like to watch really stupid horror movies just to make fun of them then i recommend this one
<START> chris rock stars in this remake of warren <UNK> heaven can wait itself a remake of the 1941 film here comes mr jordan a comedy about a man who dies before his time before he can realize his dreams and his adventures in his new albeit temporary body in the beatty version the protagonist was a <UNK> <UNK> for the then los angeles <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> version our lead character is a struggling young and decidedly low talent <UNK> comedian br br it's very funny to see the razor sharp rock playing a bad comedian it's kind of like seeing tom hanks play a bad actor lance <UNK> dream is to play the legendary apollo theater on a non amateur night but every time he tries out his material he's <UNK> off the stage <UNK> so much so that his <UNK> becomes <UNK> his jokes are lame his delivery painful in short lance is everything that the real chris rock isn't br br lance is also a bike <UNK> and he's riding the streets on his way to try out even more material when <UNK> he's hit by a truck ok so maybe he was taken from his body a <UNK> of a second early by a slightly incompetent angel eugene levy but hey he was going to get hit anyway no <UNK> it appears lance isn't due in heaven until <UNK> so what to do mr king <UNK> <UNK> the manager of heaven reluctantly agrees to find a new body for the not quite dead mr barton trouble is the body they find is of a greedy old white man turns out this <UNK> a mr <UNK> owns all kinds of things he's the <UNK> <UNK> man in the country what luck you can imagine how lance will turn things around br br but of course while in the body of the <UNK> mr <UNK> lance falls for a gorgeous hospital worker <UNK> king we males know how tough it is to find a female given our own body but try winning one over while you're an <UNK> old white guy and it's even worse when she's not impressed by your money br br this is <UNK> first shot at a lead role and in my opinion he performs admirably there's still a lot of the <UNK> comedian in him and of course if he ever wants to get diverse roles he might have to stop <UNK> <UNK> routines into the script but this isn't really a bad thing <UNK> personality his drive his delivery his demeanor and his passion are what fuel this film he's clearly having a lot of fun in the role and he seems bent on making sure you have fun watching him
<START> may contain spoilers br br a dude in a dopey looking kong suit the same one used in king kong vs godzilla in <UNK> provides much of the <UNK> in this much <UNK> monster flick kong is <UNK> on <UNK> island and helps out the <UNK> hero and other good guys this time around the vampire like villain is named dr <UNK> funny he doesn't look like peter cushing kong finally dukes it out with who's pride and joy a giant robot ape that looks like a bad metal <UNK> of <UNK> gorilla like many of <UNK> flicks this may have had some merit before american audiences <UNK> around with it and added new footage the <UNK> bass animation company had a hand in this mess they should have stuck to superior children's programs like the little drummer boy
<START> a friend of mine bought this very cheaply and decided to give it to me as a birthday present i thought i'd never watch it 'cause i knew it was a joke and the cover of the dvd looked pathetic but then my friends and i got really bored and watched it from start till finish i know quite an accomplishment but it really is a masterpiece it's hard to describe you should see it it's a real lesson on what people are capable of when they believe they're creative and smart and really aren't the acting is <UNK> <UNK> you can actually see the leading lady laugh on some occasions she's definitely the worst the story is to stupid to be summed up and really everything in this film sucked please pay special attention to the sheriff the guy is an adult and <UNK> has absolutely no excuse to be involved in this he's extremely bad as well whatever it did have some hilarious moments check it out haha
<START> this is the best movie i've come across in a long while not only is this the best movie of its kind school shooting the way ben <UNK> the director decided to film it was magnificent he filmed it using teenage actors who were still attending high school he filmed it in the actors own rooms and used the actors real parents as their parents in the film also the actors were filming too using <UNK> making it seem much more like a video diary it is almost <UNK> if that is indeed a word there are a few slip ups however for example when cal calls <UNK> land <UNK> a range <UNK> or vice versa it's been awhile since i've seen it
<START> from the writer of what ever happened to baby jane and <UNK> <UNK> sweet charlotte this tail end of the sixties horror cycle has some eerie and campy fun <UNK> <UNK> does a victor <UNK> type bit but too often the movie <UNK> dangerously close to a bad musical there's a particularly awful children's <UNK> about halfway through debbie <UNK> <UNK> and tricks up a <UNK> harlow while <UNK> religious fanatic has a lesbian edge to her <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in as an <UNK> weaver has nothing to do and even has to pay a <UNK> to dance with debbie
<START> 24 has got to be the best spy adventure series tv had ever aired the whole idea of telling a story in a 24 hour real time period is dazzling the style of filming and pacing is what <UNK> us to watch it and jack bauer is one of the greatest protagonists in a tv series in a long time i rate this along with the simpsons and the x files my three most favorite tv series br br this first episode begins with the conspiracy to <UNK> us senator david <UNK> who is also running for president bauer is called to his office in order to discover who is behind all this and at the same time figure his daughter's path to the <UNK> after fleeing from her bedroom thus begins an adventure on the best political style and what's best of it is that it always takes place in real time which makes this tv series a real work of originality in a time where almost every program on tv seems to be showing us the same things over and over and over
<START> i don't understand not being a critic i am not <UNK> the quality of the acting which i find believable a good thing my confusion lies with the content is no one else sensitive to the fact that these two <UNK> women were <UNK> their infidelity to men who were fighting and bleeding to guarantee the continued freedom of their families and their country should there not have been a prologue <UNK> us if the men made it home and if so what effect their cheating <UNK> infidelity had on them while these women were <UNK> their <UNK> out of a sense loneliness did they think that their husbands were enjoying being shot at while facing death or <UNK> daily they didn't think of their husbands at all only of themselves <UNK> me except when they wished their husbands dead
<START> this ranks as one of the worst movies i've seen in years besides cuba and angie the acting is actually embarrassing wasn't archer once a decent actress what happened to her the action is decent but completely implausible the make up is so bad it's worth mentioning i mean who ever even thinks about the makeup in a contemporary feature film someone should tell the make up artist and the <UNK> that you're not supposed to actually see it the ending is a massive disappointment along the lines of and then they realized it was all a dream br br don't waste your time or your money you're better off just staring into space for 2 hours
<START> kenneth branagh attempts to turn william <UNK> obscure rarely produced comedy into a 1930s era musical with the result being both bad shakespeare and bad musical comedy as the actors are rarely <UNK> at one or the other of the two styles and in some cases <UNK> badly in both particularly painful is nathan lane who seems to be under the impression that he is absolutely hysterical as <UNK> but is badly mistaken and alicia <UNK> who handles the shakespearean language with all the authority of a <UNK> valley girl who is reading the script <UNK> in her middle school english class br br the musical numbers are staged with the expertise of a high school production of <UNK> at sea leaving the cast looking awkward and amateurish while singing and dancing with the lone exception being adrian lester who proves himself a splendid song and dance man the only other saving grace of the film are <UNK> <UNK> and emily <UNK> contribution as eye candy but they have given far better performances than in this film and you'd be wise to check out some of the other titles in their <UNK> and gives this witless mess a pass
<START> the original cube is a fantastic b movie rich with paranoia <UNK> characterization and fine over the top performances it's creepy <UNK> and cool and it stands perfectly well on its own without a stupid sequel like cube zero br br this third film in the cube series is part <UNK> most of the <UNK> traps are sadly recycled part <UNK> it takes the bold step of explaining what the cube is something that was never revealed in the first movie but since said explanation is bland i'd rather it was kept a secret there are some potentially interesting references to the society that exists outside of the cube but they never develop beyond hints about some kind of political religious <UNK> state so what little social commentary there is feels flat and <UNK> br br what works basically nothing the acting is purely amateur hour the pacing is slow how much of this movie consists of two <UNK> watching a screen and the gore effects while revolting fail to convince in short cube zero reminded me of a cube fan <UNK> a sloppy and <UNK> clone of a good movie that definitely did not need a sequel
<START> double exposure was a tremendous surprise it contains outstanding acting particularly from the underrated <UNK> fine cinematography and a compelling storyline in other words it's one of the finest horror efforts to emerge from the 1980s br br <UNK> plays a fashion photographer who experiences dreams of murdering his models at a time when he is reunited with his psychologically <UNK> brother who happens to be missing an arm and a leg when the models <UNK> dreams about killing actually turn up dead the photographer begins to doubt his own sanity but there is more to the picture than he is seeing br br this film never received the praise it deserves most critics and <UNK> <UNK> it in with the <UNK> of slasher films released at the same time but it stands high above the bulk of that sorry lot it's clever and unique which isn't something one can <UNK> say about most films of this genre but it's also <UNK> crafted and performed double exposure is a gem of its kind
<START> i want to state first that i am a christian and that i do work in the film and tv industry so i understand what it is like to work on a feature length film so props to the filmmakers in that regard i'm all for positive uplifting messages if they are true to the nature of life that this is a fallen world and that things don't always work out even for followers of christ i'm glad that others are having such <UNK> positive reactions to the overt christian message for me it was just that the execution is where the film fell on its face a movie lives and dies on its story and here you have one dimensional stereotypes exposition <UNK> and spontaneous changes in character behavior that are inexplicably to say the least i believe that a film does not have to club you over the head with its message to get the point across i'm sure the <UNK> bros will improve with time and that their storytelling methods will as well maybe they could direct someone else's screenplay as their next project br br sports films are not exactly my first love but a good one <UNK> field of dreams etc can inspire in a <UNK> of ways if you would be interested in a pg rated film that <UNK> give steven <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> a look all truth is god's truth
<START> first of all let me say the first 20 minutes are great the monster looks superb and the cgi is reasonably done it's a shame then that the rest of the movie is such a disappointment br br spoilers below br br from the opening scene we can see this movie is anti american normally this sort of stereotyping wouldn't bother me we brits get enough from hollywood but here it's not subtle about making the americans brain dead morons it goes past the point of realism and your left wondering if a <UNK> has raped the directors mother br br the <UNK> scene was really poor and the part of the movie where it starts going downhill br br here we are introduced to the olympic <UNK> <UNK> and drunk uncle who walk into the <UNK> and start <UNK> the father for his daughters death then hitting him before they all start rolling around on the floor crying hardly realistic bonding at a time of crisis br br the whole virus <UNK> is ridiculous if the americans know there isn't a virus why are they wasting time money and resources investigating the us government agent orders the brain <UNK> of an innocent korean for nothing making the americans look evil or stupid it wasn't helped by the fact this guy was cross eyed for comical effect br br the movie is about hunting the monster us and korean special forces are assigned to finding the creature although through out the movie they are invisible the only people hunting the monster in the whole of korea is the main family and some random tramp who appears at the end to save the day naturally a few us korean agents try to stop them along the way br br the sister was only included in the movie so she could make the vital shot at the end it was clichéd you knew it was going to happen but to make it worse she does <UNK> all until that part and my final annoyance how the hell did that kid survive at the end the monster had been swimming with it's head underwater for about 5 minutes why didn't the monster eat the kids in the first place
<START> oh this is so bad it is funny the only way one could explain something like this is a porn party with drugs that resulted in the resolution to make a movie just for fun i mean you get to see porn actresses topless having sex then killed by human mutants there is plenty of gore including the classic something is wrong with her oh no it's half the person she used to be and the accidental murder caused by panic but you can also find funny stuff like intestines pulled through someone's ass and a guy running in the woods then finding himself decapitated by a wire tied between two trees that makes a <UNK> <UNK> sound afterward like in cartoons somehow there is a market for people going beyond porn they really need to know what's inside an actress mere <UNK> are not enough therefore you get to see plenty of summary <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> there is no dialog jenna and <UNK> have really small parts and i really wonder what richard <UNK> wanted when accepting a role here i think this is a film one must watch with the button on fast forward and watch only the <UNK> stuff just to be reminded of the old school c class horror movies
<START> john travolta the biggest <UNK> in the world and a mechanical bull what more can you ask for yeah you're probably not going to get many surprises or deep meaning in this one yet i have always found it fairly enjoyable to watch this redneck romance bud travolta and sissy debra <UNK> meet at <UNK> and fall in love they have all the difficulties you might expect a hardcore redneck couple to have the <UNK> scenes are fun with dancing mechanical bull riding and of course the required <UNK> it has a good 1980 country soundtrack featuring looking for love in all the wrong places the devil went down to georgia and hello texas by my favorite jimmy <UNK> break out your cowboy boots and have a boot <UNK> boogie br br out of 4
<START> i really enjoyed this movie typically ron howard who seems to like being associated with michael keaton love the scene when hunt travels to japan with his sales pitch <UNK> how did that get in there cheap laughs but great value
<START> this <UNK> comedy confronts a few bizarre characters especially of course the two leading characters jack lemmon plays felix a <UNK> whose wife lost him because she couldn't stand his cleaning and cooking attacks any longer so he tries to kill himself but every attempt fails walter matthau plays oscar his friend an <UNK> <UNK> sports reporter who lives in divorce from his ex wife in a bachelor apartment he offers his <UNK> friend felix a new home in his apartment and soon the trouble begins because two such contrary characters can't live together for a long time felix turns <UNK> <UNK> flat into a clean <UNK> flat he <UNK> and <UNK> the whole time after a short while oscar feels <UNK> <UNK> filmed in a theatrical way and excellent acted above all jack <UNK> play is wonderful he is the perfect clown he makes us laugh but in a <UNK> comic way look for the wonderful scene when both men invite their two female <UNK> for <UNK> because oscar has to touch something more <UNK> than a <UNK> ball while he is preparing the drinks felix sits with the two young ladies in the living room to get out of this embarrassing situation he starts to talk about the weather a minute later he changes the subject and talks about his ex wife and children suddenly he begins to <UNK> and when oscar comes back with the drinks there are three <UNK> people in the living room the film is full of such amusing and at the same time touching scenes an intelligent entertaining comedy with much heart 10 out of 10
<START> pure orson welles genius makes this one of the greatest of movies welles is drawn into a murder conspiracy only to be set up as the fall guy which is what he refers to with the sarcastic comment big <UNK> that i am plot is so complex that i still don't know whether the victim knew that his life was about to be lost the shootout scene in the carnival hall of mirrors is one of the most amazing ever filmed that scene alone is worth the price of admission this is the only time that rita hayworth ever played a complex yet believable character no one but welles would have had the nerve to cut her hair and <UNK> it <UNK> blond no one should miss this picture
<START> i'm a huge fan of war movies and as a vietnam combat vet have some experience with the technical details i worked with the bomb guys more than once and have nothing but respect for them other vets and iraq vets in particular have <UNK> the inaccuracies in this movie very well poetic license is one thing but this movie is a complete fantasy and fails badly because of it no bomb <UNK> unit or any unit would ever have <UNK> this rogue <UNK> for more than 5 minutes military <UNK> prize <UNK> and discipline for a reason it saves lives the opening scene particularly annoyed me the guy with the cell phone would have been shot immediately yelling stop <UNK> is not an effective <UNK> it got worse from there the scenes with the sniper were particularly <UNK> as others have noted your average <UNK> guy doesn't know jack about being a sniper and to think any arab sniper is that good really stretches the imagination kidnapping an arab businessman for some form of personal revenge just wouldn't happen somebody might shoot him but this kind of risk taking is limited to the movies i could go on but as i said others have pointed these things out in detail this is not a good movie and if it wins any awards at all it's a further reflection of why la la land is so named
<START> really bad movie the story is too simple and predictable and poor acting as a <UNK> br br this <UNK> hunter story is the worst that i have seen so far derek bliss jon bon <UNK> travels to mexico in search for some blood <UNK> he use some interesting weapons but nothing compared to blade and is part of some van <UNK> <UNK> hunters net ok but he work alone he's assigned to the pursuit of a powerful vampire queen that is searching some black <UNK> to perform a ritual which will <UNK> her to be <UNK> to <UNK> is almost a sequel of vampires 1998 directed by john carpenter and starred by james woods derek start his quest in the search of the queen with some new friends <UNK> diego <UNK> really bad acting also a teenager without experience father <UNK> <UNK> de la <UNK> a catholic priest <UNK> natasha wagner a particular vampire and ray collins darius <UNK> another expert vampire hunter so obviously in this adventure he isn't alone br br you can start feeling how this movie would be just looking at his lead actor jon bon <UNK> is a huge difference in the acting quality compared to james woods and then if you watch the film i don't recommend this part you will get involved in one of the more <UNK> stories totally predictable with terrible acting performances really bad special effects and incoherent events br br i deeply recommend not to see this film rent another movie see another channel go out with your friends etc br br 3 10
<START> the performances in this movie were fantastic the dialogue was great jason <UNK> delivered a fantastic performance as kid collins in this wonderful adaptation of the jim thompson novel far superior to the <UNK> which was a good movie this film really stayed true to the pulp fiction film noir roots from which the story came i recommend this movie to all film noir fans
<START> watching <UNK> brando on screen is like watching a master carpenter <UNK> intricate details into a piece of <UNK> <UNK> acting is the only thing that makes this movie watchable the plot is inane and laughable not comic the other big name actors seem to be making desperate attempts to give the characters they portray some <UNK> of humanity these characters have the humanity of wet cardboard everything about the technical side of this film is either mediocre or just plain awful the director throws freeze frame and slow motion shots about with <UNK> the incidental music is cartoonish and destroys any hint of dramatic effect it's not something i really look for in a movie but even the wardrobe was way off the <UNK> brando couldn't take focus away from the awful <UNK> they had him <UNK> out in i've heard this movie called david lynch esquire and <UNK> funny it is neither david lynch films are <UNK> of wicked creativity this film was in no way creative and don't confuse <UNK> with stupidity
<START> there is absolutely nothing in this movie that shows even the <UNK> <UNK> of talent nobody in it has ever tried acting before even the extras in the coffee shop look as if they've been glued in place nothing looks <UNK> the film quality is terrible most of the <UNK> takes place in narrow corridors or apartments with the cameraman <UNK> in as an <UNK> swinging some <UNK> camera backwards and <UNK> between <UNK> as they deliver their lines no <UNK> and no proper <UNK> either there sound quality is terrible even <UNK> <UNK> better than this at least they had proper equipment what plot there is simply gets lost in the production mess br br stick to home videos preferably made by some 5 year kid trying out the video feature on <UNK> new camera phone you will be in for a long search to find a movie more inept than this
<START> interesting mix of comments that it would be hard to add anything <UNK> to however i'll try this was a very good action film with some great set pieces you'll note i <UNK> the genre i didn't <UNK> about the lack of characterisation and i didn't <UNK> the acting enjoy if for what it is people a well above average action film i could go on but i've made my comment
<START> unless you are already familiar with the pop stars who star in this film save yourself the time and stop reading this review after you've reached the end of the next sentence br br forget you ever stumbled upon this film and go watch something else br br but if you insist on reading consider br br lame vehicle for japanese teen idol pretty boys featuring nonsensical convoluted plot that drags out for an <UNK> amount of time until you're ready to scream br br nothing in this film makes sense it's an endless series of people expressing various emotions from joy to anger from happiness to tragedy for no good reason we can obviously see something incredibly dramatic is happening but we just don't give a crap why 'cause there's no <UNK> br br by the time this film is over you will be sick and tired of these stupid <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> faces you'll be <UNK> at having spent all this time watching them smile <UNK> cry look mysterious be serious and any other pointless expression they slap on their faces br br that some moron would ever go so far as to refer to this piece of insipid trash as being the soul of any of its actors should prove to you beyond the shadow of a doubt what the trailer and countless <UNK> comments on this site will not tell you br br only the converted mindless <UNK> will like this film the majority of them teenage girls with a <UNK> <UNK> for anything <UNK> <UNK> would have a field day br br unless you're one of these mindless fans stay the hell away from this abomination
<START> hardly the stuff dreams are made of is this pursuit of the <UNK> ring by a naive hustler jon <UNK> and his lame con man sidekick dustin hoffman soon to <UNK> a friendship based on basic survival skills br br a daring film for its time and a foremost example of the kind of gritty landscape being explored in the more graphic films of the '60s symbolic of the end of innocence in american films since it was the only x rated film to win a best picture oscar br br jon <UNK> is the male hustler who comes to the big city expecting to find women an easy way to make money when they fight over his body but soon finds the city is a cold place with no welcome <UNK> for his <UNK> <UNK> by a lame con man dustin hoffman he goes through a series of <UNK> comic adventures that leave him <UNK> and bitter ready to leave the confines of a cold water flat for the sunshine promised in florida a land his friend <UNK> dreams of living in br br but even in this final quest the two are losers john <UNK> has directed with <UNK> from a brilliant script by <UNK> salt and john <UNK> haunting midnight cowboy theme adds to the poignant moments of search and desperation br br <UNK> up a true american classic honestly facing a tough subject and daring to show the <UNK> of certain aspects of city life
<START> very good except for the ending which was a huge disappointment br br the script was very good as was the acting the visuals were often very grainy but this in a way added to the film as the snowy features were in good places that helped create a mood towards the film this affect was ruined by the extremely unbelievable ending br br i was going to give this film an 8 out of ten but the ending knocked it down a point to 7 because it seemed to <UNK> <UNK> from the first 75 minutes of the movie and seemed quite forced at the end to make the film makers look clever br br this movie though was much better than films with quite a lot larger budgets and seemed to be filmed like a home movie with some extra equipment not much in the way of special effects as these go but for suspense it was very good
<START> haven't seen the film since first released but it was memorable performances by rip torn and <UNK> farrell were superb photography excellent moving story line and everything else about it was of the highest standard yet it seems to have been pretty much forgotten br br maybe because uk is an odd market for it but i haven't seen the film on tv or video which is sad has it had more success in us where it might rightly be seen as a quite accurate historical drama br br always <UNK> that 50 of a good film is the music and though i'm not certain i think the title theme was a simple but moving <UNK> solo of what a friend we have in jesus the film then went on to <UNK> that am i right or wrong
<START> i suppose that today this film has relevance because it was an early <UNK> loren film she was 19 years old when the film was made in 1953 br br i viewed this film because i wanted to see some of <UNK> <UNK> early work i was surprised when she came on camera having had her skin <UNK> over in brown makeup to resemble an <UNK> princess surely today this would have been viewed as a <UNK> and to be avoided in movie making it actually became annoying watching ms loren in skin color paint throughout the film br br yes this film would have been better made if the real opera singers had made this movie then the singing and the actual facial gestures of the real artists would have been apparent i <UNK> the comments by others about whether the real opera singers are older and <UNK> in weight br br as beautiful as ms loren was at age 19 and still is today the film would have been better received as though it were being performed on the stage after all we don't see beautiful young people on stage with old opera singers back stage singing from behind the curtain do not <UNK> the success of using heavy weight opera singers one only has to refer to the most artistically produced television commercial for the j g <UNK> company with the opera singers on stage singing so <UNK> the <UNK> of the <UNK> product this is one of the best and entertaining tv commercials produced to date br br the quality of the movie print also makes this production of a somewhat lesser quality the color <UNK> has faded much and that can not be helped br br to improve this film on dvd the production company should add english language subtitles so that we who do not speak italian can know what the lyrics are saying it would help the story and teach it more than the narrator giving 30 seconds of introduction to the scenes br br watch this film not because of the story of <UNK> nor the fact that this is an opera aside from ms <UNK> loren none of her co actors are known nor remembered by this writer instead watch this movie if you are a fan of ms loren and wish to see her at age 19 no matter what the production is br br larry from <UNK>
<START> i'm sorry to all the fans but this is a useless movie the acting is bad even wooden it over <UNK> the fright factor early on and doesn't exactly work i think there was supposed to be a twist at the end but it just ended up being <UNK> confusing what the hell the dude who was killing everyone was one of the hunted try again br br its hardly original and it isn't even particularly good as a straight slasher and that's saying something br br i think whoever did the <UNK> whoever wrote the script and whoever thought of the concept should be mercilessly fired and <UNK> br br don't watch this movie if someone puts this on at a party throw the disc out the window and put on a good horror movie like silence of the <UNK> or the shining
<START> as the jacket <UNK> this film is <UNK> shot and masterfully edited and yes it is <UNK> beautiful the <UNK> that we perceive in stoic rock and in the <UNK> <UNK> and flow of water frames the <UNK> works from <UNK> hands so that in their very <UNK> they point to eternity br br and so the beauty of his compositions haunt us with just a touch of melancholy woven in or in the words of matthew arnold from <UNK> beach br br listen you hear the grating <UNK> of <UNK> which the waves draw back and <UNK> at their return up the high <UNK> begin and <UNK> and then again begin with <UNK> <UNK> slow and bring the eternal note of sadness in br br at one point near the end of the film goldsworthy says that words do their job but what i'm doing here says a lot more as a <UNK> myself i take no offense and not for a moment do i think him <UNK> because the combination of form and time and change and <UNK> and color and composition that goldsworthy <UNK> and <UNK> creates is indeed something more than mere words can say br br at another point he remarks on what is here to stay and what isn't that is his theme br br i think that artists sometime in the <UNK> century became <UNK> aware of how <UNK> even the greatest works of art are compared to the vast <UNK> of <UNK> time and so they began to reflect this understanding by <UNK> works that were deliberately <UNK> the idea was that by <UNK> how short lived are even the <UNK> works of humans a sense of the <UNK> of art would be expressed br br perhaps part of the <UNK> of <UNK> work is in this sort of expression he <UNK> <UNK> some form of straw or leaves where the tide will reach it or places it in the river where it will be swept away and in this process is <UNK> both the composition and its <UNK> br br both the <UNK> and the timeless are necessary for us to understand our world and our place within it and it is important that these works be done within the context of nature so that what is composed is set within what is natural thus the walls of stone and the eggs of stone that goldsworthy <UNK> are silent and solid yet we know that they are not <UNK> to eternity but instead will stay for some <UNK> length of time and then <UNK> and return to a state much like that which existed before we came along br br this is art as art should be akin to the spiritual br br in a sense <UNK> work is an <UNK> understanding it is an experience purely of time and form in a sense his work answers <UNK> famous poem <UNK> by saying even as the tide <UNK> the work away and even as the river <UNK> the expression even so the art lives on because of our experience of it similarly one thinks of <UNK> sand paintings so carefully composed and <UNK> out and then just as they are so beautifully and <UNK> finished they are given to the wind so that we might know that all is <UNK> br br yet in the modern world these works of art endure in photos and videos goldsworthy is an accomplished photographer of necessity i would say and all his works even the <UNK> ones he tells us are photographed so that he can look back at them in a more <UNK> mood and see what he has accomplished and what he has not br br this cinematic production directed by thomas <UNK> with the beautiful and appropriately haunting music by fred <UNK> is not to be missed it is one of the most beautiful documentaries that i have ever seen and one of the most spiritual
<START> when you see boris karloff and bela lugosi as co stars you expect to find a well done horror movie but this was actually quite different representing as it did what i would describe as an early effort at science fiction karloff and lugosi both play scientists rukh and <UNK> respectively <UNK> to an extent until rukh wins <UNK> over with a <UNK> that proves his great theory the science here was to say the least a bit rough around the edges thus science fiction with the emphasis on the fiction but somehow rukh <UNK> some sort of ray from <UNK> that allows him to look at the earth several thousand million years ago in that pre historic time a huge <UNK> <UNK> into africa leaving <UNK> of a substance the scientists call <UNK> x which can <UNK> and destroy a large portion of the movie is set rather <UNK> in africa on a search for the <UNK> <UNK> which rukh eventually finds and <UNK> to create a great weapon unfortunately <UNK> himself with some sort of disease that makes him a great weapon as well br br karloff and lugosi were both pretty good here lugosi pulls off a role in which he's the good guy pretty well although i frankly found him a bit unconvincing especially during the scenes set in africa the story also <UNK> along a bit and while it held my attention it didn't <UNK> me given that this is really a sci fi rather than a horror flick and that sci fi was in its very early stages i suppose the movie needs to be cut a bit of slack it was ok nothing more but also nothing less than that 4 10
<START> i rented end game having never heard of it but i'm fond of political thrillers so i thought i'd give it a shot after doing some research on the movie i found that it had initially been intended for theatrical release but instead had gone <UNK> to dvd after seeing it i'm thinking no wonder the movie is shocking in its <UNK> the plot and the characters are <UNK> i figured out <UNK> by the half way mark but the ending was a <UNK> ball i have to say i didn't expect it to end quite the way it did but that's not a point in its favor the more predictable ending would have been <UNK> to one that is so bad perhaps the film makers saw how predictable the film was and so they decided to throw in a twist even one that made the movie even worse br br stay away i want the 5 98 and my <UNK> minutes back
<START> some spoilers i have not read the james m cain novel the <UNK> always rings <UNK> on which this movie was based so i cannot compare this film version to it but i have seen and love the 1946 us version also entitled <UNK> br br even better is this gem from italy which i have read was <UNK> in editing because of too many blatant references to the fascist regime well no matter  what is left is a fine piece of cinema apparently the <UNK> of the neo <UNK> movement in film making one can certainly see why  despite whatever harsh editing did go on a <UNK> sense of societal and cultural as well as personal <UNK> remains hanging heavy over the protagonists who therefore face many limits in life br br consider gino the young drifter not well educated unemployed and <UNK> to <UNK> away stealing and <UNK> people in order to get by his one pair of shoes so <UNK> as to be virtually useless br br in giovanna he sees a way out yet he should have kept going as giovanna is <UNK> by her <UNK> marriage to an older man with some money her job working at the <UNK> for her husband <UNK> away behind the bar and in the kitchen and her sex in the past she had limited <UNK> and decided to marry the restaurant gas station owner <UNK> <UNK> played by juan de <UNK> anyway knowing that he would not make her happy she tells gino that she feels sick every time <UNK> touches her br br on the <UNK> of helping <UNK> fix his car and sending him into the village to buy a needed part which he has in fact <UNK> gino wins <UNK> favor promising also to fix the broken water <UNK>  water <UNK> life or lack thereof and is left alone with giovanna they immediately start a <UNK> passionate yet <UNK> love affair br br gino soon feels <UNK> by the relationship and feels the need to move on again when giovanna <UNK> that they <UNK> of her husband wanting no part of it gino leaves town on a train ride that he cannot afford kindly paid for him by another gypsy type man named <UNK> a fellow train passenger to gino <UNK> represents a sort of freedom and they become friends <UNK> also <UNK> <UNK> morality and conscience traveling and finding work at a carnival together finally gino has steady <UNK> to his <UNK> he is not yet over his love for giovanna a month has passed when <UNK> and his wife go to the carnival and <UNK> <UNK> gino to go back <UNK> to live and work with them again as he is handy to have around br br too weak <UNK> to resist knowing this will reunite he and giovanna gino agrees and goes back to stay with the couple after a while he gives in to <UNK> demands to get rid of her husband once the evil deed is done giovanna becomes more cold blooded than ever seeming to have very little conscience while guilt and shame eat away at gino for hurting a man who never did him any harm as much as he wants to leave her  he does again briefly they are now <UNK> linked and must face the consequences br br i liked the way the <UNK> character came back into <UNK> life to act as a judge of his <UNK>  that was very good and interesting adding another dimension to the story br br while the <UNK> u s version with <UNK> turner and john garfield gets a bit lost in a <UNK> of <UNK> characters especially the cops and the lawyers ossessione does well to concentrate much more on the psychological effects of the crime on the lovers alone this gives the final outcome even more <UNK> and makes a powerful statement <UNK> the <UNK> inherent in the society in which the characters must live br br a minor <UNK> the amount of time hardly any that <UNK> before <UNK> love is <UNK> by the lovers how quickly they kill the husband there is no <UNK> first attempt as in the u s version <UNK> very quick to <UNK> relationship with the dancer hooker  they quickly <UNK> their love as well and she is willing to risk a great deal for a man she just met  all rather unrealistic isn't it i found this time frame problem quite distracting  it made me think that i must have missed something somewhere otherwise well worth the viewer's time the acting and direction were both uniformly good throughout recommended
<START> one of the most disgusting films i have ever seen i wanted to vomit after watching it i saw this movie in my american history class and the purpose was to see an <UNK> on the life of a farmer in the west during the late <UNK> what we saw were pigs being shot and then slaughtered human birth <UNK> oh and at the end there was a live birth of a <UNK> and let me tell you that the birth itself wasn't too bad but the numerous <UNK> that came out drove most people in my class to the bathroom the story itself was ok the premise of the story is a widow and her daughter and they move to the west to be a house keeper of this cowboy they live a life of <UNK> and it is an interesting a pretty accurate view of life in the west during the late <UNK> but if you have a choice do not see this movie
<START> tony <UNK> a <UNK> hit man or professional killer decides to leave the business and his former <UNK> do not agree in terms of content this highly enjoyable action movie doesn't have one in terms of sheer amusement it is <UNK> is very melodramatic violent quite brutal the car chases are notable <UNK> is an <UNK> yet very likable <UNK> better than the current <UNK> trash that gets the same label it comes from <UNK> rather short <UNK> with the italian b cinema of the '70s it carefully uses <UNK> tough guy persona <UNK> to the gallery of bad ass thugs that he made in his youth br br i enjoyed very much the fact that <UNK> made this film that he had a role in a good <UNK> flick br br the score is very fine with a good <UNK> <UNK> felt that gusto that the italians had for the film considered as a <UNK> work where the musical art has an important part br br in tony <UNK> big guns no way out the very appealing erika <UNK> <UNK> years in '73 appears as an <UNK> hooker meanwhile <UNK> girlfriend sandra is played by carla <UNK> a <UNK> that practically left the movies after <UNK> br br <UNK> is interestingly <UNK> ambitious visual conception some <UNK> peculiar angles the movie was directed by the prolific <UNK> <UNK> the one who made also zorro the <UNK> comedy needless to mention that these two films tony <UNK> 1973 and zorro are very unlike the first one is a bloody melodramatic violent action movie the second is a lighthearted comedy more <UNK> to a spoof though remarkably coherent and <UNK> made <UNK> <UNK> directed films like kiss kiss bang bang 1966 sons of satan the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> la <UNK> <UNK> tough guys 1974 <UNK> express 1976 etc
<START> warning this review contains a spoiler br br wow almost <UNK> bad note i said almost this is nothing more than lots of random scenes strung together in a loose attempt at a story the protagonists you cannot call them heroes shoot innocent <UNK> for their food and also rob same for similar reasons there's also tons of <UNK> which was a <UNK> for me spoiler it seems as if the <UNK> who only is topless and not naked as other reviews claim gets killed early on but miraculously <UNK> adding another 70 minutes of audience torture i can't shake the feeling that animal abuse occurred numerous times in this cinematic abomination if you're in a mst3k mood you might find this watchable but for the most part you can forget it go rent the original conan dvd instead
<START> what a let down this started with an intriguing mystery and interesting characters admittedly it moved along at the speed of a <UNK> but i was nevertheless <UNK> and kept watching br br david <UNK> is always good value and he <UNK> jones were good leads the muslim aspects were very interesting we were <UNK> with possible terrorist connections br br but then <UNK> character was killed off and all the air left the balloon the last episode was dull dull dull the whole thing turned out to be very small beer and the <UNK> was unbelievably feeble br br five hours of my life for that my advice watch paint dry instead
<START> it's amazing that this movie turns out to be in one of my <UNK> after all it is by far the number 1 worst movie i have ever seen br br not only have i ever been this bored before luckily not for more then 1 5 hours the pre adolescent attempts at humor that feature it are not even close to getting but one of the <UNK> of my mouth slightly <UNK> after the first very awkward part you tend to hope that the other parts will be at least slightly better you hope in vain it only goes downhill from there br br the movie has no story worth telling whatsoever and repeats this non story three times one can only hope that by some miracle all remaining copies of this movie are lost forever and <UNK> harris never lays his hands on a camera again
<START> an excellent cast makes this movie work all of the characters are developed exceedingly well and it's clear that the actors enjoyed filming this movie br br it's not quite the comedy i expected much more a lighthearted look at the attempt to <UNK> youthful glory than <UNK> humor for music fans there are quite a few subtle references that in themselves are intelligently funny br br i hate drawing direct comparisons to other movies but so much of this movie reminded me of alan parker films i can't help it imagine if the <UNK> actually did make it big and then tried to <UNK> said glory 25 years later
<START> at the end of the movie i still don't know whether i liked it or not so was the case with most of the reviewers but none the less i still feel that the movie is worth a 7 for the amount of efforts put in br br long ago i read a quote there are 2 kind of writers 1 those who think and write and 2 those write and make the readers think while here i feel that guy ritchie took this way too literally and left all the thinking for the audience br br i felt that the movie was a mixed bag filled with some of the <UNK> <UNK> and fight club br br it is definitely a classic something which no one understands but <UNK> br br what i don't understand why <UNK> jake green had a <UNK> thats how it all began all the <UNK> and mysteries in the movie have been taken care of except this one br br well if you are reading this review to find the solution as what this movie was all about i'll post the very midnight it strikes me and if you are still deciding to watch this movie or not then answer this first when you come across a puzzle labeled as <UNK> one has ever <UNK> would you like to try br br i would
<START> i've seen most of <UNK> <UNK> work and i've come to the conclusion that he has a knack for action scenes are <UNK> and fast often combining elements of martial arts gun fights and samurai fights with camera work that effectively captures the on screen carnage with versus and <UNK> <UNK> demonstrated that creativity and showed that he his more than capable of working with a low budget so what happened in alive to be more blunt the answer would be nothing nothing happened in alive it was a two hours plus movie with little to no action and little to no characters and plot br br adapted from a comic book by <UNK> <UNK> alive is an examination of the life of one <UNK> <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> a death row convict who survives his execution he is then given a choice of either to repeat the execution or to subject himself in a bizarre series of experiments he chooses the latter and soon after that is placed in a room along with a rapist and later with a girl infected with a strange <UNK> that in exchange for it's <UNK> humanity <UNK> supernatural powers <UNK> at some point that <UNK> moves into <UNK> the bad thing is that doesn't happen very soon br br similar to <UNK> alive sets it's first half in establishing the basic exposition characters are introduced their motivations are set and their relations between each other are <UNK> the whole thing even takes place in just one set the first major problem of that comparison is that while <UNK> was just a 70 minute movie alive drags on for more than two hours thus making the first part over one hour long that length could have been justified had the characters been made a bit more interesting but alas that is not the case dialogue is dry monotonous delivered without any sense of emotion or depth characters themselves aren't much interesting there were some small attempts at making alive a bit more moral ambiguous but in the end it all came down to the classic evil government people against super powered protagonist whom yes you guessed it saves the girl in the end like i previously said the entire film practically takes place at just one set and after two hours that does get boring even worse the set design itself wasn't even interesting to begin with and doesn't do much to improve on other aspects of the film br br now after that first part is over one might think that <UNK> would at least make some entertaining action scenes to make up for the boring beginning sadly that is not the case the two only fights are actually <UNK> of similar fights from hollywood movies complete with bullet time effects and psychic powers they're just not interesting or fun <UNK> creativity from versus is gone the small set even limits his often very impressive camera work and it all <UNK> down into generic and <UNK> fights a shame really br br evidently <UNK> was better on all accounts and <UNK> had learned something from alive so it wasn't at least a total loss watching this movie if only to understand the errors made how to fix them and create a better more entertaining movie
<START> what noise fails to do is get us to understand its character tim robbins plays an obsessive new <UNK> who can't deal with the <UNK> noises of the city any longer particularly car <UNK> it's an odd idea for a film which has about as much creative credibility as death wish it is clever at points particularly a scene in which our hero is trying to read through <UNK> i'm too stupid to be understanding this he reads and <UNK> a paragraph in confusion we read it and don't get it either just then a car alarm goes off throughout the movie is constant <UNK> of <UNK> and city noises though all in all it does little to help us understand our hero who allows this all to ruin his marriage and gets distracted with side plots instead of digging deeper into his persona br br the film making itself is too oblivious to notice its own sound problems shoddy editing and visible boom <UNK> no noise isn't all bad william hurt is at least colorful at least the ending doesn't fall flat overall it drives home a <UNK> point one you haven't probably thought of at least i hadn't though all in all ninety minutes long it couldn't have ended sooner the story dragged on and seemed to be lost as soon as it started br br this is another one of those movies that you might see at a film festival but probably won't get picked up for distribution check it out on dvd if you're really partial to someone involved in the project otherwise skip it
<START> this movie had a imdb rating of 8 1 so i expected much more from it it starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous but before the movie is half way through it begins to drag and everything becomes <UNK> predictable the characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie but we get to know them a little too well they become caricatures not real people at all this is the same story i've seen hundreds of times only told here with slightly different circumstances the thing is i could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog weren't so stale br br the only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations and unfortunately that was also the case with dead letter office hopefully this movie will end up in the dead movie office soon
<START> given the history of the director of this movie it is hard to believe that this was such a painfully bad movie to sit through i was at the european premiere last night and one of the executive producers was there he was yet to see the movie and boy was he in for a surprise i have not read the book that this is based upon nor do i know if it highly rated or appreciated but i have read captain <UNK> <UNK> and given how poorly that was adapted for screen and how bad this movie was i can only presume that something similar has happened here the acting wasn't bad albeit that there were a couple too many raised <UNK> from farrell honestly i can't believed how little i cared for any character in this movie situations play out on the screen in an empty sequence of <UNK> donald <UNK> part <UNK> a few scenes where he opens a door says something and <UNK> it again i kept looking at my watch when i wasn't cringing at the dialogue on the screen i have never walked out on a movie but i was tempted to start during this i gave this movie a score of <UNK> for reasons which seem <UNK> shallow to me but these are the best things that i can say about this movie the first is that i really enjoyed the all too short <UNK> scene and the second is that <UNK> <UNK> got naked and looked beautiful i can say little else positive about this movie don't ask the dust anything it can't talk
<START> i saw this film at the chicago <UNK> film festival to pick up on the previous <UNK> remarks the claustrophobic feel and off colors of the film is i sense quite intentional and conveys the sense of limited space drab architecture overall <UNK> that <UNK> the urban environment of most people in eastern and central europe a bit <UNK> <UNK> project style is how i'd describe it and this is how many people live on the <UNK> of larger cities i can't say that i'm familiar with <UNK> romania where the action <UNK> but i have visited and lived in eastern europe for six months br br when i visited russia as a student for a <UNK> my entire group had to drag their <UNK> seven stories up the <UNK> of a <UNK> student <UNK> building just as the heroine does when moving in with a woman because the <UNK> weren't working but i do <UNK> with the reviewer that the <UNK> and muted colors it's overdone for there are to be sure beautiful historic buildings parks <UNK> you can find in <UNK> or in any historic city center of eastern europe and <UNK> didn't get much of any footage in this film for me watching this film conveys well the <UNK> that i would feel during my half year stay there feeling trapped and limited it makes you see why someone would want to <UNK> and find a better life just as people if hope to escape from a united states urban ghetto br br also given the climate of <UNK> say circa us in the 1980s the two young women who fall in love with one another are forced to keep their love a very private matter hence the focus on their interaction in the apartment br br it's remarkable and commendable in my view that this <UNK> themed film was even made in romania and i find the complaint of the previous reviewer about the poor film quality quite <UNK> and <UNK> it's unlikely that the director and producer <UNK> up much government support and funding for their film and they did the best they could with their likely limited resources the actors were fairly good and believable the dialog was overall well done and i could identity with these women br br the film offers an added twist to that of forbidden love between two young women <UNK> an energetic fun loving free spirit with a dark <UNK> secret her admiration and love for an abusive incestuous brother <UNK> falls in love with alexandra a bright <UNK> idealistic young woman who moves to <UNK> to begin her college studies <UNK> attract and their personalities seem to <UNK> one another though there is some tension between the ambitious <UNK> intellectual alexandra and <UNK> who seems to be attending college to please her parents keeping their love hidden from their parents seems <UNK> though we don't get any sense of the tension it requires nor do we ever see or meet any other students hard to believe and the tension keeping their love secret would have <UNK> the chief threat to their love is <UNK> brother and her difficulty in trying to severe her relation to him but <UNK> love for alexandra seems to give her the strength she needs to finally severe this bond or does it that's what the suspense of the film focuses on as the narrative develops and i won't say how it concludes br br ironically <UNK> love sickness isn't love for another woman but her <UNK> incestuous love for her brother thus loving a woman offers the potential cure to the sickness of loving a sibling br br though this feel of this film is <UNK> and claustrophobic overly confined to interactions between <UNK> and alexandra it was still engaging and moving to watch so i'll give it a 7
<START> you can't imagine how i looked forward to king of the ants as a massive gordon fan i <UNK> the european premiere with wicked anticipation especially since i loved <UNK> <UNK> last achievement so much king of the ants premiered here in my country and it was gordon himself who came to present it unfortunately i couldn't go and <UNK> him for it afterwards king of the ants is his most uninspired and mediocre film to date really the quality level never <UNK> ordinary tv thriller standards the plot outline is terribly routine and with the exception of a few poor scenes the typical gordon touch is never recognized on top of that the already weak script has more holes than a swiss bowl of cheese it involves a young wannabe crook who's hired to commit a murder so he does and of course they're not paying him and of course he falls in love with the <UNK> wife and of course he <UNK> himself only the sequences in which the guy <UNK> in a spiral of madness are worth a mention and they're the only ones reminding you of the fact you're still watching a stuart gordon film the acting performances are below average with <UNK> as the heroic <UNK> george norm <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> bastard and <UNK> <UNK> as the good hearted sex bomb extremely illogical things happen constantly and the <UNK> of the story becomes irritating very quickly while the make up effects aren't enough to even satisfy amateur horror fans i read a few other comments on king of the ants claiming it's <UNK> best since it finally is a thought provoking and mature film well if that's the case i rather stay immature and give re animator another viewing thank you very much oh well i guess every good director runs out of steam and inspiration eventually too bad it also <UNK> stuart gordon
<START> so we get so see added footage of brando interesting but not exactly oscar worthy stuff <UNK> york was hardly a <UNK> new scene where lois finds out clark is superman is slightly unbelievable in that he doesn't notice that there are <UNK> coming out of the gun instead of real bullets real bullets would have <UNK> his clothes and then <UNK> off him onto the floor but forget that let's listen to <UNK> make fun of <UNK> version that made more logical sense the president talks of the <UNK> <UNK> the washington <UNK> when it was originally <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that scene made that line quite absurd <UNK> freedom of the press line sounded silly compared to care to step outside which was delivered better and had a fitting connection to <UNK> earlier scene in the truck stop then there is the ending with the turn back the world to go back in time effect it turned back everything in the whole movie and made you wonder where exactly the rocket aimed for <UNK> n j ever went since it doesn't free <UNK> and company any more
<START> i can still remember first seeing this on tv i couldn't believe <UNK> let it on i had to own it a lot of the humor will be lost on non <UNK> but give it a go br br since finishing the back of the y series matt and chris have gone on to bigger and better things <UNK> greatest dare devil <UNK> randy campbell has often appeared on the british tv series balls of steel yes he still f <UNK> up all his stunts because he is too drunk br br also the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> voodoo have since released 2 albums brown <UNK> and back in brown the band consists of members of the back of the y team and <UNK> such as 'i would give you one of my beers but i've only got 6 ' and <UNK> weren't even born in the <UNK> continue their humor br br the south by <UNK> film festival also featured their feature length film 'the devil made me do <UNK> which will be released early 2008 in <UNK> br br all up if you don't find these guys funny then you can just f k off
<START> ok this has got 2 be one of the worst excuses 4 a movie that i have ever had the misfortune of watching like all other olsen twins movies with the possible exception of new york minute this film had no story <UNK> plot holes <UNK> <UNK> acting and bad filming even in case you haven't guessed yet i hate mary kate and ashley the only reason i watched this was because i was really bored and nothing else was on i wonder if the twins will ever stop making the same stereotypical movies where they have an unbelievably stupid adventure in an exotic location and save the day meanwhile getting the help of two cute guys who <UNK> over them immediately the least they could would be to have a guy 4 1 of them or have them both falling 4 the same guy the plot in this story was so <UNK> and just plain dumb even a <UNK> could see the flaws in it maybe they should split up and start making films <UNK> or maybe films with a different kind of story anyone who liked this movie was no offense either really stupid really artificial or has not seen any really good movie or maybe they are really smart and just have bad cinematic choices either way i would not recommend this movie to my worst nemesis for a good movie experience the only thing it is good 4 is some <UNK> splitting laughter at the pathetic attempts to be cool if you watch for laughs it's hilarious basically i give it 0 or less
<START> when our local tv station first launched it filled a lot of its schedule with old british programming lock up your daughters was <UNK> aired and i <UNK> by the opening few seconds of the film popped in a blank tape best thing i ever did br br the actors are beautifully suited to their characters and bring them to delightful life complete with appropriate accents christopher <UNK> <UNK> will leave you in <UNK> as will <UNK> and her family double <UNK> abound plot line <UNK> within <UNK> mix and match the characters hilarious sight gags <UNK> in every scene and <UNK> comments are made on a regular basis br br i showed the film to friends a few years ago and they called the piece a lost treasure as much for the cast as for the story to this day i can crack up just thinking about the dialog should this gem ever find its way to a dvd release i'll be at the front of the line
<START> it is often only after years pass that we can look back and see those stars who are truly stars as that french film critic whose name escapes me said there is no garbo there is no <UNK> there is only louise brooks and there is thank heavens louise brooks this is the third of her european masterpieces but it is also an exceptional film for being one if not the first french <UNK> for following a script written by famed <UNK> <UNK> for reportedly being finished the direction that is by <UNK> <UNK> and for <UNK> the voice of edith <UNK> before she was well known so much talent working on and in a film how couldn't it turn out to be a masterpiece and that's what this film is it's a shame louise brooks was <UNK> by hollywood when she came back to the states so much talent cast so <UNK> by the <UNK> in the film in addition to getting to watch louise brooks in action it's great to see pictures of paris <UNK> 1930 and to hear <UNK> young voice i never get tired of this film
<START> <UNK> <UNK> one of the most respected <UNK> directors of that time made films full of beautiful scenes delicate love and with respect to all that is precious in life br br nowadays if people should hear about him they associate the name of <UNK> with <UNK> trilogy 1955 1956 1957 however he made other excellent films like <UNK> <UNK> 1958 <UNK> heaven 1958 and definitely this one <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> showing the young years of queen victoria although it deals with a slightly different theme than <UNK> films i do not see many differences between this movie and <UNK> they are strikingly similar br br the movie is almost identical the style the music the photography in fact the crew are almost the same anton <UNK> bruno <UNK> br br the cast <UNK> <UNK> one of the first main roles it was a lovely introduction to her role of <UNK> since this film was made one year before the first part of the trilogy about the <UNK> <UNK> it is also a film where <UNK> plays with her mother <UNK> schneider but <UNK> <UNK> was not the first director who cast <UNK> to play with her mum <UNK> debut <UNK> der <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1953 was her performance with her mother too therefore there were some voices that <UNK> began her <UNK> career on the <UNK> of her mother's fame indeed there is some truth in it br br again like in <UNK> this film shows love very gently victoria meets prince albert in a little <UNK> in <UNK> their sympathy is based on pure <UNK> in dance and gentle smiles and now what would it be showed like only sex but is it the only thing love is based on br br i am grateful to <UNK> <UNK> for these movies they had a soul and a message some people may call them <UNK> but i will never give up <UNK> these films they are impressive unfortunately highly underrated
<START> how could 4 out of 16 prior voters give this movie a 10 how could more than half the prior voters give it a 7 or higher who is voting here i can only assume it is primarily kids very young kids the fact is that this is a bad movie in every way the story is stupid the acting is hard to even think of as acting the characters are <UNK> and the dialogue is terrible i saw this one rainy afternoon on the sci fi channel in the sad event that it is ever <UNK> i suggest you read a book instead
<START> possibly the best movie ever created in the history of jeffrey combs career and one that should be looked upon by all talent in hollywood for his <UNK> charisma and <UNK> he brings through his characters and his knowledge of acting
<START> i wonder how much this movie actually has got to do with the 1984 movie bachelor party starring tom hanks is this movie even an official sequel this movie is lacking in every department and you're obviously better off not watching it br br for a comedy this movie simply isn't good or funny enough it relies mostly on the character's their stereotypical <UNK> rather then the movie actually features some good original and funny moments br br of course there also is very little story present and the movie nude breast than script pages you just keep waiting for things to finally start off there is a main plot line in it somewhere but that one is so terribly unoriginal and gets executed so poorly in the movie that it feels more as if it's something non existent i guess there even is a message and moral story in it somewhere but this again is so terribly unoriginal and poorly done in the movie that it simply does not work out br br it's basically a typical teenage comedy with lots of sex jokes and nudity only without the teenage main characters which makes the story all the more sad and tasteless the movie makes some really wrong jokes that are misplaced for any type of movie br br i regret ever watching this br br 3 10
<START> the first noticeable problem about this <UNK> titled film is its casting ann nelson plays the grandma here three years after this she would star in airplane as the woman who hangs herself while listening to robert <UNK> <UNK> for julie <UNK> i could not get that image out of my head br br matt boston is a fifteen year old with problems he has <UNK> his mother had a nervous breakdown his grandfather had a massive heart attack a chain smoking psychiatrist decides to find out what the devil is going on with this family first she <UNK> grandma nelson nelson tells a tale in flashback that fills the entire first half of the film br br she and grandpa bought an <UNK> cheap and drive it around to all the tourist traps in desert california the <UNK> soon has a mind of its own going off the road and such then large <UNK> begin <UNK> themselves at it the elderly couple are appropriately afraid but stay in the vehicle in order to move the plot along br br eventually grandpa has a heart attack after being stranded on the <UNK> roof when it goes for another <UNK> ride br br <UNK> mom begins talking to some native american <UNK> she has lying around the house she <UNK> herself an author and makes <UNK> notes about the <UNK> corpses the psychiatrist reads the detailed notes and uses her imagination to fill in the <UNK> we see the mother semi flip out but her mental breakdown occurs <UNK> much like <UNK> heart attack br br finally the patient de resistance little matt matt goes under the <UNK> gun and tells his own tale he thinks mom is <UNK> out this was made in 1977 apparently mom is making the <UNK> bodies of the native american <UNK> sort of fly through the air one hits matt like a <UNK> hits a <UNK> and matt begins acting all crazy br br the psychiatrist takes grandma and matt into the desert matt is inexplicably in a wheelchair now and the trio confront the unseen and unexplained forces br br <UNK> has no sense of scene construction the one pro here involves the <UNK> stranded in a salt flat in the desert in the distance the couple notice some <UNK> rolling toward the <UNK> this is a pretty creepy little scene that is eventually <UNK> as the <UNK> begin <UNK> themselves toward the vehicle the special effects become obvious br br the scenes where the <UNK> runs off the highway then back on again take forever the scenes where grandpa is trapped on the <UNK> roof as it <UNK> down a dirt road takes forever mom's conversations with the mummy take forever <UNK> out of body experiences take forever this film takes forever br br i was tempted to hit the fast forward button at least a dozen times as scenes dragged on it was obvious <UNK> was padding cut the fat here and this would have <UNK> in at an hour the final explanation that the <UNK> spirits were trying to kill those close to matt never holds water did they inhabit the <UNK> the film maker never brings up the fact that the spirits are no good at their murderous ways they never kill anybody br br as i kept thinking of nelson in airplane i also thought of other movies anything to keep me from falling asleep during this one boston is terrible as the kid playing a fifteen year old as a cute ten year old who has a smart <UNK> line for all these adults who fall over themselves loving him br br in the end <UNK> has written and directed a mess the title is just the beginning of this exercise in making the audience feel ill at ease this is not scary and like the ghosts you too can still walk away from this tape at the video store br br this is <UNK> and contains some physical violence and mild profanity
<START> stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so i am happy to see any of their films basically a man at a horn factory is the fourth to crack and soon enough ollie cracks with all the horn noises he is <UNK> at home with stan by his side needing quiet and the doctor james <UNK> phones to say he is coming over to check on ollie after <UNK> <UNK> and electricity is muddled up by a cross eyed <UNK> the doctor comes in for a check up and after some <UNK> he <UNK> drinking <UNK> milk and getting some sea air on the ocean after stan <UNK> some <UNK> playing hanging out the window by the phone <UNK> and a car crash he and ollie to a <UNK> to rent a boat they keep the boat on the <UNK> trying to milk a goat and stan has brought his <UNK> meanwhile the <UNK> front page reads that killer nick <UNK> escaped convict richard <UNK> has escaped and he <UNK> onto the <UNK> boat while they are sleeping and the goat <UNK> through the boat rope <UNK> out to sea in the morning the see their location and the killer comes out demanding something to eat and he spots stan and ollie making fake food e g string for spaghetti soap for cheese belt for bacon <UNK> for <UNK> and he forces them to eat it when ollie starts <UNK> on something stan blows his <UNK> to help and <UNK> rage gets him <UNK> the killer and it keeps going till the police arrive only to have <UNK> rage get them put in prison too there were the <UNK> moments of comedy but it isn't a great black and white film well here's another nice mess you've gotten me into was number 60 on 100 years 100 quotes and stan laurel and oliver hardy were number 7 on the <UNK> comedian okay
<START> how do i begin to review a film that will soon be recognized as the worst film of all <UNK> by the worst director of all time ' a film that could develop a cult following because it's so bad it's good ' br br an <UNK> approach <UNK> the film seems both pointless and part of band <UNK> syndrome let's bash <UNK> without worry of <UNK> because every other human on earth is doing it and the people who like the film like it for those flaws we'd <UNK> br br the film's universal poor quality goes without saying <UNK> years of <UNK> is not without competition for title of worst film so it has to sink pretty low to <UNK> the title and keep a hold of it but i believe this film could go the distance imdb doesn't allow enough words to <UNK> all the films failures and it be much easier to site the elements <UNK> years of <UNK> does right unfortunately those moments of glory are so far buried in the shadows of this film's <UNK> that that's a task not worth pursuing br br my impressions i thought i knew what i was getting into i had been warned to drink several <UNK> of coffee before sitting down to watch this one wish that suggestion had been <UNK> of <UNK> despite my low expectations <UNK> years of <UNK> failed to entertain me even on a make fun of the bad <UNK> level not just bad but <UNK> bad as though <UNK> intentionally tried to make this film a <UNK> yawn but went into <UNK> and shoved the poetry down our throats making it not profound but funny and supposedly <UNK> sincerely tried to make a good movie even after viewing the <UNK> years of <UNK> <UNK> literature i have trouble believing <UNK> sincerity pointless and obnoxious till the end with a several grin chuckle moments all i'm sure none intentional <UNK> the film and those few elements prevented me from turning the dvd off so bad it's good no it had just enough 'i can't believe this is a serious movie <UNK> to keep me from turning it off and nothing more br br definitely a film to watch with a group of bad movie <UNK> get your own running commentary going that would've significantly improved the experience for me so bad it's mike myers <UNK> in his <UNK> scottish accent on it as it runs to turn this whole piece of <UNK> into a comic farce ok dare ma man pass me <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> before seeing this i was merely expecting another mediocre soft core copy of the much <UNK> <UNK> series starring sylvia <UNK> it was really surprising how good this one turned out to be it actually has a story and it is very romantic indeed what makes <UNK> <UNK> so good is it's leading heroine the beautiful and exotic <UNK> lee she plays her character <UNK> wong so <UNK> that the viewer just has to feel something for her when her dreams crash down around her <UNK> wong is a much respected doctor <UNK> with a regal quality she comes from an important old family where ancient customs are still <UNK> <UNK> will remain a virgin until she is married to a man she has never met the beautiful doctor seems ok with this arranged marriage it is simply how it is done in her world however she does not plan on meeting and falling in love with the british pilot who ends up under her care in the hospital where she works <UNK> decides to do away with <UNK> and she gives herself to her western man but only after a very long <UNK> as doctor wong is anything but an easy woman her pilot george is a good guy and promises to marry <UNK> so that she doesn't lose her <UNK> and place in her rigid society neither one counts on a third party one <UNK> <UNK> who destroys their relationship through a series of vicious games <UNK> is made to believe that she has been abandoned by her man that he only played a game with her in order to sleep with her her place in society is gone she has been <UNK> the film takes a surprisingly dramatic and depressing turn as this proud elegant woman gives up her career as well as a sweet relationship with her caring father and <UNK> to a life of drinking and prostitution i was surprised to find myself so <UNK> in this <UNK> tragic tale i was on the edge of my seat when george blows back into town and <UNK> walks into a hotel where his beautiful <UNK> is working as a prostitute classic drama i imagine many viewers were a bit frustrated by all this drama one would expect lots of sex and nudity here but there is not much and when there is it is totally non exploitative and very artsy and soft core if you are a fan of the first <UNK> with sylvia <UNK> than you most likely will appreciate this lesser known classic i was especially impressed by the extra attention to details the whole segment where <UNK> takes george to her fathers house on the island is really nice her father shows george and the viewer his impressive collection of <UNK> trees he has a whole <UNK> forest built out of these amazing trees totally unexpected after catching it on late night cable tv years ago i spent much time searching the internet for a copy of the film when i finally got it i found that the video version was longer more sex no more melodrama for the dvd release there is a subplot about george suddenly <UNK> over with some unknown deadly disease i actually preferred the cable version better i am glad that this rare gem has been released finally on dvd i must also mention the beautiful cinematography and the bizarre and catchy 70's soundtrack while watching this one you just get the feeling that you are watching something very rare and quite special i recommend it to thoughtful viewers who don't need sex and violence to maintain their interest
<START> usually i know after the first minute of a movie if i will hate it or adore it but now i was wrong br br the start was great the this is based on a true story and blah blah blah thing was funny after the cartoons and the description of the <UNK> life with pictures made me think i had made the right choice br br then seeing the hilarious fake look of toronto was cool also the situation and appearance of the house seemed to confirm my first idea br br that was maybe the first 10 minutes of the movie which afterwards looked like an eternity br br maybe that's just me not understanding english canadian humour that's possible english <UNK> also do not always understand <UNK> humour but hey there was enough stuff in that for a short movie nothing more maybe that could be a meaning for the title anyway almost everything was filling and very few things were even close to funny in my opinion br br as a matter of fact the making of was better than the movie at least you understand the motivation behind that which made everything bad the potential of the idea was great that's why i rented the movie being interested in the annoying people disappearance thing but yet i did not know the whole universe would <UNK> and with it even a point to the movie br br if you are english canadian it seems you could appreciate the local humour considering the surprising number of people who gave this movie an 8 otherwise just think twice before losing your precious time
<START> i wasn't really hoping for much when i went to see this after <UNK> the heck out of <UNK> with some friends though i was hoping for a similar experience here br br unfortunately the movie took itself way too seriously do i care about <UNK> problems i'm sorry no there are a legion <UNK> movies that cover that anyway at at then end of the day he's an undead serial killer i'm just not going to get that sympathetic br br freddy was by far the most interesting aspect of the movie with the hallucinations and what not but unfortunately they were few and far between and by the end of the movie it had <UNK> into a bad episode of celebrity <UNK> only not funny br br
<START> you could stage a version of charles <UNK> a christmas carol with <UNK> puppets and i'll probably watch it ever since i was a child this has been one of my favorite stories maybe it's the idea that there is good in everyone and that therefore no one is beyond redemption that appeals to me but for whatever reason i never miss an opportunity to watch one of the many screen adaptations of this timeless classic when they're on tv as they inevitably are this time of year br br what makes this version really stand out is the somber <UNK> that the cast bring to their respective roles lines we've heard dozens of times in the past take on a whole new intensity and each character becomes more real and believable in the hands of this wonderful ensemble br br george c scott was nominated for an emmy in 1985 for this role it is to his <UNK> credit that rather than <UNK> through this <UNK> portrayed role of scrooge he instead gave it a fresh interpretation that was in my opinion one of his finest performances ever he wisely did not attempt a british accent instead delivering his lines in that famous <UNK> voice his scrooge is not merely a <UNK> old man as he is so often portrayed but a man who <UNK> a profound anger against the world as he is visited in turn by each of the three spirits we understand how this anger took root grew and ultimately <UNK> his soul as he is forced to review his life we see him alternately <UNK> and then <UNK> again into <UNK> <UNK> and in the great dramatic scene when he <UNK> and <UNK> at his own grave begs for mercy as he attempts to convince the third spirit of his <UNK> and desire to alter his life we see a man who has been utterly broken and brought to his knees literally and <UNK> scott has made scrooge utterly believable and painfully human br br impressive as scott's performance is the ensemble of supporting actors contributes significantly the this <UNK> dark beauty fred <UNK> <UNK> nephew is an excellent example of this often portrayed as an <UNK> <UNK> here he is played by roger <UNK> with an emotional intensity missing from earlier portrayals when he <UNK> scrooge i ask nothing of you i want nothing from you why can't we be friends we see in his face not only his frustration but his pain at <UNK> self <UNK> <UNK> from his only living relative it is a moving performance and one of the movie's most dramatic scenes br br even more magnificent is the performance given by the wonderful english actor frank <UNK> as <UNK> late partner <UNK> <UNK> in most versions of this tale the scene with <UNK> tends to be a bit of a low point in the film simply because it's difficult to portray a dead man convincingly and the results are usually just plain silly <UNK> look it's a scary ghost not in this version it is perhaps the most riveting scene in the whole movie <UNK> entrance as the locks on <UNK> door fly open of their own <UNK> and the sound of chains <UNK> echo throughout the house is wonderfully creepy but <UNK> <UNK> is no <UNK> spirit he is a tortured soul inspiring both horror and pity <UNK> may be a ghost but his rage and regret over a life wasted on the pursuit of wealth and his despair at his realization that his sins are now beyond <UNK> are still very human as portrayed by <UNK> we have no problem believing that even the <UNK> scrooge would be <UNK> by this nightmarish <UNK> <UNK> really steals the scene here something not easy to do when you're opposite george c scott br br and it just goes on and on one remarkable performance after another making it seem like you're experiencing this story for the first time edward <UNK> remember him from the <UNK> is by turns both <UNK> and menacing as the ghost of christmas present when he delivers the famous line it may well be that in the sight of heaven you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man's child he is no longer a jolly santa claus surrogate but an <UNK> angel who gives scrooge a much needed verbal <UNK> br br <UNK> york is a wonderfully <UNK> <UNK> mrs <UNK> and david warner brings marvelous depth to the long suffering bob <UNK> a man who goes through life bearing the triple crosses of poverty a sick child and an <UNK> boss his face alternately shows his cheerful courage and also at times his <UNK> in the face of <UNK> circumstances later in the scene in which scrooge is shown by the ghost of christmas yet to come the <UNK> family after the death of tiny tim <UNK> performance while hardly <UNK> a word will move you to tears

<START> because you can put it on fast forward and watch the inane story without having to listen to banal dialogue and be finished in 10 minutes max come to think of it even 10 minutes is too much to waste on <UNK> <UNK> meets struggling wanna be artists vomit
<START> chang <UNK> shaolin temple might very well be the <UNK> mark of the shaw brothers martial arts film cycle this rousing kung fu epic boasts an amazing cast a <UNK> who's who of the shaw stable though the plot is fairly standard and the fight choreography is superb as usual it is <UNK> handling of the subject matter that makes this film remarkable and enjoyable the sense of <UNK> displayed for the history and traditions of the shaolin temple is <UNK> in every frame not unlike william <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> fighting <UNK> in that same self titled film or john ford's <UNK> to west point in the long gray line <UNK> shaolin temple is a lovingly crafted <UNK> in that same style br br the cultural <UNK> i am tempted to make is to compare the shaolin temple to the <UNK> watching this film will give the same <UNK> and nostalgic feelings that you experienced many years ago in grade school history when you learned of the courage and sacrifice of those doomed heroes of the <UNK> at the end of the film you too might be tempted to call out remember the shaolin temple
<START> especially for a time when not much science fiction was being filmed 1973 this is a terrific vision of a future where everything has gone wrong too many people and nothing works the only people who can live in comfort are the rich it's set in new york in <UNK> i think and it reminds you of your worst vision of <UNK> br br i got to appreciate charlton <UNK> acting after seeing him in orson welles' touch of evil he was maybe is capable of portraying a range of heroic or semi heroic people here he is torn between being a cop who is just a little bit corrupt taking rare food treats from the rich and being totally corrupt <UNK> <UNK> evil br br the movie all seems to take place at night and sweat is dripping off everyone except in one of the rare air <UNK> apartments even though i hadn't seen it before i knew the famous ending which will not here be revealed but the ending is certainly <UNK> br br great scenes with edward g robinson going to the <UNK> made up of elderly jews with heavy accents so it seems where the truth is revealed and then going off to the <UNK> to check out br br gritty pre star wars <UNK> science fiction
<START> had this movie been made just a few years later i would have knocked down the score a point or two because the sound quality was rather poor at times the movie appeared to be a silent film during the in between scenes normal <UNK> sounds are missing but given it was 1931 and a french movie this is quite forgivable especially since this also occurs in later french films by which time the sound difficulties should have been worked out completely such as in <UNK> from 1934 br br okay apart from some minor sound problems this is a cute little film about a missing winning <UNK> ticket and a long list of people trying to get it and during the search there are lots of <UNK> little songs that you can't help but like a nice charming film all in all
<START> the <UNK> is a mix of the good an interesting murder mystery the bad a <UNK> script a sloppy resolution badly made attack scenes and the weird strong incestuous overtones a strangely sleepy and stiff performance by john cassavetes was that character really meant to be so <UNK> not nearly as offensive as it's <UNK> to be but not particularly successful either 1 2
<START> though i've yet to review the movie in about two years i remember exactly what made my opinion go as low as it did having loved the original little mermaid and having been obsessed with <UNK> as a child could be i decided i'd take the time to sit down and watch the sequel br br disney i've got a little message for you if you don't have the original director and actors handy you're just looking to get your butt <UNK> br br in the sequel our story begins with a slightly older ariel and her daughter melody my first big issue was that eric and the rest of the crew sang yes i understand that disney is big on sing and dance numbers but really that's what made eric my favorite prince he was calm <UNK> and a genuine gentleman that knew how to have fun and he did not sing br br and then there's the villain oh how could we forget the <UNK> that <UNK> down our <UNK> whenever ursula <UNK> onto the screen terrifying both ariel and audiences around the world unfortunately that gene was not passed on to her seemingly useless sister morgana nothing was ever ever said about morgana in the first movie she just pops out of nowhere trying to steal the baby oh how cute the younger sister is <UNK> off and instead of going after the <UNK> decides to kidnap a month old baby gag me br br other than being a flat character with no sense of originality in her morgana was just very <UNK> the same plan as her sister the same <UNK> who by the way did not scare anyone i had a three year old on my lap when i watched this movie and she laughed hysterically she had no purpose being in there i'd like to have seen mom be the villain i'm sure she would have done a better job than little miss <UNK> over there br br king <UNK> held none of the respect he'd earned from me in the first movie and don't even get me started on <UNK> sebastian and <UNK> <UNK> was a stern but loving father in the first movie and in the second it's almost like he's lost his will to knock fear into the hearts of his subjects <UNK> once a comic relief that made everyone laugh with his <UNK> <UNK> yes i'll admit it i did call my <UNK> a <UNK> hopper from time to time after that in this film <UNK> all but forgotten a supporting character even in the first he at least added something to the movie he was rich with a flavor the others didn't have and in the sequel they all but stripped it from him entirely sebastian was still the same but twice as <UNK> as before disney don't do that don't even try to mess with our favorite <UNK> or our favorite little fat fish who becomes a dad and has a <UNK> of very annoying children he's fat and he's bland and he looks like he's going to flat line any second br br the <UNK> and penguin were <UNK> and after a while you just start to <UNK> everyone especially melody who has no depth to her whatsoever br br and one of these days disney i'm kicking out of my life br br if i didn't love your originals so much
<START> first of all this film can be divided into three segments a promising opening with the <UNK> of some <UNK> by the <UNK> this is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section with the totally miscast <UNK> <UNK> and soldier blue traveling together to reach the safety of an army <UNK> miss <UNK> <UNK> forth inappropriate four letter words every time she opens her mouth and looks like she just walked out of a 1970s jack nicholson movie i mean she maintains zero interest with zero believability the third and final section involves the totally gratuitous slaughter of an indian village this is so obviously overdone to lay on the anti war propaganda that it comes across as simply long outrageous and contrived not recommended <UNK> <UNK> comment above here's an idea why don't you actually watch the movie you are commenting on instead of <UNK> your liberal nonsense this is not a political site it is for reviewing films <UNK>
<START> this film was hard to get a hold of and when i eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming i mean this is one of the great stories of the <UNK> century an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting <UNK> industry and gets away with millions in <UNK> without hurting anyone or <UNK> the attempt with all of this built in interest how could anyone make such a lackluster talk laden flick of this true life event while williams is always interesting the screenwriters assumed that the d b cooper persona was <UNK> heroic like a movie star s what we get is a type without any engaging details or insights into the mind of a person daring enough and clever enough to have pulled it off <UNK> practically steals the movie with her <UNK> and pure beauty but the real letdown was in the handling of the plot and the lame direction shame on this film for even existing
<START> rented it last night the opening 2001 ran <UNK> too long the <UNK> scene served no purpose some skits were just retarded i knew beforehand chevy chase was on for less than 2 minutes no problem here are the best parts br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> commercial curtis <UNK> song br br total 7 minutes of good material out of a 75 minute movie br br everything else was either unfunny or stupid as hell br br let me give you some advice if you want a crude movie <UNK> tv and movies rent kentucky fried movie if you want a less crude movie <UNK> tv and movies rent amazon women on the moon or <UNK> br br otherwise don't bother renting this movie you'll save 2 3 dollars br br imho ken <UNK> best movie is still modern problems
<START> i was pleasantly surprised i quite liked this movie witty writing some inside jokes i got others i didn't maybe due to actors speaking on top of one another great acting notably john <UNK> great cameos interesting and unique directing i rented it to see jeffrey meek very disappointed he was in it such a short time blink and you'll miss him but found the movie remarkably entertaining i'll actually watch it again before i send back to netflix i think actors and wanna be actors will thoroughly enjoy this movie the ending is somewhat expected but wish they'd done something different and more positive too bad the movie wasn't better received except for in the festival market i suggest it to anyone who loves the acting <UNK>
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen robin williams fit into the part like a <UNK> would fit into a <UNK> even so his performance was still pitiful kurt russell was more believable but still was awful the plot left much to be desired and the rest of the acting was also terrible the only thing this movie had going for it was the trailer which <UNK> me in to wasting 90 minutes of my life which could have been better spent trying to <UNK> the back of my head br br do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you have it if not just be happy you don't
<START> a film that <UNK> an understandable <UNK> to face the inevitable coming of the the second world war when a spanish <UNK> sent by his soon to be <UNK> government charles boyer <UNK> himself into england looking for support for his cause by trying to influence wealthy mine owners not to sell coal to the <UNK> back in spain he <UNK> the locals getting convincingly beaten in one scene and later in the film facing an angry crowd of <UNK> who see him as yet another threat to their shaky <UNK> notwithstanding <UNK> economic <UNK> <UNK> and world politics this film expertly <UNK> into a dark and suspenseful intrigue involving <UNK> <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> and peter lorre and is expertly filmed in numerous darkly lit scenes set in a dreary hotel by james wong <UNK> and manages more than once to get under your skin
<START> okay so i found out about this movie and i watched the preview read almost all the reviews and was having a hard time <UNK> whether i should watch it or not before i even watched the movie i was emotionally weird on it i was so unsure if i was going to watch this and be disturbed for like a long time so i choose to risk it and watched it and <UNK> what i thought the beginning started off fine for me it seemed to be heading in a decent direction got past the rape scene and i couldn't figure why people were so disturbed or bored by the movie don't get me wrong the rape scene was just as sad and scary but it didn't really bother me to a dramatic point then as the middle came in i understood the boring stuff that was going on there was like 5 minutes shots of nothing but people walking around saying or showing nothing its one thing to have a shot where a person is showing some kind of emotion but this movie didn't have that it had about 3 of these pointless scenes where you see the main character <UNK> kind of get out of control but it didn't show it right making me want to fast forward then when she engaged in the hardcore <UNK> it wasn't so boring but still a little dull oh and as a note rosario dawson still did a great job okay moving on so finally after an hour of <UNK> to the middle the revenge comes to <UNK> attention thats where it got disturbing i didn't feel bad for him or nothing he got what he deserved but the whole scene was really disturbing and i just felt all <UNK> after it i cant really tell you whether or not to watch this movie because its so i don't know i cant find a word to sum it up but if you choose to watch it just don't be <UNK>
<START> this film has very tight and well planned dialogue acting and choreography br br recommended film for anyone who wants to see masterful writing and plot br br question does anyone know where the house is actually located it is one of the most interesting houses a <UNK> <UNK>
<START> del you are the dumbest smart person i've ever met br br <UNK> well i had a brain but they lost it in the re writes br br i think what i find most <UNK> about this <UNK> of <UNK> work was how the character of susan <UNK> was portrayed in the books she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists able to think her way through a problem here she's just a damsel in distress waiting to be rescued by <UNK> smith br br there are passing references to <UNK> laws of <UNK> but they are an <UNK> to the cgi and action scenes br br smith is likable as he is in most of his films but honestly the story isn't that good you figure it out long before these genius characters do
<START> this movie was a mess it had the absolute worst editing i have ever seen it was almost like at the end of a scene the writer wanted to go to commercial and the filmmaker added a second of black screen to fulfill the writers dream br br under the messy direction and editing there was a <UNK> of something good a good idea a compelling spark but somewhere it went wrong br br the story is about a quasi psychic priest who is trying to solve a string of murders the first thing that is hard to bite into is richard <UNK> as a priest well the part doesn't call for him to be a good priest and he succeeds rather well the second problem is dennis hopper as the crazy bad guy he always plays the crazy bad guy very ho hum br br oh a thought <UNK> to me that maybe all the <UNK> horrible editing and <UNK> plot was trying to add a sense of the confusion the character <UNK> was experiencing and just to prove that it was contrived they rolled the credits <UNK> not a good sign for any movie br br
<START> it's a hideous little production apt to give one nightmares as well as <UNK> it's an <UNK> blend of live action and ugly stop motion animation it's weird but it's not the kind of fun weird trip anyone optimistic might expect it's the cold <UNK> <UNK> sickening even creepy kind of weird there is absolutely no reason to watch this movie after all disney did a fantastic job with the same source material and <UNK> hall did far more attractive things with stop motion br br interestingly this is a french production as such it re <UNK> the stereotype that the french have no concept of scary
<START> quite possibly the <UNK> woman in show business and the <UNK> debbie gives another fine performance here although her work in american nightmare was far superior she is still worth watching in this film br br the cast is filled with your typical <UNK> place types <UNK> features and seductive <UNK> that i had never seen before other than debbie laura <UNK> was the only actress i had seen before in the similar <UNK> <UNK> die br br the plot centers around a group of california <UNK> who <UNK> poor naive debbie <UNK> into their <UNK> they tell her that they have a murder club and that she must kill someone to be accepted debbie wants nothing more but to be accepted by these cool people so she quickly kills a person and now the group must decide what to do with her after she fell for their joke br br violence <UNK> debbie <UNK> occasionally has blood <UNK> all over her and all of the murder scenes are done in your face gore <UNK> will surely enjoy br br nudity <UNK> as well debbie <UNK> has several nude scenes as do many of the no name actresses and actors the pool party seems as just an excuse to get everyone naked man and woman alike julie strain also has a topless cameo but her character is gone after the first five minutes br br story could have received a higher vote because the plot was very interesting and unique but the plot serves as filler between nude scenes i understand that b rate films use nudity often but this is borderline excessive br br acting the acting is sub standard to say the least <UNK> is always a treat easily the best b rate actress in the business today but her character in american nightmare was superior danny <UNK> does a fine job as <UNK> object of lust but the other actors were nothing to write about
<START> there's nothing particularly original about this story of corrupt <UNK> on one side and the chief attorney on the other the stark but unimaginative lighting and photography <UNK> from the <UNK> out noir cycle the story could easily have been out of a warner brothers <UNK> with george raft in the lead the performances are routine the direction flat and even the set dressing <UNK> an alley is shown by a single <UNK> wall of <UNK> brick it has one poster on it the poster says post no bills we are introduced to the story and some of the characters by a <UNK> narrator who informs us that while most <UNK> work hard and honestly to advance the causes of their members a few are corrupt but we don't really get to know much about the <UNK> or how they operate although i suppose they were fair game after the success of on the <UNK> a few years earlier here they're just a <UNK> to hang the tale on the real ring leader is a <UNK> lawyer who runs things through three or four thugs the district attorney or whatever he is finds out like dana andrews did in <UNK> that the wrong man dick <UNK> is charged with a murder and he spends the rest of the film almost alone digging up evidence of <UNK> innocence he gets into fist fights and shoot outs like any <UNK> movie private eye br br brian keith is the d a he's shown some <UNK> displays of talent elsewhere but here he spends most of the time speaking quietly and staring at the floor elisha cook jr is a likable <UNK> but can't do a good drunk <UNK> garland is okay but is <UNK> by the direction which has her <UNK> in a night club when she should be <UNK> the remainder of the cast would be suitable for a tv series br br and nobody is helped by the writing when a b girl is about to be <UNK> by the union mob to the <UNK> someone <UNK> her that she only has to learn a few words of spanish i only know one word she says <UNK> yes the writers have not trusted the audience to know that <UNK> in spanish means yes the plot is clumsy and has holes in it keith visits a witness in her flat over a night club he enters the door and has a gun shoved in his back by a <UNK> but he <UNK> the heavy and knocks him out then the orders someone to call the police the rest of the scene played out at some length in the night club <UNK> forgets all about the police and they never show up nor are they expected by anyone br br it's nothing to be ashamed of and some people might enjoy it but there is similar stuff better done elsewhere
<START> sammy horn michael des <UNK> is the head chef and owner of a famous restaurant in california he has a lovely wife grace horn <UNK> arquette who is pregnant and a beautiful son of about five years old sammy indeed loves his family but like dr <UNK> and mr hyde he has a double life having sex with many different women dr jane <UNK> <UNK> kinski is trying to help him ok it is my fault i read the summary of the other imdb user comments i saw the imdb user rating but i really did not believe that <UNK> arquette and <UNK> kinski could participate in such a bad movie i decided to check it and actually some comments are very <UNK> the storyline the screenplay and the dialogs are so silly and laughable that even in some x rated movies we can find more intelligent stories the photography is so amateurish and naive that in some parts it seems to be taken through a vhs camcorder michael des <UNK> does not have sense of ridiculous being an old man bald would be acceptable in an <UNK> of <UNK> or grandfather of the small boy but as an attractive man who gets and has sex with any woman it is scary in wood allen's comedy maybe he got a chance but in a <UNK> movie it is funny i am trying to figure out why or how <UNK> arquette and <UNK> kinski accepted to participate in such awful amateurish and trash movie do they need money lack of chances in better movies due to their ages are they friends of the <UNK> sorry for using this word and decided to help and promote him i do not know whether the intention of <UNK> arquette was to show her breasts full of <UNK> but it is <UNK> that such a great actress accepts such a script the same is <UNK> to the gorgeous <UNK> <UNK> she is presented fat without make up without any <UNK> a total lack of respect with one of the most beautiful actress in the cinema history a fact is really intriguing me how can a reader without any personal interest promote this trash giving higher ratings or writing <UNK> comments about this movie are they friends of the <UNK> again i am using this word or the cast it sounds very strange to me that a normal imdb reader can like such a film my vote is two br br title brazil <UNK> em <UNK> addicted in <UNK>
<START> <UNK> ann and <UNK> andy the movie is about dolls that come to life when the humans aren't around in this adventure they must rescue a kidnapped french doll named <UNK> from the captain of pirates on their way they journey though deep dark woods <UNK> pit and even looney land will the <UNK> of their new friend the <UNK> with <UNK> knees help them or just slow them down with his hallucinations of his friends leaving him how will they escape the <UNK> king and his henchmen what will their owner <UNK> say when she sees her <UNK> birthday present doll gone along with her other toys delightful surprises <UNK> the two <UNK> br br all scores are out of a possible 10 story 8 very cute dolls that come to life when the master isn't around not just that because they go out into many many different places but they are in an imaginary world so anything can happen meeting new characters going to different places finding new friends its great the characters all work so well in this too and who doesn't love pirates acting 8 every character suits their voice so well specifically the marlon brando <UNK> pit enemy the greed the french doll has a very uptight french accent the evil hitler esquire king <UNK> <UNK> got hair that resembles <UNK> <UNK> bob plays his role very well and the sorrow old black man voice for <UNK> works perfectly why is it that old dubbed animation was <UNK> much better than new ones music 10 nothing short of perfection here the songs have been in my head for years and re watching it nearly 20 years later i can still remember each and every one of them and will now be able to know exactly where these tunes come from joe <UNK> of <UNK> street fame did an excellent job with the songs for this and everyone sings real well br br editing 6 <UNK> this is where it'll get confusing i mean how far did the <UNK> walk anyway a lot of events just seem to occur one after another and there's no telling who the other dolls and toys were as you never see them in the real world of the movie but it does follow some sort of path and you know they'll eventually get to where they need to go its just pretty hard to follow at times br br <UNK> 8 between this and <UNK> i'd have to say there's parts in both movies i will never forget no matter how hard i try to mainly the scary parts i've probably mentioned already how older movies were much <UNK> than animation of today but this takes the cake in the scary factor outside of the south park movie and some disney films there's almost no animated musicals or good ones of that coming out so its very unique br br worth 8 its classic worth the hunt to get a good copy thats for sure but the vhs copies are probably all stretched out by now the dvd version is sold on ebay all the time and it'll definitely be something you'll watch more than once if anything get it for the nostalgia purposes br br overall score not an average 8 its a wonderful timeless musical made in the late 70s and can still be enjoyed today its characters are all unique and the songs are great so great you might find yourself <UNK> them time and time again give your favorite stuffed animal a hug today <UNK> insight including bias this isn't like the <UNK> ann tv series made a decade later this was way more darker and real world the effects in this seem like a lot of other acid trip cartoons from the 70's in particular yellow submarine still its given me memories i'll never forget and might still influence things today it wasn't easy to find but it'll remain a treasure to keep in my collection of dvds and videos forever
<START> this film is another example of the curse of east asian cinema two or more separate stories rolled into one film other reviewers have obviously picked up on it as well because there are several mentions of the first part and second part how can you have any character development or a deep plot when the characters and the story are featured for such a short time i was enjoying the first part until it abruptly stopped it didn't end it just stopped in what appeared to be the middle of the story to be replaced by an inane and totally unbelievable second part that seemed to focus around a girl <UNK> and cleaning a guy's apartment wow i look forward to the day when wong <UNK> <UNK> is given a decent script to work with
<START> spoilers below br br cabin fever has my nod for worst film of the year that i've seen that is this movie is straight garbage there is so much wrong with the film you can't help but be amazed at how bad it really is this movie had so much potential to be good but ultimately made nothing of it the characters were as dumb as one can be for the entire movie you're just asking yourself why would you do that or what's your point in doing this this is how illogical and stupid the characters are we get no background into them so naturally you really don't give a rats as about their fate you could only laugh at their stupidity br br the <UNK> <UNK> for instance was she that horny that she had to sleep with paul rider strong there was no point in that its almost as if the filmmakers needed a excuse to give her the virus so <UNK> ugh br br would anyone really go into the woods and drink water from the <UNK> of a cabin without looking at it first br br why didn't bert just shoot the sick guy from the start movie would've been over that way besides they ended up killing him anyway br br why did it take them so long to finally decide to leave the cabin even if they had to walk <UNK> i'll just wait until 2 of my friends are infected one a blink away from death to finally <UNK> to walk outta there br br what was exactly the reasoning behind paul's attempt to fish out the body of the <UNK> only to fall in the <UNK> <UNK> and get infected with the virus pure stupidity br br i swear common sense was not a friend much less an <UNK> to these idiots i don't think there has ever been a worse ending to a movie in the beginning the kids ask the <UNK> store <UNK> what the rifle was for and he <UNK> that <UNK> for the <UNK> in the end of the film 3 young blacks dressed in <UNK> clothes one of them in a du <UNK> no less go into the store come to find out that the <UNK> was cleaning it for them to be used for hunting then he proceeds to give them all pounds and <UNK> and joke around with them as if they're his <UNK> br br okay what the hell was the point of that how tasteless can one be what were the filmmakers thinking putting that in the movie i as a black man was of course offended by the initial <UNK> comment it was a tasteless pointless remark my question to the filmmakers what was the point of the ending with the black kids was that to force me to forget about the initial racist comment made earlier to smooth things over with black viewers by making a joke out of it well i for one did not find that pathetic attempt at humor funny in the least bit the whole movie was a joke a pathetic attempt at filmmaking that shouldn't be given the time of day peter jackson really thought this film was that good what film was he looking at br br zero out of stars if i could give it a lower rating i would please fellow <UNK> don't waste 1 1 2 hours of your precious life watching this abomination of a <UNK> this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen
<START> and a rather unexpected plot line too for the era there is plague in the city of new orleans and only richard widmark can stop it <UNK> <UNK> trademark subjects <UNK> working men crowds <UNK> blue collar folk violence on a <UNK> are all <UNK> here br br jack palance is quite effective as the ice cold mobster out for a big score zero mostel as dom <UNK> somewhat miscast but certainly watchable as his go <UNK> i enjoyed barbara <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> cool wife i thought she and widmark were a believable couple br br he himself always reminds me somewhat of sinatra in the face and in the intense quiet manner and that is meant as a compliment if anything i'd never even heard of this movie and yes you have to admire <UNK> performance i also enjoyed paul douglas he seemed to play this role many times they make an unlikely but effective team br br the plague itself is a <UNK> and you gotta know it's not exactly done the way it would have been in real life rather small scale at the least no but i found it carried the plot along nicely br br check this out it's good outta
<START> let's put political correctness aside and just look at this in terms of the numerous sex comedies that came out in the 1980's because i for one don't think this is any better or any worse than the others unless your some religious <UNK> or an uptight female you can probably view a silly film such as this without getting all worked up about the content and i personally had a totally <UNK> feeling towards this before and after watching it story is set in <UNK> new mexico where a rich 15 year old boy named phillip <UNK> <UNK> eric brown is naturally horny as hell and starts <UNK> on the attractive maid that has just started working for his father br br spoiler alert nicole <UNK> sylvia <UNK> is friendly to <UNK> but things heat up when his father goes out of town on business and she starts to <UNK> with him to the point where she invites him into her bedroom to watch her <UNK> <UNK> is awkward and doesn't know how to react at first but soon he goes for it and has sex but than to his horror it seems that nicole has died from a heart attack with the help from the sleazy <UNK> lester lewis howard <UNK> they seemingly have buried her body but a note from a <UNK> shows up and <UNK> must get 10 000 out of his father's safe <UNK> is shocked when nicole shows up and he learns that the whole thing was an <UNK> plan set up by lester and that she only went along with it because she's an illegal alien and if she didn't do what she was told lester would have called the <UNK> office together they try to get his father's money back before he returns home and they <UNK> the help from jack ed <UNK> jr who is a <UNK> <UNK> but pretends to be a cop to scare lester br br this little comedy was made for less than 3 million but it <UNK> over 50 million worldwide and made it one of the least likely films during that time to be so successful which <UNK> me to wonder why this was a hit and not any of the others in the genre director alan <UNK> can <UNK> that he made a hit film but the truth is that he never really had a career in films although he did go on to be very successful in television so why did this become so successful i have a thought that it just may be because of <UNK> and before you decide that i'm crazy listen to my reasoning <UNK> was an international star because of her soft core films so that reason alone made many free thinking adults curious about viewing her in an american film that was getting a wide release with that the same adults would also be nostalgic about their own youth and the fantasy of being taught the ways of <UNK> by an attractive older woman which brings in the much younger audience members who are probably still very inexperienced and curious about the film anyway that's my thought and if anyone has another reason i would love to hear it but back to the film itself it's apparent and very sad that a film like this could probably never get made again except in europe because of the religious right and the other <UNK> freaks who just can't come to terms with the fact that a teenage boy getting laid will not do him any harm in fact it's a valuable service that all boys pray will happen to them the film itself is clumsy and <UNK> body double is all too evident in certain scenes especially if you take careful note of the difference in their <UNK> the story although intriguing in it's basic form is neither very funny or revealing so were left <UNK> the nude scenes that are really the norm for the genre
<START> sitting down to watch the <UNK> season of the bachelor on the wings of love i knew i would be in for an interesting time i had watched some of the previous seasons of the bachelor in passing watching an episode or two and missing the next three or so i find that the bachelor is often appealing and intriguing though its quality and morality are often lacking br br on the wings of love details the journey taken by jake a <UNK> year old commercial pilot from dallas texas to find true love as true a love as one can find in a season long reality drama dating show jake meets 25 beautiful girls from all over the country he begins to get to know them a bit but it is mostly superficial how well can you get to know someone in a few 5 minute conversations jake tries to make his true intentions known from the very beginning at least to the audience he noted that he doesn't just want love or a good time but he wants a fiancé or wife we can only assume that he has made this clear to the women in the competition as well if that is the case it might explain to a degree some of the women's actions the women are super <UNK> while they don't even know jake at all yet they are still in it to win it no matter what the cost br br not only were the women <UNK> but they were also confident and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> of watch out all show that these women weren't there for a good time either jake noted that he was not just looking for sex appeal but looking for a connection however the girls pulled out all the stops to try to impress jake with said sex appeal they arrived at the mansion in skimpy dresses  either low cut or short br br while some girls seemed to maintain their sense of <UNK> others missed that <UNK> altogether one girl <UNK> noted that jake was a good guy to whom she could be a naughty girl she went on to say that jake could land on her <UNK> anytime she got <UNK> from the other girls for her provocative statement which showed their take on these situations br br so a reality dating show couldn't be that bad could it besides the obvious issue of sex driven attraction there are other issues that <UNK> this seemingly harmless show is this the right way to find a future mate <UNK> for someone's attention by <UNK> <UNK> to extreme proportions unfortunately however that is what america has reduced dating to these days pleasure and sex without commitment and a little happiness on the side br br another problem is the <UNK> emotional <UNK> by which many of the girls bound themselves to jake a few girls in particular seemed to be overly attached one girl said if i don't get that first impression rose it will kill me as mentioned before they don't even know him yet and she was talking about a specific rose not just one of the 15 <UNK> to keep from being eliminated br br michelle in particular seemed to have some issues with <UNK> to jake the other girls noticed it too after one particular michelle <UNK> vienna <UNK> that michelle had a mental breakdown and we've only been here an hour michelle got the last rose of the evening on the first show  <UNK> missing <UNK>  and was extremely emotional about it the other girls thought it was simply ridiculous another girl also cried but because she was eliminated br br it began with survivor and from there it just took off  reality tv it shows our entertainment interests as a country if we weren't watching the shows and giving them good ratings the networks would not continue to run them the only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that enough of america is hooked one thing is clear america in general loves reality tv and its ensuing <UNK> br br this begs me to question why is it that we even like reality tv what is it about it that draws us to it is it because we see the similarities to our own lives or is it because we want to be sure that we are more stable and less pathetic than others whatever it is that draws us to it we should be careful of the media and entertainment that we allow to fill our minds i'm not saying that all reality tv shows are bad however i am saying that we need to <UNK> each one br br episodes used for critique season <UNK> and episode 2
<START> spoilers throughout br br i had read the book 1st to die and wanted to see if the movie followed the book so i watched it for the most part it did there were some minor differences location of the last violent scene for instance but not many and for the most part the movie stayed true to the book more so then most movies br br this may have been a mistake although the movie was perfectly cast with <UNK> and <UNK> especially i was not that impressed with the book or let me take that back i started off very impressed gradually became more <UNK> and by the end was left completely <UNK> and felt almost <UNK> no difference with the movie here is why br br there is no payoff in the book or the movie rarely have i read a who done it thriller that has created such a letdown with it's final resolution and i had hoped the movie would <UNK> a little br br the whole he did it no she did it no they both did it was not interesting not fascinating and more confusing annoying and depressing then anything else add to that that the love of <UNK> life dies at the end after her disease <UNK> and she cries at his grave and then cut to where she's <UNK> suicide then all of a sudden she's in a fight for her life with the real villain who was <UNK> after being arrested but it turns out he and the wife were in it together hello this whole thing has now become general hospital instead of a good old fashioned thriller i felt cheated and ripped off by the book and watching the movie i must admit it held my attention nicely the acting was very good for a tv movie was hoping it wouldn't follow the book which it wound up doing br br i still think the movie is watchable and for some reason does not leave as bad a taste in your mouth as the book or maybe it's just that i knew what would happen but i have to say the way this story <UNK> was not well done at all
<START> it's sort of hard for me to say it because i so greatly enjoyed both targets and paper moon but i thought the last picture show was a somewhat fascinating but overly self indulgent film its main positive as far as i'm concerned is the stunning photography but for me the film had nothing to offer beyond surface beauty and a kind of hidden beauty at that the characters were very hard to relate to or to care about basically you had this very slow pace and this <UNK> style of acting but it was all there to prop up a very formulaic and predictable story complete with all the <UNK> one would expect from any small town melodrama everything from the boy cheating with his <UNK> wife to the handicapped kid who everyone picks on it was like american <UNK> without the joy of life br br some might say this film is more realistic nowadays a lot of people seem to think that realism is the only virtue a film can possess but for me the film was simply oppressive and i want to see it again about as badly as i'd like to spend a few hours in that miserable town the characters live in br br maybe this film really just belongs to its time perhaps if i'd seen it in 1971 i would have been impressed by its novelty just by seeing something different on the screen but that would basically assume that i had never seen anything like say <UNK> breathless maybe the overt references to classic films would have <UNK> to the movie geek in me and helped me to overlook some of the film's weaknesses but in the post tarantino world that hardly seems unique or special either br br it is interesting though how he uses the films in the film to give his own film more depth we see 3 films as i recall in the picture show first we see <UNK> <UNK> father of the bride liz <UNK> exquisite looks provide a contrast to <UNK> girlfriend and <UNK> studied upper middle class <UNK> <UNK> to the character's real life surroundings in a similar way later clips from howard <UNK> red river emphasize the theme of a broken friendship between a mentor and a <UNK> it really just reminds me that bogdanovich is kissing his own <UNK> butt much as he did if i remember correctly by <UNK> a <UNK> film as part of his own on screen <UNK> with boris karloff in targets i guess in 1971 this kind of thing was new but looking at it today it just seems self indulgent like so much of the rest of this film br br ultimately i'd rather see another film by <UNK> ford or minnelli than to have <UNK> film remind us of why they were so striking in such a less than subtle way maybe he <UNK> to remind us of the giants whose time had passed all he really does is remind us how small he and most of his <UNK> are in relation
<START> the toy box 1971 bomb br br sure i like looking at nude women while i prefer hardcore porn flicks i'll take <UNK> exploitation <UNK> junk like this too under the right circumstances well these aren't the right circumstances these aren't any circumstances there's supposed to be a horrific subplot lurking in here somewhere but i'll be damned if i can <UNK> it this is another of those amateurish steaming <UNK> of badly made <UNK> that <UNK> you to tears rather than <UNK> you despite all the <UNK> sex going on all over the place <UNK> if i want to see good sex scenes i'll watch the real stuff
<START> although this is better than the first <UNK> which doesn't say much anyways i would rather watch paint dry it still sucks do yourself a favor and avoid anything from these low budget pictures guys i was <UNK> into buying a few dvds to support some <UNK> filmmakers and boy did i regret it some haven't even been officially released yet not <UNK> bought from the filmmakers themselves and i can't even list how bad they all are avoid anything with teen ape or <UNK> in them as they do pop up in other small <UNK> films that they are friends with if you are friends of these guys chances are you were in their movies and had fun making them but for those that had to watch them no way bad video bad audio bad acting bad plot etc etc these aren't even funny i gave this one a 2 only because debbie <UNK> is in it and that is about it maybe it doesn't even deserve the 2 about a 1 1 <UNK> star to show it was slightly better than the first which i wish i could have rated in the <UNK> if you want a decent no budget film go pick up something from <UNK> friends over at freak productions like marty <UNK> or even raising the stakes those are actually decent
<START> kolchak is sheer entertainment great stories and a great cast and nothing else to <UNK> it down darren <UNK> gives an energetic performance that pulls the audience along with him simon <UNK> jack <UNK> and ruth <UNK> give <UNK> the kind of solid support that most leading actors can only dream of having some excellent guest stars add colour and <UNK> to individual episodes <UNK> <UNK> in legacy of terror phil <UNK> in horror in the heights antonio <UNK> in the zombie it's easy to see how a <UNK> spent watching kolchak drove chris carter to create the x files darren rip simon rip ruth rip
<START> funny how many of the people who say this is far superior to romero's version tend to be very young judging by their other <UNK> what we have here is a slick action packed gory and <UNK> filled 2 hour mtv video frantic editing pop video camera work cool music blah blah blah br br actually it ain't bad compared to other recent remakes chainsaw massacre was a total disaster pretty good acting all round totally predictable in the who will die next stakes and a total cash in on the dawn of the dead name that will generate plenty of <UNK> alone by fans of the original who will go and see it out of curiosity br br don't remakes of classics get on your nerves can they really not come up with something original why remake dawn of the dead the things that made the original special the middle segment kids think is so boring is supposed to be slow to show how when you get everything you ever wanted you still ain't happy are totally missing this is an action flick plain and simple the faster the better if you are into action flicks and as this the 2004 version is well done fair enough but for anyone who likes a little substance to their films get ready to sigh again br br watch the cinemas over the next few years as we get the godfather series remade by whoever the most <UNK> pop director is at the moment and star wars remade with all the kids saying how the new version is miles better <UNK> the old version is slow and boring and holds a camera shot for more than 5 seconds br br not bad but in 10 years they will still be discussing the romero version not this <UNK>
<START> i grew up watching scooby and have been a fan forever this cartoon moves away from the same old routine that can get boring to viewers the crooks in mask routine gets old and this cartoon is a change from that it's not meant to replace the scooby gang it's just a break from the same old crime scene for both viewers and writers i'm sure the <UNK> focus is on scooby and shaggy who <UNK> a large sum of money and use that money to <UNK> world conquest plans from a mad scientist and his <UNK> small <UNK> of the gang and the gang themselves are featured from time to time if you are a fan of scooby doo you can still appreciate the bond between a boy and his talking dog along with the jokes that come with it just <UNK> cartoon and support the creators writers and producers so that this won't be the last scooby cartoon
<START> after reading the first 5 reviews on imdb i was very enthusiastic about this movie but it's really an awful movie the total time you see the alien is about 5 minutes the rest of the movie is cheap suspense the acting is over the top en the story oh boy which story br br the story doesn't seem to go in a direction first they capture the alien after 7 years they finally succeed then they don't know what to do with it after 7 years and even want to release it why the hell did they capture it then the girlfriend who's acting is the most over the top wants to walk away from this madness then suddenly she doesn't then again she does and then she doesn't then they come to the conclusion that killing the alien will kill the whole human race and remember in all those years no other human have seen these <UNK> settled aliens and what do they do they torture it and blow a bunch of aliens to <UNK> br br this is my first review on imdb i'm a very lazy person who doesn't write very soon so listen to my warning this move is not worth your time don't watch this movie
<START> <UNK> stupid redundant and <UNK> closure to the nightmare on elm street series part 6 is so incompetent that it looks like director rachel <UNK> intentionally wanted to turn wes craven's initial premise into one big bad and tasteless joke this isn't just the worst entry in the elm street saga it's also one of the most embarrassing horror movies ever made and it downright <UNK> fans of the genre the story is dumb the character drawings are ridiculous the structure is all murky and  most of all  the special and visual effects resemble those of a tom jerry cartoon the sequences in which freddy krueger murders his victims are endless and very uninteresting were we supposed to be <UNK> when a <UNK> freddy turned <UNK> meyer into a video game character and <UNK> <UNK> him around the walls of a house the story takes us back to <UNK> and it appears that freddy all of a sudden has a middle aged daughter you'd think he would mention that in one of his previous adventures but <UNK> there's only one teenage survivor in <UNK> and krueger uses him to get into contact with his long lost daughter another reason why this final installment is so awful is the completely illogical structure the john <UNK> boy is introduced as the leading character but then all of a sudden he dies and the plot continues to <UNK> on two adults how about that freddy krueger who spent five entire films killing nothing but teenagers eventually gets beaten by two adults wearing 3d glasses sort of like ruins the whole essence doesn't it as far as i'm concerned nightmare on elm street has always been a dreadfully overrated series but up until now even the weakest entries had at least some redeeming elements freddy's dead however is simply <UNK> and nobody should waste his her precious time watching it
<START> italian horror suspense film about a wealthy english lord who <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> for girls with red hair just like his recently deceased wife evelyn you know he must have really loved his wife because he brings them to his home a huge rotting castle and makes them <UNK> and then <UNK> them <UNK> them and kills them the most bizarre aspect of this film for me was that somehow by the film's end we see this guy played by antonio de <UNK> as the hero of the film anyway soon under the advice of his playboy uncle <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> down with a girl he meets at his <UNK> party she moves in and strange things begin to happen to de <UNK> fragile state of mind he begins to see and hear his dead wife and finally well just look at the title if you are still curious also family members and friends begin to die in the most brutal fashions poor aunt agatha she looks like she might even be younger than de <UNK> and they have her in a wheelchair and trying to look old meets her fate in a <UNK> fashion another man is <UNK> and then buried alive and of course there is a whole explanation as to why how evelyn did what she did director <UNK> <UNK> does do some things fairly well the settings in the film are well suited for this film though trying to make us believe it is england is ludicrous at best none of the actors look english many having dark black hair and <UNK> <UNK> and wearing clothes an <UNK> wouldn't be caught dead in the cars drive on their wrong side of the road but all that notwithstanding the crypt scene was effectively shot and i liked the cheesy resolution too and of course any film with the <UNK> red headed erika <UNK> is always a plus there is a streak of sexual <UNK> however which i found somewhat appalling with the idea that torturing women was quite alright and healthy in order to <UNK> one of his mental demons c'mon
<START> being half portuguese doesn't render me half blind nor half <UNK> when discussing portuguese films not that i get to do that very often anyway but this film was such a rush of <UNK> yes that's right it was mostly accurate as far as history went goes but it pulled no punches on <UNK> beyond usual portuguese film territory things like using real locations in the middle of traffic <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> a real crowd to stand in for the real crowd of almost 30 years ago and by god did they get it right ok to sum it up very emotional if you've lived through it but you'll spot minor <UNK> that could have been made as well as plot <UNK> that were if you're just watching it randomly you're in for a good historical romp only of the very recent history kind and a bit more thought proving than usual even by european standards yes
<START> susan swift is an appealing <UNK> a flower child <UNK> to the 1980's like a young susan <UNK> but she doesn't quite have the vocal range for a demanding dramatic lead and she tends to <UNK> still she's rather sweet and has bright eyes and a pretty smile in the coming as it was called when briefly released to theaters swift may be the reincarnation of a <UNK> witch the flick is very low budget and borrows from so many other pictures that i gave up on it with about 15 minutes to go it starts out strong and has some camp appeal obviously there are more serious films that deal with the <UNK> witch trials that deserve to be seen over this one however as junk movies go it isn't too terrible the boston locales are a definite plus and the supporting cast is <UNK> hammy 1 2 from
<START> dark remains is a home run plain and simple the film is full of creepy visuals and <UNK> that will make the most seasoned horror veteran jump straight out of there seat the <UNK> scene in particular these guys are good although they weren't working on a huge budget everything looks good and the actors come through dark remains does have one of those <UNK> endings which may be a negative for some but i guess it makes you think <UNK> christian and greg thompson are spot on as the <UNK> couple trying to <UNK> there <UNK> however some side characters like the sheriff didn't convince me they aren't all that important anyways i give dark remains a perfect ten rating for being ten times scarier than any recent studio ghost story japanese remake
<START> we often see movies about <UNK> things going on in politics but i still recommend city hall in a role he was born to play al pacino stars as new <UNK> mayor who has to deal with the shooting of a boy but it turns out that nothing that he does will really have any effect in this movie the characters are as gritty as we would expect of anyone involved in a political scandal no matter how much you trust any given politician you may have your doubts after watching this movie br br i understand that i can't name any specific example of something similar to what this movie portrays but that's not the point if we had idealistic impressions of those at the top this movie tears such ideas down certainly one that i encourage you to see also starring john cusack bridget fonda danny aiello anthony <UNK> and david <UNK>
<START> this movie completely ran <UNK> around the original <UNK> it had everything that makes a movie great except for real actors ernie hudson couldn't do it alone and you know that lol i admit that i have killed my first video tape of this movie and i plan to buy the dvd version again as soon as possible this movie has so many catchy lines it's pitiful i am embarrassed to say that i know the theme song backwards and <UNK> i love jimmy lynch's character to death and he should have won the best supporting actor award in <UNK> but the oscars were never ready for this this is a random film <UNK> of crooked cops breasts chases bad editing and of course martial arts being that it's the 70's and i can say everyone knew some kind of martial arts i think this movie should be restored and shown one night in the midst of a marathon in local theaters
<START> they have sex with <UNK> in asia br br okay first i <UNK> that but after seeing the <UNK> cloud i changed my mind and was finally convinced that they have sex with <UNK> with people dead or alive no safe sex of course the <UNK> ugly leading man shoots it all into the <UNK> mouth after he did the dead lady never heard of hiv guess not br br the rest of this movie is mainly boring but also incredibly revolting as a matter of fact in parts it got so disgusting i couldn't take my virgin eyes off sex with dead people how gross is that and what's the message behind it all we need water we need <UNK> we need to be dead to have sex sorry but this stinks
<START> divorced lawyer rick <UNK> branagh stumbles drunk out of a party <UNK> by his firm one night and has a chance meeting with a woman named <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who was a waitress at the party and seems to have lost her car rick drives the woman to her home and there they discover that her car has been already <UNK> there seemingly by her father dixon <UNK> duvall rick and <UNK> walk into the house arguing about the situation when <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in front of rick and he then spends the night with her br br rick wakes up in the morning and <UNK> encounters him later in the day asking him to file suit against her father because of his dangerous behavior rick now obsessed with <UNK> and willing to do anything for her is successful in having dixon put on trial and sent to prison but when he is freed by his local friends rick finds himself in a trouble trying to protect himself and his children from the danger he has <UNK> brought to life
<START> atlantis the lost empire was everything the previews <UNK> it would be it is not often you find that most of the time the previews show only the best parts and then the rest of the movie is terrible not so with this one i was pleased with the original plot even though the sub plots were not the animation was not break through like shrek but it was good none the less the plot and the story line were well presented and there were only a few slow spots in them this keeps you interested i found myself enjoying this one atlantis gets and keeps your attention you also have to think a little bit but not too much once you think about it a little you can figure out what needs to happen but you really don't know for sure how it is going to happen br br the casting was also good michael j fox as milo was an excellent choice his personality fits nicely the gruff natured commander rourke was also well chosen with james garner his character reminded me of his performance in maverick which i also liked i really liked the casting of <UNK> christian as <UNK> <UNK> her ability to play a no nonsense personality makes the film more interesting it's just too bad she is a villain br br over all definitely worth you while 8 out of 10
<START> wow the only people reviewing this positively are the carpenter <UNK> i know a lot of those the guys that'll watch john carpenter <UNK> on celluloid and <UNK> out a movie and <UNK> it a <UNK> of horror this movie is utter crap it looks and sounds like a porno good lord the soundtrack is awful and has sub par porn acting which is shocking because normally ron <UNK> is really a very good actor i honestly have no idea what carpenter was thinking when making this most likely <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> until somebody fed him and rolled him up into a <UNK> for the day they say nothing about the abortion debate whatsoever when they could have had a very interesting central theme how do religious <UNK> anti <UNK> feel when it's the devil's baby but instead they chose to have ron <UNK> and his terribly acted kids kill a bunch of people and have the horribly cast doctors try to calm the hysterically bad pregnant girl not a single person from this episode or what have you should come away <UNK> it's just awful like plan 9 from <UNK> awful like good god please would somebody turn it off before i <UNK> myself awful try watching this and the thing in the same day and your mind will <UNK>
<START> seriously i loved this film i had started to read the book and i loved it the way everything was set up and everything had a purpose i think this film did so well was because louis <UNK> wrote the screenplay and of course andrew davis directed it <UNK> <UNK> gives a great performance for his first film the storyline is very cool and interesting there's humor heart and intensity it is very similar to the book i find this film to be not the least bit boring i absolutely loved it and i encourage anyone to read the book all in all this film is very well put together and carefully crafted two thumbs up for me in every single way
<START> this was one of the dvd's i recently bought in a set of six called <UNK> to brush up our french before our planned holiday in beautiful <UNK> this year so far as well as <UNK> our french we have considerably enhanced our appreciation of french cinema br br what a breath of fresh air to the stale predictable unimaginative crash bang <UNK> drivel being <UNK> out by hollywood what a good example for screenplay writers actors directors and <UNK> to follow it was so stimulating also to see two <UNK> characters in the lead roles without them having to be glossy magazine cover figures br br the other thing i liked about this film was the slow character and plot build up which kept you guessing as to how it was all going to end is there any real good in this selfish thug who continually treats his seemingly <UNK> <UNK> with the type of contempt that an ex con would display will our sexually frustrated poor little half deaf heroine prove herself to the answer to her dreams and the situation that fate has <UNK> upon her the viewer is intrigued by these questions and the actors unravel the answers slowly and convincingly as they face events that challenge and shape their feeling towards each other br br once you have seen this film like me you may want to see it again i still have to work out the director's psychological motive for the sub plot in the role of the <UNK> officer and some of the subtle nuances of camera work are worth a second look the plot does ask for a little imagination when our hero is given a chance to assist our <UNK> and <UNK> heroine in the office you must also be broad minded to believe in her brilliant lip reading and how some of the action falls into place but if you go along for the thrilling ride with this example of french cinema at its best you will come out more than satisfied four stars out of five for me
<START> while this outing certainly doesn't live up to its predecessor it does have more than its share of memorable moments my personal favorite just after laying waste to a city block with his <UNK> cannon we see a close up of <UNK> face as a single tear <UNK> from his left eye we know at that point that <UNK> is more than just a killing machine the viewer can't help but be pulled into his emotional turmoil and we understand that his previously flat affect was only a <UNK> absolute brilliance the sex scenes display a nice balance <UNK> but not pornographic afterwards i felt i had a pretty good understanding of how to work the <UNK> <UNK> player too bad they haven't produced them in over 25 years
<START> warning here be spoilers why do i waste my <UNK> fleeing years watching garbage like this this film is an impressive collection of clichés poor writing worse directing and then we haven't even got to the acting yet br br and of course you can predict the whole story from beginning to end br br hero expert fights against stupid corrupt and incompetent henchmen one <UNK> goes off <UNK> all the heroes who somehow manage to get out alive in spite of going through all sorts of cliffhanger <UNK> corrupt partner who caused the whole thing gets fried alive together with his payoff money second <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> adventurous experiment evil henchmen in the end turn out to have a heart as well troubled teenager falls into the arms of her <UNK> stepmother after being saved by her etc etc etc etc on and on it goes br br in fact there's little reason to warn for spoilers you could probably work the whole plot out if i gave you the basic ingredients at least i wasn't too wide off the mark most of the time <UNK> what would happen next br br and then we haven't discussed the factual errors br br i agree with a previous <UNK> that even though there are usually some redeeming features even of a bad movie you'd be hard pressed to find any in this one i suppose i gave it 2 out of 10 for some nice scenery shots but that's it br br it's been some time since a film made me <UNK> but this one certainly did
<START> overall i agree wholly with <UNK> review in a sense i feel that i should not even be commenting since it is so much a <UNK> movie and i am not a vet i was a <UNK> the flaw is that martha is badly underdeveloped and does not act consistently my guess is that stephen <UNK> is a vet himself and spent too little planning time on her character
<START> channel 4 is a channel that allows more naughty stuff than any of the other channels this show was certainly a naughty one the <UNK> of this sometimes gross adult chat show four time <UNK> winning and british comedy award winning also twice nominated graham norton was just the perfect gay host for a good show like this it had one or more famous celebrities in the middle of it they basically had an adult idea which would either gross <UNK> or humour the guest but some are not for the faint hearted they had women playing the <UNK> with their parts men using their <UNK> to play a <UNK> women <UNK> <UNK> in the bath men with or without pants under their <UNK> and many more gross but hilarious ideas this is just for adults but enjoy it it won the <UNK> twice for best entertainment programme or series it won the british comedy awards for best comedy entertainment programme also nominated best comedy talk show it won an emmy for episode 18 and it won the national television awards twice for most popular talk show it was number <UNK> on the 100 greatest funny moments very good
<START> the lovely eva longoria parker plays kate who dies after an ice angel <UNK> her before the i <UNK> with fiancé henry paul rudd after two years henry has yet to move on and his sister chloe lindsay sloane is very concerned chloe <UNK> for henry to talk with an attractive psychic ashley lake bell ashley is to contact <UNK> spirit hoping to help henry get on with his life when the psychic starts getting attracted to henry <UNK> ghost appears to <UNK> the romance in the bud there are some funny situations but if you've seen the trailers you have seen the substance of the film also in the cast stephen root jason <UNK> william morgan <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i personally thought that bell stole the show from parker and <UNK> as usual a pain in the butt still this movie was over hyped
<START> this movie is more <UNK> then most especially coming from <UNK> other then the bad dub it isn't bad br br the first hour is a lot like the comic which is what all <UNK> the 3rd stuff is based on <UNK> trying to get a huge treasure <UNK> using <UNK> weakness to women to try to get something out of it the last bit isn't that bad he's with another women but of course <UNK> still him number one br br a lot of the other <UNK> movies are more family with <UNK> words then <UNK> any good <UNK> fan i think will be pleasantly surprised i know i was after hearing so many bad things about this movie it might be a bit better without the little animations rolling during the credits they make it a little <UNK> but overall it isn't a bad film good enough to be one of the few i'd watch again of the <UNK> iii movies
<START> this movie was clearly done poorly and in a rush i realize that the funding for any such movie is hard to come by however if the plot had any kind of original substance someone would have seen that it got the necessary funding this was not the case and movies like this are not necessary themselves and have no purpose in existing the plot for this movie has been done and done better i might add many times before there is no reason to make a movie that has no chance in competing with any others i was informed by my computer that i need a minimum of ten lines to submit my comment so the following lines are just bull to fill in space in my opinion there is no need for anything else to be said about this film what i've said is plenty and if you wasted enough time reading this review than for god's sake don't waste more time watching this movie the only exception to this is if you are the kind of person who likes watching crappy movies that get played on the <UNK> entertainment network at 2 00 a m in that case go ahead see what i care
<START> i have seen dirty work several times and is probably my favourite stan and ollie short br br in this one stan and ollie are <UNK> <UNK> and get the job to clean the <UNK> at the home of professor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> while <UNK> is doing mad experiments in his lab stan and ollie cause much chaos trying to clean the <UNK> and make a mess of the living room the end is where ollie falls into a tank of special formula that <UNK> uses for his experiments and this turns him into a <UNK> the best part is where ollie falls down the <UNK> and loads of <UNK> land on his head but he doesn't seem to suffer much pain from this br br dirty work is stan and ollie at their funniest great fun br br rating 5 stars out of 5
<START> nut case is murdering college students can new teacher stop the madness br br believe me you won't care br br with a title like splatter university one would immediately gather that this movie just isn't high art but worse than that splatter university doesn't even qualify for amusing garbage splatter u is so poorly made the story is mindless the characters are throw <UNK> and the whole movie lacks any essence of imagination needless to say there is no suspense or atmosphere or scares this drivel isn't even brave enough to throw in any nudity for the <UNK> thrill of all so all around this endlessly flawed slasher offers nothing in the way of entertainment not even cheap laughs and just becomes a complete bore bottom of the barrel folks even die hard slasher fans will want to think twice before viewing let alone paying money for this flick br br bomb out of
<START> jeff <UNK> has written directed <UNK> her dead <UNK> poorly the idea is first of all is as stale as my jokes and the execution is just a <UNK> on the cake br br minus eva longoria parker there is hardly anything appealing in this film eva looks great as ever and delivers a likable performance br br paul rudd looks jaded and least interested lake bell is a complete miscast she looks <UNK> and delivers a strictly average performance jason <UNK> is wasted so is lindsay sloane br br i expected entertainment more from this film sadly i didn't get entertained
<START> in the hands of a more skilled director this film would have been considered a horror masterpiece despite michael death wish <UNK> merely passable direction the movie is interesting original and more than a little scary br br the script bucks more than one horror cliché off its back several it can't shake including chris sarandon as the <UNK> boyfriend who actually <UNK> to her as she insists that eerie things are going down burgess meredith is delightful as the <UNK> insane neighbor eva <UNK> is haunting with a young beverly <UNK> as her mute and disturbed lesbian lover john carradine does a heck of a job sitting in a chair and watch out for a brief cameo from an unknown at the time chris walken this movie is creepy and creative the plot twists are lovely if a tad predictable the climax of which i will give no detail is disturbing and quite impressive again a better director could have done more with it nonetheless it is quite satisfying at least to those with the sensibilities of seventies horror br br if you like modern <UNK> body counting torture fantasy you won't like this there is almost no gore the direction is quite <UNK> the effects are few although there's some delightful makeup near the end most of which actually isn't makeup but perhaps i've said too much already br br i've rated this a little higher than its quality may justify but i enjoyed it as much as any 8 film that i've seen
<START> <UNK> <UNK> will never forget this name in his life this is the movie which caused his downfall it was released with much hype but crashed badly and laid to severe financial <UNK> for its producers and <UNK> <UNK> had to personally <UNK> them for the <UNK> <UNK> soon after its release he tried <UNK> into politics but failed miserably its a very bad movie with horrible acting bad quality makeup and pathetic screenplay throughout the movie <UNK> looks like a person suffering from some disease i'm one of the unfortunate souls who saw <UNK> first day first show in theatre the audiences were so bored that most of them left the theatre before the <UNK> sorry i'll not recommend this one to anyone
<START> okay yes this was a very tight budget movie with continuity errors like single scenes obviously filmed in sunshine and then in shadow and then mixed together and as much as i love nick <UNK> he was often a little too good at the burnt out part and some of the minor supporting cast was really bad plus at least one actor was used for two different but <UNK> roles but come on richard <UNK> was hysterical his hair alone is worth the trip steven ford was very likable <UNK> had some great lines while nancy allen ironically was completely bland and uninteresting classic no bad parts yes entertaining big yes i would have loved to have been on set the day they decided what kind of <UNK> <UNK> would have are you fast <UNK> that fast
<START> love it love it love it this is another absolutely superb performance from the divine miss m from the beginning to the end this is one big treat don't rent it buy it now
<START> <UNK> they don't come much worse than this horrid adaptation of c s <UNK> beloved novel while the adaptation is very true to the novel the acting is simply awful and the sets and special effects are on a scale equivalent to a school play i've read that the budget for this miniseries was the <UNK> that the bbc has ever given at the time but surely they could have <UNK> together a bit more than the 2 that it looks like this was filmed for the worst effect of all is mr <UNK> i know computer effects weren't at the level necessary or even cost effective at the time but the costume store man in a suit look was horrid better to have just cut the character from the film than do that to the role avoid this at all costs
<START> a question for you a family go to a new house and get stalked by demonic forces which film am i talking about every horror film you <UNK> seen yes that s true but that s not the answer i m looking for i ll narrow it down by saying there s a lot of teen angst scenes <UNK> t help well there s lots of bits where the characters are stalked by a creature and you see the characters through the creature s <UNK> no <UNK> forward okay there s a dream sequence involving lots of blood could still be any horror film you say oh <UNK> this could take weeks so i ll say the film i m talking about features loads of <UNK> many of whom have appeared in <UNK> and home and away yes that s right the film is the third circle aka <UNK> and do you understand what the above exercise is about it s about me pointing out how the third circle is absolutely no different from any horror film that s been made
<START> i'm from romania i'll try to speak in english all i want to say about this movie is that it is and will be my all time number one seen it above 30 times at least and will see it for many years now it has all the little things i like in a movie it's very touching makes me cry shows a whole lot of twisted love things and questions about love and reality and the true things that matter for different people it so happens that for me this matters the most the love the soul of a man he's inner being and this i see in this movie perhaps for me it's much more than a motion picture it's a proof in my mind that it could really exist and that you most make the best out of every moment you live with your soul mate it's a long way from reality to sci fi but what if what if all the capitalism disappeared and economy would go down would fall we would all be concerned about other issues and my thought is that on your death bed the bigger thing you remember is not the wealth not the adventure not the countries you visited and the people that remember you but the true friends and your true love and the hope that after you die all will be god damn perfect and people would be good and care more watch this movie and probably it will guide you through your life like it did to me <UNK> from romania
<START> while fred <UNK> i q doesn't really have any important qualities it's still worth seeing walter matthau plays albert einstein trying to help mechanic ed <UNK> tim robbins fall in love with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> candidate catherine <UNK> meg ryan probably the funniest scene is when dr <UNK> and friends lou <UNK> gene <UNK> and joseph <UNK> try to make ed look like a scientist he ends up looking like a french <UNK> br br obviously little of the movie is historically accurate but that's not the point it's not intended as anything except a light comedy quite the opposite of <UNK> most famous movie from 1994 the <UNK> redemption a movie about <UNK> whole life would have to focus not only on his scientific achievements but also his political <UNK> namely how he wrote a letter on behalf of the <UNK> nine and came out against nuclear weapons it got to the point where the fbi kept a file on him br br so anyway this one is acceptable also starring stephen <UNK> tony <UNK> frank <UNK> charles <UNK> and <UNK> curtis
<START> dragon hunters has to be the best looking animated film i've ever seen it was jaw dropping the film is about a couple <UNK> in search for some cash their weird <UNK> blue dog that <UNK> fire and a girl who dreams about becoming a knight and they are sent on a quest to go to the ends of the earth to kill the world <UNK> an <UNK> immense dragon but honestly it doesn't even matter what the film is about because it is jaw <UNK> gorgeous the gravity in this fantasy world is different so <UNK> of architecture and <UNK> of land <UNK> around amidst <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> alike and there are <UNK> of floating lily <UNK> the world is so creative so uniquely beautiful with a sort of muted <UNK> look to it the world looks like a set of gorgeous paintings the monsters are visually stunning as well like a fire dragon comprised of a <UNK> of evil red bats some of the plot isn't too original like the main protagonists wanting their farm a la of mice and men and never seem to be able to make it in the world but the gorgeous graphics some seriously sinister scenes and emotion <UNK> dialog makes this film spectacular
<START> the idea had potential but the movie was poorly scripted poorly acted poorly shot and poorly edited there are lots of production flaws for example dr <UNK> daughter who never ages despite the passing years wait for video but don't expect much
<START> i would rather of had my eyes <UNK> out with rusty ice picks than have had to sit through this abortion there is no plot there is no acting ability ray <UNK> has <UNK> himself and should be <UNK> from any more work i am so sorry that the industry allows crap like this to be shown on any type of medium br br <UNK> has it that <UNK> threw herself to the floor to break her other arm so she could be taken away on a <UNK> <UNK> she deserves to be married to this loser and wanna be actor director i hope she stays in london and never returns to the usa please do not waste your money on this so called film i beg of you
<START> an absorbing although repetitive and rather <UNK> analysis of exploitation and despair in a situation where there is no way forward or up where the attempts to make yourself feel better by <UNK> and putting down whoever is below you seems to be the only option but even here in this desolate <UNK> of lost dreams and no future that does not work and reaching out to something or someone to comfort and share with a simple act of charity gives some reward even if it just makes the present bearable by <UNK> memories of the past br br although there is little actual on screen violence this is a harsh and brutal film about the small <UNK> of <UNK> politically and personally that does not make for easy entertainment clearly based on a play with a small cast a <UNK> more <UNK> relation to the general social and political environment would possibly have helped the film to reach a wider audience
<START> i first learned of the wendigo many years ago in one of alvin <UNK> scary stories books according to that story the wendigo after calling your name in the wind drags you along and then pulls you up into the sky and <UNK> you while it sounds like a pretty bizarre notion <UNK> story turned it into a fairly coherent idea br br the movie wendigo doesn't it basically consists of every horror flick cliché family moves to new house and strange things start happening anyone who <UNK> them is asking for it and everyone had better listen to the old indian guy i've seen this stuff so many times that i no longer bother to count br br anyway avoid it patricia <UNK> and <UNK> per sullivan <UNK> on malcolm in the middle have done far better than this
<START> now i know french inmates are unlikely to have read <UNK> and that proves my point that his <UNK> should be taught in school maybe as a separate subject but how did they think something that sounds like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> could possibly lead to any good br br the movie takes place in a prison where four very unlikely cell mates stumble upon a magical book that may if read right get them out as <UNK> go the cell was totally unrealistic so that made it hard for me to get into the atmosphere of things it also moves rather slowly which may bore people but other than that this is top notch horror feeling mixing <UNK> hell is other people with a <UNK> barker type of story and doing rather successfully br br bottom line take the time to watch this that means not doing it when you are about to go to work or to sleep or while doing something else this is a movie that works best if you are immersed into it lessons to be learned <UNK> is bad almost as bad as french women
<START> absolutely <UNK> slasher film has not one redeeming quality it has camp <UNK> angela pamela anderson awful as the killer her <UNK> when she wastes people aren't even amusing on the <UNK> <UNK> teenagers who act the least bit naughty or resist her <UNK> for good behavior we run the gamut of boring clichéd killings such as the <UNK> to the throat to one kid looking for his freddy <UNK> <UNK> a kid who gets a chainsaw one girl who gets <UNK> one who gets shoved into the <UNK> filled with <UNK> one who is <UNK> etc br br it doesn't have one original idea to offer and is merely a waste of time that is unless you want to see valerie <UNK> who plays the slut ally tits most of the violence occurs off screen so even that will not satisfy
<START> i hadn't heard about brashear before i watched this this is the story of him and the man who trained him helping him to become the first african american us navy diver a tale of will power the plot is well written and develops nicely throughout this is what it seems the typical underdog thing and it doesn't hold too many surprises it's also quite hollywood but hey i don't know the actual man maybe it's close to how it actually happened nevertheless it gets the job done with dramatic scenes and <UNK> along the way and this is inspirational for anyone who's ever heard the words no you can't be spoken about their life long dream the acting performances are all excellent deniro and gooding jr both shine whenever they're on screen <UNK> is marvelous as well the characters are well written credible and consistent this is well edited and features good cinematography the production values are high and this does a fairly convincing job of <UNK> us back to the 50's this is the only film i've seen by this director and the writer though i may now consider looking into more they're responsible for there is a <UNK> amount of strong language otherwise no offensive material i recommend this to anyone who finds the subject interesting and or fans of those who made it 7 10
<START> if you like to see animals being skinned alive their heads <UNK> dogs throats being crushed my men <UNK> on them then this one is for you but if you are somewhat normal and don't need to see real footage of animal cruelty pass this one up this movie tries to shock the viewer and it sure does with the animal snuff at the beginning and the killing of babies in the movie fake at least its was enough to make myself turn it off i've seen movies like this before that show <UNK> footage btk movie and this kind of footage should not be allowed in a horror movie we watch gore and horror because we know its just make up and special effects so we shouldn't sit down to watch a movie and see the real killing of animals its not what we rented the movie for if anything there should be a large warning label put on these types of garbage movies so people won t be surprised by it as a very hardcore horror fan this one turned my stomach the entire movie cast and crew need their heads checked
<START> this film takes you to another time when there was a different pace to everyday life we get an idea how families had to deal with the war and how quickly we sent young men off to fight a very touching look at the past and a reminder that <UNK> of war don't just happen on the front br br luckily many of us have never had to go through what our great grandparents grandparents or parents went through during a war this film i think is a small thank you peter <UNK> looks amazingly like a young peter o'toole and russell <UNK> is absolutely charming and as australian as he can be it's definitely worth listening to him <UNK> high flight and makes me wonder what he might accomplish with shakespeare
<START> this movie starts out hilarious from about the 15 second mark and continues it throughout the movie i cannot recall a scene where i didn't turn to look at people laughing with me he is the perfect actor for this roll because of the way he looks and the way he dressed br br the comedic parts were great to see from actors not very big or popular as you can see people do like this movie it is currently rated 7 9 on imdb i think it should be in 250 lets put it this way i haven't seen this funny of a movie since american pie or the original vacation see it if you want a laugh i give this movie 2 of the highest thumbs up i have ever given since i found out about imdb great movie site
<START> in my opinion this movie advances no new thought seems to me like taking a <UNK> to a <UNK> without looking to the side the director seems to have an agenda duh i find that his rational is lacking there does not seem to be room for the alternative view i for one am usually on the side of the <UNK> but this movie lacks credibility as it relies on the fantastic observations of the man woman on the street really now if you wish to <UNK> a credible alternative to a <UNK> held onto for 2000 years you have got to make more of an effort allowing the other side to voice their beliefs i'm not sure but at the beginning of the movie it felt like an attack on the <UNK> faith i for one am a non believer but allow for the beliefs of others and would not wish no <UNK> them but try to understand and tolerate
<START> theodore rex is possibly the greatest cinematic experience of all time and is certainly a <UNK> in human culture civilization and artistic expression in this compelling intellectual masterpiece jonathan r <UNK> <UNK> himself with the great film makers of the 20th century such as francis ford <UNK> martin <UNK> orson welles and roman polanski the special effects are nothing less than breathtaking and make any work by spielberg look trite and <UNK> at the time of it's release theodore rex was such a revolutionary gem that it raised the bar of film making to levels never anticipated by film makers the concept of making not just a motion picture featuring a dinosaur but adapting an action packed thrilling detective novel co staring a talking dinosaur with a post modern name such as theodore and an existential female police officer changed humanity as we know it the world could never be the same after experiencing such magnificent beauty watching theodore rex is much akin to looking into the face of god and hearing him say you are my most beloved creation this is one of the few films that is simply to die for
<START> when two writers make a screenplay of a horror version of breakfast at <UNK> you know something is going to go right drew barrymore patrick <UNK> leslie hope and sally <UNK> are excellent actors the fbi agent was a terrible actor the scenes where patrick looked holly up and down like some sort of <UNK> those was just weird drew barrymore is very hot intimate strangers where sally <UNK> worked was a great part the weird <UNK> worm was just weird nathan was a very handsome cat but what was that scene where patrick followed holly into a <UNK> and mr gooding attacked him and the scene with dr wallace what was he doing <UNK> around in there and not every male has a female as sally <UNK> stated and when patrick and elizabeth saw drew outside of <UNK> that was weird
<START> scary movie 3 isn't as funny as its predecessors but its still has its funny moments it all begins when <UNK> reporter cindy campbell sets out to find a hard news story in the middle of television <UNK> she soon <UNK> an outrageous <UNK> of globe threatening developments including alien <UNK> killer <UNK> freaky crop circles and much more faced with <UNK> of massive proportions and a crew of very strange people following her around cindy must fight to stop evil from taking over the world yet again the plot is a non issue here as the first two were pretty much plot less this time around they focus on signs the ring matrix <UNK> and 8 mile as well as many others just not as much as the previously mentioned ones the first one was imo one of the funniest films i have ever seen the second one wasn't as good but still quite funny the third one is mildly enjoyable but its nothing special let's just say that i didn't mind seeing it once but i probably wouldn't want to see it again the jokes are either hit or miss and the ones that are funny usually involve charlie sheen the lame ones usually involve anthony anderson as he is very overrated why he keeps getting cast is unclear because he isn't funny anna <UNK> gives a funny performance and she's also kind of underrated simon rex shows some potential as he actually wasn't so bad <UNK> hall also returns as brenda and she gives a pretty funny performance the rest of the cast were pretty much a bunch of cameos jenny mccarthy and pamela anderson probably had the funniest scene out of all the cameos their in the opening sequence <UNK> the ring and that scene turns out to be on of the more enjoyable ones in the film denise richards queen <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and many others also have cameos david <UNK> directs and while this isn't another airplane it's also not another my <UNK> daughter either its pointless to really analyze a straight comedy as the main thing that people want to know if its funny or not like i said before if you do like it you probably won't really like it that much in the end i found it a bit disappointing as the pg 13 rating kind of <UNK> it but it can still be enjoyed rating 6 3 10
<START> i'll give credit where credit is due and say that linda <UNK> gives a good performance as a hard drinking actress who does what she wants she's <UNK> sassy hard edged and very sexy she is much better than this film deserves br br but that is it this dull suspense film is a <UNK> mess attempting at once to be a stalker thriller a murder thriller a tale of loyalty and betrayal and a steamy erotic thriller the film my friends isn't thrilling in the slightest br br for instance who thought of casting c thomas <UNK> as a <UNK> leading man he is not ugly but for crying out loud it looks as though <UNK> tough cookie <UNK> is getting it on with a <UNK> teacher <UNK> has neither the authority or screen presence to fill the leading man role br br the script is by far the worst aspect of the film there is no tension as <UNK> character gets eerie phone calls there is no mystery concerning her guilt in the murders that are the focus of the film there is no sense of <UNK> as <UNK> gets <UNK> <UNK> to lose his <UNK> br br look for interesting but poorly done cameos by adam <UNK> and <UNK> hayes and one really really good sex scene between <UNK> and <UNK> besides that my first <UNK> would be to put this sorry piece of trash down and go rent something else
<START> ok this movie was cool i don't think it was the best movie ever made but it sure was fun my brother and i still act out scenes once in a while and will occasionally <UNK> the movie out of the <UNK> blow off the dust and pop it in enjoyable all the way until the end but a great concept this is a movie that one has to just forget criticism all together and just enjoy judgment is victory for robot <UNK>
<START> escaping the life of being <UNK> by her father and the <UNK> <UNK> who dies in an explosion lily powers barbara stanwyck who is simply ravishing <UNK> her way through the <UNK> inside a bank business in big city <UNK> when a <UNK> lover murders who was supposed to be his next father in law and <UNK> new lover the <UNK> the limit for lily as she has written down her various relationships in a diary and subtlety makes it known the papers will receive it if certain pay doesn't come into her hands newly <UNK> president to the bank <UNK> <UNK> george brent sends lily to paris instead of <UNK> over lots of <UNK> but soon finds himself <UNK> in love after various encounters with her in the city of love this makes <UNK> mouth water as now she'll have reached the <UNK> of success <UNK> a man of wealth and <UNK> bring <UNK> her way though circumstances ensue which will bring her to make a decision that threatens her successful way of achieving those <UNK> <UNK> now her husband is being <UNK> with jail certain and has lost the bank he needs money lily now has in her possession or he'll have absolutely nothing br br stanwyck is the whole movie despite that usual warner brothers polish being set in the pre code era gives the filmmakers the chance to elaborate on taboo subjects such as a woman using sex to achieve success and how that can lead to tragedy good direction from alfred e green shows through subtlety hints in different mannerisms and speech through good acting from the seductive performance of stanwyck how to stage something without actually showing the explicit act obviously the film shows that money isn't everything and all that jazz as love comes into the heart of <UNK> dead heart that ending having lily achieve the <UNK> <UNK> into someone in love didn't ring true to me she's spent all this time to get to that platform only to fall for a man who was essentially no different than others she had used before him
<START> i have to say that sometimes looks are all that matters just like jeremy <UNK> from bbc has pointed out not about our earth though but he is right anyway br br and when it comes to looks this movie is such an unbelievably stunning beauty you will absolutely love what your eyes are about to see br br and then there's the personality of the movie as well interesting with a captivating narrator voice and narrator stories that will touch your soul as you watch those superbly filmed images br br the movie probably won't affect your lifestyle ruining these <UNK> but it will certainly remember you how precious our earth we live on truly is br br this movie deserves it's 10 stars as it is one of the few <UNK> earth documentaries i truly enjoyed
<START> this movie has a special way of telling the story at first i found it rather odd as it jumped through time and i had no idea whats happening br br anyway the story line was although simple but still very real and touching you met someone the first time you fell in love completely but broke up at last and promoted a deadly agony who hasn't go through this but we will never forget this kind of pain in our life br br i would say i am rather touched as two actor has shown great performance in showing the love between the characters i just wish that the story could be a happy ending
<START> i saw this movie when i was much younger and i thought it was funny i saw it again last week and you can guess the result some funny parts in it very few and too long the beginning is the only thing that is funny if you ask me br br if you want a total b movie this is a good pick but don't expect too much from aliens dwarf size
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or pee pee pee as i prefer to call him due to his love of showing male <UNK> is perhaps the most overrated european <UNK> director and they are thick on the ground how anyone can see art in this messy cheap sex romp <UNK> is beyond me some of the stories here could have come straight out of a soft core porn film and i am not even so much referring to the nudity but the simplistic and banal often pointless stories anyone who enjoyed this relatively watchable but dumb <UNK> should really sink his teeth into the der <UNK> soft porn german 70s movie series because that's what <UNK> looks like to me br br besides the movie is sloppy on nearly all levels from start to finish br br 1 editing an example at 1 hour 15 minutes 45 seconds there is a chasing scene that is put quite clearly in the wrong place it was supposed to be placed about a minute later but i guess that <UNK> must have hired <UNK> up <UNK> who have little time for the fine details of movie making pee pee <UNK> fans would probably counter this by saying that it was placed there intentionally which i very much doubt besides even if that were true that would be even worse because that story <UNK> absolutely nothing by making it harder to follow this isn't exactly <UNK> or one of <UNK> broken form films br br 2 acting <UNK> sloppy triple <UNK> fans all 8 of them proudly <UNK> how <UNK> o uses real people instead of actors aren't actors people or are they martians sure many actors have sub par <UNK> but does that mean we should treat them with contempt other directors have used amateurs and succeeded such as alan parker or de niro so why are <UNK> amateurs so utterly awful in his movies the answer is once again appalling <UNK> <UNK> is sloppy in everything and that includes trying to get as much out of his <UNK> amateurs as he can he is a lazy director an <UNK> if you like the anti kubrick i suppose pee pee <UNK> principal goal when casting must have been to find as many <UNK> old people as possible and young men that are to his liking in <UNK> world there is a simple formula lack of teeth strange face realism it's all well and fine to have them <UNK> but at least try to <UNK> out some at least semi decent performances out of these inexperienced neo <UNK> otherwise you're an amateur yourself an amateur director in <UNK> case whether <UNK> 0 wasn't capable of this feat or simply didn't care doesn't change anything who knows maybe he didn't even notice the awful acting br br 3 audio the <UNK> if <UNK> 0 felt that <UNK> are too much of a <UNK> when filming a movie then he ought to have at least made a <UNK> effort in post production i e getting all these bum actors to say their lines on cue in the studio so that we the viewers wouldn't have to watch mouths move while the <UNK> dialogue <UNK> elsewhere in the movie br br 4 lack of concept we have close to a dozen stories which aren't connected in any meaningful way some are anti church more on that later while some are merely sex <UNK> i e cheap male sometimes gay fantasies designed to <UNK> and nothing else the stories and characters are not amusing if at all on an intelligent level but on the <UNK> level 10 year old kids can laugh here and there is nothing wrong with that but then don't call it <UNK> intellectual art br br 5 as a result of point 4 there is also a lack of logic in the order of the stories that goes without saying pee pee pee could have arranged the order in any other way and we would have had the exact same movie this also means that you can feel free to start from the middle then go back to the beginning etc <UNK> is like a bowl of spaghetti that way when you start eating it you can begin with any thread you want it makes no difference at all br br 6 the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> most stories end with a cheap gag joke i e some damn dumb punchline straight out of a porn comic book whereas some stories don't even have a conclusion they merely end <UNK> at best the stories are watchable semi <UNK> barely any deeper meaning there unless you find deep meanings in a porno there is of course nothing easier than looking for and finding meaning where there is an absence of it hence even any hardcore porn film can be <UNK> <UNK> over endlessly it's easy and fun try it oh <UNK> 8 <UNK> fans br br as for the church bashing some viewers get all excited about his attack on <UNK> and what not in principal that's all well and fine after all i'm an <UNK> myself but what those people ignore is the simple but essential fact that <UNK> was a <UNK> it's like the pot calling the <UNK> black a <UNK> <UNK> the church for <UNK> and stupidity where does he get the nerve besides <UNK> wasn't an <UNK> hence his high and mighty and self righteous stance isn't justified after all <UNK> are <UNK> they merely <UNK> the accepted god with the idea of a <UNK> which is merely another supernatural <UNK> thinking fantasy hence i cannot get excited about <UNK> anti religion antics br br this <UNK> <UNK> anthology ends with <UNK> saying rather <UNK> i wonder why produce a work of art when it's nice just to dream about it he wasn't actually referring to this silly little movie as art was he in case he was the poor <UNK> man then i have to wonder why he didn't just leave it at dreaming and not make all those bad movies br br wanna read my altered subtitles of bergman

<START> <UNK> first mainstream slasher film hits the screen with a bang and a stab and a slice and a scream or two and plenty of blood <UNK> red herrings and lots of laughs br br in fact there's lots of first surrounding cut it's the first script of dave <UNK> to be produced although he has several others either <UNK> or in <UNK> it's the first major film from director and former <UNK> guru <UNK> <UNK> and it's also the first film for producer martin <UNK> and for a bunch of guys <UNK> their <UNK> into this genre for the first time they sure know their stuff br br cut tells the story of a bunch of australian film students who hear about a slasher film hot blooded that was never finished because its director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was killed by the actor playing the psycho killer in the film br br despite their <UNK> who was assistant director on the night <UNK> died warning them that whenever someone tries to start up production of hot blooded again someone dies director <UNK> jessica <UNK> and producer <UNK> sarah <UNK> decide to go ahead and complete the film they put together a crew and manage to get the original star vanessa <UNK> molly <UNK> to return to australia in fact to the original location to complete hot blooded  14 years after shooting shut down br br of course this being a slasher film lots of <UNK> ensues  long with plenty of laughs a few good scares and a <UNK> aussie soundtrack cut shows that australia can make a good mass market horror film just as well as hollywood br br it's a finely crafted feature with excellent special effects a taut plot and a killer <UNK> that's a welcome addition to the ranks of michael jason and freddy
<START> ghost train is a fine and entertaining film typical of the better british comedy <UNK> of the 1930s and 40s the antics of comedian arthur <UNK> are not as funny as they once apparently were but this can be overcome by viewing him as a period piece or a curiosity br br for a low budget wartime production ghost train is atmospheric effective and it provides some genuine suspense great fun for a dark and yes <UNK> night <UNK> up take off the <UNK> hat and enjoy
<START> a huge disappointment from writer <UNK> and director <UNK> their previous collaboration on the first <UNK> <UNK> was twisted and darkly hilarious in all the right ways this poor handling of an intriguing premise left me <UNK> the supposed payoff showing generic aliens <UNK> something from the brains of the infected <UNK> was completely unsatisfying and explained nothing if the point of the story was an <UNK> cleaning of the planet of it's human <UNK> why did they go about it in such a <UNK> sadistic and misogynistic fashion why not just <UNK> a completely lethal virus a la stephen king's the stand instead of having the male population butcher the females i kept hoping the episode would improve as i kept watching but it just got more pretentious and preposterous the religious subtext simply seemed forced but it was clear sam <UNK> must have thought it was profound by the weight he gave it i like a lot of both <UNK> and <UNK> work but this was just unwatchable
<START> brilliant technology but what good does it do if the content is hollow and foolish i have left after than 30 minutes of watching being bored and irritated br br the theatre administration returned my money but the time <UNK> and <UNK> remained i have been had and no thanks to the stars whose names were the main attraction br br george meryl bill i hope you were well paid you might have even liked it so i apologies for my limited mind a lot of people seemed to like it too look at the comments oh well br br wish to know what is remotely redeeming in a story about mr fox the husband the father the citizen the whatever

<START> christopher guest need not worry his supreme hold on the <UNK> sub genre is not in trouble of being <UNK> in the least especially not by this extremely unfunny <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> the jokes are beyond lame not enough substance to last the typical length of a particularly <UNK> snl skit much less the <UNK> atrocious minutes i <UNK> watching this drivel the great william <UNK> greatest american hero house deserves much much better one thing and one thing alone makes the fact that i saw this worth it in my mind and that's <UNK> about it on here so hopefully just hopefully i'll save someone such a bad experience br br my grade d br br dvd extras 2 audio <UNK> 7 interviews with various cast members 4 deleted scenes theatrical trailer br br dvd <UNK> extras 2 <UNK> br br <UNK> egg highlight the eye in the picture on the main menu for a short scene
<START> let me be clear i've used imdb for years but only today i went through the trouble of <UNK> on the site just so i could give this movie the lowest possible rating i've seen hundreds of films some of them bad a few awful never though have i seen such a contrast of <UNK> and incompetence of high intentions and failure br br mira sorvino is horribly cast as the princess but entirely unbelievable as <UNK> a young boy <UNK> shaw is always an entertaining character but the dialogue in the film is much worse even than in the insipid french play that is the source <UNK> never reached hollywood until now and we should keep it that way br br to illustrate for example that <UNK> is a brilliant passionate <UNK> and scientist she is shown <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> to <UNK> shouting out names of famous scientists and the romance between <UNK> and the princess is played even <UNK> for this the pair should receive a joint <UNK> <UNK> award which in a just world would be awarded for <UNK> <UNK> and uninspired re interpretation of interesting teens from literature as <UNK> of the 1990's see miss danes in les <UNK> br br aside from the atrocious plot and dialogue there are some attempts to introduce artistic <UNK> into the filming for example there are moments when a handful of <UNK> are faded in and out of view of the action sitting in <UNK> watching the principal characters the director wants us to realize she's adapted a play i get it but it doesn't happen at all until far into the film at that point seeing a crowd of people sitting in <UNK> for a moment then disappearing is creepy and distracting they're like some sort of un scary zombie crowd appearing through the <UNK> filling us with dread when you see the horrible <UNK> and song that ends this movie you'll want to <UNK> your own crowd of zombies and kill them all for the grave <UNK> of <UNK> your mind for <UNK> minutes br br matthew <UNK>
<START> this 2003 made for tv movie was shown on a women's channel naturally as a man why do i even attempt to watch this i don't know but i should have my head examined and director and writer simon <UNK> should be ashamed of himself to give men an injustice as he does he takes away any strength and conviction a man could have by having several boring women do him in number one bore is <UNK> <UNK> as the wife i couldn't wait for him to drop her her revenge was silly and stupid and very confusing through most of the movie the other femme fatale was <UNK> <UNK> about the <UNK> person you'd ever want to meet her looks didn't warrant our leading man to go that ape over her and her acting was so obvious only a fool could miss definitely a loser <UNK> locke was pretty good but slow on the <UNK> as to the slut <UNK> her own husband again played as a guy who is a loser by david <UNK> <UNK> out our cast of losers is anthony <UNK> as a boss who has little to do but <UNK> at our hero stephen <UNK> as our hero or should i say victim was not that good at first i thought he just a bad actor but later i believed it he never got the part off the ground and was repetitive throughout although as a man i became <UNK> when the two women got away with it men beware of this channel that puts men down and women get away even with murder <UNK> is the channel beware note having watched this a second time by mistake i am convinced on my initial thoughts especially on the writer director simon <UNK> i still believe he has <UNK> the male species and should be horse whipped only saving grace in this film is <UNK> locke who doesn't have a chance to show her talents with the awful acting of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> around her plus the stupid plot that only makes it worse down with <UNK> movie and his <UNK> stars in it please <UNK> don't show this trite again
<START> first of all let's get a few things straight here a i am an anime fan always has been as a matter of fact i used to watch speed <UNK> all the time in <UNK> b i do like several b movies because they're hilarious c i like the godzilla movies a lot br br moving on when the movie first comes on it seems like it's going to be your usual b movie down to the crappy fx but all a sudden boom the anime comes on this is when the movie goes <UNK> downhill br br the animation is very bad cheap even worse than what i remember from speed <UNK> for <UNK> in fact it's so cheap one of the few scenes from the movie i vividly remember is when a bunch of kids run out of a school it's the same kids over over again the fx are terrible too the dinosaurs look worse than godzilla in addition the transition to live action to animation is <UNK> the dialogue voices especially the english dub that i viewed was horrid i was begging my dad to take the tape out of the dvd vhs player the only thing that kept me surviving was cracking out jokes comments like the robots joel mike on mst3k you pick the season honestly this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie survive it at the same time br br heck i'm planning to show this to another fellow <UNK> pal of mine on halloween for a b movie night because it's stupid pretty painful to watch unintentionally hilarious at the same time i'm giving this movie a 3 10 an improvement from the 0 5 10 i was originally going to give it br br according to my <UNK> scale 3 10 means pretty much both boring bad as fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it then it will become as fun as counting to 15
<START> i rented this movie simply because rosario dawson was in it i sat down to watch it with my buddy and 6 minutes in we were glued to our seats not because of any intensity in those 6 minutes but because it was a real film no hollywood <UNK> no explosions no corny one liners film it drew you in slowly <UNK> you toward a <UNK> human fate some people think they enjoy film but they are sadly mistaken they like movies mindless entertainment for <UNK> sake alone michael <UNK> transformers and the like were produced for just this audience no need to think people just watch and allow ever stereotype we can <UNK> to slowly <UNK> your brain we'll even place <UNK> throughout the movie to keep you buying our products and don't forget the explosions we all love explosions here we make the distinction art can be entertaining but it's also thought provoking and moves you in hidden ways entertainment is rarely <UNK> and even then only <UNK> movie are entertainment descent is a film film is art br br if you still house a soul within your walking meat sack <UNK> this rape scene is every bit as powerful as <UNK> the distinction here is that <UNK> was a violent rape scene involving two people whose paths have unfortunately crossed at the wrong time and hell <UNK> descent is about date rape no less disgusting no less <UNK> just different this is about trust <UNK> soul <UNK> and the <UNK> that run deep had the character <UNK> been <UNK> it would have been a hot sex scene but seeing as she was desperate to escape the scene is sickening jared is a sick and manipulative serial rapist and it's wholly unsettling because it so closely resembles a passionate love affair how could <UNK> ever be close to anyone again when even in the midst of <UNK> her <UNK> slick lover boy <UNK> only ever hints at <UNK> she is ruined br br the film as a whole is beautiful the camera work and lighting at times <UNK> the surroundings and focuses everything on <UNK> and the silent inner <UNK> of her mind all this accomplished by rosario with facial expression and gesture the soundtrack was excellent a blend of everything my particularly favorite scene being a <UNK> of all these film aspects working together <UNK> dancing in a sea of <UNK> bodies something inside her awakening becoming aware all set to a beautifully sad jeff <UNK> tune br br i don't think i've really spoiled anything here but i'm stopping before i do bottom line i think this was the best film of 2007 hands down unfortunately it seems that everyone is so jaded these days that if you don't hack and slash gang rape or <UNK> anything then people just can't be bothered death isn't the worst thing that can happen to you it's only the last thing that will happen in this existence the worst things that happen never leave you they are always in your thoughts when you shower when you brush your teeth when you buy a christmas present when you tie your shoe they haunt you they haunt you until that last thing releases you br br treat yourself challenge yourself watch this film
<START> this quasi j horror film followed a young woman as she returns to her childhood village on the island of <UNK> to sell the family house and meet up with old friends she finds that one the daughter of the village <UNK> drowned several years earlier she and <UNK> another childhood friend then learn that <UNK> mother is trying to bring her back to life with black magic already the bonds between the dead and living are getting weak and the friends and villagers are seeing ghosts nothing was exceptional or even very good about this movie unlike stellar j horror films the suspense doesn't really build the result doesn't seem overly threatening and the ending borders on the absurd br br this movie is like plain white rice <UNK> a little too long so that it is <UNK> on <UNK> sometimes you get this at poor asian <UNK> or cook your own white rice a little too long you end up eating it because you need it with the meal because what is chinese or japanese food without rice but it almost ruins the meal because of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of it all 3 10 http <UNK> <UNK> com <UNK>
<START> okay now i know there are millions of americans who believe in the rapture that moment when all people born again in christ will be <UNK> up to meet god and all the rest of humanity will be left on earth to <UNK> in <UNK> and fire and the <UNK> of <UNK> as the <UNK> battles it out with jesus in an <UNK> <UNK> mode and i know the books were best sellers among <UNK> anyway and i mean no <UNK> to all that br br but i have to say they stuffed this movie into a sack and beat it with the suck stick br br i'm sure the books are much better really br br the plot needs no <UNK> if you've watched this movie chances are you read the book i may be one of the only people on earth who actually watched this just for the sheer bad moving making experience and i wasn't disappointed especially not by kirk cameron the creepy little growing pains <UNK> who came of age on that show found christ and decided that the show should reflect his christian values well kirk your career has gone to the dogs but now you can be happy that you're <UNK> the word of god in movies so bad they never even make it to theatrical release well that's not strictly true i guess this was the only movie ever made that went to dvd first with a <UNK> for a free viewing of the movie when it was briefly released in theaters i still have the <UNK> how many people do you suppose showed up i don't know about you but it never came to my town of course i live in nyc where we <UNK> <UNK> sit around <UNK> pages out of the bible and use them to roll <UNK> so there you go in fact i'll bet out of three million people on manhattan island not one would be <UNK> br br check out the <UNK> <UNK> on the dvd where you'll learn the creepy behind the scenes details of these movies the cast and crew all must be of the same religious mindset they don't come right out and say this but listen closely to what the filmmakers say it's like a bunch of <UNK> people got together to make a <UNK> movie how <UNK> is that honestly this stuff just <UNK> to the converted doesn't it can you imagine anyone who doesn't <UNK> to the whole apocalypse thing watching this <UNK> his <UNK> and saying holy hoover <UNK> i better get saved <UNK> anyhow i'm hooked i gotta see the rest of these christian fiasco movies especially the one with gary busey which i think is <UNK> at least busey has an excuse for taking the part he <UNK> his head on some <UNK> when he crashed his motorcycle br br <UNK> br br oh and one more thing what's with all the shots of poor innocent dogs <UNK> their <UNK> dragging <UNK> along the ground because their owners have been called to heaven what's up with that are we supposed to feel badly for the dogs and if we do what are we to make of god doesn't it <UNK> people that there's no room in heaven for man's best friend <UNK> br br this is one more reason i'm <UNK> good night and good luck
<START> i gave it an 8 only because it had received such low votes this is definitely really about a 5 5 <UNK> it was kind of bloody had likeable shallow characters and it had some really hot babes in it i like the <UNK> killer because he didn't kill people the same way <UNK> that sometimes gets old
<START> sorry to say i have no idea what hollywood is doing sure give us movies like batman begins oh by the way hollywood i think they may cover the story line in the movie batman but please don't entertain us what we would really want to see batman and superman together i really hated this trailer because it left me wanting for more i was looking around to see when it was coming out it was like a terrible practical joke the graphics where good the story line seemed solid and it had all the <UNK> of a great movie unfortunately it's not going to happen for now to the producers directors and all the actors great job but i hate you for doing this to me you left me wanting more
<START> this movie displays the kind of ensemble work one wishes for in every film barbara <UNK> and donald sutherland who play husband and wife are positive chilling discussing the family business as if it were a <UNK> store or a dry <UNK> macy campbell <UNK> and ritter are also terrific they play off each other like members of a top notch theatrical <UNK> who realize that a quality product requires each actor to support the others <UNK> and finally there's sammy david <UNK> what an amazing performance from a child and what an uncanny resemblance he has to <UNK> whose son he plays br br we're treated to a unique story in panic and that's a <UNK> in these days of tired formulaic crap the dialogue is sharp and smart and this relatively short film nevertheless has the power to <UNK> a full range of emotions from the viewer there are places to laugh to be shocked to be horrified to be <UNK> to be <UNK> to be angry and to love it's not a movie that leaves you jumping for joy but when it's over you're more than satisfied knowing you've spent the last ninety minutes experiencing a darn good piece of work br br more of us would go to theatres if we were treated to quality fare like this when are the powers that be in hollywood going to wake up it's a real shame when something this good fails to get exposure beyond festivals and <UNK> fortunate enough to have cable
<START> i found this a very entertaining small kids movie that actually is <UNK> more for adults with a lot of jokes and humor only they would understand a few things are inappropriate for the <UNK> but just a few <UNK> the grinch jim carrey cracks so many jokes you can't keep up with them all ranging from sexual to cultural to <UNK> hollywood to racial br br the film is very colorful and looks great on dvd the little girl in here cindy lou who taylor <UNK> is really cute and the costumes and <UNK> of the little people in here are fun to view anthony <UNK> voice is pleasing too so having his <UNK> this <UNK> the movie further his <UNK> are fun to hear br br i saw this in the theater though it was fair but on dvd it was far better i've seen in three times and it got better each time
<START> on the face of it a film about women wanting to see a football match wouldn't appeal much to somebody with little interest in football such as myself however this isn't about football it is about <UNK> and the women's enthusiasm for the sport they love br br the film opens on the day of a crucial world cup <UNK> match between iran and <UNK> a girl is trying to get in to <UNK> <UNK> stadium by dressing like a boy it looks like she will get in until a soldier tries to search her once caught she is taken to a small <UNK> high up on the outside of the stadium where there are a handful of women who had already been caught here they are <UNK> by a small group of <UNK> soldiers who's leader would rather be back home <UNK> his <UNK> we never learn the character's names but we get to know them as people as the girls <UNK> with the guards to let them watch though a nearby gap in the wall and when refused try to get them to at least provide a commentary br br as well as making an important point about the rigid gender <UNK> in much of present day iran the film contains many hilarious moments such as the disguise one of the girls is made to wear when going to the toilet and the girl who disguised herself as a soldier and was only caught because she chose to watch the match from a seat reserved for a senior officer the girls enthusiasm for the game is such that by the end the viewer is likely to be on the edge of their seat hoping that iran will win and thus get to go to the <UNK> in germany the soldiers aren't shown as <UNK> they are just <UNK> who are there because they have to be and when explaining to the girls why woman can't watch men's sports don't seem that convinced by their own arguments br br it is a shame that this film can't be seen in iran itself but it is good that the wider world can see it and thus see that ordinary <UNK> aren't a bunch of fanatics desperate to <UNK> war on the west but normal people with the same passions and concerns as people everywhere the cast did a great job in making their characters seem like real people rather than mere caricatures
<START> i created my own reality by walking out of the theater i was <UNK> in by my girlfriend into going to this dreck with her mom we my g friend and i walked out about an hour into it what a load of pseudo scientific new age <UNK> br br sub atomic <UNK> are thoughts by <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> of water and <UNK> it by a <UNK> monk it grew little pretty <UNK> a drop of 25 in the murder rate in <UNK> happened when a bunch of folks <UNK> wow what a <UNK> scientific study i'm sure that someone ate <UNK> for four days straight during the same time should we conclude that eating <UNK> caused a drop in the murder rate br br <UNK> <UNK> bull <UNK> br br btw it was <UNK> by the <UNK> cult the leader of which was one of the experts which were interview by the filmmakers no <UNK> motives here right
<START> i was so impressed with doug <UNK> film version of the jane austen novel emma and i loved the music score by rachel portman so much that when i went to the video store one day and discovered the two had re united for nicholas <UNK> i immediately rented it without any other consideration br br i have read the book and for those overly critical fans of this jane austen adaptation i don't know what else <UNK> could have done to more perfectly capture the spirit and major plot elements of miss <UNK> work especially given the limitations of a two hour movie which some have complained about being too long and as far as <UNK> <UNK> accent is concerned i must confess i wasn't too familiar with her when i saw this at the theater initially and i was absolutely convinced at the time that she was an english actress br br i am taken <UNK> by those who criticized the film for its lush scenery that is one of the things i enjoy and look forward to seeing in period pieces set in the english countryside the film's beautiful backgrounds are a major <UNK> to its appeal and success if your idea of <UNK> fare is something <UNK> then perhaps you should rent something like death wish iii br br the english country settings are as attractive and charming as the cast and combine with the story and soundtrack for entertainment that makes you not tire of repeat viewings <UNK> is a wonder at <UNK> the interplay of subtle expressions that are so essential in conveying the complicated romantic intrigue that occurs in this story br br this refreshing movie could also be a clinic on how enjoyable a film can be minus sex violence or even a villainous antagonist the story is often amusing endearing and at times quite touching br br i have seen many competent jane austen book adaptations but this is without question my favorite
<START> i saw this movie on mystery science theater when it was called it lives by night that title is much less misleading than <UNK> in fact it would more accurately be called <UNK> this movie is about a doctor who studies bats i am thinking because he wants to make a better cure for <UNK> this is not really clear what is clear is that he and his wife take a tour of a cave and he gets bitten by a bat why a scientist needs to take a tour to study bats is beyond me shouldn't he be able to go in by himself well after being bitten he and his wife go on their honeymoon where he starts having fits they go to the worst doctor ever the guy stays in the hospital and kills a nurse in the end the guy kills 3 4 people and his wife stands by him and you are supposed to be rooting for him instead of the sheriff investigating the murders
<START> i actually retired from asian horror films some time ago after becoming completely sick of seeing <UNK> ghost story rubbish however i've been getting more and more into exploitation flicks recently and so decided to give them another chance my first <UNK> of call was highly rated director takashi miike's highly rated <UNK> <UNK> i'd already seen audition and while i didn't like it much i do rate it as one of the better modern asian horror films so i went into this with sensible expectations and unfortunately found only boredom i suppose this movie is actually really clever and it just went over my head but what it seemed like to me was simply a collection of violent and nasty scenes with little or no <UNK> between them any comparisons to the work of luis <UNK> and david lynch is <UNK> as far as i'm concerned all miike has done here is make a film any intelligence surrounding it has been <UNK> by pretentious fans desperate to find some kind of meaning my headache set in about 10 minutes in after a father had sex with his daughter for some reason and it didn't <UNK> until the movie finally ended at least twenty four hours later or so it would seem don't get me wrong i'm not against violence in movies and in fact <UNK> seek out the most notorious films around but while this may be violent it's also pointless and boring and i didn't get one ounce of enjoyment out of it takashi miike may have a lot of fans but i'm certainly not one of them and i certainly hope this is the last time i'll come into contact with one of his films
<START> huge ramones fan i do like the ramones and i suppose if you hate them then besides being a avid bush <UNK> you might not like this classic br br it's immensely better than the sappy john hughes teen films and the like that <UNK> the 80's infinitely better than the american <UNK> that plague us now br br there are some other great high school films <UNK> sisters fast times class of <UNK> three <UNK> high and the cheesy yet gripping doesn't seem possible <UNK> edge but <UNK> will always be my favorite because it's the funniest and most fun plus you can get up and dance with it br br i love you riff <UNK> br br 10 10
<START> cinderella is one of disney's greatest films one of those films i think you appreciate more the older you get disney creates a magical adaptation of the classic fairytale i consider the film to have been the greatest of his films at the time of its release the characters became more dimensional than earlier films creating more depth to appreciate the characters more cinderella herself is in my opinion one of the greatest characters disney ever created with her kindness and dash of dry humor she is extremely likeable however it is the inspiration she provides which makes her memorable like many people she is an endless <UNK> and she holds onto her dreams never giving up even in the most <UNK> of situations her dreams endure and she won't let anyone take that away from her her example should serve as inspiration to everyone and <UNK> to never let go of your dreams
<START> in my eyes this is almost the perfect example of hollywood ego only beaten by the new king kong movie superman is the original super hero and deserves to be treated with respect even though he wears <UNK> brandon <UNK> was the worst superman i've ever seen from the start of the movie u just wanna <UNK> a <UNK> of <UNK> down his throat he looks just silly wearing the costume but enough about him kate <UNK> was a bad <UNK> for lois lane she is supposed to be a hard ass reporter but in this movie she looks more like a <UNK> the plot was weak and predictable wow he is actually <UNK> son who would have ever thought and the acting was horrible this movie has one good thing going for it and it's name is kevin spacey his portrayal of lex luthor was brilliant but even he could not save this movie what this movie needed was the cast of lois and clark except kevin spacey of course and a different story i watched this movie after watching the hills have eyes and i was <UNK> to learn that there existed worse movies then that
<START> i remember going to see the movie in the summer of <UNK> with my parents and being pretty into it at the time of course i was seven at the time br br right before the jackson movies came out my wife and i rented this movie since she had never seen it and i was feeling nostalgic br br ralph bakshi ran out of money about mid way through the animation process for this movie and was forced to drastically cut <UNK> on this production since this movie was done primarily with <UNK> the animation technique for people on a budget this is saying something much of this movie is animation only in the very <UNK> sense of the word there are some scenes which are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen with maybe some animation effects <UNK> on top of them br br because of budget constraints the movie already a <UNK> of the <UNK> of the rings and part of the two towers was <UNK> down even more what you get is sort of like a film strip version of the cliff notes of the books br br its not all bad though the animation brings a warmth to it that i found lacking in the jackson movies its nice to imagine what it could have been like with decent funding br br this movie is also noteworthy for having the sequel which never came several years later a half hearted half hour long tv special was aired which was meant to wrap things up all i will say about that is that it was a musical
<START> this movie was o k but it could have been much better there are some spooky moments but there aren't enough of them to make me ever want to see this movie again there are some scenes you could fast forward through not miss anything the biggest flaw is that it is so predictable that is the reason why i rated it so low it's watchable but don't expect anything great
<START> this film was probably inspired by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and i urge you to see that film instead br br the film has two strong elements and those are 1 the realistic acting 2 the impressive <UNK> good photo apart from that what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness lena <UNK> has to be most annoying actress in the world she acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film it's unattractive comparing to <UNK> film <UNK> has been replaced with stupidity without going too far on this subject i would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the french and the swedish society br br a movie of its time and place 2 10
<START> i am obsessed the story is amazing and the show is highly <UNK> but i love it i am on season 2 disc 5 and i tell you that i am too attached to the characters now for anything bad to happen to them would seriously affect my vote for the show and michael is on my list now kidding i am so happy to see there is a season 3 because i was too afraid to go onto disc 6 thinking that it would be ending i can't wait to see the rest now thanks to the directors producers and actors of lost i enjoy watching tv again before lost i <UNK> through every channel going to bed sad because of my disappointment in television but i have to say that lost is my kind of entertainment
<START> this is just a case of a previously worthless island changed into something worthwhile jesus christ people lets throw a big fit over 2000 <UNK> big deal this is just a case of a previously worthless island changed into something worthwhile jesus christ people lets throw a big fit over 2000 <UNK> big deal this is just a case of a previously worthless island changed into something worthwhile jesus christ people lets throw a big fit over 2000 <UNK> big deal this is just a case of a previously worthless island changed into something worthwhile jesus christ people lets throw a big fit over 2000 <UNK> big deal
<START> for those fans of laurel and hardy the 1940s and beyond were a very sad time for the team their <UNK> with hal roach studios had <UNK> and now they were free agents able to work for any studio who offered them a job unfortunately fox rko mgm without roach and even a french film company who hired the boys had absolutely no touch for their comedic talents plus stan and ollie were a lot older and seeing these <UNK> men taking <UNK> seemed sad not particularly funny stan looked very <UNK> and <UNK> weight had <UNK> up to the point where he could barely walk and so it made me feel uncomfortable laughing at their very very <UNK> antics br br in addition to their age this particular film suffers because fox studios oddly cast them in a supporting role and created a parallel plot involving a young couple something that reduced their time on screen and turned them into insipid <UNK> on instead of just being themselves a cute and <UNK> stan and ollie is very foreign to the old laurel and hardy of the <UNK> and 30s and just seemed awfully strange and suited them poorly br br now even with their age this could have been a decent movie if it had been given decent writing and if it appeared the studio cared and it's quite obvious they were using the b unit here with at best second class support in particular there are very few laughs and the last 10 minutes of the film is simply dreadful relying exclusively on a sloppy rear projected screen for the stupid chase scene which might just rank as one of the worst of its kind in film history br br for mind <UNK> zombie lovers of laurel and hardy it's probably a film they will love but for lovers of the team who are willing to honestly <UNK> this film relative to their amazing earlier films it simply comes up wanting indeed in fact of all their full length films pre 1940 i can't think of one i liked less than dancing masters unfortunately of the post 1940 films this might just be one of their better ones sadly it got a lot worse with wretched films like the big noise and nothing but trouble i just wish the boys had just retired after <UNK> at sea br br finally i wonder if all the generally positive reviews for this film on imdb might reflect the <UNK> love of the team more than it's an indication that this is a good film for an audience who are not already in love with the team i don't know how this film will do anything but bore the audience it certainly won't convince anyone that laurel and hardy were comedic geniuses but even comedic geniuses need material worthy of their talents
<START> i saw this movie on tv late one night years ago but it was a disturbing experience that has stayed with me to this day br br the premise may seem a bit unoriginal due to an <UNK> a hidden underground store of a toxic nerve agent in the hills above a small town is <UNK> and a <UNK> amount of the substance finds its way into their food supply the inhabitants of the town begin to lose their ability to exercise restraint over every <UNK> and base desire that <UNK> through all of our minds from time to time and that normally we know we simply must not act upon br br the pace of the movie is slow but for me that only added to the <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> behaviour slowly starts to unravel there are several surreal and very unsettling scenes that have remained <UNK> in my memory all this time br br it raises interesting questions about what we could all be capable of if we gave in to our most <UNK> instincts did i enjoy it i'm not sure <UNK> is the right word did it make me think definitely i'm still thinking about it scary stuff
<START> most yeti pictures are <UNK> <UNK> by a grave <UNK> of energy and enthusiasm not so this <UNK> bent <UNK> and <UNK> over the top italian made shot in canada <UNK> gut buster it's a wildly <UNK> and <UNK> moronic ghastly marvel which reaches a stunning <UNK> of <UNK> over baked what the <UNK> going on <UNK> excess and <UNK> br br a <UNK> ship crew discovers the body of a 30 foot yeti that resembles a <UNK> 70's disco stud complete with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> perfectly <UNK> in a large <UNK> of ice they <UNK> the beast <UNK> him back to life with electric charges grossly <UNK> him and keep the poor hairy <UNK> in an enormous glass booth before you can say hey the filmmakers are obviously ripping off <UNK> <UNK> our titanic <UNK> <UNK> breaks free of his cage grabs the first <UNK> <UNK> blonde euro <UNK> the gorgeous <UNK> grant he lays <UNK> eyes on and <UNK> away with his new lady love the yeti gets <UNK> and <UNK> to toronto to be showed off to a <UNK> audience of course he breaks free again <UNK> the <UNK> and goes on the expected <UNK> around the city rampage br br the <UNK> stupid dialogue <UNK> line philosophy has no place in science professor cheesy far from special effects the horrendous transparent blue screen work and <UNK> <UNK> toy <UNK> are especially <UNK> in their very jaw dropping awfulness clunky <UNK> direction and a heavy handed script that even attempts a clumsily sincere is the yeti a man or a beast <UNK> debate all combine together to create one of the single most delightfully ridiculous giant monster flicks to ever <UNK> its absurd way across the big screen better still we also have a few funky offbeat touches to add extra shoddy spice to the already <UNK> <UNK> cinematic <UNK> the <UNK> accidentally <UNK> against one of the <UNK> <UNK> which causes it to <UNK> and <UNK> a big <UNK> grin of <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> wounded hand while he makes goo goo eyes at her the yeti <UNK> windows with his feet while climbing a <UNK> office building and the <UNK> fellow even breaks a man's neck with his <UNK> overall this <UNK> screwball and <UNK> <UNK> should be camp classic stands tall as a remarkable <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> celluloid <UNK> that's <UNK> worthy of a substantial hardcore underground cult following
<START> these slasher <UNK> are past their sell by date but this one is good fun br br the valentine cards themselves are witty and well thought out br br the film has one <UNK> of a line he's no angel when he in fact is angel watching buffy reruns will never be the same br br the cast is a <UNK> display of young talent but the story does not give them enough real depth denise richards on the dvd extras seemed to think the girls on set <UNK> well together and this would give the feeling that you <UNK> with their characters sorry but no br br the direction is very good managing to show very little actual gore and relying on your <UNK> implied threat much can be said also for the similar manner in which miss richards and <UNK> do not remove their clothes br br essentially the main directorial plus lies within the <UNK> of various other ideas from previous slasher flicks <UNK> shower scene is <UNK> along with <UNK> <UNK> br br murdering someone hiding in a <UNK> though is a pretty original one as far as i know br br light viewing not very scary but a few good jump moments if it was a choice between the hole and this though choose the hole slasher movies have had their day and this is just another slasher a very good slasher but nothing groundbreaking
<START> just looking at the sets staging and editing it is easy to tell this project lacked a proper budget maybe bela lugosi is meant to take your mind off of things like that young brides drop dead at the <UNK> after saying i do their corpses are stolen by a renowned <UNK> dr <UNK> lugosi and a couple of his <UNK> <UNK> as his aging wife elizabeth russell needs <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> of the young <UNK> to remain forever young forever beautiful an eager local <UNK> reporter <UNK> <UNK> realizes that each missing bride wore the same rare <UNK> to the <UNK> an <UNK> in which dr <UNK> would be most <UNK> a typical horror movie storm <UNK> making a visit to the <UNK> estate a bit spooky especially with a dwarf and a <UNK> <UNK> on the premises other players <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> coffin <UNK> <UNK> and frank <UNK>
<START> i didn't expect much when i saw this at the palm springs film fest this weekend it was an alternate choice when two other films were sold out still i held out hope it sounded a bit much like bride and prejudice l a guy falls for an indian beauty <UNK> conflict blah blah blah b p was not perfect but it was an enjoyable film with some good laughs and likable characters br br my bollywood bride had none of that the acting seemed stilted and way to by the numbers characters were so cliché the story seemed like it could have been written by high school <UNK> drama student technically the sound really bothered me it seemed as if there was a lot of over dubbing of dialogue i mean a lot i know sometimes it's necessary but it sounded like half the film was shot in a closet and it became very distracting br br two stars is being somewhat generous
<START> i went to see it in hopes of some good old fashioned alice entertainment once i realized i would not be getting that i watched it for a pretty well made movie in terms of filming and yeah that was it but aside from it having a good film quality considering i had been watching grainy movies all day long there was nothing good about that movie br br he killed <UNK> why were <UNK> dee and <UNK> played by <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> who can answer that for me who can answer anything awful about this movie for me br br i agree with whoever said it was just one big long inside joke for the staff that's all it seemed to be br br poor mr <UNK> i'm so sorry somebody did that to his wonderful tales
<START> the back cover of the dvd missed this one when it came out <UNK> hitler the rise of evil as a triumph the new york post and mesmerizing <UNK> br br well never mind the post but really who ever wrote that word in <UNK> in the same context with this peace of <UNK> art should be <UNK> br br i don't no where to start with why try to paint the picture of hitler's evil with colors that did not exist he was evil alright but now his character is portrayed in way that is often historically inaccurate compared to his love of animals the gentle and subdued way he treated women and so on br br the actors are good so you must feel sorry for them as they are imprisoned inside their one dimensional characters some kind of curse here with peter <UNK> <UNK> this is the second time in his honorable career when he has ended up playing an old and failed leader in a failed movie or in this case tv production to be accurate the first one was of course the legendary <UNK> br br the list of historically inaccurate scenes alone would fill the 1000 words allowed by imdb so i think i'll leave it here br br this one is ok if it's on telly and you don't have anything else to do but believe me it's best left on the shelf in your local virgin store
<START> despite the gravity of the subject and probably the good intentions of the filmmakers to make a film addressing white supremacy the inconsistencies of its main character bronson green aspiring new york actor easily turned l a phony makes it hard to take the story seriously green who is constantly rejected by los angeles casting agents for being <UNK> i e too new york when the 80s is looking for big blonde and dumb he finds success comes easily when he's willing to <UNK> to <UNK> his image unfortunately the new hair <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> attitude lands him an acting opportunity with the <UNK> church which <UNK> white <UNK> teaching of the <UNK> nation green is willing to easily forget his past and particularly turning his back on his young black friend of ten years in order to be the <UNK> new <UNK> this makes no sense seeing as how <UNK> our character initially is it is this sudden and loose change in character coupled with an abrupt <UNK> back to the hardened deniro obsessed as his taxi driver character form who is able to battle the villains a noble attempt on the filmmakers but one that ultimately reveals itself as anything but serious br br the other characters too are quite annoying and what we are forced to recognize in them comes too easily the psychotic paranoia of the church leader the self interested actress girlfriend the first girlfriend bronson has when he's in l a and the new blonde girlfriend who's character lacks so much development she is for the most part just a walking talking void we are just supposed to see them in fleeting moments in which something random forces us to draw <UNK> about the characters but there is really little development of any of them br br the other problem with this film is the <UNK> amount of time the characters are involved in very little important action much of the beginning concerns introducing the characters obviously and later we see <UNK> difficulties with breaking into the l a acting scene and the <UNK> which <UNK> from constant <UNK> but after he does willingly change his looks and personality in order to become accepted there is at least a good twenty minutes to thirty minutes of wasted film in which very little of anything happens br br for films that seek to draw attention to the irrational fears behind racism this was not one done with enough credibility
<START> this movie is one of the worst comedy movies i have ever seen i hate these <UNK> dynamite rip offs just face it people the dumb humor has been <UNK> already make something new for once all these new comedies are just horrible and coming out of snl andy <UNK> is not ready for a lead role yet i hope he can <UNK> back from this awful movie and will <UNK> character is just plain bad hey will did you read the script the plot is truly the worst ever written now you tell me if this is weird this is the movie rod <UNK> step dad frank is dying and the family needs 50 000 to pay for the heart surgery so rod is planning this huge jump to raise money for frank only so that rod can beat frank in a fight and prove his <UNK> yes thats the movie you tell me would u spend 7 00 to see that piece of crap br br 3 10 just horrible br br adam
