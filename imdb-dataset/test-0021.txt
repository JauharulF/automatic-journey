<START> this is a dreadful adaption of charles <UNK> story the animation is to put it <UNK> awful and the songs are a disgrace to film songs the high song which they keep repeating i feel sorry for jon pertwee and david jason 2 of <UNK> finest talents providing the voice for the depressing animation sequence tries his best to perform in this awful production but fails br br avoid this film at all costs even if it is the last film on this planet
<START> <UNK> master is a very unique film amongst john ford's work mainly because it's the only one that is based on a story written by john ford himself the story that was <UNK> by frank <UNK> and director's son  patrick ford and turned into a screenplay and because of director's personal opinion regarding it <UNK> master is the film john ford called the one which came closest to being what i had wanted to to say so is not to say a little but as ford <UNK> once to lindsay anderson his favourite was nonetheless my darling <UNK> and not any other br br <UNK> master has all ingredients one might expect to find in a john ford's film wonderful cast delivering his best <UNK> not featuring any major stars except the most of all actors  ben johnson very peculiar small characters who provide an obligatory comic relief and <UNK> master has quite a few of them such as horn blowing sister jane <UNK> in her shot but very inspired <UNK> and last but not least legendary <UNK> valley with john ford's fifth passage through it after <UNK> my darling <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and she wore a yellow <UNK> br br the film starts with two friends <UNK> travis blue ben johnson and sandy <UNK> harry carey jr being hired to be <UNK> masters or <UNK> for a <UNK> of mormon <UNK> who are headed to silver valley a place that's for them like a promised land on their way they are joined by a very peculiar dr hall alan <UNK> with two beautiful women who are supposedly his wife and daughter and who call themselves actors they are headed in the same direction simply because they were recently driven out of the nearest town and have no other place to go nothing particularly unpleasant happens till they <UNK> into a dangerous family gang <UNK> of father and his three sons who are on the run from the <UNK> of the town where they recently committed murder and bank robbery br br overall <UNK> master is no more nor less than one more precious pearl in a <UNK> of john ford's wonderful westerns a must see 9 10 br br
<START> in out in my opinion is a very hilarious movie i thought that cameron matt dillon was wrong to say that howard kevin kline was gay the part i liked most was <UNK> bachelor party this was because they were cracking jokes about a lot of things including barbra streisand films i also thought that emily joan cusack looked very beautiful in her wedding dress and that howard looked good in his <UNK> my favorite quote of in out is is everybody gay is this 'the twilight <UNK> that was absolutely hilarious the one character i couldn't stand was <UNK> <UNK> harlow this was because she was very <UNK> and <UNK> in conclusion i recommend this movie to all you kevin kline fans who have not seen it be prepared to laugh hard and have a good time when you see it
<START> this film is engaging and complex while maintaining simple beauty our two characters come together sharing the base of curiosity and loneliness but it is a <UNK> for learning these people they <UNK> life styles and <UNK> which support this br br the two lead actors were in the moment as any two actors i have ever seen 100 believable they transport the audience seemingly effortlessly into their world the actors' <UNK> acting teamed with beautiful realistic dialog and his truthful direction drives the story forward into a striking and moving finale this film is visual treat soft increasing the intensity of the story the soundtrack the viewer <UNK> yet drawing out the emotional content of the film i find this project to be nothing short of a masterpiece intriguing intense
<START> minor plot spoilers br br i must confess to having a soft spot for wayne crawford i know little about him but he appears to have masses of enthusiasm to compensate for his lack of talent in his films he usually performs multi tasks <UNK> any 3 from lead male director producer and script writer <UNK> story lines from the sub basement despite this the end product is usually enjoyable fun for the non <UNK> br br 'the evil features crawford as a down on his luck captain of a <UNK> <UNK> boat a bit like bogart in <UNK> have have <UNK> the similarities between the films ends here though br br the story begins with an underwater scene with two <UNK> searching a wreck before being attacked by an unseen creature bit like the start of <UNK> the wreck turns out to be that of the <UNK> <UNK> which went down centuries earlier the ship was <UNK> by <UNK> priests on the run from spain with a <UNK> of stolen church treasure this allows the introduction of various <UNK> to supernatural forces with <UNK> and the <UNK> both getting a look in the films title refers to this <UNK> devil ship rather than any <UNK> sea creature br br whatever faults the film has and there are many it is fun to watch and competently made you can't help but like a film which in the final 5 minutes copies the famous beach scene in <UNK> here to and the final line from <UNK>
<START> brooke <UNK> in a departure from her suddenly susan duties plays a bitter <UNK> who three girlfriends in a girls only weekend in palm springs the problem brooke is <UNK> and on the <UNK> while her friends are all involved hence the title <UNK> and emotional <UNK> their amoral weekend causes br br despite a few laughs generated by dan <UNK> victoria's closet and mtv relationship authorities adam and dr drew this is somber stuff for women only d b <UNK> virginia madsen and jon <UNK> co star
<START> we saw this film in toronto at the film festival last year it was a truly moving experience i had heard of the truth and process but as others have written did not know much about the details of the process this film demonstrated the process and the growth that can occur when people are able to face up to their <UNK> understand the events from the points of view of others involved and <UNK> together <UNK> <UNK> and the others involved in developing the t r process deserve recognition for their understanding of human emotions seeing this film gave me hope for the human race if we can do t r we just might not destroy ourselves people will look back at t and r as the first step out of human <UNK> and toward maturity br br as a film of course there were flaws i did not notice any major problems in acting directing or writing but for the first time in years i was totally lost in a film so perhaps i did not notice br br see this film the audience in toronto would not give up the stage for the next film we had so many questions and comments for the stars and director tom hooper jamie <UNK> and went outside to the sidewalk to continue the conversation people came by just to shake their hands and thank them for the film it moved us all
<START> <UNK> 2002 film distant his third feature film his first was <UNK> black and white the small town is a significant step up from his good but flawed 1999 film clouds of may the earlier film had potential but <UNK> of a small budget and improvised quality in the worst ways plot holes and wooden acting from amateurs that clouds of may succeeded on any level was a testament to talent as a budding filmmaker however distant is arrival on the international scene as a great artist one who has many of the same qualities as other great filmmakers like <UNK> bergman although his screenplay is not as dialogue heavy it is just as brooding and he lacks <UNK> <UNK> for close ups his shots are usually long shots for <UNK> and medium shots for interiors and <UNK> <UNK> whose <UNK> scenes of <UNK> the bulk of the film takes place in snowy <UNK> the fact that it in turkey will likely surprise some which lends the film a definite feel as well as reminding one of some of the bleak snowy urban images from <UNK> the <UNK> the natural images <UNK> the best of <UNK> <UNK> as they tend to go on a beat or two longer than standard film theory would <UNK> which is what makes them even more memorable while the urban landscapes range from the nearly compositions of <UNK> antonioni to the cultural <UNK> of woody allen one shot of a <UNK> <UNK> water is a direct <UNK> read steal from manhattan save the lack of the brooklyn bridge in the background in another scene similarly quotes a famous shot of a ship in the harbor from <UNK> tokyo story yet like all great artists makes his <UNK> his own art by slightly <UNK> them and keeping them <UNK> to his own film's distant is a film whose title the characterization within the film and the feeling some viewers will have toward them but it does not describe the film itself for scenes stay with one long after the film ends perhaps the most memorable scene and image of the film comes when stalks his ex wife at the <UNK> airport and watches her with her new husband as they head to board the plane that will remove her from his life forever as he watches her from a distance we see her catch just a glance of him watching her will she leave her husband and return to not in this film he pulls back behind a <UNK> and merely turns her head back to her future is her past and she knows how to best move on just keep moving will never get it most rarely get such moments of insight into themselves of life that some viewers will get the film and that gets his own powers of creation shows that ignorance can teach as long as one moves about it distant does albeit it at just the right length
<START> this movie was one of those movies where it completely fooled me into thinking that it was a cheesy 80's slasher flick based on the cover but it wasn't it was quite possibly one of the worst slasher films that i have ever seen the picture on the cover did not match any part or scene in the movie in fact it didn't involve a chainsaw not even the tag line fit the movie the film is about a group of <UNK> and two <UNK> who escape to a desolate cabin in the cold woods for a weekend <UNK> however things get extra <UNK> when they start to get murdered by an unknown killer at the same time the local <UNK> department is hunting down a dangerous killer i'll name the problems in a list br br 1 the acting boy was it cheap and horribly bad it felt unnatural and it seemed as thought it was very scripted none of the actors seemed as though they tried to perform with good intentions and therefore they seemed silly and tired there was bad acting by all the characters in the movie so i won't point out specific people but i <UNK> say that the <UNK> did a horrible job as well as the police and the <UNK> which is not a surprise br br 2 the plot this story had set up a perfect storyline for good ol' fashion slasher flick but instead they <UNK> it with plot holes useless and unnecessary scenes and an overall stupid back story to the killer's intentions there were major plot holes including how the killer killed the last victim so quickly and yet still be there in the group of girls when it happened the ex con virtually served no purpose in the movie aside from being a useless plot device there was random and unnecessary sex and nudity <UNK> throughout it even for a b movie or my taste it was a bit too much as for the killer's intentions lets just say it was stupid and it makes no sense as to why she he is killing young girls plus there was also some very predictable kills that i saw coming about 30 miles away br br 3 the technical side the lighting was okay it certainly wasn't the worse lighting that i've seen in a movie but there were points where it was supposed to be dark but it looked more like the afternoon the house seemed darker with the lights on then with the lights off the camera work was average it didn't have any good establishing shots or amazing pans or <UNK> thought it did get the job done is building some suspense with it's framing br br overall this movie in the sense of plot character development and performance was a huge disappointment and a waste of my time what i thought would have been a great slasher flick turned out to be one of the worse movies that i have ever seen the acting was really bad and wooden there was hardly any sense in the plot and there was no emotion to this film however the technical aspect of this film saved it for me because if the camera work or the lighting was bad then i would have turned off the dvd player and popped in something else i would recommend this movie to those who enjoy really cheesy b movies as well as those who follow cult classics because this movie certainly is i would partially recommend this film for those who enjoy 80s slasher flicks but for me this movie was pitiful and utterly horrible
<START> a really terrible movie really low budget with terrible acting a convoluted and inane plot a modest <UNK> of the vampire tales mixed with modern science br br the result is a total mess without meaning for most parts with very limited and cheap effects it is not even fun like several of the low budget independent movies of this kind br br a waste of time
<START> i honestly dont know why so many people hate this movie i have always thought that it was one of my absolute <UNK> the fight with tiger and his men <UNK> the fight with the pirates with the <UNK> <UNK> the whole skit with everyone trying to avoid one another in the house is pure <UNK> ok so it didnt have the requisite kick ass final confrontation but the <UNK> were pretty good i give it a 8 10
<START> what could be expected from any adam sandler produced comedy <UNK> boy is predictable and so dumb it is sickening allen <UNK> stars as alex in the film a 35 year old <UNK> who works as a video game <UNK> and has had to move in with his grandma and her two roommates after losing his apartment some usual plot turns occur he has trouble <UNK> to his new living situation which in turn makes him have trouble at work which is particularly bad because he is trying to nail one of the new <UNK> throw a weird boss almost alien company star really nerdy best friend a few scenes at burnt out pot <UNK> place a really big party scene and an original video game alex is trying to finish by himself into the mix you have <UNK> boy in its entirety allen <UNK> does make a <UNK> good lead linda is cute enough for her role as the just one of the <UNK> office <UNK> samantha and a few scenes do manage to <UNK> out a chuckle or two but none of that makes <UNK> boy worth much of anyone's time most of the supposed funny jokes or gags or whatever you want to call them are nothing but humor that would make anyone at national <UNK> embarrassed to watch joel moore is incredibly unfunny in his role as video game mastermind j p and the entire film actually manages to be boring on top of not funny or substantial well at least <UNK> boy did something for someone adam sandler was able to get a few <UNK> to his out of work friends david spade kevin and rob schneider
<START> mr baseball was a fun video rental with my fiancé susan susan said that she had been looking forward to seeing the movie ken <UNK> as a tough yet honorable manager makes sense ken has made so many wonderful asian movies i correct the one reviewer and say is still a cinematic presence with films like of course everyone likes tom <UNK> yet ken is the better dramatic actor of the two today someone accused me of being <UNK> well i say that my great uncle shadow president jack f kennedy myself and others are part of the legitimate human <UNK> in our universe and thanks to our humans are free people fighting all the parts of <UNK> that president kennedy talked about in his <UNK> address to be honest someone has kept food <UNK> very low in canada on things like bread in honor of our please stop eating <UNK> <UNK> and eggs i hope that there will one day be a sequel to mr baseball with father ken <UNK> still as manager thank you to imdb for supporting freedom of speech like the kind president george w bush and i support support imdb
<START> jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles his performance is simply genius he owns the film just as <UNK> owned coal <UNK> daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire in fact it's hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself ray charles is legendary he is well established as a musician and the music is deep complex and innovative even more innovative than i realized before watching this movie the film should make new fans of a young audience who might come into it knowing little about his music ray <UNK> life provided excellent <UNK> material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician i confess that i knew very little about the man's life until i saw this film i came out of it being impressed with ray <UNK> courage strength and <UNK> as man and musician
<START> the new celebrity <UNK> is terrible they kill off the popular people and make the low budget <UNK> win i mean andy <UNK> flip <UNK> flip and <UNK> wayne should of both died <UNK> flip sucks the fight between <UNK> jon and <UNK> bow wow and <UNK> flip was mad corny and short they should of just kill off all of them why did <UNK> lose to jake and christian lose to adam they are better actors and <UNK> they also spend too much time on talking rather than fighting which can bore the viewers everything seems rushed for some reason they can't just make a long fight the old <UNK> is way better
<START> heather graham sets out after her husband carl luke wilson who disappeared to clear his head about himself and their marriage who is committed to their marriage starts her journey to find carl yet on the way discovers a lot about herself on her trip she encounters a <UNK> of interesting characters who <UNK> help her find her way br br in my eyes this is a classical road movie which moves just at the right pace some viewers may find it too slow throughout the movie it keeps its humorous note while responds to the <UNK> of the world around her with a warm knowing sometimes sad smile all actresses and actors give wonderful performances and the musical score is <UNK> 9 10
<START> telly <UNK> put on a passable but no better than that performance as <UNK> villa the notorious mexican <UNK> revolutionary in this account of raid on the town of <UNK> new mexico in <UNK> villa is not really a historical figure who i'm overly familiar with so i won't say much about the historical details of the film as a movie this isn't great although it has a <UNK> here and there of both action and humour chuck <UNK> performance as colonel <UNK> commander of the u s army base near <UNK> struck me as a bit over the top and clint walker as <UNK> sidekick <UNK> didn't really do very much for me the movie is obviously a pretty low budget effort of limited technical quality for a movie with a runtime of only slightly over an hour and a half i have to say that this movie dragged in places particularly in the last 20 minutes or so raid into the united states was an interesting if in the overall scheme of things not especially important historical <UNK> and probably deserved better treatment than this 4 10
<START> i saw the movie in 1972 and like other people who have commented on it here i went back many more times to see it over and over i think 9 times in all just great is how i would describe it i was taken by the sound track the beautiful <UNK> of the south of france the life style the kids began on their own an ideal way to live is what they had set up of course the powers that be have to <UNK> but when i forget that part i find myself wanting to be in the movie and live like that so good that it is available on dvd now it was not around for years br br
<START> despite all the <UNK> about the trouble with <UNK> episode the balance of terror might just be the best episode of the series and while i have always loved a piece of the action because it is so much fun i really do have to cast my vote as this episode as being the very best br br the movie interestingly enough is really like a wwii submarine movie in that it <UNK> back and forth between the <UNK> ship and the enterprise as it seeks to destroy the <UNK> before they sneak back across the neutral zone after a raid on <UNK> <UNK> in so many ways the show is much like the film the enemy below where the american captain robert mitchum and the german captain <UNK> <UNK> are shown in counter point as they both try to <UNK> the other and in the process develop a <UNK> respect for their <UNK> br br interestingly enough only a short bit of the beginning of the episode takes place on a planet and this is amazing because an episode on board ship could easily have been static and dull but because the writing was so fantastic and the main characters written and acted so well shatner and mark leonard as the leader oddly for the die hard <UNK> out there they'll recognize leonard as the same actor who later played <UNK> father br br the bottom line is this is simply a great and extremely engaging episode that will keep you on the edge of your seat
<START> i was all ready to hate this but it turned out to be surprisingly tolerable though the mtv style of film making shot on <UNK> to boot is quite an eye sore i liked the <UNK> self mocking style as well as its central idea of having the female vampire lead <UNK> as a contract killer as to the cast <UNK> <UNK> best known as the <UNK> of those horrid redemption <UNK> has an <UNK> screen presence and is quite sensual despite her age however christopher <UNK> hammy chief villain is obnoxious david <UNK> has a brief role as a doctor dubbed the horror movie man who <UNK> the <UNK> on one of the <UNK> victims the film seems to have taken quite a long time to shoot as <UNK> died in 1997 there's plenty of nudity and violence on hand but not much sense alas especially since its subplot involving a secret society of vampires <UNK> the power <UNK> is barely developed the film is also overlong for its purpose and eventually slips into tedium during the last half hour
<START> closet land is a nasty piece of work with superb actors nothing more or less happens in the movie besides the <UNK> abuse of an attractive woman prisoner by a sadistic police official the setting is <UNK> this might be considered soft core s m porn because the drama is devoid of all reference points such as time place and political context since what happens is cut <UNK> in a fantasy futuristic environment the abuse becomes purely personal the pornographic aspects are justified by being a warning about the <UNK> of <UNK> government but because there is no real context for the torture of this young woman we come away disturbed but having learned nothing br br what is the point that torture exists in the world that <UNK> prisoners is bad that <UNK> abuse innocent people we know that already closet land has echoes of such works as darkness at <UNK> and but both those works were made by competent artists whose work had historical context and depth of meaning this work is amateurish and the dialogue <UNK> a definite thumbs down
<START> this movie just didn't do it for me i like horror and splatter movies but this one has very little to do with horror the effects are cheap and when they chop of one of her feet it looks so fake the same goes for the other effects like the tongue torture and the gut sex they could have spent of few extra bucks on the effects br br with lots of sex with as in all japanese movies this is just a sick fetish porn and there seems to be a market for sick stuff like this while <UNK> for me it fits in with titles like <UNK> and the series these movies feature girls eating and playing with every fluid that comes out of your body eating bugs and fish in a gross way and having sex with all kinds of weird animals like <UNK> <UNK> and one look at the covers will tell horror fans to look elsewhere no horror here just sick and <UNK> sex scenes br br horror fans should avoid this one and are better of checking out guinea flowers of flesh and blood or even august underground while these are not great they at least offer a horror experience and absolutely fails in that department
<START> this movie is not a horror movie there is nothing scary about it it's more of a torture flick and it doesn't make sense to me there is a few <UNK> with disappearing bodies for instance he woman in the beginning of the movie that get pulled away returns for a scene in the <UNK> with nicole and she and she completely disappears then she kills the police officer to put him out of his misery and he disappears plus had to shoot him in the head twice to kill him i don't think so especially when you can see his head half blown off and didn't kill him the at the end she sets the killer's truck on fire that but he's not in it he is standing behind her then it cuts to the rest stop has been completely <UNK> and some people are at the rest area and a new girl comes in and nicole in asking for help like the first girl totally no sense in this movie save yourself some money and skip this movie
<START> i saw 'i smell the <UNK> sorry 'i sell the <UNK> at a press screening glenn the film's writer director editor is a <UNK> <UNK> who introduced the screening by <UNK> that whilst it was in progress he would be <UNK> out for a i don't <UNK> him a drink but by telling us about it he seemed to feel he needed to his or his or both when the opening credits rolled there were as usual at press <UNK> loud for the names of every actor or crew member who'd got friends in the audience and silence for those who hadn't returned for a witty q a afterwards br br this horror movie doesn't take itself seriously which is good because its humour is considerably stronger than its horror only one scene is even remotely scary and most of the <UNK> is merely gross out but i laughed throughout much of the film br br this movie appears to be set in ireland circa <UNK> by which time grave robbing was mostly <UNK> the story is told in flashback we get flashbacks within flashbacks and the <UNK> character flashbacks material that he couldn't know about because sometimes he wasn't present or in one case because the action is unfolding behind his back br br the story begins with a prisoner being taken to the <UNK> <UNK> weren't used in 19th century ireland but for once we actually see a plausible <UNK> sequence the prisoner struggles on his way to execution the rope <UNK> are accurate and the prisoner manages to look up to see the blade <UNK> and there's a payoff later to justify the historically inaccurate use of the <UNK> itself br br the characters are ostensibly irish but one major character speaks in cockney <UNK> using phrases like a game and take a <UNK> for <UNK> a <UNK> for once actors in 19th century roles display 19th century dental <UNK> yet nearly all the clothes and <UNK> and the women's make ups are <UNK> 21st century i'm not complaining in the case of heather <UNK> who wears a very <UNK> black <UNK> that appears to be <UNK> br br the lead actors except ron <UNK> are excellent but most of the supporting cast have no sense of the victorian period the worst <UNK> is joel garland as the whose characterisation is firmly <UNK> in the twenty first century just when i thought that <UNK> performance couldn't get any less victorian he used his fingers to make ironic air quotes br br the sets especially <UNK> lab are detailed and impressive yet failed to convince me that people actually lived and worked in these places nearly every interior contains burning <UNK> but never once did i see what would have been there if these were actual victorian homes or <UNK> from previous <UNK> br br one scene features an extra <UNK> i was annoyed that <UNK> for a stereotypical grey alien rather than something original br br there are splendid montage sequences but <UNK> for flashy effects split screens <UNK> shots that don't serve the story i was impressed by a recurring blue screen device the main characters' heads over other backgrounds less effective was a recurring style <UNK> of camera shots <UNK> actors' faces into drawings resembling <UNK> art from 1950s <UNK> horror comics i'm a fan of <UNK> comics but they don't belong in 19th century ireland the money that spent on flashy photo f x showing off his editing skills without serving the story should've been spent on accurate costumes br br big spoilers now ron <UNK> gives an <UNK> performance full of acting school <UNK> ostensibly playing a 19th century irish priest he writes with his left hand in victorian ireland left handed children were <UNK> for using the devil's hand and were <UNK> to become but <UNK> character turns out to have a reason for <UNK> his right hand elsewhere a character is bitten by a zombie yet suffers no ill effects so i knew <UNK> be a payoff later several scenes that would more <UNK> take place at night are shot in daylight apparently only because this was easier and less expensive since is a <UNK> director and editor he could easily have shot day for night but using a process photography effect to help tell the story seems to interest him much less than showing off his flashy editing techniques br br seems to be giving homage to those great old hammer horror flicks but those <UNK> were so great because the actors and production <UNK> worked hard to convince us that we were actually witnessing events in <UNK> <UNK> or wherever 'i sell the <UNK> almost entirely fails to evoke the 19th century br br glenn shows talent as a director <UNK> and editor yet in all three <UNK> here he makes odd choices then largely fails to justify those choices but i enjoyed 'i sell the <UNK> i'll rate it 7 out of 10 and i look forward to his next movie
<START> annie rooney lives with her officer father and brother tim in the <UNK> of new york where she is constantly getting involved in many fights with the other neighborhood kids annie secretly has a crush on joe kelly whose little brother mickey is head of the gang that annie constantly battles who is in a gang that is headed for trouble says officer rooney kelly <UNK> a dance where tony plans to shoot kelly in order to get even with him for making him look like a fool in front of his girl but officer kelly gets <UNK> wounded instead tim part of kelly's gang is told by tony and friend spider that kelly shot his father so he goes after him in vengeance annie learns of this and goes to stop her brother if she is in time very good mix of humor and heart in this film even though the plot doesn't start until the 40 minute mark of the film pickford is enjoyable even though she was 33 playing a girl no more than 12 13 and really gets into her character haines doesn't play kelly as tough as he should but is able make the audience feel for him on an emotional level the scenes where the officer tells annie of her father's death and the ending really put a <UNK> in your throat the mix of all sorts of kids throughout the film are fun to watch rating 8
<START> i don't really consider myself a conservative so i wasn't personally offended by this film but it was pretty clear that the plot and the characterization in this film were secondary to the message and the message is that all <UNK> are either evil or stupid or both the characters are one dimensional either good freedom loving americans or brainless greedy evil <UNK> there's nothing clever or creative just anti conservative i don't really mind the political bias itself but it shouldn't be the only purpose behind the movie and clearly it is br br on the positive side the cast is wonderful and chris <UNK> impression of w is funny the first two or three times but after that it's just the same old joke being told over and over again br br so if you really hate the <UNK> you'll probably enjoy this film but if you're looking for something with realistic characters and a story that's less black and white then you'd be better off watching something else
<START> i hope robert redford continues to make more films like this books are wonderful and as a young child raised in the <UNK> his stories hit home adam beach is a highly under rated and under used actor wake up hollywood not everyone thinks that your mel <UNK> are cool many movie today want to see films that make you think i have seen all of the redford <UNK> series they are thoughtful <UNK> and have great plots i'm hoping that if enough people write to robert redford he may decide to make a few more thank you adam beach and tony <UNK> for great entertainment if anyone <UNK> a chance to read tony latest book do so it's great i also recommend traveling through arizona new mexico <UNK> and <UNK> stop at every view site and feel the setting of books amazing experience
<START> i cannot hate on the show when the old and better tech tv had to hit the <UNK> the channel was <UNK> and new shows stepped in attack of the show is the replacement for the screen with 3 co <UNK> in the beginning they were kevin rose kevin <UNK> and sarah lane brendan <UNK> came to be something of a co host as well but he mostly did pieces for the show kevin rose decided to leave the show and eventually there was a contest to see who would be the third host but that didn't pan out for some reason br br eventually i just learned this from this very imdb sarah lane and brendan <UNK> moved on because hey this is what i read the two got married that was a big secret to me now there is a new female co host the not as hot my opinion olivia <UNK> she's hiding something in those tops she wears while sarah lane had a perfect body and she wasn't afraid to show it br br <UNK> sorry br br attack of the show deals with everything young people want to know about it's music movies comic books the internet and television this is what's great about the show if you don't want to bother with <UNK> the net or waste time watching mtv you can get all you want on some segments and bits they do are funny they have regular guests and <UNK> who are in the industry as well as guests who range from insignificant internet stars to actual big names br br even though the <UNK> aren't as geek as i'd like them to be i still have found attack of the show to be entertaining even with its latest <UNK>
<START> yes this movie features a gal named jessica who says everything is evil and she causes trees to land on people too well she only causes a tree to fall once but she does say everything is evil this movie is about a farm that apparently <UNK> out rooms to people but offers little else in the way of entertainment jessica can find things with a stick and she finds the head of an evil guy of course they don't know this until the owner of the <UNK> open the box containing the head the head proceeds to <UNK> everyone it can so it can get to jessica and use her powers to find stuff to help look for his body this movie has an interesting enough story but it plays out very bad here everyone in this flick will get on your nerves at least once
<START> let's start from this point this is not a movie intended for the common audience utterly bizarre somehow incomprehensible totally unpredictable it just keep you stoned watching at the screen trying to figure out what will happen next if that by itself doesn't make you agree it is an excellent movie then go back to your family movies and forget about it has material to be considered a cult movie it can be placed in the same category with movies that win awards in cannes or other intellectual film festivals but sadly hollywood already let if fall in oblivion simply because it is not commercial the performance of young jordan christopher michael may not be oscar material but he gives the right touch to the story even the genre is difficult to describe it is not a comedy in the proper sense you don't know if you are supposed to laugh at the strange situations in which gus gets involved it is more like an impossible adventure that some kids may wish to have but don't let them watch it either it is not a movie for kids so if you like disney movies or are looking for a home alone style this one is <UNK> not for you but if you enjoy reading edgar alan poe or the works of tim burton then you will like so jump in your red <UNK> get a <UNK> spelling <UNK> and cruise with gus i'd like that
<START> <UNK> take on <UNK> heart of darkness was not quite what i had expected although based on one of <UNK> most studied and interesting <UNK> the film just became sort of dull the story just never manages to grasp the viewer it just comes across as indifferent in a way br br the <UNK> of the text are easily spotted but still this is not really <UNK> heart of darkness <UNK> <UNK> who also wrote the passion of the christ script just uses conrad as an inspiration and thus becomes <UNK> heart of darkness the film is just not worth it unless you are particularly interested in conrad or perhaps john <UNK>
<START> rock star is a nice movie everyone is nice even the guys who aren't supposed to be nice really are nice chris is a nice guy who learns a lesson in life he goes back to his girlfriend emily who is also nice br br it's a good movie despite all the <UNK> maybe i'm just used to all the angst of the x gen music in some ways the film was a caricature of rock stars and not hard edged enough to be believable br br mark <UNK> acting is quite good jennifer aniston played her role well but it was <UNK> she was a nice girl br br go see it if you have ever been to a rock concert or seen spinal tap go see it
<START> why do i hate this let me list the ways br br i have nothing against mary pickford but a <UNK> year old woman playing a 12 year old is just stupid br br there's a fight scene in which kids are throwing <UNK> at each other and it's considered funny and it goes on for 15 minutes br br strange how none of the kids are even remotely hurt br br the title cards contain plenty of racial and ethnic <UNK> br br for a family film the fights were way too violent loved it when pickford was <UNK> it out with a little boy and the humor was just stupid br br seriously 40 minutes in i gave up and turned it off the <UNK> racism and little kids throwing <UNK> at each other got to me also there was no plot that i could see the only thing worth seeing in this film was william haines who was a top leading man in the silent era br br just painful avoid
<START> a really funny british comedy from the mid 1950's about a school for girls the girls are all involved in <UNK> and mayhem making <UNK> <UNK> smoking and gambling <UNK> <UNK> plays <UNK> in a glorious drag role as well as playing brother a female police officer goes to the school undercover to see what is going on this film is funny having great sight gags and <UNK> <UNK> is great just a classic <UNK> comedy lots of fun and not too <UNK> joan <UNK> <UNK> sid james stars of many carry on films play small roles but this film is about the girls it <UNK> 3 sequels and a recent re make watch and enjoy where it all began
<START> no let's just say the samurai is somewhere between <UNK> boring and mind <UNK> painful to watch as an historical epic it could have had so many more chances to be a rich saga but it's really no more than just another cheap '70s action flick with a based on real events story and an <UNK> sporting sonny chiba before this movie's halfway point i was even tempted to commit <UNK> the music is like a thousand dogs in heat <UNK> in your ears to a tune composed by <UNK> <UNK> that's not an insult towards <UNK> the use of zoom lens cinematography is more nauseating than fascinating and in terms of action it's really nothing more than a series of brutal attacks and oh no they didn't shocks what a terrible movie
<START> this episode is not incoherent like another person said the source agreed to help because he was not going to keep his word if you pay attention he says after she <UNK> agrees to stay down there in hell get rid of her and so i don't have to worry about them in the future and also he didn't let cole warn the sisters like <UNK> asked in exchange of accepting the deal that's why died because she got hit harder than <UNK> and on the head and there was no <UNK> to call for leo this time and in the past leo said that she almost got herself killed pay more attention next time and there is not a to be continued after this episode it is the ending of season 3 and on season 4 they can't show anything from because she owns the rights of it so the producers would have to pay her for whatever they show this is the last episode she is in
<START> i can't honestly believe that this is a sequel or follow up of john <UNK> classic comedy horror movie from 1981 i suppose you can't really describe it as an original werewolf movie either since the bare bones of the story steal elements from the one set in london an american tourist visits a famous european capital he <UNK> survives a werewolf attack that kills a colleague he <UNK> <UNK> the pun on a sexual relationship with someone in the medical profession he turns into a werewolf he's visited by <UNK> of his dead victims etc etc and reading the previous line i've just discovered how much the storyline has in common with the original that it seems very similar indeed the difference lies in how enjoyable and entertaining the <UNK> movie is br br with this paris based movie there's no scenes that really stand out there's no naked man waking up in a <UNK> wondering how he's going to get back home with no money or clothes there's no bizarre dream sequence of and there's no spectacular climax does try to be funny but is there anything more embarrassing than failed humour i'm thinking of the scene where andy mcdermott has to convince someone he's got chewing <UNK> in his pocket and not <UNK> perhaps the biggest difference between the two movies is that there's no <UNK> involved with this dubious follow up you really do feel sorry for the <UNK> fate and dilemma in the london movie here you just feel andy is nothing more than a cypher going through the literary motions of a script there's also a large number of plot holes visible is this the first time the <UNK> club have carried out a massacre if not then aren't large numbers of corpses with their hearts torn out been reported in the world's press why haven't the police got leads br br everyone else has mentioned it and so will i the visuals are poor look at the jumping scene at the tower it's painfully obvious that it's achieved via some blue screen projection while the werewolf transformation is done by some very cartoonish cgi i won't put anthony <UNK> in the same <UNK> as stephen <UNK> as a director who totally ruins a movie because of an over <UNK> on cgi the major problem with is the screenplay coupled with a high degree of expectation from those who saw the 1981 movie classic but i would have preferred the rick baker type special effects used for the transformation to be fair it's reasonable to <UNK> that perhaps the budget didn't stretch that far but at the end of the day this is a fairly poor horror movie that didn't need to be made and dog soldiers is much better entertainment
<START> it's fun and fast paced as one <UNK> leads to another and another toward an inevitable surprising conclusion the suspense <UNK> this holiday flick from all others one wonders how the pieces are going to fit both during the movie and in the future br br the character actors laid the foundation and entertained us in the process frank <UNK> shows us what manipulation can get and ultimately what manipulation can cost uncle felix s z <UNK> up each person for us while trying to protect barbara stanwyck and this helps us decide who we are going to root for in the end br br if we could ever achieve a perfect world <UNK> people would likely have to <UNK> a series of events such as these br br a glaring weakness is that fake baby cry after it allegedly <UNK> uncle <UNK> watch i've heard more authentic crying from a doll in a toy store br br watch it and you'll really feel like you've been somewhere
<START> this episode of <UNK> changed everything the show is about to end it's third season and all hell is breaking loose in this episode the <UNK> ones bring an innocent named dr <UNK> to the <UNK> the protect him from the sources assassin when attacks he <UNK> in as a <UNK> and then into his demon skin he <UNK> threw a wall which totally knocks her out and practically kills her then <UNK> <UNK> threw what is left of the wall <UNK> comes from the attic and says the <UNK> spell before came kill the doctor but being the power of one it just wounds him leo comes to <UNK> the other sisters and wants to find and destroy him for real <UNK> meanwhile is in the underworld trying to find cole when and <UNK> go out into the street to find the demon the demon finds them after their battle the witches realize that a camera caught everything when they get back to <UNK> trying to battle the media and after they <UNK> a a witch gone <UNK> shoots <UNK> uses her <UNK> to move people out of the way so she can get to the hospital but they get their to late and <UNK> dies and just when is about to get shot time is <UNK> to where they bring dr <UNK> to the <UNK> blows in and <UNK> and <UNK> but <UNK> is still in the underworld so kills the doctor and <UNK> out of the <UNK> when leo finally comes he can't <UNK> is dead and so is the power of three for now personally this episode was sad was the of all of them i would love to have her power of <UNK> i really don't think <UNK> should of went to the underworld because if she didn't wouldn't have killed but <UNK> brings the power of three together again and i'm happy with the show's progress
<START> what a waste of a great cast figured i'd check it out because it looked like a good <UNK> comedy with a lot of fairly well known actors what it turned out to be was a pointless collection of boring <UNK> stories about several characters with minimal connections with each other characters who start off looking like decent people but end up with not a single likable or interesting characteristic among them calling it a comedy was a stretch as well the only thing that made me chuckle was jack <UNK> song which was basically <UNK> d i waited for something big to happen but ended up with nothing more than <UNK> minutes of my life wasted
<START> even disney are guilty of the cash cow disease after the roaring success of the love bug in 1968 the house of mouse <UNK> in with <UNK> rides again <UNK> goes to <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> goes <UNK> neither sequel capturing the charm and <UNK> appeal of the love bug back in <UNK> in this one we find race driver jim douglas and his sidekick <UNK> entering <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> naturally things outside of the race start to take over <UNK> they get mixed up in a diamond robbery and <UNK> falls in love with another car the car stunts are of course pleasant and easy on the eye and it would be <UNK> of me to really <UNK> <UNK> on such a friendly piece of fluff it's just that the film goes nowhere fast and personally now i can see it for the <UNK> motivated piece of work it is still you get to see <UNK> take a bath foil the baddies and of course dance for the lady in his life so something there for everyone i think 4 10
<START> k <UNK> is a very intriguing film is kevin spacey really an alien or is he a mentally deranged human who just thinks he is an alien that is the question that dr powell jeff bridges must answer before the self <UNK> <UNK> that sets for his departure from earth br br as the film unfolds and more evidence is <UNK> both theories grow in credibility his ability to map from memory the area of the galaxy where his home planet is located <UNK> a knowledge that no human could possibly possess yet the <UNK> sessions lead us to a real person with a very real and traumatic life filled with devastating events that could have caused such a personality <UNK> the ending seems to give the answer but is just ambiguous enough to make you wonder if you really know normally i don't like lady or tiger endings but this one is <UNK> i have my own theory that fits all the clues but i don't know that my theory is any more correct than anyone else's br br director wings of the <UNK> the tale <UNK> with great skill this is a rare example of the director staying in the shadows and inducing outstanding acting performances out of talented actors to let the story dominate this is not to say that the directing is technically inferior because it is excellent however remains <UNK> delivering great power through the use of subtlety a pleasant change from today's <UNK> directors who visually grab and shake the viewer as if to scream look how brilliant i am ' br br kevin spacey once again delivers a marvelous performance as this is a part that is extraordinarily demanding <UNK> spacey to render the cool and logical one minute and then switch <UNK> to <UNK> his tormented alter ego under <UNK> the next spacey is so believable as both alien and human it makes the viewer's task that much more difficult jeff bridges is also terrific as the relentless psychologist who becomes obsessed with learning the truth about br br this is inspired storytelling for the thoughtful viewer i rated it a 9 10 if you must have closure at the end of a film this movie will be very frustrating however if you like a fascinating mystery that keeps you thinking long after the credits you won't be disappointed
<START> i was impressed by the story it had the typical <UNK> gay male and the typical mormon <UNK> but they each also had friends and family who balanced their lives well there are a number of characters some nice and some not so nice each with their own personality nuances and most reminded me of people in my own life br br the story starts out with several humorous moments and slowly <UNK> into a heartwarming relationship film the story progresses without obvious plot turns and never talks down to you it makes you think a bit while waiting to see what happens even when i thought i could <UNK> something coming i was surprised by how it actually came about br br not many movies make me laugh <UNK> at real gay dialogue and then bring a tear to my eye when i feel the characters' pain i watched the film on dvd and couldn't bring myself to stop watching until it was over usually i watch a film in pieces over a couple of days it's nice to see a film with gay characters that is uplifting but not preachy i highly recommend this film and not just for gay audiences the relationships <UNK> sexuality
<START> i've watched this movie on a fairly regular basis for most of my life and it never gets old for all the <UNK> remarks and insults mostly from david spade tommy boy has a giant heart and that's what keeps this movie funny after all these years br br tommy callahan chris <UNK> is the son of big tom callahan brian <UNK> master car parts salesman and has ridden on that all his life but after his died dies on his wedding day tommy learns that the company is in debt and about to be bought by ray dan <UNK> the owner of a huge car parts company so in order to save the company tommy has to go on the road to sell the <UNK> new <UNK> <UNK> along for the ride though not by choice is richard hayden david spade a former <UNK> of <UNK> who was big <UNK> right hand man br br the movie rides on the chemistry between the two snl stars and real life best friends chris <UNK> and david spade the duo has enough comic energy going between them to power the world it's the big dumb guy versus the smart little guy it works and some of their scenes are <UNK> funny <UNK> and spade are actually decent dramatic actors as well although the film is primarily a comedy it has its fair share of drama but spade and especially <UNK> are just as good there as when they're making the audience laugh br br forgive me but i have to talk about chris <UNK> a little more i read his biography the chris <UNK> show a biography in three acts for anyone who cares and understanding who chris was in real life made this movie more special to me chris <UNK> was a genuinely good person who <UNK> and ultimately failed to <UNK> his <UNK> although this was the first movie he had a major role in it is his best film it really showed who he was and just how much talent he had knowing <UNK> story adds another <UNK> to this movie although it doesn't make it any less funny br br <UNK> and spade are matched with a good on screen cast rob lowe is suitably slimy as <UNK> new brother and bo derek is solid as his step mother brian <UNK> is great as big tom <UNK> makes it easy to believe that they're father in son big tom is just as crazy as his son although he's smarter and more mature dan <UNK> gives one of his best performances as giving tommy the hard truth behind advertising julie warner is also good as <UNK> love interest michelle br br for me peter segal is one of the great comedy directors he keeps the pace quick and energetic but most importantly he knows how to make comedy funny he doesn't <UNK> the jokes and he understands that funny actors know what they're doing and he allows them to do it but segal goes a step further he gives tommy boy a friendly almost nostalgic tone that both <UNK> the <UNK> genuinely and <UNK> the br br critics didn't like tommy boy shame on them a movie doesn't have to be super sophisticated or intellectual to be funny god <UNK> <UNK> and spade were forced to do muted comedy a la the office this is a great movie and one of my all time favorites
<START> it took me a while to find this movie since they don't have it yet on dvd and my vcr is not worth <UNK> up again i guess all the <UNK> to drug use is too much for some folks but i found a decent <UNK> on ebay and i must say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously is just retarded it is a slap stick spoof in the vein of airplane i must say that when i watched it on showtime or spotlight growing up in the 80s i enjoyed the humor a whole lot more then than i do now but it's definitely worth watching just to see what they i e movie makers were able to get away with before the just say no <UNK> unleashed their propaganda sing we are all on drugs <UNK> it's a silly film and worth the 10 i paid off of ebay to get it on dvd just don't even think about comparing it to the original that's just plain stupid what are you high
<START> a documentary filmmaker explores seemingly unrelated <UNK> incidents connected by the legend of an ancient demon called the br br from the looks of it the film looks like one of those camcorder movies that have been popular these last few months even one that's going to be released next week <UNK> activity however unlike movies like <UNK> <UNK> and blair witch where most of those movies are in complete chaos and mayhem with all of the <UNK> this one is basically shown in a traditional documentary style it has tv <UNK> and interviews and the scares are very subtle well <UNK> the last 20 minutes where we go into the chaos effect and where the fear factor is raised up tremendously br br and it works the film is very engrossing and it makes you think yes you heard me right it makes you think you have to pay attention to those unrelated details given throughout the film and the payoff is great when in course of the film these things start to <UNK> one another the film is also very slow moving which in this case is a good thing we as the audience get to <UNK> the details shown on screen however subtle or blatant they are br br above all it's a frightening little film i'm a person who is scared of ghosts and the <UNK> more than killers who <UNK> away teenage victims so yes the film gave me some nightmares there are some images in here that are really disturbing to watch including one closer in the end where it makes you go what am i looking at well it's better left unanswered there are around ten <UNK> characters in here all of which gave authentic performances in their roles br br the only thing i don't like about the film is the ending because most questions are left unanswered the question that's it went though my mind it left a bad taste in my mouth however the rest of the film is just engrossing and really frightening don't see this alone in the dark because you'll regret that choice also i can see in a couple of years that hollywood would remake this film that will be interesting
<START> surprised to know that the director sebastian was a young <UNK> 28 and bored with so many predictable movies i was delighted with the script showing so many small stories and <UNK> spread here and there directed with black humor and taste i loved the tension between the very <UNK> and the very natural but beautiful thompson each member of the gang deserves attention <UNK> <UNK> at his best is remarkable
<START> the film is nothing else than an exposition of nudity has anyone noticed that all three main female characters appear naked it looks like the only winning bet for portuguese filmmakers is to include some if not a lot of nudity of the local stars together with <UNK> which otherwise in the nowadays portuguese society is <UNK> with horror if you watch advertising for portuguese films at portuguese <UNK> they all have included a hot scene from the movie i'm not saying by any means that portuguese society is <UNK> just that the movie industry does not seem capable of finding others ways of success going back to the movie there is nothing left from the spirit of the book which is a masterpiece the film could have been a good one had there been <UNK> the real idea of the book of <UNK> at any time and not the strictly erotic part it had almost all the ingredients but the chef was awful
<START> when going to see rendition i was expecting an exciting film on a controversial topic with big name actors i was not expecting a film that was so engrossing exciting poetic and sad that picked me up from the very beginning and didn't let me go even after i left the theater a word of advice to anyone who hasn't seen it yet don't let your politics come in the way of enjoying or not enjoying this film take it for what it is i saw this with my conservative jewish family i'm the black sheep the pseudo liberal college student and i thought they would write it off as liberal propaganda instead they said it was a great film with excellent performances they like to fancy themselves film critics br br it's sad that a movie like this has to be <UNK> by its oscar <UNK> actors while leaving out the constantly underrated <UNK> as well as new talent like the truly excellent the entire cast gave good performances with some standing out much more than others my only problem with it was that there was a lot going on which didn't allow for much screen time for each of the characters in fact i felt like the sub plot with and was just as prominent on screen as part of the story br br the characters all have the potential to fall into stereotypes but the actors do a good enough job to give them depth with the little screen time they have streep is truly terrific as a heartless senator and as much as i don't want to see the actress in such a terrible role its impossible not to believe her <UNK> who will probably be one of the oscar <UNK> for this movie seems a bit unsure in his role at times <UNK> trying to portray his inner conflict but usually just comes off like he either forgot his lines or he doesn't know how he should feel <UNK> gave an excellent performance his unforgettable confrontation with streep is easily one of the best parts of the movie again was terrific and i hope to see him in more mainstream films it's a shame that <UNK> with probably get nominated before him as shown on imdb has been is some films already but he is a newcomer in my eyes he along with <UNK> and all gave great performances br br the story of and was not given any credit in commercials but it brings a sad humanity to the story the narrative was interesting as i was trying to really connect the two story until it was <UNK> told to us at the end i've read some comments on here that say the love story was useless but i disagree i think it definitely shows another side to the controversial issue as well as humanity in general was the real terrorist but he was doing it to avenge his brother and even though he is responsible for the attack you see a <UNK> side to him through the story with not that i think we should feel bad for actual terrorists but i think the we are all people theme was definitely relevant br br whatever your feelings on terrorism politics etc leave it out of the theater the bottom line is this is an interesting story with a message we all need to hear
<START> examination of the lives of three <UNK> constantly complaining single ex <UNK> in post war japan is a wonderful character piece they used to be friends in the old days but now their relationship is strained because one of the women has become a successful and the other two owe her although the is the only one who has become successful in this <UNK> economy she is the only one of the three that has no children the other two each have a child whom they depend upon for <UNK> because neither of them work complications ensue when the kids decide to get married though not to each other and leave home this leads to the bitter <UNK> old women to become even more bitter and <UNK> getting drunk and <UNK> their rotten children and <UNK> friend the meanwhile the is herself unhappy despite her <UNK> she has no one besides her young deaf maid to keep her company and chance encounters with two former lovers from her geisha days lead nowhere all they really want is to borrow money from her the three characters are all neck deep in the <UNK> of their own bored lives and are too weary to struggle much usually <UNK> instead to <UNK> themselves to the <UNK> of it all or at the very most toss complaints back and forth to each other br br late is very slow moving and not much actually happens but like all great directors has the ability to do much with very little i haven't seen much of his work but i suspect that this isn't his best even though it is very good the problem i think is that it all doesn't seem to amount to much but the film is full of good points although it is cynical it isn't overly so seems to sympathize with his desperate characters and he paints vivid <UNK> that make the characters seem even somewhat noble in the <UNK> of their self made misery while the film isn't a must see it is important as a <UNK> of the work of a great little known outside of his own country director precious little of which is available on video here in the u s
<START> granted <UNK> 2 is better than the uwe boll <UNK> that was the first one but thats like saying drowning is better than being chopped alive ok ok i'm being a little bit harsh with this one its just that video game adaptations of zombie movies always leave a bad taste in my mouth resident evil was alright but its sequels are pure rubbish the first <UNK> was entertaining crap more than anything else uwe boll saw to that and <UNK> 2 was better the entertainment value was there the hot chicks were there the gore was there but this is it the script even though <UNK> was better than the first one but in the script <UNK> horribly written characters stupid action sequences clichés and an ending that drags on and on reaching a level of <UNK> which would make the very very proud but it could've been worse right br br <UNK> 2 stars <UNK> <UNK> yes sid <UNK> as an insane doctor looking for a cure to death as you may guess it all goes to sh t a nearby college campus seems to be the center for the zombie or <UNK> and as you may expect a group of <UNK> and two zombie scientists try to save the world by going there and the problem their main goal no it ain't blowing sh t up instead they have to get a <UNK> of zombie blood so they can create a cure to the deadly virus between this and that lays bland character interactions an <UNK> amount of clichés but hey at least the black guy isn't the first one to get killed and decent looking zombies br br the acting is passable who would've thought that <UNK> was a passable actor not me <UNK> <UNK> and ed quinn shine somewhat as the leads and the supporting cast was passable too it was all passable br br the make up effects on the zombies were alright it could've been worse like in the first <UNK> just guys running around in dusty mummy suits the gore was alright too cheap scares and even cheaper tension are almost non existent in this movie which is a good thing the action sequences were stupid as f <UNK> but at least there wasn't any sword fighting zombies or that ridiculous slow motion bullet effect br br overall this movie will appeal only to zombie <UNK> fans of the <UNK> games and for someone who wants to rent a cheap horror movie for the weekend apparently there's going to be a third one as hinted by the ending but i wouldn't count on it unless uwe decides to do it a 4
<START> this has got to be one of the better post astaire musicals made by columbia produced by arthur <UNK> and directed by vet charles <UNK> this picture really put gene kelly on the map and <UNK> rita <UNK> reputation as <UNK> <UNK> female dance partner she plays a bit of a <UNK> role here since she performs contemporary 1940s numbers with gene and co star phil <UNK> but also puts her in the role of her grandmother a nightclub performer in the late 19th br br the music should also be <UNK> out because this was i believe the last project that the legendary <UNK> <UNK> most famous today for old man river and smoke gets in your eyes worked on and his <UNK> was the equally legendary ira gershwin they <UNK> a score that is full of charm and characterization the music for the historical sequences is especially noteworthy because it's so perfectly <UNK> in the early 20th century <UNK> that was original period it's a bit like picking up a record from one of your favorite bands from the 1970s and hearing them do a song in the original style of that time br br the story is pretty <UNK> which is fine with me because this film is as close an <UNK> as you will ever be likely to see of the 1930s 40s golden age of broadway musical comedy style on film even the 1940s war propaganda aspects of the film's music give it extra charm as the talented trio sing make way for tomorrow and even <UNK> poke fun at america's enemies and use period <UNK> such as referring to <UNK> br br probably the most memorable performance in the film is kelly's dance to the alter ego dance which found him arguing with and then dancing with himself as a <UNK> image of the battle of the conscience this <UNK> much of his later work and also stands an effective and memorable scene in and of itself br br fans will want to seek this out for various reasons kelly fans will see this as a rare chance to see him outside of the confines of mgm with a different set of co stars and music superior to his usual mgm material hayworth fans will want to see rita in glorious color at the peak of her fame and ability and fans of classic broadway musicals will definitely want to hear final score and marvel at the quality of <UNK> lyrics and the <UNK> of their styles this is a definite gem in the crown of <UNK> musical program
<START> oh so beautiful oh so <UNK> and so gut wrenching br br makes everything seem so superficial so pale so meaningless in comparison br br sister helen is not a real saint br br she is a real human flawed raw and blunt but passionate and with a heart of gold br br what i found most interesting is that this handful of wretched miserable people found meaning and laughter br br what i loved most is how the documentary portrayed the of human nature
<START> oh boy oh boy this movie is something for the lovers of real art it really does not make any sense at all it is totally boring especially because of the anti <UNK> all people behave more than strange and unrealistic sometimes it feels like sitting in a theatre because in dialogues the actors tend to face the camera and therefore the audience instead of each other like i said before if you are in to those more <UNK> movies shown in cannes go for it if you are not better leave this movie alone because you will be more than disappointed and in the end know that you have wasted your time like i did two thumbs down
<START> starting with a my name is joe like scene in <UNK> anonymous careers into a mad spiral of infidelity double standards and <UNK> affairs but what do you expect from a family of lawyers br br a genuinely funny film with some of the most outrageous characters since the <UNK> plot and subplot are <UNK> with surreal scenes of <UNK> <UNK> life ever been to a wedding reception in the <UNK> toilet where the brides grandmother and her deranged girlfriend are smoking <UNK> and cracking blue jokes no me either leading to a final scene of almost symbolism br br excellent
<START> i don't understand jokes i do believe this is my problem with modern cinema or those films that are made with millions of dollars in hopes that it will become the next greatest sensation isn't it odd  people just don't laugh as much anymore and i do believe one of the <UNK> to that problem is the film showtime there was absolutely nothing from the beginning to the end of the credits with all of the <UNK> between murphy and de niro with russo as eye candy with even standard clichés which make the general population <UNK> with pre <UNK> laughter there was nothing in this film that made me laugh there weren't the overbearing physical jokes or the <UNK> mental vocal jokes at all throughout this <UNK> of a film from the beginning i didn't buy the match up of de niro and murphy as anything more than hollywood excitement throughout the commentary the director vividly talks about the <UNK> and laughter going on during the shoot  where was it in the film this falls to either two problems  the director really doesn't have a sense of comedy or the editor didn't understand the value of the film either way they both doomed the entire hour and a half spent on the hollywood nightmare showtime br br outside of finding no reason to laugh there was no reason to follow these characters through any moment of the film there was a glimpse of humor with de <UNK> desire to pick up <UNK> as a <UNK> but the director had to write on the machine so audiences would understand  who does that but that was dropped and never developed there was the idea that murphy was an actor but outside of that one opening monologue nobody would have understood that he <UNK> a room in a <UNK> house in which he can afford on a police <UNK> <UNK> this just didn't <UNK> even for hollywood standards there was a bad guy who wanted a big gun but the gun was never developed nor was there any true test of the weapons <UNK>  even at the end it became a bigger joke to laugh at an accent than remember the guns where was the television show in this russo had to get <UNK> from this random guy at the beginning but there were no consequences there was nothing in the middle of this film outside of further questions and meaningless <UNK> random characters were introduced forgotten re introduced and forgotten all over again the director and producer laughed at this while we the <UNK> viewer must suffer through inside jokes and cliché stereotypes br br was there a love interest in this film was there a truly sinister bad guy that went apart from the comic duo to bring true evil to the screen were there any pop culture references that didn't come back to robert de niro was there random chaos throughout this film if you need the answers to these obviously you won't find them in showtime the fact that i am this review with question upon question only means that this sub par actually well below sub sub sub par filled no <UNK> or <UNK> anything of value to the cinematic world sure it had big names and one really neat explosion but there was nothing of substance to this at all it was almost as if the director said prior to the shoot that he wanted clichés but not regular clichés  go with the bad ones the plot had no linear structure the jokes were boring the characters were drab and underdeveloped this ranks below even the best of buddy cop films i like to give films the benefit of the doubt but nothing worked in this film not even shatner could save this film and he even tried hard br br overall i cannot nor will i suggest this film to anyone with a pulse the commentary only <UNK> the pathetic nature of the film with obvious flaws horrid jokes and creators questioning the <UNK> of their work if creators can't stand behind showtime why should we i didn't want a lethal weapon when i watched this but i did want something like that i understand there was some form of criticism of reality television and the corrupt nature of the media but that message didn't make it off the page in fact i believe i saw media leave the theater first when i watched this shame carries its heavy hand with this film and i cannot blame it murphy used to be a big star comedy was his middle name see coming to america but lately he seems to have lost his edge de niro obviously wants to get away from an image that <UNK> him but making these sort of films is only going to set him back further one of these films is equal to one scorsese picture br br skip this one i promise it will make your final cinematic days worthwhile oh and if you laughed at any of the jokes in this film  i am truly sorry br br grade out of
<START> i had to watch this movie for professional reasons and can only say it's a complete waste of time when running baldwin looks like an ape characters are dull same story has been told 1000 times better in other movies i think everything has been now said about this film but imdb requires me to write 10 lines so boring and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and trivial
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is the kind of girl i would marry never boring always thinking positively good with animals okay as one reviewer wrote a bit too much <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> only madonna could get away with that but that's why i love <UNK> <UNK> she's not your ordinary girl she makes things happen always exciting to be around and always honest sure she steals but she doesn't rob or murder unless you're out to do her in she knows which rules can be broken and which ones should be she knows what to take and what can't be stolen if you need a favor from her she's in 100 bottom line she knows how to enjoy life <UNK> is always loving which is why she has a way with wild animals and completely dedicated to those she loves and who love her br br who's that girl she's the girl for me
<START> my wife and i saw every episode in this series and loved it however the series was cut short without a final episode by the producers of the show it ended with a typical end the season cliff <UNK> leaving it's fans feeling cheated a waste of great writing and acting
<START> the late shift is a great book i read the book several years ago and i was <UNK> at the <UNK> <UNK> that went on when johnny carson retired and jay leno and johnny carson tried to grab his spot when the movie came out i <UNK> a vhs copy of the movie and having <UNK> the book recently it's hard to say which i enjoy more because they're quite equal in the amount of information conveyed the two lead actors john michael <UNK> and daniel <UNK> two actors i never heard of before and haven't heard of since play leno and <UNK> convincingly despite <UNK> <UNK> of his portrayal as being poor they play the parts quite well despite a lot of people looking for an imitation of the two i wasn't as interested in that the story is what counts and that brings me to kathy bates kathy bates playing helen is this movie she plays this evil bitch of a character so <UNK> you realize how on earth can this woman control herself much less a national tv show <UNK> there should be a sequel
<START> i'm sorry to say this but i didn't enjoy this movie at all it was just too boring so boring that i couldn't watch the rest of it it's not as interesting as the lion king or <UNK> that's why i hate this stupid days because these days are just not what they used to be the movies that disney have released lately really sucks i miss the old days when they used to produce good movies like the lion king <UNK> <UNK> cinderella the <UNK> and robin hood this movie is really awful i really tried my best to be interested in this movie but i just couldn't i don't think i could recommend this film to anyone i would recommend the ones that i just mention above
<START> rendition is a film not to miss with solid writing from <UNK> sane and with the direction of <UNK> hood that takes us on a story which is a ride through a man's journey through hell once again meryl streep in a convincing role of the cia today and great performances from a cast of <UNK> actors in reese <UNK> jake and alan arkin along with actors of middle eastern descent who add to the reality of the story br br in rendition you see how terrorism can breed terrorism and as the film progresses <UNK> the story to what is playing out in the middle east is reality brought to the screen the <UNK> shots add to the intensity of the story and peter <UNK> does a brilliant job of playing an assistant in the ass kissing way of how american politics are <UNK> too bad there has not been a larger audience for this film as along with the valley of and lions for <UNK> rendition plays an important role in showing an audience how the fight for and the protection of democracy can go seriously <UNK>
<START> i thought this movie was absolutely hilarious i already knew it was going to be a funny movie but it was funnier than i expected sure there were some lame jokes but they <UNK> me up i thought the actors were going to turn out to be pretty bad but the actors were good in acting out this comedy i have to give kudos to amanda <UNK> she looked surprisingly like her brother and pulled off an awesome performance as a boy as for the other actors they were funny as well of course there were moments where you yell at the screen how can you not tell but that's all part of the fun in the end the plot turned out pretty well there's a happy ending but you expect br br overall just hilarious
<START> definitely not only for urban legend <UNK> <UNK> tales is an often scary and always fun ride through several popular stories it is also a film that <UNK> the low expectations i had a horror film i had never heard or read about a straight to video release granted the latter often presents us with a pleasant surprise but with horror films nowadays it can be all or nothing a cast of mostly <UNK> well i'll leave the <UNK> to you br br the film proves to be an entertaining suspenseful and overall very enjoyable experience the four stories are well paced and satisfying the only one i felt was a little weaker was the for the simple reason that it offers almost no explanation for its plot or the characters' actions however i still loved the tale its atmosphere and ending my favorite one was the third story people can <UNK> too the suspense in it is not only <UNK> but also educational br br i found <UNK> tales to be one of those horror gems one discovers by chance and then goes on <UNK> it to everyone br br 7 10
<START> the story is shortly about the faith lacking business man priest daniel <UNK> christian slater who is looking closer on a case where another priest is suspected for murder the priest <UNK> he's guilty but at the same time he is not able to discuss the matter due to <UNK> enter daniel <UNK> who starts playing cop br br while the plot isn't ridiculous everything else is let's start with the visual side the cinematography is dull it looks more like a tv series than a movie the camera angles are boring in fact there's not a single memorable camera angle in the entire movie there's no interesting closeups revealing details and the scene transitions well there's not much to say about those they aren't smooth at all there seems to be no connection between the scenes than the actual plot okay they did use a transition with music in between two scenes but there are no interesting visual transitions in the entire movie the times <UNK> was used there was no visual connection between the scenes br br the boring visual part could be forgiven if the film would offer anything else unfortunately the film only offers forced wooden acting and clumsy dialogue with no punch on top of that the film suffers from audio problems the sound volume is <UNK> several times in the movie as if the <UNK> would be too far br br i didn't predict the solution of the film it could be because the film never gave me the opportunity or it could be due to the presentation which was so boring i never even tried to figure it out br br put two plus two together and it equals a b movie where <UNK> stands for boring
<START> gary cooper and a <UNK> change identities since they both agree cooper would be more efficient facing the <UNK> what is remarkable in this film are the costumes both the and steve who is the bad guy <UNK> wears his guns backwards probably to be able to the film starts quite <UNK> with a showdown with wild bill <UNK> ruth roman looking very pretty is the <UNK> there is plenty of action never a dull moment but you have to concentrate because the story is a bit complicated good entertainment
<START> this movie is an all time favorite of mine i'm sorry that imdb is not more positive about it i hope that doesn't keep those who have not experienced it from watching it br br i've always loved this movie i watch it about once a year and am always pleased <UNK> with the film and especially the stellar performances by entire cast br br i've always wondered whether jean <UNK> actually did the ending dance with travolta if anyone knows this piece of trivia please leave a comment br br thanks and enjoy
<START> this is probably the only movie i have ever not been able to make it all the way through not only was it annoying and boring but the low production values made it hard to make out the action and in some cases the dialogue avoid this one like the plague
<START> this was the most uninteresting horror flick i have seen to date the premise is <UNK> forgotten after about 1 minute the acting is terrible the scariest thing about this movie is when the two guys kiss <UNK> what were the film festival judges thinking when they gave this garbage a <UNK> <UNK> the only reasons i didn't turn this movie off were to see what not to do as a filmmaker and if the paper thin plot line could really keep going on as is was i was not disappointed by this latter notion there wasn't even a single bit of nudity or gore to keep the <UNK> interested also i thought it was tacky to use about 3 minutes of resident evil 2 in the movie was that supposed to be filler 'cause it was the <UNK> and most interesting part of the movie
<START> after the death of all senior officers commander craig scott of the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> finds himself promoted to command of an <UNK> spaceship owned by corporation its chief mission is to search for planets and of course long term coffee <UNK> br br craig scott and his second in command chief <UNK> find themselves ill prepared for command except <UNK> as they are fully able to keep the <UNK> <UNK> clean which is not to <UNK> the importance of clean <UNK> especially when incompetent <UNK> cause those same <UNK> to be well <UNK> on a regular basis br br the episodes are presented as a series of short 2 3 minutes reports by the commander to earth the humor is a mix of <UNK> deadpan and outrageous physical comedy think yes minister meets red dwarf but on a shoe string budget all the usual plot devices of sci fi are here aliens nuclear weapons computer <UNK> but each is improved by the fresh <UNK> <UNK> of high grade <UNK> br br <UNK> is definitely low budget but the somewhat cheesy effects and props fit the absurd premise of the show remember those hilarious hockey <UNK> they wore on the old battlestar galactica with the brand name still visible okay there's a lot of that in <UNK> but it's cute br br <UNK> ain't high art but that's not what it's trying to be it's just a little bit of off <UNK> fun it does a good job of being that
<START> this is marvelous movie about a soul of <UNK> this is a journey to heart i found it fascinating the director did a great job he makes the scenes talk especially on the silent scenes the window of <UNK> is a great one an the scenes when he lies in bed are one of the best directed scenes i have seen br br apart from directing it has been a quite time i did not watch a movie about a soul as a <UNK> i can say that this film proves that the age does not matter about your soul so as soul br br as living in turkey i do not care about the other side of ny this is a universal scene you can see everywhere in the world as to my opinion more universal than every other thing br br do not miss this film otherwise you will miss a great thing about a soul if you have one br br
<START> i just watched the dvd of this award winning film one life stand is a stark drama that through it's pace black and white shots and atmospheric music paints a very compelling and honest picture it's a story about life's <UNK> around power sex and control <UNK> by a few sad lonely lives the mother very well acted by maureen <UNK> is uptight and drawn in on herself the father only appears on the side lines and yet is a powerful and pivotal part of the drama money is hidden in boxes and shoes br br the writing was superb and i liked the sensual close up shots of details such as nails red lips a candle mirrors etc the way the camera was used made it very intimate it's a harrowing tale with sexual undertones while the <UNK> on the dark streets adds to the despair of the sad characters br br there are some highly memorable shots conveyed simply by a walk or a dropped shoulder such as walking away under the bridge and the stunned and hurt look on face in the call centre which hopes to helps people through using <UNK> cards as she <UNK> to a <UNK> talk of her own abuse br br at the start we see john paul wide eyed and innocent having photos shot as he wants to try <UNK> his mother is <UNK> and making poor choices for him in a way pushing him away while she tries to keep him john paul's <UNK> turns into <UNK> work and boss offers her money and eventually they go on a date there are also moments of humour and subtle irony one excellent scene is when they are having a fairly normal meal and starting to open up a bit when the father appears with his dark presence and clouds everything over but this and other things offer moments of hope br br i felt at times the pacing of the film was a <UNK> too intense but this is a small detail in another wise challenging and memorable film and something a bit different it stands in start contrast to most american films which are either total fantasy or the <UNK> <UNK> as seen through <UNK> glasses this film depicts life with all its rough edges and displays unforgettable images br br this isn't <UNK> but a thought provoking and real life drama br br one life stand is a truly involving and emotionally honest film
<START> seems like m is back the man behind la comes back with a really fun and clever sequel to those old fashioned <UNK> <UNK> whereas directors tend to over <UNK> sequels of old classics remember the <UNK> chose to work on a really cheap hero <UNK> <UNK> a kind of low budget french <UNK> and decides to do it in a old school way the photography the body attitudes the fights choreography and the fx everything is like an homage to the way films were made back in the 50s and it works as the tone and jokes of the movie are really good jean <UNK> perfectly this stupid arrogant macho selfish french spy lost in a country he understands only in terms of <UNK> and <UNK> yes that's it just the way the <UNK> uses to consider its <UNK> back then and oh no i won't say it has anything to do with what happens nowadays in the very same area ah ah he just looks like an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with something like 40 pounds less which is perfect for the role the other members of the cast fit perfectly as well with all you can dream of russian spies egyptian and former nazis and of course the women as there has to be <UNK> <UNK> in any good spy movies the plot is good maybe not brilliant but really good enough taking place between actual historical facts and remembering us in a funny way how france and the others treated its <UNK> back in those days it all starts in 1955 with a british spy disappearing while tracking a russian <UNK> full of weapons in then france sends his best friend agent <UNK> <UNK> to discover what happened to both the <UNK> and the agent the fact is that this agent is really as dumb as can be and he slips through the story without even understanding it solving it in a very <UNK> esquire way i have to say i had a bad feeling about the movie as the publicity made around it was quite frightening and as french humor tends to be quite <UNK> and flat forget about les 3 or camping but i was really surprised and in the good way i highly recommend it whether you want a good parody of bond esquire movies much more fun than in d e b s for example but less <UNK> or you're a fan of that genuine and <UNK> way of filming they had back in the yes that's it clever and really funny you've got the point once again mr
<START> although i found the acting excellent and the cinematography beautiful i was extremely disappointed with the adaptation br br one of the significant portions of the <UNK> is the fact that ethan and <UNK> decide to kill themselves rather than go on this is never presented in the movie they show it as if it were a <UNK> accident br br the character changes in <UNK> and are almost non existent while in the <UNK> they almost change places at the end of this adaptation it appears as if they are both <UNK> br br lastly that <UNK> and ethan <UNK> their relationship fully nearly destroys the power and <UNK> of the finale br br the change of the narrator being a preacher was one effective change br br neeson and arquette are superb in their portrayals joan allen was also wonderful however her character was much watered down from <UNK> br br i do not expect films to <UNK> portray novels but this one went to far and in the process nearly destroyed the story br br overall i would not recommend watching this film unless you have read the book as you will come away confused and disappointed
<START> this is possibly one of the worst movies i have had the <UNK> pleasure of watching in my entire life the plot is ridiculous and the characters are horrible people i watched this film with 3 friends and we all agreed to turn it off 30 minutes before the end ben <UNK> character is just plain stupid but not funny at all it is a wonder why an actor of his talent would be involved in such tripe tea <UNK> does a fine <UNK> <UNK> impression throughout to portray the very cold and uninteresting female lead who has all the endearing qualities of a <UNK> handle throw in a pointless and unexplained sub plot and a horribly cringe worthy montage and you end up with a waste of <UNK> minutes 60 in my case avoid this film at all costs
<START> hey i think this movie was great and it had great graphics and i was <UNK> glad they used final fantasy 7 i think that game was the best i ever played anyways this is a great movie and i loved it they should make another one but maybe they should <UNK> use final fantasy 7 again or final fantasy 10 there both pretty awesome from tyler <UNK> i hope you can email me back if you have any details if there is another one people for anyone else reading this i suggest you see this movie it is animated but it looks pretty realistic and its got awesome fighting scenes i haven't see that fast of fighting in a movie for a long time the game final fantasy 7 is also really great not good graphics but its really fun and challenging
<START> context is everything when one goes to rate a movie when rating this movie one has to consider the time in which it was made we didn't really know what the inside of the earth was in those days so you can't <UNK> on the movie too much for the plot based on a much older book for the era this was top notch special effects and the production quality was great i watched this movie in a masterfully restored <UNK> master for the time the makeup and effects almost make the guys in the rubber suits look plausible as a monster thing this is pure movie cheese complete with bad rubber suits models and creepy costumes awesome ps doug <UNK> rocks
<START> this is almost ed wood territory yeah that ridiculous wreck of a flying monster looks like a cross between a turkey <UNK> and a bad day at the <UNK> office and that sound effect <UNK> makes <UNK> across a <UNK> sound like <UNK> and why the giant claw when the goofy <UNK> <UNK> its victims with a mechanical jaw we get big close ups of the ugly chicken foot but nothing more i guess the producers thought a more appropriately titled big mouth might suggest a jerry lewis comedy and speaking of comedies all that anti matter <UNK> <UNK> is funnier than anything in a lewis movie i guess the were stuck for a reason why an ordinary duck hunter couldn't take care of a 1950's flying menace so they <UNK> a real <UNK> anti matter from another galaxy <UNK> this fugitive from <UNK> is supposed to have <UNK> in from another galaxy behind a shield of anti matter as explained in excruciating detail by one of the film's resident geniuses in this case it's jeff <UNK> a pilot who i gather in his off hours <UNK> einstein on the secrets of the universe br br unfortunately it's also <UNK> who keeps the ridiculous proceedings out of the bad movie hall of shame since he actually delivers his lines with a straight face what's more he even sounds as if he believes them this is a movie acting triumph of the first order to heck with the oscars <UNK> deserves a combat <UNK> for performing above and beyond the call of duty under the most extreme bad movie circumstances watch leading lady then you can <UNK> his <UNK> under fire she looks like she just woke up inside a bad dream and maybe if she stands stock still no one will notice her i barely did oh well the first time i saw this drive in disaster was through a <UNK> <UNK> in the back row of what's now a <UNK> development i should have learned my lesson and broken out another 12 pack this second time around
<START> here's what you have to remember about this movie it's a kids movie i don't know about the rest of you but i'm an 80s child i was obsessed with <UNK> so naturally i love this movie but if you watch the other <UNK> movies this one is by far the best but like i said it's a kids movie you have to judge it as a kids movie it doesn't matter to kids if the acting animation or script is fantastic or even good all they care about is what happens to the characters if the good guy or girl wins then it's a great movie if not then it's bad you all know what i mean you were all kids once
<START> this was without a doubt the worse horror movie i have ever seen forget the fact that the story had little to do with the facts of ed <UNK> ed story is horrific this movie ignored the facts and <UNK> way off course acting on all levels was pathetic story again for some unknown reason didn't go into the horrific facts could have been so scary if it would have stuck to the facts what were they thinking terrible movie steve <UNK> version was much much better don't waste a penny on this terribly made flick and why ignore the reality of the horrific events that alone would make for a great story man makes you wonder why this would ever be <UNK> for release why spend so much money on a movie that will never make a penny except for my wasted 5
<START> and there were quite a few of these br br i do not like this cartoon as much as many others partly because it was made in its period i much prefer cartoons with <UNK> and bugs which are fifteen or so years before hand many people will like this particularly people who always find violence funny cartoon or not br br the basic plot is a pretty well known one for looney tunes elmer goes out hunting <UNK> leads him to bugs and <UNK> ends up being shot instead also inserted are quite clever and highly entertaining jokes some do not enhance the episode ugly shooting and animation which is slightly mediocre the plot is mainly <UNK> by jokes each joke keeps the episode going this way of plot going is not all that unusual in looney tunes of course if you are pretty much a looney tunes <UNK> or an eager one like me then you'll know this already br br for people who love everything about looney tunes and <UNK> duck and like the sound of what i have said about it enjoy rabbit <UNK> br br 7 and a half out of ten
<START> bergman and comedy don't quite go together some of his comedies are so <UNK> you almost <UNK> this film has the odd <UNK> moment the last 30 seconds being the <UNK> but on the whole this is a charming rather than funny piece enjoyable throughout bergman casts several of his usual suspects who perform well there is a great scene on the train between david <UNK> and an <UNK> salesman which will stick in the memory some of the marriage material is typical cynical bergman but this is bergman in a light rather than dark mood br br this film has its moments and is worth the 90 odd minutes not one of his classics and not the place to start if you want to fall for bergman
<START> yep this has got to be one of the <UNK> movies i've ever seen it's utterly tasteless has no style whatsoever the story is so thin that you can watch television through it and the whole film has so many holes you could drive an oil <UNK> through it br br sure i appreciate a good b movie as much as most male white <UNK> <UNK> do but this has got to be the worst i've seen in fact it's so b that it lacks everything that makes a b movie interesting br br the whole movie is based around such charming <UNK> as the characters beating the crap out of each other various <UNK> functions and the complete lack of sanity of anything on screen br br it's not even funny in fact it's quite the opposite i found it even boring at times due to it's extreme predictability br br i find nothing good to say about this movie it was a waste of time watching it and i hope others don't do the same mistake if you also pay for it you should get a serious done
<START> dennis quaid is hard to prove us that jerry lee lewis was a dumb guy and he's doing too much to prove it tv sequences are very good like a of old black and white <UNK> music is fine too because mr lewis himself is singing but the rest is just hollywood b movie style with the fifties happy days complex i think the only good thing in this movie is to see young <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i usually like these dumb no brain activity movies but this was just too stupid there were way too many clichés and the plot didn't really make much sense there were a lot of loose ends and the ending was extremely poor and abrupt we didn't even get too see if the big master plan worked we only got too see the main character <UNK> over his dead <UNK> the professor that died because of stupidity see below br br one scene annoyed me particularly why did the professor only have about 5 minutes of <UNK> in his <UNK> when he went to <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> and if they only had <UNK> <UNK> containing 5 minutes worth of <UNK> why didn't he bring two or three of them then he would have that was bloody stupid the movie is pretty full of such stupid things i can not recommend it at all
<START> thank you the for showing this sleazy soft core sex flick at 1 a m i truly enjoyed it to be honest i expected a lot more from a sexy cast with <UNK> <UNK> and of course the talented chloe as rebecca carter br br the production values are truly bad mainly because of the low budget but a little more effort wouldn't harm for example the cinematography makes it look like a hard core porno movie there's absolutely no effort in lightning but let's ignore that fact because let's be honest we watched pleasures of sin because of the high amounts of sex br br the sex factor is pretty good and offers steamy explicit scenes delivers the best performance of the female cast br br so my advice is watch this movie if you are in the mood for good explicit sex or just watch it if you are a fan of mrs br br recommended only for the sex scenes don't expect anything else
<START> <UNK> 2 is the only <UNK> thank god to be held at three different locations and while it was an interesting idea it didn't really work there are only really two matches that really struck out with the rest being decent or most of them pretty terrible there are some entertaining <UNK> on hand like susan saint james ray charles and cathy crosby but the experience was a waste of time for the most part the british vs the dream team match is worth the price of admission itself but you can honestly see that anywhere br br matches br br <UNK> br br paul vs the magnificent w mr <UNK> for the time it had and despite the crappy finish this was surprisingly bearable stuff with the crowd being really into it crowd <UNK> <UNK> t at the end that being said it did nothing for career match ends in a double count out with them fighting outside the ring br br 2 5 br br <UNK> championship match randy savage c vs george the animal steele not that great wrestling wise but heavily entertaining due to the antics involved and some great comedy from steele besides savage can <UNK> a <UNK> and make it look interesting savage wins when he puts his feet on the <UNK> for <UNK> br br 2 1 2 5 br br jake the snake roberts vs george wells for a throwaway match this was better than it should have been but it's too short to make any impact what so ever roberts wins with the <UNK> pulling out the snake <UNK> which <UNK> saint james br br 1 1 2 5 br br boxing match mr t w the kid joe <UNK> vs <UNK> <UNK> w lou bob <UNK> a huge failure in my opinion i was bored senseless throughout this and while it may have been a marketing success it certainly didn't succeed at entertaining me lot of <UNK> <UNK> are noticeable as well t wins by <UNK> when <UNK> <UNK> t br br 1 5 br br horizon br br women's title match fabulous <UNK> c vs <UNK> <UNK> ends too quickly before it even gets a chance to start making a record for quick pin fall as far as woman's matches are concerned <UNK> wins when she takes advantage of missed <UNK> from the top rope br br 0 5 br br <UNK> vs <UNK> <UNK> w classy <UNK> big pop for the <UNK> stupid match up with boring offense from both involved while being much too short to matter <UNK> wins when he <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> br br 1 5 br br battle royal william perry and andre get the biggest pops this is pretty entertaining stuff despite all the <UNK> talent involved it's also noteworthy for <UNK> <UNK> 1st ever <UNK> appearance andre wins when he <UNK> the hart foundation out br br 2 1 2 5 br br tag team titles british w lou <UNK> <UNK> vs the dream team w johnny <UNK> c absolutely tremendous match that is one of the best <UNK> matches of all time you won't have time to catch your breath with all the <UNK> on hand and the excellent in ring psychology this is pure wrestling at it's finest you cannot call yourself a wrestling fan if you dislike this match win when dynamite kid heads with valentine br br 4 5 br br los angeles <UNK> sports <UNK> br br ricky <UNK> vs <UNK> <UNK> pretty decent match up here with both men putting on solid performances <UNK> is a nasty <UNK> with above average skills and it <UNK> well with high flying style <UNK> wins with a high flying cross body off the top rope br br 2 1 2 5 br br adrian <UNK> vs uncle elmer terrible match with annoying comedy involved the fans love uncle elmer but i do not <UNK> wins with a top rope <UNK> br br 0 5 br br the <UNK> brothers vs <UNK> <UNK> pretty solid match here with a lot of memorable <UNK> taken from terry <UNK> the one through the table was something else for that time i would have to rate this as my 2nd favorite win with help from jimmy <UNK> <UNK> br br 3 5 br br <UNK> championship hulk hogan c vs king kong <UNK> decent pop for hogan one of the most over hyped matches in <UNK> history hogan can't <UNK> worth a <UNK> and <UNK> is not that great himself the violence was brutal for the time but <UNK> superhero act is kind of annoying and there are too many boring moments hogan wins when he escapes before <UNK> br br 1 5 br br bottom line <UNK> 2 is a failure in most aspects die hard wrestling fans should see this once but you really don't have too there isn't enough here to satisfy a true wrestling fan vince blew it on this one don't be fooled by the hype of the main event it really is a boring affair like most of the card not recommended and ranks as one of the worst <UNK> outside of the brilliant tag title match br br 4 10
<START> a fine performance by <UNK> and a masterful one by jean <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this tale of lust desire and alienation in france the work of the two lead performers is striking subtle intense and passionate alas the script is deliberately turgid and <UNK> and the overall effect leaves one with a <UNK> spirit still those who can appreciate fine quality acting will be able to <UNK> the courageous work of the leads in this often difficult film journey of <UNK> low life br br
<START> by the way it looks at the other comments made it seems that a lot of people did not get the point to the flick it is not centered around zombies as a matter of fact they are not zombies at all they are a device by the wizard to scare the girls to death his main focus is on meg <UNK> who he wants to help him finish the job that he died while doing in the first place and what you get is a great flick with an awesome ending it is hard to find on video but every once in a while it shows up on hbo or check it out i gave it a 10 and highly recommend it
<START> can you people please stop believing everything this man says get br br your facts straight before you start <UNK> this liar he's not even br br from <UNK> he just says that to keep his blue collar look he's br br from a rich <UNK> next to <UNK> i mean he went to a private school br br his parents paid for him to go to school wow that sure does seem br br like they suffered a lot from <UNK> going to the <UNK> he was also born in canada oh wait that makes him a canadian citizen i wish he would just move there instead he lives here in his 1 million dollar new york apartment thats working class right there i sure can't wait for his dvd set to come out i want to here him talking about how big <UNK> are bad where will i get those dvds oh yeah at target and wal mart the two biggest <UNK> in america which were also the only two stores allowed to sell them
<START> i'll start off right at the beginning by saying i like this movie it's sweeping it's grand it's gripping and it's fun the <UNK> sits in front of his small stone <UNK> writing his <UNK> and what a story it is taken from a river and <UNK> by an elderly couple who <UNK> on him he becomes a <UNK> to the poor he befriends who sees glory while sees healing and both run into the future <UNK> forgive my who <UNK> an <UNK> fit br br and this <UNK> has another flaw he believes in one god instead of a <UNK> of gods back then this was totally revolutionary and grow up one night sees a woman who makes him lose his senses he gives up his practice sells his parents' home and even their <UNK> just to spend a night with her does he i won't tell meanwhile merit a <UNK> maid played with sweet simplicity <UNK> strength by jean simmons falls in love with she falls under his spell and under the spell of the belief in one god br br victor mature overacts perfectly as <UNK> <UNK> is sincere as the lost <UNK> does he find redemption stay tuned even bela the woman who steals heart isn't as bad as everyone has said the fact that she was <UNK> f <UNK> mistress had nothing to do with the casting right yeah right still she wasn't that bad i've seen worse i think she did better in the egyptian than many of today's young actresses have done in anything i said it before and i'll say it again i like this movie i recommend it it makes you think despite some hammy acting have fun with this movie it's worth it
<START> i've seen this programme a few times and the more a see of it the less i like it jamie <UNK> spears was approached to do this because of the fact that she is <UNK> sister and i'm sorry to say that that in the show is obvious they've created the character <UNK> to be everything people want to believe jamie <UNK> is clever original smart pretty popular etc the characters around her are only there to make her look better by being smarter then them more popular than them more wanted by boys then them there is nothing original about this and it's <UNK> with money so every kid there has the coolest of fashions and stuff i also have to say for a 13 year old girl or however old she is can't be much older she wears very mature clothing those short <UNK> are too short it makes young people want to wear them and all that make up this adds to the rising problems of why young girls get into so much trouble the only thing i will say is that the opening credits are sung by jamie <UNK> and given her age isn't bad at all much better than her sister anyway when it comes to vocal ability sorry it's too mature and yet too <UNK> down it's poorly acted with predictable story lines and there is far too much stereotyping going on too
<START> it's so fake the plot seems like a generic adaptation of the average <UNK> film the common themes of <UNK> like racism <UNK> and fighting for the integrity of your community are <UNK> so <UNK> <UNK> and the jokes aren't even funny <UNK> does these stand up monologue comedy routines that are really painful all the people around him deliver this <UNK> laughter even the soundtrack sounds like it's the <UNK> for far better comedy in a <UNK> try <UNK> friday foster with pam <UNK> for a more realistic experience try black heat
<START> channel <UNK> one night i just caught the start of this movie and it hooked me from the beginning it tells the sad story of an adopted child adam whose mother left him after birth the movie takes us through his childhood and makes us discover a very disturbing fact from <UNK> past i will not reveal more but it is a very in depth movie and will intrigue you for sure this was one of jimmy best roles in my opinion
<START> i saw this late at night on a minor channel and i put it on expecting a laugh or two martin lawrence is a good comic actor and i <UNK> he might be a good stand up comedian actor in the style of richard <UNK> br br i couldn't have been more wrong this concert was awful it was full of racist comments directed at white people muslims and people from india muslims and indians are the same thing in <UNK> narrow mind and rambling clichéd <UNK> philosophy lawrence like many black comics and directors can't resist the urge to <UNK> when given a platform do we really need a lecture on martin <UNK> king and the civil rights struggle during a stand up comedy show then there were his <UNK> comments designed to <UNK> him with women it made my skin crawl listening to him br br worst of all the show simply wasn't funny and i found it boring i turned over halfway through and <UNK> back to find him either still preaching or going on and on and on about the birth of his child there was no humour in the story of the birth of his child and it was self indulgent on his part to bore us with the details he clearly didn't have very much to say or he would have cut this section of the show out br br this show was rubbish
<START> mom has to be one of the all time uncomfortable movies to watch it features an elderly lady you would love to have as your <UNK> who becomes the <UNK> mother f ing monster you would ever want to meet on a dark night br br this <UNK> <UNK> eats the <UNK> of a young lady at the opening of the movie and it just gets <UNK> as it goes on a cross between the howling and brain dead seem to come to mind when describing mom br br a must for horror fans who have the stomach for it if you have watched re animator or brain dead this will <UNK> your boat and are willing to switch the brain off for an hour or so let the gore pour 8 10
<START> i went to see this 3 nights ago here in <UNK> ireland it was the world premiere of it in the tiny cinema in the arts centre as part of the <UNK> film festival br br i found strange fruit to be an excellent movie it is a bit rough around the edges but for a low budget movie that is to be expected in general the acting particularly from the main lead kent is wonderful the cinematography and direction excellent and the script hugely entertaining and thought provoking with some nice set ups and witty dialogue br br the ending was a bit sudden with no conclusion given to characters and events once the finale came to its gripping end but perhaps that's what the filmmakers were going for it certainly did make the movie more unsettling i did like the fact that the main character never came to terms with his mother on screen it leaves you wondering whether or not he ever will as in real life sometimes these things are never settled this was a good choice to leave it <UNK> rather than <UNK> <UNK> it up br br taut and suspenseful throughout strange fruit is a hugely ambitious debut and i have high hopes for what the writer director kyle will <UNK> next he and his colleagues are a talent worth watching br br i hope strange fruit gets a wider release soon as more people deserve to see this movie an above average thriller with some original and insightful twists on <UNK> and racism in america's deep south br br highly recommended 7 10
<START> so many times bollywood has tried to remake hollywood hits only to produce total <UNK> mercifully <UNK> <UNK> interpretation of sleeping with the enemy is an extremely stylish and well made films br br shah rukh khan is obsessed with <UNK> <UNK> who's looking her very best in here when he realizes that <UNK> has a <UNK> in sunny <UNK> he stops at nothing to make sure she becomes his br br every frame of this film is a delight to watch whether it's shah rukh <UNK> his trademark i love you k k k <UNK> or the feel good <UNK> scenes between sunny and <UNK> who make a perfect match you won't feel like leaving your eat in boredom br br each and every song on the soundtrack is ear pleasing especially <UNK> and <UNK> mere like i said <UNK> looks like a <UNK> in this film <UNK> may not be <UNK> best film that honor goes to but it definitely figures as one of his most flawless performances sunny is ok he's done similar roles before but he's good br br overall <UNK> is g g g great
<START> well made documentary focusing on two <UNK> who get <UNK> in the united states it's your basic fish out of water story with a non fiction twist i found it fascinating to see how peter and lived prior to coming to america and how they adapted once they arrived here in <UNK> texas they expected a sort of heaven but found out that it's a lot harder than it looks to cope well in the states they go from hopeful <UNK> to somewhat more realistic <UNK> everywhere they go they meet <UNK> with paper <UNK> that most citizens may take for granted they <UNK> that they are <UNK> than the african americans here and don't feel accepted because of that one of the lost boys manages to leave <UNK> to go to <UNK> kansas where he finds conditions slightly better but still less than ideal there are people that try to help them as well as try to hurt them in this film not shown but talked about are those who put a gun to their heads and robbed them leading one lost boy to comment <UNK> that all black people in america are no good i found it interesting too that they arrived in <UNK> in august 2001 a month before the world trade center was attacked by terrorists i had hoped to see their reaction to this tragedy but it's not mentioned at all still all in all a really well done documentary with no narration none is needed really the lost boys do a fine job on the events going on around them without any help at all thank you very much
<START> mr bug goes to town was one of those films that i grew up hearing about however a copy could never be <UNK> until now i just watched this film on dvd and thought it was a delightful and charming film with wonderful animation a good plot and great songs if this film was made by disney then the film would be considered a classic however because it was made by a little known film studio that is long gone the film has slipped through the cracks br br the film was made by the max <UNK> studios at their miami <UNK> studios and was released through paramount pictures the film was to have had its premiere on <UNK> <UNK> 1941 the date of the bombing of pearl harbor though this probably did hurt the release of the film the film did play at some movie theaters for up to a year as <UNK> by doing some research the film was called a family favorite by most of the major american <UNK> the film continued to be re released about every year or so usually around holidays like <UNK> at least in major cities br br in the mid 1950s this film was re released under a new name goes to town named after the lead character in the film br br the film is a true period piece capturing a slice of <UNK> as it was back in the late 30s and 1940's the animation is great and many of the characters are very cute the animation of the humans in the film is via the <UNK> process meaning that actors were filmed and then that footage was <UNK> over by animators giving the movement a very real look br br the studios were one of several animation studios making animated cartoons back in the 30s and 40s while some of the <UNK> characters like betty <UNK> <UNK> and the superman cartoons are better known the work of the studio is more or less forgotten br br almost as a whole the body of work of the <UNK> studios are in the public <UNK> all of the superman cartoons are public <UNK> all but one of the color classics series are public <UNK> and the film <UNK> travels is also in the public <UNK> this film never appears to have been released in the us on vhs or dvd but was released in europe however some looking around on the internet can very quickly produce you with a copy i recommend the search
<START> goofy story about a young man arquette who convinces his friends that they should kidnap frank sinatra jr nicholas the film is written ridiculously direction is odd dialogues are out of place and <UNK> the actors didn't do it much justice either arquette is annoying throughout ian nicholas was nonexistent macy was decent but only because hes a pretty good actor and probably just tried his best not to come out of this project with a totally embarrassing performance he was at least tolerable this is a stupid film in my eyes boring at times not entertaining just a film that i wouldn't recommend to anybody imdb rating 5 5 my rating 4 10
<START> being raised at the time this movie was released has probably influenced my shallow mind but still this isn't a bad movie by any means it's a movie about a hostage situation involving a <UNK> school populated to some extent by endearing teenage boys who can't seem to get out of trouble what's wrong with that it doesn't have any big special effects but so what who needs special effects <UNK> decline began around the same time that special effects were <UNK> a coincidence i think not it turned movies with potentially good plot and feelings and turned them into a big substance less light show for innocent kids and the self <UNK> well you know not all movies need special effects about three <UNK> of the movies on the imdb top 250 are without special effects but almost all of the top <UNK> movies of all time have some special effects think about it star wars e t <UNK> etc all good movies but the rest of the top <UNK> movies are usually cliched tripe with non <UNK> plots and lots of eye candy well some movies don't need ny of that junk br br excuse me for going off on a <UNK> which i normally do but i'm just so fed up with that special effects junk back to the point toy soldiers is simply a great movie i admit some of the content is a little corny and ripped off but so what every movie rips off another to some extent think of dogs countless appreciation sites <UNK> the fact that beloved quentin <UNK> who i admit i like has copied many many many movies in the making of his first major film <UNK> dogs many say that the entire plot is ripped off almost scene for scene from japanese and chinese gangster movies which mr <UNK> loved so much and probably still does sorry once again for the <UNK> br br toy soldiers is fun it has the whole <UNK> from teenagers to <UNK> members of authority i e hostage <UNK> it's fun to see kids take over when they're being held to something they don't want to do hell teenage angst inspired was the key topic to a great majority to 80's comedies plus there's the tension and thrill of having the characters use fire arms and knock out the bad guys etc plus there's some emotional points to the film when one of the characters dies the others have to cope and <UNK> it's not perfect acting but it beats most of the other tripe out there br br in short toy soldiers is exciting interesting and fun how dare you jaded <UNK> rate this movie poorly shame on you all br br personal rating 8 10
<START> one cannot help but admire mike judge for his hands on i've experienced that approach with office space almost anyone working a job could associate with the characters <UNK> has exactly the same feel to it one can easily appreciate the years later experience of our heroes because again the director has tried to put things on a very human level somewhat similar to woody allen's sleeper this movie is very funny do not miss the deleted scenes as the museum of fart is a classic imaginative comedy is a <UNK> and <UNK> is wildly imaginative extremely funny and a solid 8 0 movie experience <UNK>
<START> when i was younger i saw the end of hair on tv i just watched the last 5 minutes of the film and i was really impressed by it i got <UNK> <UNK> and i said to myself that i had to watch this film br br and i did and i've to say this film is amazing the songs are great the actors are very good and the message the message of this film is one of the most important ones make love no war this film is a real masterpiece meanwhile it's my favourite film br br the last song is one of the saddest and <UNK> i ever listened to i nearly could feel myself joining the crowd all i've got to say let the sun shine let the sun shine in

<START> an epic story of hope <UNK> by budget and limited artistic ambition seeing as <UNK> <UNK> produced this i expected something haunting and lyrical instead we get a typical norwegian co production revolution with al pacino anyone where quite possibly good intentions are <UNK> by a dreadful screenplay and where many of the characters are reduced to stereotypes the me tarzan you jane english dialogue between the non english speaking protagonists is particularly <UNK>  one could <UNK> whether nick nolte and tim roth ad <UNK> their own as they almost sound like real people the story is loaded with <UNK> we are expected to believe that can speak a <UNK> of english after having spent his entire life living as a <UNK> slave his <UNK> but unfortunately not <UNK> command <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> camp without the benefit of night classes coincidence is <UNK> i wonder whether an hour or two has been edited from the first third he tracks down his mother in ho <UNK> city almost immediately after <UNK> into his thirty year younger half brother who <UNK> <UNK> him mum gives him a gold or something similar of great value as they part but this is never referred to again his relationship with me dead inside <UNK> is supposed to provide the obligatory love interest but feels as artificial as <UNK> and cameron in gangs of new york br br the voyage in the <UNK> bucket of a boat does convey a sense of the appalling conditions that human <UNK> <UNK> indeed the only time the film is remotely exciting and unpredictable is the jerky hand held footage shot from the bridge during choppy weather conditions incidentally a boat cruise from <UNK> to new york via the cape of good hope and the african coast without stopping for fuel or supplies is certainly an epic journey the beautiful shot of the new york <UNK> echoes <UNK> use of magic hour but i want to know why the coast guard didn't show up perhaps they were watching the super bowl or something of course manages to track down his blind old dad on a remote farm in texas with the same flair he displayed in ho <UNK> city i was impressed at how nick nolte could wander around digging fields and feeding horses on a large ranch without the aid of a guide dog or white stick for <UNK> of how a story about the <UNK> <UNK> could be structured and shot on a small budget check out michael far superior in this world
<START> since i am not a big steven seagal fan i thought this was a pretty good movie it is apparent that his fans are very <UNK> with this drama that lacks an over abundance of martial arts and <UNK> force br br <UNK> <UNK> plays a self claimed <UNK> leader of a <UNK> in a <UNK> with the for weapons <UNK> he <UNK> with the intentions of releasing a deadly virus seagal is a former cia agent turned country doctor that <UNK> himself to find the <UNK> for the lethal bug that has <UNK> a small town his <UNK> native american <UNK> <UNK> figures into the salvation br br notable appearances by l q jones <UNK> belle and <UNK> <UNK> mitchell my personal favorite in this movie is <UNK> yellow <UNK> she is stunning and appears to have what it takes to take on a more challenging role br br despite the far fetched ending this was a decent movie that could have used a lot more action
<START> i'll bet i watch this film 4 or 5 times a year and will do so more often now that the <UNK> <UNK> have seen fit to put it on dvd because it's a classic with a capital c this film is timeless how can people pay 10 00 nowadays to see the junk that comes out of <UNK> with movies like the egyptian the ten <UNK> ben <UNK> captain newman <UNK> on tape dvd and cable movie channels i could go on forever but this film is so great and for a relative unknown edmund <UNK> carries the movie like <UNK> carried the world the story is wonderful the acting is first rate and the graphics at the end are so powerful you sit in your seat for a few minutes just trying to let the words sink in really a <UNK> of a film i'd give this one 15 stars if they'd let me they don't make them like this anymore but they should
<START> in a sense this movie did not even compare to the novel however it was good to have a visual of what the <UNK> looked like and also the natives if you are not good at <UNK> as you read i would never recommend watching the movie rather than reading the book i hardly suggest even watching this film let alone any other films based on this literary work this movie and many others did not fulfill this book one important part that is missing from the movie is <UNK> sense of how government of lack of there in africa was <UNK> an early <UNK> also in the movie <UNK> and his companions didn't stop and get the note and wood likewise african mistress knocks <UNK> out towards the end of the story which has a major influence in the story but was not in the book in the novel <UNK> died on the ship however he died in his <UNK> in the movie the <UNK> reaction to <UNK> interpretation of last words also <UNK> this movie is only effective if you wish to <UNK> more clearly the novel
<START> i saw this film at the 2001 toronto international film festival la <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> grim <UNK> i'm isabelle <UNK> won a well deserved best actress award at cannes for her portrayal of a woman who in her efforts to <UNK> the artistic ideal loses her humanity trapped by her talent she <UNK> her emotions and her sexuality until they can only be expressed in twisted and terrifying ways when a younger student falls in love with her our hopes rise but are soon <UNK> by the realization that she cannot experience love the way others can it is too late for her and the film's final 30 harrowing minutes are <UNK> devoid of the beautiful music that carried the first 90 minutes the message seems to be that the music itself is not enough without the life and beauty it's describing
<START> this vicious little film is horrendous my low rating for it comes for two main reasons the first is that it is an animal snuff film and i find that whole concept so vile it turns my stomach filmed over a hundred years ago i can only hope that we've evolved into something a little more <UNK> and compassionate this film is complete and utter exploitation made to cash in on the sensational aspects of the film and the subject historical interest aside this is something to watch only if one finds themselves in the grip of morbid fascination br br reason number two look at the way that the camera is set up it is placed in the best possible location to fully capture the full effect long march forward of the elephant perfect view of the <UNK> platform and a cold and <UNK> <UNK> viewpoint of the elephant with smoke coming out of it before it finally <UNK> sickening br br thomas edison did many great things for civilization and his talents and intelligence aren't in doubt nobody is perfect but when you realize that this film provided a an opportunity for him to <UNK> early cinematic <UNK> with a <UNK> film of an elephant being <UNK> and b he filmed the execution to demonstrate the greater <UNK> of <UNK> as opposed to <UNK> you can't help but wonder if the scientist in him was a little too <UNK> and cold any number of peter <UNK> mad scientists would be proud the rest of us should be ashamed and <UNK>
<START> this movie has a decent story in my opinion very good fight scenes but i was a little bit disappointed by the end of the movie i think that it was a way better if <UNK> knew karate also or if she knew to use some weapons her character has become more interesting too and she was a decent <UNK> to <UNK> i think when the director filmed the final between <UNK> <UNK> he wanted to finish the movie earlier so he didn't care how the end was going to be all in all i think that fans of <UNK> <UNK> will be very satisfied watching this movie it's not like <UNK> or <UNK> to justice but it was entertainment enough and <UNK> looks awesome in this movie so my rate for this movie is a solid 8 10
<START> distant is a slice of turkish life flick which follows the mundane activities of two adult male cousins one a photographer and the other an unemployed <UNK> there's little doubt that auteur <UNK> is a work in progress with considerable talent however this little foreign <UNK> arty is so full of empty filler and so devoid of story or anything engaging or provocative that it will likely appeal to only the most avid <UNK> of cinema and mainstream audiences should look elsewhere i personally grew quickly bored with the slow pace of the film and found myself fast <UNK> through the empty spaces and there are many between dialogue plot development and denouement distant is a very nicely done bit of b
<START> this review contains some small yet significant spoilers br br br br i just finished watching my copy of br br and it was great this might sound cheesy but several times during the film i forgot it wasn't real <UNK> the acting is convincing although the acting from <UNK> playing himself i think seems a bit hokey at times <UNK> in takashi <UNK> <UNK> seemed to change levels of believability throughout the movie sometimes she's really good then the next moment she's really cheesy especially at the <UNK> <UNK> and subsequent re possession br br a character that was ridiculous at first was mr a man covered in believing worms are coming to eat everyone he provides unintentional comic relief at the beginning acting like the stereotypical alien <UNK> type victim but near the end has some really creepy scenes br br the plot was very interesting and really kept me wondering how everything tied together there are some things that aren't really explained like a mass suicide in a tokyo park and where the <UNK> boy came from but everything else turned out fine the ending has got to be one of the most unnerving if not the scariest sequences i've ever had the pleasure to witness br br all in all is a very fun way to spend 2 hours and the new hong kong dvd provides great picture and sound most importantly the english subtitles <UNK> free for a great j horror experience i highly recommend picking it up
<START> the <UNK> of satan is a <UNK> combination of conventional horror elements mixed with some imaginative characterization and direction bernard it all starts out with father charles <UNK> as ben driving out west with his pretty <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> and daughter as k t things get <UNK> and <UNK> for the trio as they approach the town of which is being <UNK> by a satanic cult br br when the <UNK> <UNK> hit the action switches to the film's more interesting <UNK> of characters <UNK> l q jones as pete the sheriff martin as doc charles robinson as jack the priest and moore as <UNK> their interplay is sometimes fun soon enough it all gets very silly and predictable mr martin is the stand out as you might expect he considers the possibility of a satanic cult to be a <UNK> and bull story but is of course their leader the come in children ending is puzzling unless perhaps it was the film's original title
<START> taylor wanted to make this movie for 15 years and finally found jamie foxx to play the title role foxx is amazing in his portrayal of ray charles from an interview i saw with foxx he met charles several times and the two of them also played piano together foxx had piano lessons as a young child and actually played piano in all his scenes i didn't see charles live until his later years so it was great to get a perspective on how his career developed i hope foxx gets nominated for the best actor oscar as he certainly deserves it the music also is incredible it really showcases the <UNK> of <UNK> music from country to blues and everything in between the movie also gives an <UNK> account of ray <UNK> life from the many women he had relationships with to his drug habit and the consequences of that
<START> i just finished watching this movie and am disappointed to say that i didn't enjoy it a bit it is so slow slow and uninteresting this kid from harry potter plays a shy teenager with an rude mother and then one day the rude mother tells the kid to find a job so that they could <UNK> an old guy apparently having no place to live has started to live with his family and therefore the kid goes to work for a old lady and this old lady who is living all alone teaches him about girls driving car and life i couldn't get how an 18 year old guy enjoy spending time with an awful lady in her 80s sorry if my comments on this movie has bothered people who might have enjoyed it i could be wrong as i am not british and may not understand the social and their family structure and way of life mostly the movie is made for the british audience
<START> i mean you just have to love the italian film industry someone came up with a post <UNK> action movie road warrior and the italians were busy for years doing one rip off after another then some other one came up with a successful barbarian movie conan and the italians were busy eh see above br br besides countless other variations of the theme one of my favorites is <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> starring the paul twins the <UNK> series was created and this the second one is probably the worst or best depending on your point of view br br <UNK> is called back into action by his old teacher who has discovered some kind of nuclear power that of course has to be <UNK> so it won't get into wrong hands the old man sends his daughter to <UNK> and after a few complications <UNK> his sidekick <UNK> and the girl set back to the castle which meanwhile has fallen to some <UNK> of course an old class mate of <UNK> somewhere along the way the heroic trio forgets about the plot and <UNK> some giant snake <UNK> cult for the fun of it not before some <UNK> are sacrificed just in time before the madman finally loses his temper and kills the wise teacher our heroes remember their duties <UNK> and <UNK> and save the day br br included terrible acting by all participants especially <UNK> incredibly hilarious special effects you just have to adore the snake fight scene which must be sort of a <UNK> to bride of the monster badly staged fight scenes numerous continuity errors <UNK> flies two different during the climatic battle watch for it just an example and an overall non understanding of the concept of history <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> castle <UNK> all thrown in one film br br if you're like me devoted to bad movies this is the one of the series to see you'll probably end up for the records the <UNK> filmed third part is actually quite watchable br br considering joe <UNK> other efforts this is probably his most entertaining movie as he certainly has failed to deliver watchable horror or erotic movies but i strongly have the opinion that this was completely by accident br br
<START> ok first of all who in their right mind would remake hitchcock and second who would do it shot for shot i admit i had no intention of ever watching this movie for that very reason the original psycho is one of my favorite films ever and this just seemed like a <UNK> of it i did watch it because my girlfriend wanted to compare it to the original and we both agreed less than five minutes into this crap that it was awful first as mentioned they did it shot for shot where's originality why remake a movie that is almost perfect exactly the way it was done the first time why remake such a movie to begin with if you are going to remake something remake something that doesn't work and make it better br br second they used the exact same script from the 1960 version the dialog no longer works it works fine and sounds perfect for the 1960 version but seems odd and stilted coming out of modern actors why not update the dialog <UNK> didn't write the script you could have <UNK> br br this film had some very good talent and they were wasted by imitation of the original actors the actor who played the car salesman seemed like he was just playing john <UNK> performance as the car salesman in the original all the actors seemed like the only direction they were given was be the characters from the original movie vince vaughn may have seemed a little <UNK> than anthony <UNK> but in doing so you loose the sympathy you are supposed to have for norman having norman <UNK> while watching marion <UNK> was going too far and lost the innocence of the character that i think tony <UNK> captured so well in his performance viggo <UNK> accent was annoying and rita wilson was far too old to play caroline her lines came off as someone desperate rather than just young and fun like patricia hitchcock's performance br br the only good thing i saw about the film was that gus van <UNK> was able to open the movie with the shot <UNK> had <UNK> <UNK> wanted to open with 1 long shot going over phoenix but couldn't at the time so he had to settle for a series of shots cross <UNK> together this film <UNK> that vision with a helicopter shot going into the window of the hotel after that though the film became a worthless waste of celluloid br br if you are curious about how to destroy a wonderful film watch this but do not under any circumstances watch this before you watch the original this is a faded of the original and should never have been green lit stick to the <UNK> film not the imitation
<START> i <UNK> by stating i am a big fan of and not one of patrick therefore i watched this to see her performance and of course it was excellent i do not feel the director was adequate for the film as several very bad choices were made re shot angles <UNK> etc if the director was trying to give it a realistic feel they failed and lost some good performances because of it nearly always felt that the camera was way too static too far from intense facial reactions and so many times when the action <UNK> on the <UNK> of lead characters the dialog was slow and plodding this easily could have been resolved by <UNK> or changes of camera angle but the impression i got was that the budget was too small and only one camera was used i also got the impression that perhaps scenes were shot multiple times and the energy coming from the actors was used up
<START> saw this film at the in london where it was showing as part of the <UNK> john huston season i wasn't really sure what to expect and the first few minutes of the film gave very little away in fact the rest of the film continued to give little away no real plot no action no suspense very little drama and except for a short section at the very end no scenery br br the result of lack of all of these features was however a wonderful film i don't fully understand why but i think that its understated nature made the film almost completely perfect the acting script and most important of all the casting were all spot on and i can't remember walking away from a cinema feeling so good but i still can't work out why i just know that i will be getting the dvd this is one of those films that will i am sure be just as good on the small screen as the cinema experience provided that you can find somewhere quiet to watch it and i will be watching it again soon i will be also interested to find out what my family and friends think of it i'm sure that it will not be everybody's choice but i am convinced that a large number will agree with my view br br 9 out of 10
<START> this is by far the worst version of william shakespeare's tragic masterpiece i have ever seen it seems the filmmakers didn't actually read shakespeare's text no they just took what they wanted from the olivier movie the plot is out of order and <UNK> down to its bare necessity yet there is time for the non <UNK> olivier created incest hint between hamlet and queen <UNK> could we have had the something rotten in the state of <UNK> bit instead casting is another issue i understand that the far superior branagh movie had its weak bits robin williams and charlton heston come to mind but this one has very few good moments i do like <UNK> and <UNK> but the rest of the cast is stale mel <UNK> creepy <UNK> is irritating and one often wonders if he has any idea what he is saying many of the actors seem to have just <UNK> the part they know less about what is being said than <UNK> in high school br br if you want a version of hamlet check out kenneth branagh's or even olivier to be frank even disney's hamlet is better
<START> the kid at <UNK> years old <UNK> has a life that most men would envy he has a great job is respected and feared has a beautiful house and makes <UNK> of money but everything comes at a cost in this case no social life no conscience and a fear of spending the rest of his life alone he just needs someone to show him the way br br as i watched the movie i kept wondering why disney didn't pass this film on to <UNK> not because it's particularly daring or edgy but because it is clearly a movie for adults this is <UNK> by the marketing campaign which is clearly <UNK> children it is <UNK> in with trailers for <UNK> the movie and pokemon 2000 aren't they <UNK> yet but i <UNK> br br i was impressed by the sensitive treatment of the subject matter rather than the typical male <UNK> crisis that involves some pathetic <UNK> buying a <UNK> <UNK> and acting like a moron <UNK> character <UNK> some serious <UNK> and takes stock of his life his guide on this journey of self discovery is himself at age 8 they never explain how rusty arrives and frankly i didn't care young innocence and <UNK> optimism give him a distinct advantage in the truth he sums up <UNK> job as an image <UNK> <UNK> you teach people how to lie and pretend to be something they aren't in order for a good script to succeed however you need actors to bring it to life not a problem here br br although willis has <UNK> ignored w c <UNK> <UNK> about starring with children or animals he has <UNK> out once again <UNK> as well <UNK> with <UNK> as he did dramatically with <UNK> willis manages to balance <UNK> <UNK> traits with vulnerability and confusion without becoming ridiculous <UNK> meanwhile gives a dead on portrayal of a kid from everyone's childhood the one that always stuck out for some reason and got picked on we also get two bonus performances lily <UNK> is great as <UNK> <UNK> assistant and jean smart is perfect as an insightful charming <UNK> i loved her in <UNK> br br the kid is charming heavy and real and it will appeal to adults of all ages
<START> i got this movie in a bargain bin hoping for an <UNK> bad flick boy was i disappointed except for <UNK> you see the movie is indeed horrible but so horrible it isn't even laughable the plot oh wait there is no plot i suppose you could say it's about the main character rising up in the ranks of street fighting at the end of the movie the directors decided to either not make any more sense or more likely died and had a monkey finish directing the movie don't read if you don't want the ending spoiled although the ending doesn't really spoil anything the main character somehow ends up in a room filled with mirrors a la enter the dragon and then gets real angry has stupid flashback and hits a mirror the end br br the only redeeming factor of this movie was scene he's talking to the rival street fighting boss and says something along these lines completely deadpan do not worry about him anymore sir i have killed him in a sophisticated manner i him i <UNK> we went to a disco we was a lot of fun and then i killed him at which point the boss says good work <UNK> you're number 1 and <UNK> says number 1 the scene continues with <UNK> continuing to say over and over the next scene is of a dead <UNK> floating in a pool intelligent i think not br br lastly i own the <UNK> version of this movie meaning the title on the box i own is <UNK> it shows a huge guy holding a giant gun and screaming this never happens in the movie this man is never in the movie high quality br br note i am new to this reviewing but hell yes i am going to keep it up
<START> i remember this bomb coming out in the early 80's at first it sounded like a great idea a retelling of an american classic with the help of modern movie techniques of the day there was a bit a of a back <UNK> over the treatment of the original lone ranger <UNK> moore the movie studio had threatened legal action if moore continued portraying him self as the real lone ranger moore was performing at children's <UNK> as the lone ranger for sick kids to many americans <UNK> moore was just that the the one and only lone ranger i had always felt that the studio could have done justice to both the fans and legacy of the lone ranger if moore had been treated better maybe even a cameo in the new movie how ever this was not the case and many of the viewing public stayed away in <UNK> also the story and acting were weak all this added up to a big box office bomb and rightly so i personally i'm glad the studio lost big money after the way the real lone ranger was treated you don't treat an american icon that way
<START> a great animation movie that really gets up to the level of <UNK> like the lion king br br i went to see this with one of my best <UNK> friends who also watched the series on tv i was lucky because i didn't know people in <UNK> were aware of wallace and <UNK> br br when it started and that good old theme started it started to bring back memories of me watching it when i was 5 br br the humor itself was very funny some nice sitcom style scenes some <UNK> or just plain jokes the animation isn't as impressive if you have know the series but it is still fun to watch is you realize how it gets done br br my conclusion not only can it keep my happy and entertained some of the humor can easily appeal to older people so i say go and watch curse of the were rabbit as soon as you can
<START> one of the many silent comedies stan laurel featured in before he teamed with oliver hardy and is a ho hum <UNK> the story is badly disjointed though this could be because of the modern day edit and the humor itself is not at all inventive br br potential <UNK> are started and ignored for instance <UNK> promise to make <UNK> de sole pay for what she's done to him never comes to <UNK> <UNK> character doesn't seem very centered either but this is a common criticism of his work before he developed of laurel hardy fame so it might be that i was just expecting to see this <UNK> br br i strongly believe that all the silent films should be <UNK> and viewed and i'm glad this one is still available it's just not a great film
<START> i watch this movie at the start of every summer and it never <UNK> to <UNK> me here the jokes are packed in near every line of dialogue giving you more bang than the average simpsons episode some of the jokes fall flat or will only <UNK> a slight chuckle but others will leave you rolling and then there are those that stick in your brain the audience is now deaf br br the video knows it's a video and makes no <UNK> about being anything else it's easy to sit back and let the <UNK> of humor begin a good mix of slapstick pop culture and tongue in cheek comedy <UNK> there's something for everybody i was in sixth grade when i first saw this video and i have to admit i still find it as hilarious now that i've started college br br this is a good movie to watch over the summer much in the way you might watch it's a wonderful life at christmas or ten <UNK> at <UNK> more than that it's just funny as hell
<START> i have yet to watch 1979 that <UNK> cheesy italian take on star wars 1977 but it can't be much worse than this <UNK> piece of junk which suffice it to say makes mel <UNK> so so <UNK> 1987 look like a <UNK> work of art in fact the main reason why <UNK> is remembered at all nowadays is because of the tragic fate which <UNK> its leading lady playboy <UNK> dorothy <UNK> who was killed by her insanely jealous estranged husband before the film had even had its official premiere br br although who subsequently had two <UNK> made about her <UNK> she was portrayed by jamie lee curtis and <UNK> <UNK> plays the title role for the first half of the film she is reduced to being <UNK> up in a chair ostensibly driving a spaceship on a 27 year journey to some planet or other in fact <UNK> is an all purpose <UNK> who also serves the wacky crew their <UNK> gets them all hot under the collar and even goes <UNK> for the blue star cue <UNK> music once they land having said that certainly looks <UNK> in her white <UNK> and even if her role hardly demands much <UNK> of any acting talent she might possess it's not exactly <UNK> either br br still it's ironic that for a film which bears her name she is overshadowed by the campy and would be zany antics of her fellow crew members especially the annoying captain <UNK> butt which gives you the idea of the level of comedy on display here a long <UNK> wing sporting colored guy a pot smoking <UNK> <UNK> old and best of all relatively speaking a foul mouthed rock eating hairy alien creature they hold prisoner the villain of the piece is a metal clad non <UNK> who does however have the best laugh in the film when upon hearing the <UNK> music following his every mention of the blue star <UNK> what is this s t there is little point in listing the sci fi classics which are <UNK> by this stinker in its ludicrous attempts at <UNK> the genre since they are not only lame but obvious incredibly enough a chest <UNK> but ultimately <UNK> alien is apparently played by <UNK> hollywood veteran <UNK> <UNK> br br for what it's worth then the scenes shot on the planet they visit which looks more like a western set than a <UNK> landscape have a <UNK> sun like <UNK> and its inhabitants are <UNK> on their menu include skin and <UNK> <UNK> on the rocks <UNK> <UNK> baked <UNK> etc not to mention a motorcycle gang who serve their own particular <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> and when our heroes escape on the back of it they dare not shoot at them for fear of hitting their lord god awful indeed
<START> is a <UNK> and <UNK> young with a <UNK> who out a living selling cheap books from a <UNK> in an <UNK> market he wouldn't appear to have anything in common with the middle aged would be intellectual zhang and yet the two of them wind up in a restaurant together discussing the <UNK> and of murder the chinese title would perhaps be better translated as it <UNK> if that makes it sound kind of pedestrian don't be <UNK> this film is <UNK> inventive in its plot and mostly races along at <UNK> speed although the pace does flag quite badly towards the end br br if you only know zhang <UNK> worthy historical dramas like raise the red <UNK> and shanghai <UNK> or his more recent martial arts epics hero and house of flying <UNK> you'll be amazed in fact <UNK> of his other films you've seen you'll be surprised pleasantly surprised this is far and away his most original most quirky most experimental work it was shot within a couple of weeks on a minimal budget almost entirely on location in <UNK> and making use of many ordinary in the smaller supporting roles there's even a fleeting cameo by the director himself and mostly with a hand held camera in a jerky hyper <UNK> style which is a million miles from the elegant <UNK> of his best known films br br ok i live in <UNK> so i find an additional delight in all the bizarre little details of everyday life that i am coming to <UNK> and <UNK> even though it was shot in <UNK> and things are changing so rapidly here but i really think this film can be appreciated by anyone i saw it as i have so many other chinese <UNK> at a movie club that screens sub titled versions of recent chinese films for an almost exclusively audience and it is the only one i can recall where the audience was laughing out loud some non chinese audiences might find it a little too strange a little uncomfortable at times in that it does include some violence and after opening as a <UNK> offbeat romantic comedy <UNK> into something much darker in its second half it is however very very funny br br it's also superbly acted by the two leads especially long time zhang <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who is probably <UNK> <UNK> foremost film star and has a brooding screen presence reminiscent of a young depardieu or de niro br br watch this film for proof that the chinese have a sense of humour that can translate to other cultures for proof that zhang <UNK> is far far more than a one trick <UNK> and for a thoroughly good time
<START> when oh when will <UNK> write a decent movie based around computers i cannot believe people actually consider this movie to be a credible story br br no computer operating system could ever survive wit that sort of annoying <UNK> <UNK> it may look good on a movie screen but if you actually tried using it for any length of time you would go nuts br br as for <UNK> people the way she did it simply cannot be done that way network security alone would prevent that from happening the key stroke <UNK> was laughable to say the least br br regarding the <UNK> that was supposedly being <UNK> no system <UNK> would allow such a critical piece of <UNK> to be <UNK> on a production system until it has been tested and tested again on a <UNK> system br br but probably the worst possible part of the movie was the virus there is no way that a virus that works on one operating system will work on any other system and as for a virus that could take out a <UNK> is a couple of seconds that just <UNK> belief there is no way that an open remote connection would have the required access that would allow <UNK> of system files br br i could go on but i can't be bothered br br a porno has a better thought out plot that this pile of garbage
<START> a gang of <UNK> lead by the <UNK> rugged ruthless a perfectly <UNK> performance by gilbert <UNK> steals 300 000 worth of gold <UNK> during a daring train robbery but <UNK> member an amusing turn by jose <UNK> makes off with the <UNK> and hides them unfortunately gets killed before he can tell where he <UNK> the <UNK> so has to join forces with cunning cocky enigmatic bounty hunter the stranger smoothly played by the handsome george hilton and <UNK> corrupt <UNK> <UNK> a delightfully <UNK> portrayal by 50's teen idol eddie burns to find the <UNK> <UNK> directed by <UNK> g <UNK> with a clever complex and twist laden script by <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> a <UNK> amoral and <UNK> tone everyone keeps double and triple crossing each other with happily greedy abandon a <UNK> <UNK> spirited score by <UNK> and <UNK> de <UNK> plenty of stirring shoot outs and rousing <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> sly sense of self mocking humor a steady pace and a real <UNK> of a surprise ending this <UNK> and often hilarious feature makes for an inspired send up of sergio <UNK> the good the bad and the ugly popping up in nifty secondary parts are the <UNK> <UNK> as fiery gal pal <UNK> as a hard <UNK> army captain and gerard as <UNK> <UNK> lawrence <UNK> an immensely amusing and enjoyable romp
<START> now any fan will <UNK> the ingredients big <UNK> topless babes bad fashions and some talk in this case add in a lead who can't act a plot that makes little sense editing by someone with no hands who has been <UNK> and the most god awful fight scenes and you have <UNK> not quite bad enough to be good but not good enough to be bad this is a wonderful mess from start to finish i especially loved the endless continuity errors and the <UNK> white stunt double br br this is so '70s bad far eastern martial arts meets black power that it hurts but boy it hurts so good i am ashamed to admit that i almost enjoyed it
<START> this is perhaps the most ridiculous crap i have ever watched three <UNK> stories about completely stupid and random things are occasionally interrupted by a bus and a boring monologue about relationships by a stupid man christ knows why so many people got involved in this highlights green <UNK> man reading jean paul <UNK> the <UNK> mans dinner guest and her horse <UNK> hair products a ridiculously <UNK> woman in the third short who suspected a man of foul play just for taking an interest in her generic activities <UNK> br br i need to use up a few more lines apparently so may as well mention some more stupid things about the film the first film involves a man driving a talking car around and <UNK> its <UNK> demands for absolutely no apparent reason the only way you would watch this film is if you were blind and had other <UNK> <UNK> in your personality and brain it is kind of funny in an ironic way but also extremely <UNK> like being forced to chew for a very long time on a <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i am a shakespeare lover since childhood i am also a jew <UNK> of <UNK> is anti <UNK> through and through no matter how hard <UNK> and literature lovers try to re interpret it br br in the play <UNK> is portrayed as demonic and cold hearted and has no forgiveness no warmth no love except for money and cruel revenge whereas the christians are kind moral people his motives in the play <UNK> around money he plots revenge from the start based on damage caused to his business as well as blind racial hate not noble ideals or hurt racial pride as this movie wants you to believe and this characterization is given to him by shakespeare himself not by the other characters as final proof the happy ending is where the jew loses his money and is forced to <UNK> to christianity br br i acknowledge this and move on it is part of history and i enjoy <UNK> despite this fact therefore i expect a movie based on this play to play it straight i would much rather see the work adapted for its rich language and storytelling without any <UNK> br br but many of the the <UNK> <UNK> subtleties and playful characters are lost in this movie for example in the last scene where the men discover undercover work as a man who also took away their rings instead of the playful game of words and <UNK> as the truth reveals itself it becomes a mean spirited game where two bitchy women play <UNK> with their soon to be husbands br br so instead we are only left with lovely detailed sets <UNK> of the rich language with poor <UNK> poor casting one intense courtroom scene and a controversy br br the truth is i think it would be much easier to identify the anti <UNK> in the story and move on if it were left as is despite all the <UNK> the makers of this movie pulled out of their hats there is plenty of hatred left only now people can make excuses and pretend the portrayal of jews isn't so bad anymore br br and finally another problem is with most of the actors being miscast pacino is way out of his league and is very uncomfortable with the language not to mention the horribly fake accent <UNK> as is <UNK> and awkward with the language <UNK> is <UNK> as always but doesn't do much with his role is somewhat ok but unlikeable and covered in bad makeup just like the movie
<START> this is truly one of the most awful movies of all time it's dull <UNK> badly acted and teeth pretentious br br i watched for about an hour waiting for some kind of drama to unfold before <UNK> there wasn't any the shot on a shoe string budget was particularly painful these have to be the worst day for night shots since plan nine from outer space br br the only barely redeeming feature is the ludicrous <UNK> wandering around the countryside with a plastic cat basket how scary is that and i did like the used as extras i suppose they are least cheap though it did seem a bit obvious that they had been <UNK> into camera by the careful placement of some <UNK> br br this film is so dreadful it should have a public health warning there was a <UNK> at my local video store when i took it back of people demanding their money back i kid you not
<START> i will never ever forget watching this show around the age of 13 even at the young age i remember thinking this is a <UNK> rip off show without the one thing that makes <UNK> tolerable the girls in bathing suits nonetheless i was too small in those days to be the <UNK> of the remote in my house the high point of pacific blue was an episode in which a couple of out gangsters are coming to <UNK> someone with <UNK> guns on <UNK> as a thirteen year old i never laughed so hard at something that was supposed to be taken seriously even i knew that the task of going out and <UNK> for murder is a task that should never come before <UNK> <UNK> car for the day that had been the defining moment of this show simple crimes and situations <UNK> made by hack writing so they could be taken care of by the <UNK> hero of the crime fighting world the bike cop does not get much dumber

<START> it looks like people involved with this movie are <UNK> the <UNK> box to boost its ratings the good news that apparently only 18 people have seen it i suppose that makes me the 19th i have no involvement with the flick and don't know anyone who did and i'm a long time imdb user check my vote record and reviews over the past seven years so i promise i'm giving an honest and <UNK> opinion it's coming to you from a 30 year horror fan who has also appeared in a couple of low budget flicks himself br br aside from a couple of interesting video effects bloody nightmare is incoherent boring and technically flawed beyond all reason it was apparently shot on silent stock and the audio then dubbed in most of it sounds like it was recorded with a tin can and a piece of string anyhow more than three quarters of the dialog is <UNK> br br i watched this from beginning to end and have no idea of what the story was or even if there was one it seems like the director is mostly <UNK> himself with long <UNK> shots of the <UNK> of table and dead black spaces that do nothing but pad the film out that would be a problem if one were actually developing a plot and making a film that had some sense of pacing in this case though the rule doesn't apply it doesn't matter how scenes are shot because they don't add up to a story br br watching this video is an exercise in <UNK> at every level whatever people who worked on it are writing and however they're trying to influence the ratings here on imdb this is just bad tedious stuff br br that's the honest truth if you're thinking of spending your money or time on this one think again it's easy to find something better because you won't find much worse br br and that's the <UNK> <UNK> truth
<START> this movie was awful especially considering the work that must have gone into its production though it's not as bad as <UNK> 'em it is quite awful take into account the obvious rip offs from gladiator and <UNK> of the lost <UNK> and what do you get this <UNK> of awful make up and wooden acting br br the movie starts as most zombie movies nowadays do a montage of interesting jump cuts and a radio broadcast of the <UNK> at hand we see our hero quite possibly the worst <UNK> <UNK> in modern era counted about four or five times where he either <UNK> his head with the barrel of his pistol or looked down the barrel while blowing cutting off fingers of zombies we later learn that these fingers are <UNK> for br br well seems to be a rebel in his ways of <UNK> of zombies going so far as to purchase <UNK> gasp from his french buddy hans who isn't really french speaks with an odd middle eastern accent as uses the <UNK> to collect a <UNK> bounty from lost hills all hell breaks loose br br and cue the awfulness of the movie the zombies are put together quite poorly i've seen comments <UNK> their make up but it was quite amateur in my opinion obvious halloween were used to make the <UNK> faces and there were points at which one girl looked as if she were <UNK> a clown mask instead of a <UNK> <UNK> face <UNK> <UNK> br br to sum the next sixty minutes up in a few lines is back stabbed by hans who made a deal with some other zombie hunters <UNK> being the <UNK> gives him a second chance gets back stabbed again by hans then shoots hans and gets to union city where he finds <UNK> is <UNK> the cities for profit br br that's it really in regards to plot when reaches union city all the baddies are gathered around in a house that evidently is so massive it takes hours to reach the top floor people die lives and the movie ends with one of those cynical is he going to kill himself scenes br br end spoilers i'm going to have to blame most of this mess on <UNK> the direction was awful every character featured a <UNK> other than hans who was easily the best <UNK> in this group of <UNK> rejects when they reach union city a <UNK> of zombies attacks the crew and the zombies were obviously given no <UNK> or ideas about how to walk as if your <UNK> were rotten one woman is <UNK> as if she's swimming in mid air on a sunday <UNK> br br some movies are awful this movie is one of them simply on the grounds of how logic seemed to be abandoned in order to keep a story flowing works occasionally but in this regard where the story was already in <UNK> it doesn't br br avoid it unless you want a decent laugh
<START> head is one of those films you'll have a lot of trouble convincing your friends to see but once they do they'll fall in love with it i don't know how many times this has happened to me this film is just so funny and bizarre really a <UNK> of everything the <UNK> had been up to this point in their career a lot the credit goes to bob who pretty much ended the career with this film my guess is he wanted to get out of directing the tv show and get into features which he did in a big way after this one <UNK> <UNK> is absolutely hilarious i can't believe he didn't have a second life as a comic actor after this film this film has a lot of great cameos and a lot of wonderful psychedelic nonsense i feel like the reputation of this film is continuing to build and it wouldn't surprise me if it eventually becomes a full on cult classic
<START> this is a truly hilarious film and one that i have seen many times drew barrymore is brilliant as <UNK> <UNK> as is david arquette as her brother you cringe with embarrassment at the thought of her returning to high school as the film is a reminder of what high school was really like her outfits are wacky and weird and it brings back memories of those who dressed a bit differently the gorgeous michael <UNK> was adorable as the teacher wish there had been teachers like that when i was at high school and boss is fantastic this is a film you could watch again and again with a fabulous sound track one for all those at school in the 90's to watch
<START> i've been wanting to see this movie for a very long time i eventually just bought it on e bay since it's so hard to find state side but the wait was somewhat worth it br br i can't say the movie was great and i can't say that the movie was hilarious but it was good and it has some pretty funny points that aside the shots in this movie are just beautiful and the entire cast especially brenda <UNK> someone i hadn't seen before sadly were excellent br br in the end this is a feel good romantic comedy and i recommend checking it out unless you've just had a death in the family br br if anything the final chapter is highly worth the money
<START> dead gentlemen productions has put together a film with amazing production values considering their budget anyone that has ever played any role playing game particularly any fantasy <UNK> they play <UNK> and dragons in the movie will love this movie brilliant performances all around especially with regards to the <UNK> nature of the principles playing their players and their characters anyone who has ever filmed or acted in a student film will appreciate the amount of work and love they put into this project this movie and its prequel is to fantasy movies and role playing games what blazing <UNK> is to westerns parody of the highest order i only have a couple minor complaints about the movie itself none of which will prevent me from buying the dvd as soon as it's available only 6 more weeks i'm counting the days br br 1 when <UNK> is talking to joanna about joining the <UNK> group he hands her a copy of the <UNK> and dragons players <UNK> and says this will tell you everything you need to know the camera <UNK> too long on a shot of the book and the moment really seemed like a commercial br br 2 the jokes are hilarious but they seem <UNK> spread throughout the movie the last third of the movie after the almost continuous <UNK> of visual and verbal humor <UNK> it slows down a bit as if the narrative was catching up with the jokes odd but blazing <UNK> always struck me that way as well and i love that movie too br br one of the narrative strengths of the story is the <UNK> nature of the romantic subplot will joanna become the <UNK> girlfriend will she go back to <UNK> or will the three maintain a <UNK> friendship <UNK> by the <UNK> of role playing yes that sounds sappy but there are a couple of <UNK> moments particularly when <UNK> and <UNK> make up at the end but the movie <UNK> one week in terms of human relationships those questions could not be answered in a week the fact that the characters' relationships are left <UNK> strikes me as better than the more classical choices you see in most movies like the girl gets her prince and they move into the castle or the prince sinks into the north atlantic after three trite tedious and predictable hours the writers really seem to have a grasp of the psychology of the characters and you can see the characters both the <UNK> and the <UNK> characters change over the course of the movie but not suddenly and not unbelievably br br i would love to hear more wisdom from brother silence the man who stands out in darkness is <UNK>

<START> this movie comes down like a square <UNK> in a square hole a poorly made <UNK> a <UNK> so cheap it couldn't even be produced in a <UNK> line in <UNK> mexico in fact when you try to press the <UNK> into the hole for which it is obviously designed it <UNK> into <UNK> disgusting pieces that smell like rotting fruit and won't wash off is such a <UNK> br br this movie is so mind <UNK> awful it couldn't have even been created a movie like this must have been the result of some accident of nature some <UNK> <UNK> that in the corner of a <UNK> office somewhere and and grew until it was too big and terrifying to look at only science would be interested in such a thing anyone not bent on studying it would <UNK> it from this world br br what it comes down to is this if you're the kind to enjoy first year <UNK> <UNK> racism or coke zero it might just be your birthday
<START> hi br br blade is an sensational action movie the hero wesley snipes and the villain have done justice to their roles br br the movie's action sequences are better then matrix br br wesley snipes is one the best action heroes ever br br if u like action vampire movies this is the one br br the theme is pretty good considering the fact that so many vampire movies have been made before but these is the best of them br br enjoy the ride
<START> i'd never thought that i would be caught saying this but i think dog the bounty hunter is more entertaining than this 90's era cop drama walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of high <UNK> cop shows such as <UNK> <UNK> miami and so forth i'm not saying all these shows are bad but they aren't good either i like the karate chop action that walker <UNK> on the enemies of justice and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the <UNK> series but there are some elements that i hate in a show like this stereotypes that's right stereotypes unfortunately this is a show for the of red state america who refuse to part with the old prejudices of <UNK> especially when it comes to crime for example there was an episode in which a kid with psychic powers <UNK> into dallas where he encounters group of kids in <UNK> punk clothing and they start <UNK> him now this is exactly what middle america <UNK> the <UNK> punk culture i mean come on how often do people that dress like that rob and steal from people just <UNK> there own business whenever there are blacks and <UNK> in the plot it's always about gangs in some <UNK> neighborhood okay not everyone who's a minority is a desperate <UNK> of a gang surrounded by crime drugs poverty again this is what middle red state america sees of these people finally why is the the bumbling sidekick can't you make the sidekick an equal ass <UNK>
<START> my college theater just had a special screening last night of this film i have got to say that i think everyone was impressed with how good this movie was though my roommate didn't care for it but he's not into horror movies anyway and just went to see if paris hilton can act by the way if you're worried about that don't be i'm not exactly one of her fans but i must be honest and say she was pretty good and she has the best death scene overall all the actor's were very good i'm not gonna go into detail for the plot since i'm sure you know about it the characters are pretty engaging and you actually care for them especially elisha <UNK> and <UNK> michael <UNK> characters we meet them as rival siblings and end with them having to work together another plus is that it does not have the <UNK> look of <UNK> horror or texas chainsaw massacre and feels almost documentary like rather than a music video don't get me wrong i loved texas chainsaw and enjoyed <UNK> br br now for the death scenes in most slasher movies whenever a character is stabbed or killed the scene immediately cuts away to another scene but not in this one when a character is about to die they die pretty <UNK> but the filmmakers don't stop there and add a little something extra each time for each victim i won't say anything about the death scenes and will let you see them for yourself br br while this is a great slasher movies it does have the flaws of almost all slasher films exploring a creepy house when you shouldn't be getting a ride with a suspicious character splitting up and screaming so the killer can hear you also there is a kinda stupid plot twist that was unnecessary and didn't add to the film at all you could tell it was just added in at the last moment and if you took it out it would not have affected the movie at all br br basically if you are a horror film fan see this movie you will not be disappointed it's got all that's needed to make it a great slasher film possibly the best of the year even though it's kinda early the suspense is felt and it is at times a funny movie if you hate horror films chances are you may like this one and if you are divided i encourage you to give it a shot
<START> awful more can i say i remember seeing it in the cinema see how it sticks painfully in the memory as a 16 <UNK> old <UNK> mark <UNK> was the older generations skywalker and wasn't great at that he was worse in this plus a <UNK> soundtrack by then <UNK> there is one film equally as bad as this i saw in the cinema arthur 2 on the rocks funny how that question what is the worst film you have ever seen is is easier than what is the best film which incidentally <UNK> between the italian job original <UNK> casino things to do in denver <UNK> getting a sense of what i like this will fool you finding <UNK> pirates of the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> please never watch this film or it will stick in your memory too

<START> i am a longtime fan of the original of this movie <UNK> martha mostly martha and everything that makes that movie great and enjoyable to watch is missing from this one i miss the slow pace the build up of characters and their style in small gestures the <UNK> of lights and <UNK> and moves over dialog i don't think that the story itself is enough martha kate is more secluded and mario nick is not a clown in most of the cases the things that makes one scene great in the original its is not working in its copy here the small <UNK> take away the tension my opinion is that you should go and see the original it'll worth the <UNK> of subtitles
<START> if you have ever been has a friend or a kid that is or was into <UNK> at one time then watch this flick i have seen it several times and i get something new out of it every time that i see it it reminded me of why i got into <UNK> in the first place a long time ago it reminded me of what <UNK> brings to a person and i have found will also help a person who doesn't understand why <UNK> well <UNK> sure there is a very dark side to the whole seen which the movie does touch on slightly but it tends to focus more on what is at the core of <UNK> just a person on a board doing it because they love to do it this movie was so inspirational to me that i'm now <UNK> once again i'm <UNK> and i haven't been this happy with my self in give this one a go you will not be disappointed
<START> the swedish filmmaker roy latest film you the living is not easy to review one of the reasons is that in his own words he has broken with the <UNK> <UNK> tradition of story telling in all essence the <UNK> of most western film productions another reason might be that although roy is somewhat heavy on <UNK> his unlike those of say <UNK> <UNK> are of a more <UNK> nature it took him 3 years to complete this <UNK> minute long film and it wasn't because he was forced to have long breaks between shootings due to financial troubles or problems with the actors the film consists of <UNK> vignettes shot mostly by a still camera and it was the careful design of each of these scenes which required much time the imagery of this film which is closely related to the director's previous film songs from the second floor is of <UNK> importance to the story thus this story is told to a great degree by the surroundings and the environment in which the characters of universe <UNK> and interact before each scene was finally shot there would have been no less than 10 different test shootings with different actors colors dialog etc the result is a <UNK> version of the surrounding world which most of us would recognize and if the setting is like a dream why not dream a little just like in <UNK> the <UNK> charm of the <UNK> when somebody says last night i had a dream you get to watch it but then again what is perceived as reality here is not very much different from the dreams br br despite the fact that the film lacks a plot in the traditional sense of the word and there are no main characters as such the different characters who appear and <UNK> in different scenes still meet each other and their stories are inevitably <UNK> what most of these characters have in common is their apparent loneliness despite being surrounded by other people the trailer trash chain smoking and <UNK> drinking woman who dreams of having a <UNK> so that she can get away from all this crap her <UNK> and mostly silent boyfriend and his <UNK> and seemingly gentle but rather absent minded mother members of a <UNK> band whose skill <UNK> efforts at home aren't getting a <UNK> reception neither from their families nor their neighbors the depressed middle eastern <UNK> and his arrogant <UNK> on his way to a very important business meeting an elderly man having a nightmare about <UNK> in the <UNK> a young girl dreaming about marrying the young rock star that she is so <UNK> in love with it's all about dreams and nightmares versus reality but it works as much as a statement in support of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> claims that all human communication is <UNK> people speak to each other but it is as if they speak past each other they try to reach out to the others but shut the others out when those try to reach them br br you the living is a poetic film set physically in <UNK> but yet universally <UNK> the society it portrays is sweden its artistic language and the people displayed are generally <UNK> <UNK> yet the subject it deals with namely the misery of the <UNK> in a selfish world reaches far beyond this <UNK> despite the seriousness of its theme the film itself seems a lot more cheerful and laden with humor than one might have expected but in the words of the director himself living is so complicated to each one of us that the only thing that saves us is our sense of humor hence this film is a tragic comedy or a comic tragedy depending on your <UNK> and not a depressing black reality tour of the human nature it is unusual in its language and structure but if you can think outside the box and enjoy it you will certainly find this film both entertaining and meaningful at the same time it was shown at this year's cannes festival as part of the un certain regard program which offers original and different works outside the competition after the film was shown in the <UNK> <UNK> the 1 000 strong audience gave it a standing <UNK> for several minutes do i need to say more
<START> the <UNK> tells of a <UNK> russian mob family who lives in <UNK> and well frankly this awful attempt at drama isn't worthy of commentary br br jason leigh introduces herself to mr mob guy as being from pacific <UNK> with huge letters in plain sight on her back which say west coast <UNK> eventually the mob guys get suspicious because she was <UNK> in a bedroom duh br br in another scene mr plays russian <UNK> giving a hooker <UNK> to bet whether he'll live or die she has 5 chances out of 6 of keeping the money if she <UNK> live well she <UNK> die double duh later she complains it wasn't fair and wants to play again triple duh br br the list of flaws just goes on and on while this intelligence insulting film stinks and sinks in a <UNK> of lousy music mediocre camera work poor direction boring story etc pass on this loser d br br note the <UNK> dvd which i rented had no english same language subtitles or closed <UNK>

<START> overall the <UNK> army movie is very funny although the humour isn't quite as catchy and <UNK> as in the tv and radio series so where does this leave us the viewers if you've never seen <UNK> army then the movie is a good way of bringing yourself up to speed and getting hooked on the mad world of <UNK> o s the downside is that you might not get it because as i said the humour in the movie is a bit on the <UNK> side br br for <UNK> army buffs the movie holds nothing new as the story is more or less a of the tv series but it's a unique chance of seeing your favourites in high <UNK> as compared to the <UNK> quality of the bbc video <UNK> br br the movie also features what must be the <UNK> <UNK> sequence in the history of the universe i can't make up my mind if that's a positive or a negative though
<START> one of a few movies filmed at high school in <UNK> <UNK> in the late 80's as well as just one of the guys bill and ted's excellent adventure and just perfect which was a <UNK> movie played during the mickey mouse club movie is definitely for kids as the previous comments have it pretty right on br br has gone through an <UNK> in the past couple of years and many of the buildings seen in this film are now gone the field where they are playing catch is <UNK> to the football field one of the few areas still there the internal scenes near the <UNK> i believe were in the old 200 building br br unless it is playing late at night on the disney channel it may be a very hard to find flick how they ever made sequels to this is beyond me
<START> this moody creepy horror flick begins on a castle <UNK> a cliff <UNK> the sea a great setting as a vampire bat flies in and creeps toward a sleeping doctor <UNK> stevens the bat changes into a man known as baron in reality count dracula john carradine he seeks dr help to cure him of his <UNK> eventually the good doctor also wants to help his <UNK> nurse assistant jane adams the wolf man <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> monster glenn strange but <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the doctor's blood and he becomes a <UNK> hyde vampire himself this is somewhat better than the prior year's house of frankenstein being less episodic and more exciting visually there's a haunting scene where dracula tries to lure the second nurse martha into his world where she is initially playing <UNK> <UNK> on the piano which soon gives way to terrifying music director uses <UNK> shadows and eerie music to frame many sequences including a wonderful montage sequence that the studio frequently used in their horror features two performers are of note stevens with his wonderful voice is at first sympathetic then convincingly menacing adams her beautiful face in <UNK> contrast to her twisted body <UNK> great pathos and sympathy it all ends in a slam bang climax typical of 1940s universal horror a little abrupt with footage borrowed from the ghost of frankenstein 1942 i hope universal releases it soon on dvd it was left out of their double feature releases
<START> blind spot one of my festival favorites i was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers searching for a mysterious man who has loved and betrayed each of them in different ways the cast is great james franco is particularly amazing as the broken hearted boy from los angeles his <UNK> entries which we hear in voice over narration work well with the visuals and are quite intense the film has a powerful style it pushes elements like the road movie and revenge drama in new directions it also plays with time and perspective in ways that capture the frightening ambiance of lost love there is a <UNK> quality to several sequences and the images are <UNK> with an eerie sense of tension strange suspenseful beautiful to look at definitely worth seeing i really would like to see it again <UNK> i check to see if blind spot has been distributed i can't wait to see the film again in the cinema or on dvd br br <UNK> 13 <UNK> 2005 <UNK> italy
<START> the acting in this film was of the old school corny and stiff irene dunne is <UNK> and comes off the best even though she has some very unnatural lines to say still her ability to convey emotion comes through br br old movie buffs will find at least some redeeming qualities in this film through observation of cinematic technique of the 1930s otherwise it is not really that worthwhile
<START> to some of us director <UNK> lubitsch <UNK> for his underlying and ironic comic touches was rather wet when it came to picking material it isn't that lubitsch is overrated on the contrary he probably was ahead of his time in terms of a visual narrative yet the projects he became attached to or was assigned to are not quite the <UNK> of comedy his fans like to label them with heaven can wait a screen adaptation of bus play birthday lubitsch is <UNK> with sleepy don <UNK> in the lead and the combination of an <UNK> plot a <UNK> star and a <UNK> flashback <UNK> the director a wicked man at the turn of the century falls asleep without realizing it presenting the facts of his life in front of <UNK> entrance <UNK> wicked that was problem number one the promising opening sequence set in the <UNK> <UNK> quickly gives way to dreary <UNK> and the supporting cast is of little help 1 2 from
<START> i jumped for joy to learn this show ended this show's characters were extremely irritating none of them had one singing redeeming quality damon wayans is probably the most one campbell is campbell she's just as annoying as she was in martin br br the kids are all very annoying as well the oldest is an idiot the oldest girl is a stuck up brat and the youngest is frustrating to listen to br br i guess i did like the intelligent little boy but that's about it br br it did the world a favor by ending br br let's pray that a <UNK> never stars in another show ever
<START> the bad news the canadian version of beast in the <UNK> released by <UNK> pictures that i saw was of poor quality dark and washed out it appeared to be dubbed <UNK> from a vhs tape it even <UNK> at one point due to some missing frames br br the good news this movie is so bad that the poor quality of the dvd <UNK> little from my viewing enjoyment this horror movie fails to build tension and lacks scares it is a horror film while most frightening films have limited dialog beast in the <UNK> is a so much so that a character will repeat something we have just heard said by two other characters presumably all the <UNK> chat acts as filler for a very low budget unimaginative movie unfortunately the dialog isn't campy enough to make it worth a watch
<START> that <UNK> br br that <UNK> br br the acts of random violence br br the voice br br the fetish wear br br that <UNK> head br br it can mean only one thing br br grace jones is back br br actually my sources tell me that the title role in blade wasn't played by the 1980s <UNK> but by wesley snipes br br all in all this is not an improvement br br blade is an adaptation of a comic character somehow in the transfer from the simplistic two dimensional world of the <UNK> page it has become even more simplistic and lost a couple of <UNK> br br the plot is hackneyed almost beyond belief and adds nothing to the vampire genre in fact much like <UNK> it seems to suck the life out of the audience in brief <UNK> mobile vampire wants to become more powerful but is opposed by blade half human half vampire all annoying it all <UNK> with blade being put in a vampire juice press some bad martial arts and the most pitiful cgi since 1968 br br blade has to be the least <UNK> character since dolph <UNK> <UNK> also a comic adaptation perhaps there is a trend here surely the audience is meant to be on the same side as the <UNK> and whilst a vampire can be a tragic character this is not true of blade he is relentlessly cruel <UNK> and not a whole lot better than the bad guys br br i assume that wesley snipes has an <UNK> career purely so that everyone else can be compared <UNK> as he <UNK> his way through his movie you find yourself looking for a stake even a pen anything to put blade in the grave br br as a piece of <UNK> blade is pretty much <UNK> we are treated to endless lingering shots of a gym fresh snipes for no reason whatsoever likewise no other actor is allowed any chance to give a reasonable performance the likes of steven <UNK> can act but they have to play second <UNK> to <UNK> tedious performance br br kris kristofferson used to appear in good movies here he is reduced to a sidekick that you just know isn't going to make it through to the final reel and what happens when blade finds out yes you guessed it he rushes to the scene to <UNK> his revenge in the <UNK> giant underground <UNK> br br why can't world <UNK> take place in a quiet country house they always go ahead in underground <UNK> that would have had albert <UNK> wondering if they were a little <UNK> a lot of these plans could be stopped right now if local <UNK> paid more attention to plans for <UNK> sub <UNK> br br the rest of the movie is just as dull and unimaginative with nothing new to add to the genre vampires have been done to <UNK> and perhaps they should be laid to rest for a while at least until someone can think of some way to make them interesting again br br to finish there is a grace jones vampire movie it's called <UNK> and it's about ten times better than this
<START> this is just another one of those american finds romance with charming <UNK> in exotic european locale this genre has been <UNK> <UNK> since the 1950s yet they continue to <UNK> them out i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it if all you want to see is <UNK> try watching stealing beauty with <UNK> tyler a <UNK> better movie br br this types of genre movies are very hallmark <UNK> card ish
<START> if you want to see a brilliant performance of played to perfection with expert timing and <UNK> don't watch this version if you want to see a hammy version with eric <UNK> <UNK> around in 1930's english <UNK> private club society this is the one to watch it's a lot of fun and a good intro to gilbert and sullivan but after this rush out and rent the canadian version you'll see the difference between good and great nobody does g s better than brian <UNK> and the group
<START> i am sorry to see that surface has not been picked up for the nbc 2006 2007 season i guess market demand for inane game and reality shows on broadcast television a reflection on our sense of culture has <UNK> a good story i hope and pray that some network picks it up so it will continue on as does stargate and it's spin offs br br i also hope the producers find a <UNK> where they can produce the level of post production they wished for in a tv guide interview right now the reruns on sci fi <UNK> will have to do i for one would love to see where the story goes after the <UNK> that ended episode 15 i would like to find out the mastermind of the efficient effort to the real identity of the creatures br br
<START> as an avid disney fan i was not totally impressed by this movie certainly not motivated enough to catch it in the theaters i am however so glad that i caught it on dvd and watched the special features br br you must check out the <UNK> commentary the entire movie can be viewed with commentary from and the comic relief <UNK> of the story who are voiced by rick <UNK> and dave thomas two veterans of the famous second city comedy <UNK> ad <UNK> in character for an hour and a half about a movie that they are clearly fond of i laughed the whole time the enjoyment i got from this commentary completely made up for the tepid reaction i had to the film itself do yourself a favor and listen to it
<START> i came across this movie in an australian hotel room at 3 am my brother and i were channel surfing and who do we see but a young <UNK> <UNK> but not the <UNK> throwing <UNK> <UNK> we had come to know and quasi love back in the states this movie much to my surprise was amazingly creative and hilarious it stars a cast of awkward teens with hilarious stories of odd sexual experiences including a slick salesman prostitutes and an unusual sexy mother if you are lucky enough to come across this film i would strongly suggest picking it up i have to say this movie was amazingly entertaining and i thank the fine people of australia making it
<START> viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b grade desert based films such as bagdad <UNK> or <UNK> man which more or less takes place in the desert it also models some of the bizarre humor and especially eccentric trail of characters of writer joseph comedy <UNK> hours ' in a sort of desert <UNK> fantasy a metaphor of temptation and redemption gus played well by jordan christopher michael a clever 10 year old boy <UNK> in his <UNK> bank steals a <UNK> and runs away from his grossly <UNK> parents it begins as a trip through salvation which is apparent in the scenes with john <UNK> but once he becomes hooked on a scratch off game called he becomes easily <UNK> by temptation and <UNK> his childish innocence he travels from one crazy fictional state to another <UNK> ways of getting cards from <UNK> gas stations just enough so that he might spell out the prize winning word m o t o r a m a and be <UNK> for the 500 million cash prize br br along the way he is <UNK> with dozens of strange characters such as flea who plays a high strung <UNK> <UNK> who plays a crazy biker and mary <UNK> and sandy baron a seinfeld regular as two violent <UNK> br br the dvd can be very <UNK> as have previous attempts to sell this film to the non cult market first with <UNK> comparing it to home alone and thelma louise the <UNK> calling it a love story with the <UNK> <UNK> that the film is about jordan michael christopher on an adventure to meet the girl of his dreams which despite the size of her picture on the dvd cover is actually only about a 1 second cameo by drew barrymore as the fantasy girl that gus dreams about why didn't they just market it for what it was thought it may seem totally bizarre on first viewing it is actually a well designed narrative br br is great material for fans of strange b grade comedies this was quite an interesting story and particularly because of the strength of its lead actor jordan michael christopher who unfortunately has few other screen credits of note and the clever metaphor inherent in the plot hopefully its re release on dvd will make it an easier find for cult fans
<START> compared to director kevin <UNK> later <UNK> adventure this is a masterpiece however that's not saying much in fact at the <UNK> core is a silly fantasy adventure in which peter cushing who appears to be on something strong and some other actor whom i don't know use a giant digging machine called the iron mole dig their way down to the <UNK> core only to find that the inside of the earth is pink and populated by ape like creatures who have <UNK> the humans there's also a giant bird that controls the apes by means of <UNK> and we get to see it blink its eyes in <UNK> throughout the film most importantly cushing and what's his name also encounter the lovely caroline <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> and here's what i've really got against this little flick why oh why is it that whenever <UNK> in a movie she only gets <UNK> 5 minutes of screen time in the spy who loved me maniac dracula ad 1972 golden voyage of <UNK> always she's in the background how can kevin connor possibly think that we'd rather listen to peter <UNK> fake accent and look at some ridiculous ape man whose voice sounds like a <UNK> cd than <UNK> at the beautiful <UNK> i don't get it please somebody direct a movie where this english brunette is on screen all the time
<START> i just get <UNK> when the movie start because i saw juliette lewis name on the screen the script seemed very complicated first but as the movie continued it became understandably clear i concentrated well on it but the result was disappointing because the object of sex used too much on the film unnecessarily and it seemed to me that the director ignore ones who has tendency upon opposite sex in my opinion the well prepared script couldn't be <UNK> as we look at the cast the movie promises something in the beginning or i just expected too much and finally the end the end is so so much mediocre that i wouldn't expect the main character <UNK> wants to give message about having baby and how a baby can change a life in my opinion that scene is the real disaster for the film all in all the characters are funny and acted beautifully but only cast can't save a movie
<START> disappointing comedy drama with sentimental <UNK> has michael j fox <UNK> cast as a former child star who now runs a talent agency for <UNK> <UNK> nathan lane and <UNK> <UNK> are his <UNK> this all sounds as if it can't miss however too much of the scenario is given over to <UNK> christina <UNK> as a <UNK> <UNK> whom fox believes will be the next big thing they lock quickly lock heads and the <UNK> dialogue takes them back and forth to an uninteresting formula finish fox and lane are both appealing but the energy of the early scenes gives way to <UNK> <UNK> produced but ultimately stale 1 2 from

<START> the hand of death aka <UNK> in kung fu 1976 is a vastly underrated early work by director john woo the film stars <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and features jackie chan sammo hung and james in significant supporting roles many people believe or have been lead to believe by <UNK> advertising that this is a jackie chan film this is not a jackie chan film <UNK> <UNK> is the star but jackie gives one of his best most serious early performances br br the hand of death is about a shaolin <UNK> named <UNK> who is sent on a mission to <UNK> a shaolin <UNK> named and protect a revolutionary named zhang <UNK> woo along his journey meets up with a young named <UNK> chan and a <UNK> sword fighter chang <UNK> known as the <UNK> both men have suffered at the hands of and want to take revenge the three team up to defeat and his eight <UNK> and <UNK> the revolutionary to safety br br the martial arts action is above average under the direction of sammo hung <UNK> <UNK> uses his trademark high kicks very effectively as the northern <UNK> styles kicks along with some southern five styles boxing sammo hung and jackie chan provide excellent martial arts performances as well james is not the greatest martial artist on the <UNK> screen but does an acceptable job some of the early fights are a bit slow and seem over choreographed but the final <UNK> featuring chan <UNK> and hung are very good br br director john woo provides plenty of interesting character development in the film which is refreshing the cinematography by <UNK> wing <UNK> is very stylish unique and beautiful for a kung fu film of this era joseph music a combination of soft <UNK> and 70's <UNK> style <UNK> pieces is kung fu cinema at its best hand of death is not jackie and <UNK> usual kung fu comedy hand of death is a serious straightforward revenge driven story br br hand of death aka <UNK> in kung fu is an underrated classic in the old school kung fu genre the film is one of the best artistically of its time and a preview of the great things to come from jackie chan and sammo hung <UNK> great choreography is put on display here before his directorial debut and chan's early charisma and talent can be clearly seen br br hand of death is a solid stylish old school kung fu film and a brilliant early work of the legendary john woo br br kung fu genre rating 7 5 10 br br <UNK> to <UNK> referring to his new weapon the little eagle wing god lance br br <UNK> just a

<START> i absolutely adore this movie i had never heard of it when i saw it at the video store i saw kathy bates was in it so i figured it had to have some worth you know i watched it the first time just shaking my head huh then it was the last scene and i found myself <UNK> from smiling so hard i <UNK> play movie and watched the whole thing again it is without doubt the <UNK> movie i've ever seen but the more i watch it the more i love it it's absurd and crazy and sweet and dear kathy bates is impeccable but the rest of the cast is fabulous too what odd characters they all are the midget is just too funny for words and julie andrews and barry <UNK> are hysterical it's just an all around funny fabulous movie i get <UNK> to see it again whoever is watching it for the first time please stick it out to the end it's well worth it
<START> i have nothing but good things to say about this <UNK> and heartwarming film i think that the effort of the film's director writer is courageous as well as inspirational i loved this film not only for the fantastic story which needed to be told but also for the way the actors delivered the story this is not another shallow gay movie that depicts stereotypical characters in humorous situations this was a memorable and flawless effort to show people that love truly knows no <UNK> and love is still as beautiful and wonderful as it always was br br another thing that touched my heart was how well i could relate to the emotion portrayed in this film surrounding the coming out of one of the main characters we all have to go through similar situations living in the society that we live in and feeling that feeling of <UNK> from everything that is right and normal i give my most heartfelt praise for this fabulous and courageous story
<START> fascinating and <UNK> bad lights of new york is the first all <UNK> feature and one that almost never saw the light of day br br two naive <UNK> eddie and gene from out of town get involved with <UNK> and end up a speak when a cop is shot by one of the <UNK> the police start to close in and the <UNK> who shot the officer decides to pin the murder on eddie <UNK> his henchman to take him for a ride but it's the <UNK> himself who takes the bullet in a twist that will surprise few br br shot in one week at a cost of 23 000 lights was originally meant as a two <UNK> but <UNK> took advantage of jack <UNK> absence to <UNK> it to six when warner discovered this he ordered <UNK> to cut it back to the original short only when an independent offered for the film did <UNK> actually look at the film which went on to make a <UNK> 1 3 million br br seen now this is an extremely hokey piece with acting that <UNK> from the passable eugene <UNK> to <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> in a particularly <UNK> scene and much of the playing is at the level of vaudeville since it's an early <UNK> 4 part <UNK> <UNK> it that's about all the characters do and very slowly at that the script feels improvised visual style is non existent apart from the shooting scene done in <UNK> and scenes <UNK> on <UNK> title cards are <UNK> which <UNK> <UNK> characters and locales br br despite all this lights is a compelling experience as we watch actors and crew struggling with the alien technology and changing cinema for ever br br catch it if you can
<START> gosh i am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a <UNK> and then again 20 years later you gain a different view primarily because in 20 years you learn more for example i had no idea who george <UNK> was how great of a director he was and how much of that made this film fly all i can say is i really liked this film for it touched on an area that <UNK> my life <UNK> friendship between two women can that ever exist well in certain doses yes and this film let out in a bit on how br br being a <UNK> with not a lot of life experience at the first time i saw this so i focused more on the rich and famous part between the two at the time i had no idea there was a difference and what would happen to two women who discovered there was and how that would effect their friendship through their men their career the decades that defined them and coming to realize one thing remained stronger than anything else their friendship and knowing each other more than anyone else could have br br then i got older studied film a bit and watched this film again with my best friend from high school we do understand the and angle and we are still the best of friends but this film is not a cinematic masterpiece it can be seen as a bit campy at times a little over the top at points kinda on a and level to me and honestly i can identify with the teddy bear scene for we do share a bear that means a lot more than a stuffed fun toy through our trials and <UNK> with men careers et al so its not as over the top as it seems as many already said seeing meg ryan and matt and rambo and david <UNK> are great in this 1981 piece this is a nice chick flick
<START> my family truly enjoyed this movie as far as what this movie will do for <UNK> in the usa well i am sure that will be <UNK> but as for me and others around me i know that we were more curious about the sport after seeing the movie and i personally gained more respect for the game you may wonder how this possible especially since the movie does not dive in and explain <UNK> but the simple fact is it drew you into the players and emotion of the game and life the film was inspirational as well as entertaining it made us laugh and cry the chemistry between sean <UNK> big <UNK> and sean <UNK> worked well some may think the movie is a little cliché but i seriously wish hollywood made more movies like this i couldn't help drawing <UNK> of the game and life's struggles at the end of it i found myself <UNK> my own life to see what i needed to do better in order to be the best person i could be honestly i was grateful this movie taught morals values and <UNK> there is so much to the contrary after watching this i really hope my kids are <UNK> by someone who has a philosophy like coach
<START> obviously someone was looking at catching onto the blair witch wave br br this movie was set up like all the reality haunted shows that are popping up on tv lately and i must admit i get a kick out of these but this movie is much <UNK> probably the first three quarters of the movie is filled with the participants going through the house whining give me a break spending 10 minutes whining about going up into the attic is not my idea of a good time any <UNK> happenings are blatant <UNK> no strings but too perfectly caught on camera to be real the participants were not very likeable either two goofy guys who don't take it seriously one girl who scares at the drop of a hat and the quintessential over played <UNK> person is this becoming the clichéd formula for a ghost movie br br i have to admit the last 15 minutes or so were pure tension they took every ounce of tension in the movie and stuck it in those 15 minutes i admit i spent that time pacing in the kitchen i really wouldn't recommend this movie to younger viewers even if it is <UNK> br br if you're looking for some entertainment if you don't take it seriously you will get a kick out of this movie there's tons of situations to make cracks about if you're looking for an great story line look elsewhere
<START> cave <UNK> or the blade <UNK> or whatever it's called is in one word vile i saw this on <UNK> and i laughed not only at the great running commentary but at the inept film making that was demonstrated <UNK> tire tracks and where did <UNK> get a hang <UNK> then they lift a few shots from another movie where <UNK> dare as tom <UNK> points out to show just how cheap this movie really is watch the scene where <UNK> and <UNK> have to battle invisible <UNK> or even better look for the giant <UNK> dressed up like a snake that <UNK> must <UNK> and what exactly do those scenes in the credits have to do with the movie
<START> without a doubt one of tobe best epic great special effects and the <UNK> me baby
<START> it's <UNK> to view this film as a daring avant garde experiment i like to think that the director was trying to see if it was possible to take all the conventions of comedy film and produce something that was completely utterly entirely unfunny br br the answer to judge by from <UNK> is a <UNK> <UNK> this may not be the worst film i've ever seen but my brain seems to have repressed all memory of the others this horrible flick <UNK> just on the borderline bad enough that the thought still causes pain but not quite so bad that my internal censors have <UNK> it from my consciousness br br it's difficult for me to imagine what the director and the cast thought they were doing when they made this or why they went ahead and released it once they'd made it i doubt anyone involved with it earned very much but surely between them they could have got together enough money to buy up all the <UNK> and have them burned br br this is a movie that has nothing whatsoever to recommend it it's not even <UNK> bad it's just a non movie in which nothing interesting happens i gave serious thought to taking it back and demanding my money back which is not something i've ever done before br br don't even think about renting much less buying this horrible non movie
<START> <UNK> 4 is pretty <UNK> sequel the <UNK> look very different from the first three <UNK> but there still cool there are some nice flash backs from <UNK> the first movie jonathan is back once again in this one he wasn't in parts 2 or 3 though the movie is low budget at times but fun to watch you've got tony cox as the dark <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as the light <UNK> the <UNK> in this movie are actually good guys instead of evil like in the first three movies both <UNK> are pretty funny characters in the movie then you've got the very hot alexandra it's a great dark comedy and funny any fan of the <UNK> movies will enjoy watching <UNK> 4 the dvd is finally coming out this july 2007 hopefully one day <UNK> iii will be on dvd in the usa i'd really like to see a sequel to this movie one day too i doubt it will happen though it's 2007 now and no sign of a sequel yet if there ever is a sequel i hope jim <UNK> will make it br br i give <UNK> iv a 9 10
<START> after recently seeing cry uncle by the same director i decided to seek this out and am i glad i did this is an extraordinarily good film far far better than it would seem likely given the ingredients how many times have we had to suffer the embarrassment of someone playing a middle class dad mixing it with the flower children and yet here thanks to a perfect script it is made believable not ideal not good or bad but believable peter boyle as the working class hippie and <UNK> er <UNK> and dennis patrick as the uptight suit play their respective parts <UNK> and i can't remember ever seeing the two classes getting together like this without things getting sentimental susan sarandon is effective as a hippie chick but doesn't have all that much to do in her first film this is a truly must see film capturing as it does that very short period in western and in particular us times when the counter culture was about to bust itself wide open
<START> contains spoilers br br a lovely film this starring brad and the ever wonderful joseph i like joseph out of all his films i've seen to date i've loved every single one of them for many different reasons and the cure is no different brad does very well in this movie as well the cure is a drama coming of age movie from the viewpoint of an ill child and his friend br br the basic idea is <UNK> joseph has aids he ends up <UNK> the kid next door brad but <UNK> mum is very narrow minded ill informed and somewhat thick when it comes to <UNK> illness she thinks aids is <UNK> like the common cold so doesn't want her son going anywhere near <UNK> br br after many attempts at making their own cure with no success the boys go on their way to new orleans to find the cure after reading a <UNK> about it after getting their kicks from playboy magazine <UNK> health goes south shortly afterwards and as his health there's still enough life in the boy alongside <UNK> for two pranks of pretending to stop breathing unfortunately poor <UNK> does indeed die from his illness leaving poor <UNK> behind to wonder why he couldn't find the cure throughout the movie he ends up bonding more with <UNK> mother than his own br br it is a very heartwarming movie to watch and is not absolutely perfect movies rarely are but you won't care less about that as you get involved in the film more a must for joseph fans one of his best performances ever very well recommended must see movie if you can find a copy
<START> i can remember seeing this movie when i was very young and several times on tv since then i have always liked it i have noticed on the print shown on local tv that one scene has <UNK> film it is the one where they are hiding behind the rock <UNK> it looks like <UNK> rocks near los angeles watching the indians ride by if you look carefully you will notice that suddenly all the soldiers are left handed it is only a short segment and i have to admit that it took me years to notice it br br as far as history goes there were often to rescue white <UNK> from the indians the direct connection for the final battle scene is the battle of island in that action a group of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with repeating <UNK> spencer <UNK> not were surprised by the indians and <UNK> to an island and held off several charges in the last charge they killed roman nose one of the more famous indian <UNK> i have no idea if the writer of the script had this in mind but it does fit fairly well br br there are several guy madison movies that i hope come out on dvd someday and this is one of them
<START> there are subtleties in this film that i think a lot of people may miss if they're not careful you really need to follow what <UNK> says and read his character to figure out the intended why the movie presents at the end nothing it solid it's not definite it's about what the individual viewer takes out of it i think that was the plan from the get go people aren't meant to all understand it in the same way it's almost about <UNK> your own personal relationship with <UNK> in order to maybe feel him a little better br br the storyline is interesting but its summary could never explain what the movie really is it's dramatic and thought provoking a lot of heavy ideas but the pace of the movie is almost <UNK> even with its more intense scenes with yelling i think it's probably <UNK> he's just calm and almost <UNK> even for all of his sadness the movie <UNK> <UNK> in a way br br of course it is captivating and draws you in if you let it but there are some recycled ideas i mean <UNK> has a lot of impressive dialogue he is anything but typical but he's not a prophet everything he says is not a revelation many people i know have mentioned things he mentioned even i have observed a few things he's observed <UNK> is the unique and attractive character he is probably mostly for ryan portrayal br br in the end the acting is all exceptional there are no real bad guys there is no way to psychologically <UNK> <UNK> only to maybe understand him and life a little better br br comparable to goes down i think not comedic but similar in its general <UNK> on life
<START> forgive me but this work of director peter hall is horrendous if you can't get to us with the plot why not kill someone's cat or dog that surely reaches the audiences this viewer is tired of seeing animals sacrificed for the plot of a movie and believe me i saw it coming before she opened the package how predictable can you get take a cute animal then kill it in a gruesome way i have never been a fan of de and this performance tells me why <UNK> and somewhat <UNK> in interpretation i found her rather silly and definitely boring i did like <UNK> but felt bad that he had to play opposite de he has done much better in other films namely philadelphia where he had some honesty in his dialogue in this <UNK> he did his best to keep his character real but the writers green rush did a good job in <UNK> this with their trite storyline and insipid dialogue please let us not be subjected to this kind of entertainment some of us aren't fooled by corny plots <UNK> animals and generally long <UNK> dialogue seeing her get away with it made me furious
<START> i'm a big fan of <UNK> art but this film by <UNK> with some ideas from <UNK> left me cold <UNK> had a life long grudge against the catholic church and delighted in trying to offend <UNK> in fairly silly ways this is one of the <UNK> almost like what you'd expect from a smart <UNK> 18 year old in film class the last few minutes of the movie which have nothing to do with anything else are a final nose <UNK> at religion br br if you read the <UNK> regarding this slow paced occasionally amusing film it's all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual <UNK> if that is indeed the point then <UNK> expresses it in the most <UNK> fashion possible the central male character is a nasty <UNK> who loves kicking dogs and knocking blind men down in the street and who mentally turns <UNK> ads into strange sexual fantasies is this behavior the <UNK> fault for <UNK> his <UNK> or is he just a jerk i vote for the latter i think <UNK> must have had a lot of personal <UNK> and chose the <UNK> as the ones to blame br br there are a few moments where you might cry <UNK> <UNK> a cow in a bed a <UNK> falling out a window a poor model a man <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> a woman <UNK> a toilet while we watch pictures of <UNK> <UNK> or a mud pit hard to tell in b w the rest is forgettable self <UNK> unfortunately <UNK> was still chasing the same <UNK> men through the rest of his career <UNK> charm if you're interested in seeing <UNK> on the screen check out jean <UNK> early work
<START> the odd thing about <UNK> is not that it is <UNK> bad although it is the odd thing is that in spite of being <UNK> bad it is not funny <UNK> bad movies have their own particular brand of <UNK> humor the secret of their success you might say but <UNK> is quite uniquely different it is <UNK> worst nightmare a bad movie in which the intentional and the unintentional humor alike fall flat br br it is easy enough to figure out why the intentional jokes fail and the reasons are quite varied sometimes it's a timing question sometimes it's a good idea badly worked out the human restaurant could have been hilarious but it wasn't sometimes it feels like there was some in the cutting room with the punchline ending up on the floor and sometimes the jokes are just bad jokes bad movies get their laughs from such unintentional <UNK> it's harder to figure out why <UNK> doesn't get any laughs on that count something is subtly wrong with the unintentional humor in this movie just as something is wrong not at all subtly with the intentional humor it is a <UNK> bad movie whose very badness is not the redeeming quality it usually is it's absolutely unique in my experience
<START> i think i would rather have my <UNK> <UNK> with a pair of rusty than bear another 5 minutes of this movie in fact i cannot even be bothered to go in to detail not sure how they managed to get the <UNK> into the wooden actors to cure them better off for all concerned if they had just <UNK> the island after finding out about the virus that way it would have lasted as long as the commercial break and we could have moved on with our lives plus one more thing was this rubbish <UNK> by the god channel as all they seemed to do was praise the bleeding lord most of the time avoid like the plague in fact i would prefer it
<START> despite having a very pretty leading lady <UNK> one of my boy <UNK> the acting and the direction are examples of what not to do while making a movie br br placed in southern mexico the aztec mummy real <UNK> by the way did not made <UNK> has been up by the lead characters and starts making trouble in mexico city <UNK> during the first movie the aztec mummy in this second part the leading man and woman want to find <UNK> mummy and put it in its final <UNK> place a <UNK> would have been my first choice br br into this appears the bat a criminal master mindless stereotype of a criminal genius who creates a human robot some idiot inside a robot suit to control and get this take over the world the final match between the robot and the mummy is hilarious some of the worst choreography ever witnessed the funniest part is that this movie was made and released by a serious mexican movie studio br br the acting is just as awful hearing the movie in spanish as it is in english they dubbed the over acting you should watch this movie through <UNK> 3000 the comments are even funnier
<START> this movie is one big stereotype the acting except <UNK> harrison is awful and the horrid script only make things worse i must agree with another review that the local characters sound ridiculous as a matter of fact so do the <UNK> characters 3 stars out of 10 for 1 <UNK> 2 harrison 3 surf scenes 1 2 out of watch <UNK> summer and or beyond paradise for hawaii done right especially <UNK> which i found to be entertaining and brilliant
<START> i <UNK> seeing this movie having really enjoyed the original what a disappointment catherine zeta jones is a good actress but this wasn't her film the original had poignant moments perfectly <UNK> with an incredible soundtrack no <UNK> felt like it never connected the food the characters nothing felt passionate in mostly martha the food came alive every scene was filmed in such a way you could taste it with your eyes the <UNK> the <UNK> the food in <UNK> was in the background rarely did we get a <UNK> of the <UNK> the characters were not real enough to carry the movie without it it was hard finishing the movie many of the scenes felt awkward see the original it's a truly enjoyable movie the soundtrack incredible
<START> <UNK> i really think this movie is very good br br is basic a different kind of <UNK> movie is hilarious and the actors uses local expressions that are so much <UNK> to listen br br it shows a different face o and i think that's very important because <UNK> is a diverse country and we need to show that to the world this is the first movie of the director <UNK> and i really except this movie will be the beginning of a great career as a film director br br we need to continue support <UNK> filming industry because this movie and others good films are the beginning of something big
<START> so im not a big fan of <UNK> work but then again not many are i enjoyed his movie <UNK> maybe im the only one boll apparently bought the rights to use far cry long ago even before the game itself was even br br people who have enjoyed killing <UNK> and <UNK> secret research <UNK> located on a <UNK> island should be warned that this is not far cry this is something mr boll have together along with his legion of <UNK> feeling on the set mr boll invites three of his <UNK> to play with these players go by the names of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> br br three names that actually have made them pretty big in the movie <UNK> so the tale goes like this jack <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> yes <UNK> is german all <UNK> the <UNK> eating <UNK> however i find that acting in this movie is pretty <UNK> people have complained about how he's not really staying true to the whole <UNK> agenda but we only saw <UNK> in a first person perspective so we don't really know what he looked like when he was kicking a br br however the storyline in this film is beyond demented we see the evil mad scientist dr played by <UNK> <UNK> making <UNK> mutated soldiers or as they are called performing his top secret research on an island that reminds me of spoiler <UNK> for some reason thats right no palm trees here instead we got some nice rich <UNK> woods we haven't even gone far before i started to cry i cannot go on any more if you wanna stay true to <UNK> <UNK> then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true boll experience meaning most of it will suck br br there are some things worth mentioning that would imply that boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes until the whole <UNK> squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh the movie far cry <UNK> of that's <UNK> for you <UNK> from a <UNK> r if you wanna take a go ahead btw <UNK> gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you wanna shoot him the first three minutes he's on screen
<START> i thought this series was going to be another fun action series with some dynamic plots and great performances i was wrong while i like jamie <UNK> this show is hardly worth watching at all unless you enjoy watching some people <UNK> and the actions of the agents supposedly <UNK> under the theme of national security the show is great propaganda for the current government and <UNK> out <UNK> as though we talk that way every day after a couple of episodes it was boring the hell out of me and i started watching reruns of house <UNK> on instead rather watch <UNK> and without a trace without a doubt
<START> i understand that roger corman loves to do things on the cheap but this is just sad i purchased this flick from the dollar bin at my local video store not a month after watching the original <UNK> i was blown away it was the same damn movie with just some corbin spliced in it reminded me of all of those 80s ninja movies that took old kung fu movies and spliced in a bunch of white ninjas running doing <UNK> with the word ninja written on their if you haven't seen them check out ninja terminator the <UNK> ninja black dragon and ninja warriors thanks roger corman you just made me waste a dollar
<START> the time machine starts in new york during <UNK> where professor alexander guy <UNK> <UNK> to his beloved girlfriend emma <UNK> who accepts unfortunately just after they are attacked by a <UNK> emma is shot dead dies in <UNK> arms jump forward <UNK> years <UNK> alexander has built a time machine which he uses to travel back to the night emma was killed in order to save her but she is still killed only a different way this time alexander realises whatever he does however many times he goes back emma will always end up dead one way or another he <UNK> to know the answer why so he travels far into the future to discover the truth however after having destroyed the moon two new races have evolved on earth the human like the monstrous that eat the alexander decides to stick around save the br br directed by simon wells who is actually the great <UNK> of author h g wells who wrote the original the time machine book on which the original the time machine 1960 film was based it is in fact the 1960 film that producer john <UNK> script is based upon here rather than wells original literally source while all three share the same basic story ideas this remake adds the subplot about <UNK> fiancé emma being killed that's the reason he <UNK> a time machine rather than just because he is clever he can the script is a mixture of sci fi action adventure drama none of which really grabbed me or engaged me that much sure there are a few pretty special effects a few nice action scenes the moment when <UNK> question is answered regarding why he can't save emma is actually quite intelligent makes sense it never really captured my imagination i was never really moved by it either the time travel aspects of the time machine feel very similar to terminator 2 judgment day 1992 in the sense you can't change the past but at the same time the future is not set only the time machine isn't anywhere near as good a film as terminator 2 judgment day the character's are alright although i thought guy <UNK> just looked too young to be a <UNK> scientist capable of <UNK> a time machine there's never any real explanation behind it's <UNK> either as it's like one moment there's no time machine the next he has invented made one it works perfectly i <UNK> the back to the future trilogy offer far more thrills laughs excitement general entertainment value than the time machine ever does while i will stop short of calling it a bad film since it moves along at a decent pace tells a reasonable story has it's moments i wouldn't call it brilliant or even particularly good there is also a <UNK> little reference to the book original film which are both name checked here br br the benefit this modern version has over the original is the development of special effects in particular cgi which leads to scenes of time rapidly passing around alexander in his time machine complete with huge buildings being built new <UNK> mountains being formed a elaborate pan back which ends up in space as we see passenger rockets <UNK> the moon the effects work is good there are one or two moments that look a little below par but generally speaking the effects are good i saw the time machine on telly the station playing it badly pan and <UNK> it so the left right edges of the frame were cut off the screen thus cutting off part of the year on <UNK> time machine <UNK> so i actually didn't know what year he went to apparently director gore took over the last <UNK> days of filming as wells was suffering from while the imdb says that the time machine itself was the biggest most expensive prop ever built for a film at that point which i find hard to believe guy <UNK> broke a <UNK> during a fight scene but like a <UNK> carried on br br with a supposed budget of about 80 000 000 the production values are high with a lovingly <UNK> period new york good effects work although amazingly the time machine was nominated for an oscar for best make up but lost out to <UNK> 2002 the acting is mixed <UNK> puts in a good performance in a terrible make up job that has him looking like a reject from a lord of the rings film while singer samantha makes her big screen debut here is simply terrible although guy <UNK> is quite good fairly likable br br the time machine isn't a particularly bad film or a particularly good one just a somewhat <UNK> one that is watchable passes an hour and a half but not much else watch back to the future 1985 again instead
<START> <UNK> aged female scientist kills fellow scientist in order to steal <UNK> for <UNK> cells and <UNK> the aging process she takes it and turns into the beautiful evil <UNK> who goes around <UNK> and murdering wealthy <UNK> br br she dresses very <UNK> in late 60s <UNK> clothes and <UNK> those around her looking a lot like the late marisa from the film coincidence br br however in spite of all this it's amateurish and sloppy without the james bond pop art that had had even the <UNK> and lake <UNK> filming locations don't make up for this br br the soundtrack is by <UNK> <UNK> and it isn't bad at all <UNK> of lush <UNK> with a little <UNK> guitar used as an <UNK> perfect for one of those european <UNK> that came out in the 90s br br the <UNK> dvd also uses a <UNK> grainy color print that's in poor shape with an explanation at the beginning saying that this was due to the age of the film bull they either didn't bother looking for a better source or they couldn't find one at all there are only a few stills of <UNK> and that's it br br sloppy poor all around this one gets a 3 out of 10
<START> if you take the parents and blend them with the kyle parents you get a perfect blend of over the top and under the edge <UNK> that you can wish for your own family child skills the best part about each show is that the parents do not come off as pompous self righteous upper class know it <UNK> but at the same time they are not the stereotypical under educated parents who are constantly being <UNK> and <UNK> by their children my kids are 20 16 and 6 just about the same ages as the kyle kids and i see so much of their situations <UNK> my own experiences with my family the silliness that they <UNK> in only goes to show that when you have love in your family you do not have to take yourself too seriously to keep your household together and have fun with your kids
<START> this is one of those so called hollywood social commentary films that wants to have it both ways and believe me in this film both ways are clichéd and stereotypical stop loss is a 21st century john wayne film dealing with some anti war sentiment but clearly ending on the note that if you are a man in today's society you get your act together and march off to war with your buddies in many ways the film was a great sequel to taxi to the dark side as it portrayed a military equally as insane and out of control a quasi frat party animal house <UNK> mixed in with a texas red neck world of repressed <UNK> erotic <UNK> of <UNK> this movie had it all in one scene after another of clichéd imagery and then rebellious military <UNK> ryan <UNK> goes on a road trip with best friend's girlfriend an artificial storyline manipulation to visit families of dead <UNK> <UNK> soldiers in military <UNK> etc and finally to <UNK> the issue of fleeing to canada or mexico but male honor and <UNK> win out in the end as all <UNK> <UNK> and handsome he rides off into the sunset on a bus with his buddies back to iraq and a world that a few minutes before he assured everyone he could never again tolerate full metal jacket meets <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> but in the end john wayne rides again and a hollywood blockbuster ultimately gets to keep both sides of its audience in the palm of its at least it would like to think so as far as i was am concerned just take me back to the more convincing reality of in the garden of
<START> while the remake of the excellent day of the has better <UNK> and a <UNK> budget this film nails the actual persona of carlos down br br quinn excels as the naval officer <UNK> to <UNK> the <UNK> to draw him out of hiding and at the hands of kingsley and sutherland turns himself inside out to do so <UNK> his family his career and all that he believes in he takes on the task albeit utterly <UNK> br br to say more would spoil it this is an excellent film br br 3 1 2 niro stars of 4
<START> this movie started off well enough sticking to the mood of the book fairly well even if the acting was not top notch the soundtrack was bad <UNK> and electric <UNK> it was <UNK> <UNK> the female singer was positively dreary in the second half of the film the story takes a decidedly darker turn too dark for austen <UNK> <UNK> is made a dark and scary place whereas in the book it was <UNK> tame and <UNK> to <UNK> eyes br br who in the heck is this with the ghastly makeup and wig a totally <UNK> and unnecessary character br br one of the key elements in the book is the general is not a gothic monster like the characters in <UNK> books his monstrosity is far more complicated in his <UNK> of his children's spirits and his treatment of catherine based on money concerns alone he does not lock up his wife or kill her but he does send miss <UNK> on a 70 mile trip alone in a hired <UNK> with not enough money to pay her way home only her friend miss <UNK> in <UNK> her some money on the way out the door saves her from being stranded this whole point gets seriously muddled in the film they make the general too dark from the outset br br peter <UNK> should have not sung this part was painful to watch his depiction of wasn't too bad but it was a <UNK> dark in places henry of the book made sport of miss imagination on trip to <UNK> but he was never dark <UNK> would have <UNK> from better direction the young lady who played <UNK> needed a better acting coach john was appropriately <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> he wore was ghastly it certainly fit his character br br i think the film would have <UNK> much better with a completely different soundtrack it cast an oppressive <UNK> over the entire movie if i watch it again it will be with the sound off and subtitles on perhaps i would give the film a 4 then br br the sound quality of the dvd was quite poor the picture quality was not much better this is <UNK> noticeable on a digital television br br when i think of what this film could have been i think of <UNK> with amanda root and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> imaginary heroes is clearly the best film of the year it was a complete and utter joy to watch i was <UNK> the whole audience up at the sunset five was <UNK> when the film ended no one moved spoke nothing i think this film is a perfect example of the of the power that drama has especially in so much as it sets an example of the quality of drama work of this younger generation br br there were moments in your film many like at least seven where i was struck by such a great amount of beauty emotional beauty that i actually couldn't breathe for a while and for a <UNK> <UNK> like me that's about the best experience i could ask for it is the result of powerful masterful storytelling and direction like <UNK> stuff like and those guys br br each element of the film fit tightly together there were no <UNK> at all the cast was amazing i have been a huge fan of and <UNK> for a long time and i thought they have never been better i was am will be continuously stunned by this film and i promise i will drag every person i know to see it it should be seen it should win awards
<START> this is by far the worst british comedy ever how it made it past the first episode let alone the pilot is beyond me the acting is weak from the main character played by ben miller to sarah alexander from the fantastic <UNK> right through the cast the plot story lines were unfunny and very very predictable using many worn out ideas a very painful series to endure but sadly put in a <UNK> between two excellent shows describing it as <UNK> answer to ' meet the parents' does a <UNK> to <UNK> the parents' and is as about as fresh as an old shoe that has a run around with the family dog britain should have learned that rip offs from other countries never work from looking at america's sad attempts at doing so
<START> i think i've finally seen the worst movie ever made and it hurts me to say that as a big fan of indie cinema gay or otherwise i had high hopes several minutes into the film however the sheriff appeared and has my vote for the worst actor of this or any other century his performance and the dialog he was forced to perform caused me the unusual step of stopping the dvd in its track hours later when i screwed up enough courage to press the play button again it was no better br br aside from the sheriff and his cartoon racist <UNK> the film has an attractive cast for whom i felt genuine sympathy since they had such a miserable script the idea behind the film is fine using <UNK> of gay men in the new south the same way it was used on black men in the old south leaving strange fruit hanging from the trees br br with an accomplished writer and director we might have had a movie instead we get fake detective work <UNK> about homosexuality and a cliché with a the one good white man trying to save the day br br i have no doubt that racism still <UNK> the fbi is currently investigating a white school bus driver in the back woods of who forced the black kids to get to the back of the bus but this town is a cartoon and it is hard to believe anything you see or hear br br there a few subplots in a weak attempt to try to make the main character more three dimensional but for the most part they also fail miserably br br for the truly <UNK> the dvd contains some deleted scenes that will leave you running for cover br br the is probably the first movie that makes me believe that writer directors should have to pass a test and get <UNK> before they can make a film although i would look forward to seeing several of the cast members in better films i would be hard pressed to witness anything else from this director
<START> i like steve <UNK> i like his work very much both as an actor and a director you could say that i am into steve <UNK> a steve <UNK> freak i steve <UNK> br br i remember when i first saw <UNK> full length directorial debut trees <UNK> i enjoyed the movie although it wasn't as good as it could have been it was almost there it almost <UNK> that <UNK> the <UNK> of wanting to see small movies about small people in small bars that are in small towns it was close enough to where i would say that it was a very good movie one that with a few <UNK> could have been great but that's ok i like the movie and i've watched it more than once br br but this review is not about trees <UNK> it's about <UNK> jim when i saw the description of the movie and then i saw who's movie it was i was excited at the <UNK> of finally seeing the movie that i knew that trees <UNK> could have been but what i actually experienced was not unlike that of leaving one of those <UNK> bars with a belly full of cheap <UNK> and an of cheap <UNK> heading back to your apartment with a <UNK> brain full of exciting <UNK> that inevitably <UNK> into the reality of alcohol induced <UNK> and <UNK> br br in other words this movie left me flat and <UNK> and sorry that i wasted the time and the money that it took me to get to that state the film equivalent of waking up next to that cheap <UNK> the next morning or if you happen to be the <UNK> waking up next to that <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the film had all of the substance of a stale white bread <UNK> with store brand white bread no less and the emotion of a <UNK> i am not sure what the point of this film was and since it was supposed to have some sort of a point and was not an exercise in abstract <UNK> that can get by without one then this lack of a point is a sin of <UNK> sorta like those new cars that don't come with anymore although there are millions of people who smoke and buy new cars i'm not one of them but hey i can sympathize overall it was a boring film about boring people doing boring things and had none of the <UNK> and believability that can carry and save such a film i mean trees <UNK> was about boring people doing boring things but it was interesting br br i blame a lot of this on affleck why do people keep casting these affleck <UNK> they suck the life out of anything that they are connected with one affleck was in one decent film and wasn't even the reason why the film was decent and all of the sudden every named affleck is <UNK> up as many films as they possibly can and <UNK> tyler is no better being the daughter of a rock star does not necessarily make an actress she is as lifeless as affleck these people simply do not rise from the flat page of the script people pay to see films and they deserve to see actors and actresses with a bit of charisma these two <UNK> together don't have the spark of the old guy who hands out shopping <UNK> at wal mart i always thought that steve <UNK> was the type of guy who would rise above this type of but oh steve you let us down this film makes me want to stuff you into another wood <UNK>
<START> a year after the release of the average house of frankenstein universal released another monster mash where all their famous character would <UNK> once again house of dracula would reunite dracula the <UNK> creature and the wolf man for what would be their final battle and will finally close an era for the studio directed once again by c house of dracula presents a slight but noticeable improvement over the previous film and delivers a better constructed although still flawed story that while far from perfect is a more appropriate closure than the previous film br br the story ignores most of the events of the previous entry house of frankenstein and introduces a new angle to the story count dracula john carradine tired of having to hide during <UNK> asks help to the brilliant scientist dr <UNK> <UNK> stevens a <UNK> famous for his research in <UNK> <UNK> becomes fascinated by dracula and soon begins an experimental treatment in the mean time larry <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jr the wolf man visits <UNK> with the purpose of get rid of his curse soon <UNK> realizes that dracula is a monster that must be destroyed but his own exposure to <UNK> blood is also developing a disease in him the discovery of the <UNK> monster glenn strange in a nearby <UNK> will bring more turmoil to the mind of the brilliant scientist br br after the previous clash of monsters it is good to see the series going back to the roots and delivering an almost straight forward gothic horror returning to the dark <UNK> nature of this kind of films and moving away from the comic relief of the previous entries the story by edward t lowe jr has many interesting themes as the contrast between dracula and <UNK> both looking for a cure but with different purposes and <UNK> increasing madness probably among the most interesting themes is the inclusion of the character of nina a gorgeous but <UNK> woman who aids dr <UNK> hoping to be <UNK> of her condition br br director c is back again and this time he finally captures the dark nature of these three characters a nature that was apparently lost in the previous film despite the low budget <UNK> a gothic horror that while simple is quite effective and even manages to present old partners such a these characters in a fresh way while it's never on the level of the originals house of dracula <UNK> that charm that universal studios horror films used to have and makes sure that at least for a last time the monsters receive a chance to shine br br the cast is very good this time with carradine <UNK> and strange <UNK> their roles although role is considerably smaller with more enthusiasm than in the previous film the addition of <UNK> stevens jane adams and martha to the cast bring back the tragedy and the drama to the series with stevens giving a terrific performance as dr <UNK> a small cameo by lionel <UNK> and the presence of <UNK> as the creepy complete one of the better cast universal horror films has had in years br br house of dracula is a nice addition to the series specially after the mediocre house of frankenstein it's nice to see back in form in a somewhat serious horror film however and while the plot is quite original it suffers not only because of the budget but because the film attempts to do a lot in a very short runtime with bad results it's true that the characters have all very inventive story lines but the film <UNK> very few time for each of them to develop and the film seems very rushed and disjointed br br while far from perfect it's also far from being the worst of the series house of dracula is a nice closure to one of the best times for the horror genre a time when ghosts and <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> nights and mad scientists gave life to hideous monsters later the monsters would be back in bud <UNK> lou <UNK> meet frankenstein 1948 but that would be a whole different context after the disappointing previous entries it's easy to dismiss house of dracula but give it a chance and let the monster <UNK> for a last time 7 10
<START> i thought this is an unbelievable boring movie i heard the director can't speak french and so he left his actors tell what they wanted well <UNK> is great as usual but i can't say the same of other actors they have nothing to say especially bruno br br they all seem very tired this being one of the movie plot tired of being together of living abroad of their live in general so they spend half the movie sleeping in a hotel room after a while i felt sleepy myself br br i gave 4 because of some very beautiful scenes including the last one
<START> more maybe is mostly remembered for the excellent soundtrack composed by pink <UNK> in 1969 they weren't <UNK> yet actually they made an album with the film music no fan can miss it br br but this is also the first film of german french director <UNK> <UNK> it's a cult movie when it was released censorship everywhere cut several scenes of sex and drugs it is also one of the first films to treat <UNK> the theme of drug slavery br br a german boy travels to paris and meets an american girl they fall in love together they search for sun and <UNK> but it's a too high price love she <UNK> him into drugs br br in the sixties anti drug <UNK> were not like today there wasn't much information on the contrary in many taking drugs was a sort of spiritual experience so it's quite surprising to see a film of that period which describes a nightmarish heroin experience br br the film is simple not vulgar at all and shot in a cinema <UNK> style actors farmer and <UNK> are very convincing more is a document of the end of the sixties and a document of the end of the hippies <UNK> as well
<START> there is more to this movie than meets the eye if you're looking for groundbreaking originality or easy comedy you'll be disappointed but for an entertaining 90 minutes this is just fine br br the cinematography is careful and precise the sex scenes which one comment as gratuitous are anything but every gesture contributes to the development of the characters br br yes some of the main characters are not exactly lovable human beings but the movie makes an honest effort at showing their interactions in an honest light without being <UNK> at least not for early 21st century urban standards and there are many very amusing moments
<START> this movie is like porn with all of the good parts removed it's like all of the porn stars that didn't want to fulfill their <UNK> <UNK> together around this awful trite useless piece of <UNK> <UNK> br br this is a helpful movie if you're in the mood to torture a loved or no longer loved one it's important that if you choose to use this movie as a method of torture that you put in <UNK> and put on a <UNK> to keep yourself from going insane br br if i had a choice between this movie and the 700 club i'd choose girls gone wild br br overall better if you've been drinking but only because it becomes a drinking game of epic proportions
<START> <UNK> the <UNK> 1982 makes me think back to the really crazy time we were facing in america fresh off the do what feels good <UNK> the last american virgin comes as a wolf in <UNK> clothing as yet another sex <UNK> from the glory days oh sure there's sex but i can't think of another movie ok this and fast times at <UNK> high that really wasn't killing time between topless teenage scenes there was some pretty good stuff here amongst the <UNK> br br the movie follows three <UNK> friends gary wanting to lose his virginity rick stud <UNK> and david overweight but not inexperienced as they try desperately hard to make sure gary joins the world of <UNK> but a funny thing happens on the way to the gary falls for karen pretty brunette who loves the bad boys and can't seem to follow through with any sexual conquest that david and rick can <UNK> only trouble is rick and karen get hot and heavy and karen <UNK> a period it's gary who is by her side as she goes to get her abortion and it's gary who truly cares but who is karen dancing with by film end rick <UNK> the r and add a d where necessary br br what <UNK> this film from others from the <UNK> we think about is that by god they attempt some real drama here and not of the my parents just pulled in the <UNK> variety and you know what i bought it br br it wasn't sloppy it wasn't far fetched and when gary sees rick dancing with karen at the house party at the end of the film i actually felt sorry for the guy our teenage romeo actually believed in <UNK> love and when his heart was broken at the end it all sort of touched me br br so all the t a aside there's an actually pretty believable and engaging story here oscar worthy not by a mile but i don't know that i'd <UNK> it into the let's get laid category either like fast times at <UNK> high they actually were trying to do a true film here letting the hi <UNK> in between fall where it may
<START> this film is dreadful it has absolutely zero laughs <UNK> hammer adam goldberg sets out to save from evil santa andy dick perhaps a promising enough basis for a plot in actual fact the film does not progress beyond this premise while there are some far and few nice touches and the plot is relatively coherent it is <UNK> hackneyed and ultimately <UNK> boring this despite the fact that goldberg dick and <UNK> <UNK> client love interest all have quite considerable screen presence despite being played for what might be described as <UNK> over the top gags this film is consistently middle class middle of the road <UNK> do not waste 85 minutes of your life on this note the music was good
<START> i wanted to like this film and certainly there is room for a psychological character driven movie which doesn't go for the cheap thrills yet for the enjoyment of a movie one requires a believable plot some pacing and editing and a feeling of involvement in the <UNK> what starts out as an intriguing mystery with a kidnapping and unknown motives turns into a slow <UNK> pointless exercise nothing much really happens and the so called character driven angles as expressed by the director in his commentary really don't add up to much br br fine actors are wasted here robert redford does his best trying to engage and <UNK> willem dafoe dafoe brings a bit of nuance to his character <UNK> as one can feel somewhat sympathetic towards him it's unfortunate that dafoe has been <UNK> as a villain he's gone into the christopher walken hall of fame of <UNK> br br wendy <UNK> is usually good but her character's entry into the movie was brief and contrived and i was wondering why they even bothered to introduce her character by far the biggest waste of talent was helen <UNK> in the director's commentary all i heard was how fabulous a talent she is i agree she's a great actress then why was she not used properly only towards the climax of this movie does she get to show herself but by then the viewer has quit caring br br too bad i liked parts of this movie but as another reviewer wrote once you're halfway in you know the film is not going to get much better
<START> this film was released soon after the conan films a sort of female conan red <UNK> played by <UNK> ex wife <UNK> <UNK> she's not a very good actress unfortunately as proved in rocky iv and <UNK> the whole film feels cheap but strangely arnold appears in this film but not as conan although he looks acts and fights like conan from the two conan films i don't know what thats about anyway he only appears about every twenty minutes and doesn't hang around for long maybe arnold filmed this in his time off from filming conan the <UNK> or something anyway the film is way to slow and boring for an action film skip this and watch conan the barbarian instead
<START> the movie was supposed to release in 2002 and was much <UNK> due to the <UNK> but it finally released in 2003 after the producer died br br the movie is good in parts but overall isn't great br br the scenes between <UNK> and ajay are okay but the other scenes are not well handled br br the film is too similar to bollywood hollywood and though this was planned before that got released first so originality is lost br br <UNK> disappoints overall after br br music is good but too many songs br br ajay <UNK> looks jaded and his appearance gives away that the film was <UNK> and his acting looks boring too <UNK> is good <UNK> is good too rest are okay
<START> there are very few films that are able to tell such a complicated story on so many levels as well as <UNK> a life in four chapters one of the most difficult aspects of story telling is the ability to flashback and forward without losing the pace of the film this film not only flashes back and fourth with the greatest of easy but it also flows through some of <UNK> <UNK> greatest stories this film <UNK> in every aspect and is a joy to watch not to mention the incredible philip glass soundtrack
<START> a <UNK> craven movie from 1995 directed by joe <UNK> and starring lance <UNK> a group of scientists save a dying man they find by their desert stranded government <UNK> by <UNK> him with their experimental virus of course one of their colleagues goes overboard and the virus transforms the man into a near <UNK> monster with them trapped inside lance <UNK> plays the morally offended <UNK> who leaves the project before all this but returns after receiving a call for help to save the man pre <UNK> death machine <UNK> br br deciding to combine two <UNK> in one he brings his family along with him they're going on vacation afterwards and proceeds to give them entry to the top secret government facility thus putting them right in the middle of the chaos within in case you can't tell this one relies on the viewer to work with it a little and put aside some petty see major and blatant details br br overall though watch able with mild bits of enjoyment note the <UNK> is <UNK> known under the title <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this <UNK> classic about a kung fu mama who travels to hong kong to avenge her brother's death offers everything you learned to expect from the genre <UNK> <UNK> bell with a giant <UNK> really kicks ass and usually loses her clothes very quickly if you don't take it all too seriously the movie is great fun to watch stan shaw gives a solid performance <UNK> bell is a little less convincing pam <UNK> she ain't br br this is where quentin tarantino got his idea for the light switch scene in jackie brown from br br the soundtrack by don julian is a gem and is frequently used in rap songs
<START> extremely entertaining mid 1950's western that packs a whole lot into just a <UNK> minute running time most viewers will quickly get drawn into this story and will find the experience quite enjoyable more than just a b western but not really an epic the budget was modest and the cast <UNK> despite several big names glenn ford was the only box office draw at the time edward g robinson and barbara stanwyck were past their <UNK> and looking for work stanwyck was 10 years away from a new popularity in the big valley brian keith and <UNK> foster were just starting out br br ford plays john <UNK> a small <UNK> who decides to sell out when the sympathetic sheriff is murdered by the big robinson hired <UNK> <UNK> is a former <UNK> officer who only moved out west for health reasons br br robinson plays lee who already owns most of the valley and <UNK> to <UNK> the rest making good on a promise to his wife martha stanwyck lee was crippled in a land war he fought 12 years earlier his brother cole keith has come up from texas to help him run the huge spread lee has been turning a blind eye to obvious between stanwyck and keith but sensitive daughter <UNK> foster is understandably upset by what is going on in their home br br john <UNK> has promised his fiancée caroline may that he will move back east caroline who is <UNK> on grace kelly's high <UNK> character breaks off the engagement at the first sign of trouble and simply disappears from the film this leaves the way open for a john and <UNK> romance to develop br br the violence starts early and continues throughout the film with <UNK> able to apply military tactics against an enemy who <UNK> his ability and determination he has a very original confrontation with the main <UNK> about <UNK> into the film ford plays one of his standard characters the modest guy who <UNK> everyone with a self <UNK> manner who is slow to take offense but brutal when finally <UNK> very much like his role in the br br robinson is likewise excellent as a man who maintains his personal integrity even though physically just a shadow of his former self and he gets enough lines and screen time to adequately develop his character br br stanwyck has the most difficult role and she is simply not convincing as the classic two faced woman a seemingly loyal wife who is scheming to replace her husband with his brother in part this is because she is not <UNK> enough time to do anything more than <UNK> convey either side of the character that said a talented actress could have done a much better job even with these limitations br br <UNK> foster is a pleasant surprise she should remind viewers a lot of <UNK> baker both physically and in acting style although required to play <UNK> according to 1950's convention she is allowed to be tough but then required to break into <UNK> after each major confrontation foster shows a nice range she conveys a growing attraction for <UNK> but does it so subtly that it is only in retrospect that the various clues click into place br br the real problem with the violent men is that it tries to be both an action western and a character study morality play because so much has to happen on the screen much of the action is rushed and many of the characters get only a <UNK> treatment this is neither fatal flaw nor a reason to avoid the film but it could have been significantly better with another 20 minutes of running time or the absence of unnecessary characters like caroline br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> okay i love this movie i watched it over and over again it is so hard to tell who the <UNK> is you keep thinking it's one person then another then back to the first person then another person it is so suspense full you want to fast forward your tv to the end to see who it is br br summary <UNK> <UNK> is raped and left at her home she is in the hospital and begins to tell the story of how she was raped it goes from her meeting her steady boyfriend to her teacher who takes a liking to her to her ex boyfriend all different stories all suspects but who did it br br i love the acting they have a lot of great talent in here the suspense is wonderful and the settings are superb if it comes on tv watch it 1 2 stars 10 10
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was seemingly born to fill the role of <UNK> philadelphia gordon in this story that is often compared with margaret <UNK> american civil war classic gone with the wind waters heaven tonight is in arguably his best role also as her love interest and the two leads head a wonderful australian cast in this arguably the most well known and best loved of australian miniseries it's br br an outstanding production all round though don't try watching all of it in one hit and it deserves to be remembered as a magnificent portrayal of life in pre <UNK> australia rating 8 10
<START> ok when i rented this several years ago i had the worst expectations yes the acting isn't great and the picture itself looks dated but as i sat there a strange thing happened i started to like it the action is great and there are few scenes that make you jump <UNK> james maybe one of the greatest b grade actors next to bruce campbell is great as always the story isn't bad either now i wouldn't rush out and buy it but you won't waste your time at least watching this good b grade post apocalyptic western
<START> the best horror sci fi movie i have ever seen i was myself in the <UNK> working for canadian government in a small northern station when i see this movie for the first time needless to say i was in the mood
<START> seriously disappointing performance by brad pitt and q t the plot is very superficial and lame and unless <UNK> intended this film actually <UNK> the nazis and portrays them as men of honor and show that the jewish people are <UNK> cant keep promises and bloody vicious the following contains spoiler hitler together with the most notorious nazis are attending a stupid plot less movie about the killing of 300 italian soldiers in a small cinema theater in paris is unbelievably ridiculous the nazis laughing and each killing in the movie as if watching a basketball game stupid the deal at the end is lame whats really appalling is that the movie earned great reviews and is <UNK> here in the 40s amongst the greatest 250 films will not be surprised if it <UNK> many awards including oscars as well the movie is simply a kissing ass to the jewish people but hey <UNK> its not even doing a great job doing that it truly <UNK> the whole nazi jews conflict and a pure insult to all who fought and suffered from the <UNK> of the nazis
<START> i like this movie i may be biased because i love <UNK> however my 3 and 4 <UNK> old will sit and watch the whole movie it's not oscar material but definitely entertaining the <UNK> cinematography is well done with a beautiful backdrop of ocean scenery and <UNK> my favorite scene is when <UNK> <UNK> the pop can out of the water striking sandy in the head it's an endearing funny moment that makes me laugh every time on the other hand the villainous of the bully forget his name are a little hard to take and the shark scene is far from reality question do <UNK> really make that much noise or is there some serious dubbing happening here bottom line my kids like it and it keeps <UNK> through our vcr
<START> unbelievably disappointed the pace was slow the characters unbelievable and throughout the film as a whole just let me feel bored and <UNK> there was no real plot that could keep you revolving around the film and keep you interested the heist itself never offered any excitement and didn't seem very well though through br br there was not enough depth or background to any character and character was one i eagerly <UNK> for unfortunately has no idea how to play the <UNK> and is much preferred as a likable character <UNK> short one of my favourite actors in <UNK> the yard let me down with his performance his character was dark and you could hardly see what drove his reasoning br br the only character i think offered anything to the film was milo <UNK> peter in heroes though his character quite small and insignificant i think his touch added to an all around dull film br br in conclusion buy the dvd if you want to find a new way to waste your time
<START> wow did this episode start on a premise the enterprise is along when all of the sudden abraham lincoln is floating around in space and <UNK> the enterprise is it just me or is this a really lame <UNK> idea lincoln comes aboard and they welcome them <UNK> suggests they <UNK> down to some <UNK> planet where they meet other famous dead folks both good and evil it seems that a really cheesy looking rock monster has assembled a team of good and evil people to battle it out for supremacy the whole thing seems really <UNK> and <UNK> unfair as the good side is <UNK> with a <UNK> who makes gandhi seem like rambo despite a totally awful premise the action is pretty good and it's great to see <UNK> shots of obvious <UNK> fighting it out in this grudge match but don't mistake this for high art or deep sci fi the bottom line is that the series was on its last legs as a first run series and this really looked like they <UNK> off this turkey and filmed it regardless of the absurdity of the premise
<START> in moments of desperation were willing to do whatever it takes to win i loved how the <UNK> leaves <UNK> was used as a <UNK> basis for bobby and <UNK> the acting was accurate by far superior from the <UNK> <UNK> given by the film industry br br great editing at the end of the short i felt it was a bit <UNK> but so is life and this is were life and art <UNK> into cinematic masterpiece br br excuse me while i <UNK> off the cheese <UNK> but i guess it's acceptable at certain times br br two scenes which i must point out are the bath <UNK> and the couch scene br br the couch scene for <UNK> was a defining moment and <UNK> of the human condition throughout the short i viewed her as a <UNK> but now we see her true reality her mind spoke before her heart need i say more about the bath <UNK> scene
<START> hoot is about these three teenage kids who try to save a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> now to me i thinks that right they stand up to whats right and whats wrong in this film a kid name roy <UNK> logan <UNK> moved from montana to florida and once he gets on the bus a bully name dana starts bullying him finally the next day roy punches the bully and runs off the bus chasing the mysterious running boy after all that roy finally meets the running boy who's name is <UNK> fingers cody well actually his <UNK> his step sister <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gave it to him because he can catch <UNK> with his bare hands anyway <UNK> fingers and roy becomes friends and they join together with <UNK> to stop the construction of a new <UNK> restaurant <UNK> fingers is the one behind all the that happened there and also later he gets bit by one of the dogs that put there to guard the construction site so they stood up to the that was driving the <UNK> and everybody got to see the <UNK> it turned out to be a great movie because it showed where kids can make a difference in life by standing up to whats right and whats wrong thats what is great about this movie it teaches a lot to everyone about <UNK> and how important it is
<START> another awful movie from hollywood this time a female helps the revolution in a central american country yeah yeah yeah hey lets make a movie without any sense of realism at all i am so sick of movies like this one the actors and actresses are lousy the effects are cheesy and the dialog horrible and suddenly i see john rhys davies as the evil president from <UNK> to hugo louis <UNK> i bet he is very proud of this well i shouldn't have expected much of this movie and i didn't and i am glad cause this sucks <UNK> i wonder what kind of people who like this movie my guess is younger people aged 12 16 and i guess some people like because of <UNK> <UNK> well i am in neither of those group and i hate it rating 2
<START> i saw heaven ship at the 2006 cinema <UNK> festival in italy what a great movie this danish <UNK> saga is the stirring tale of the first trip to mars in an era when <UNK> hasn't been <UNK> the spaceship hasn't got a radio and the heroes are brought back from the landing field via even the <UNK> are delightful some of them written in <UNK> in the original danish br br the actors' performances are laughable largely hand to brow <UNK> but the sets are astonishing easily <UNK> anything done by georges <UNK> a decade earlier or in die <UNK> im a decade later of course the plot is simplistic the crew consist of seven thin guys and one fat <UNK> guess which one cracks interestingly everyone in this movie except the dubious professor <UNK> believes in god even the martians br br <UNK> the <UNK> have the sense to acknowledge that a trip to mars is no the title cards establish that it takes the scientists two years to build their spaceship which has an and six months to reach mars during the construction sequence there's one extremely impressive set up which must have been choreographed dozens of workers all <UNK> through the in different directions with no and no <UNK> the danish scientists <UNK> their ship <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and set course for mars even though the moon and <UNK> are closer when the ship which flies not <UNK> lands on mars it is <UNK> by martians who turn out to be <UNK> <UNK> all highly developed <UNK> and <UNK> as a highly developed meat eater i <UNK> that part br br conveniently enough mars turns out to have an atmosphere just like <UNK> as well as equal gravity in an exterior shot of the martian landscape the <UNK> apparent <UNK> when seen from mars is the same as it is when viewed from earth i also couldn't help <UNK> that all the wise elder martians are male in fact female <UNK> are thin on the ground here both the earth born hero and the martian maiden are the martians speak a universal language wear on their <UNK> and <UNK> the earth <UNK> with a globe of earth which of course they hold with its north pole <UNK> br br that martian maiden is played by an <UNK> beautiful danish actress <UNK> i'll have some of that danish we see a martian dance of <UNK> which might have been <UNK> or ludicrous but is actually quite touching and beautiful also the martian funeral scene features one shot which reminded me of a sequence in the seventh seal i wonder if <UNK> bergman saw this film br br has a few flaws but its production design and its other merits very far <UNK> its <UNK> the <UNK> olsen who is named in the credits and who appears in a brief prologue is no relation to <UNK> <UNK> vaudeville partner from i would give a 12 but the scale tops off at 10 so a full 10 out of 10 for this delightful trip to mars the blonde planet
<START> this isn't a very good movie but it is easily the best troma studios film i have ever viewed lloyd kaufman the brains behind troma isn't concerned with a good plot or even making a moderately entertaining film his chief concern is making something bizarre and his definition of bizarre <UNK> mirrors my definition of terrible cinema br br in this film we have the titled character <UNK> whose favorite <UNK> isn't baseball but biting the heads off of <UNK> receiving his release from <UNK> the board has deemed him <UNK> despite the fact that he doesn't speak he merely like a chicken and has a set of <UNK> <UNK> at his <UNK> of course once <UNK> is set free he goes about causing mayhem first at a <UNK> store and later at a farm house br br violence lots of violence in this <UNK> tasteless flick <UNK> sinks his <UNK> <UNK> into a poor elderly lady waiting at a bus stop and then spends the rest of the film <UNK> the mother and daughter at the <UNK> br br nudity <UNK> <UNK> delivers some noteworthy skin in his picture as the former lois lane i can't recall which superman edition she was from gives us a shower scene followed by a romp in bed with her boyfriend a guy who just doesn't have any chemistry with ms <UNK> the extended shower scene footage in the dvd extras gives the viewer quite a bit more of <UNK> she is quite something br br story <UNK> screenplay may just be the worst ever written the way in which <UNK> is released from the asylum completely throws all credibility out the window his dialogue is something that a pre <UNK> might write and the actions he writes for his characters border on the absurd it's as if styles spent ten years without human contact and completely forgot how people react in certain situations br br acting the film belongs to edward terry who actually does a decent job as the geek he is quite menacing in a stupid <UNK> fashion joan roth as the mother does a super job in support but <UNK> and her <UNK> lack of chemistry made their roles awkward at best
<START> i stumbled across this film while channel surfing and was blown away it was being broadcast on a lesser known short films program here in australia br br it has been a long time since i have been so impressed by a film especially one so short br br the power of the story the quality of the acting and the stunning cinematography wow if it were available it would make a very worthy addition to my dvd collection br br i am undoubtedly impressed and i will look forward to joshua next film br br an exceptional experience 10 10
<START> with sam <UNK> in the title role and with david <UNK> as <UNK> is an example of the <UNK> at its very finest well written well acted by actors who bear a believable resemblance to their historical characters highly informative and very entertaining the set designs and costumes capture the feel of the us during world war 2 and the plotting and dialog make the viewer feel as if he were really present at los and caught up in the excitement of the manhattan project the only downside is that this is a british production and some of the actors lack skill in affecting a convincing american accent the skill of current day australian irish actors taking on non native <UNK> is amazing the storyline is fully consistent with richard definitive history of the development of the atomic bomb sadly the mini series was shown only a couple of times on <UNK> at the beginning of the 1980s and then apparently <UNK> into oblivion br br <UNK> <UNK> to the more recent <UNK> man little <UNK> feature film with paul newman as leslie the <UNK> overweight and rather <UNK> general would be thoroughly <UNK> and dwight <UNK> <UNK> of tv's 'a <UNK> as <UNK> as a mini series is around <UNK> as long as the newman feature but uses the all of the additional time completely to its advantage
<START> i'm only going to write more because it's required however the summary i put at the top is way too <UNK> for what this film was you pretty much know who's in on it from the beginning in spite of its attempts at plot twists and turns acting <UNK> trying hard to have looks of shock and <UNK> when a twist happens you never really need to wonder in this <UNK> br br the more i write the more i feel bad that i have to write so much in order to have a comment but rules are rules i really feel bad about saying this but this is the lowest i've ever rated a movie i think it makes me wonder what i'm saving votes of 1 and 2 for however i thought this film deserved a 3 since i believe there was some talent in the film <UNK> <UNK> or is it watson did a pretty good job she was crying and <UNK> in one part and i thought she conveyed that emotion well the man who played the character that was 'the did well too for his short part br br many of the actors did an <UNK> job but the lead actor david forget his last name terrible with names was pretty bad i think he must have thought he was doing dramatic displays for 'the young and the <UNK> or of our <UNK> if you try you can just picture him in a white lab coat playing a doctor with multiple personalities on it doesn't help that the movie is even shot like a daytime soap although i'm pretty sure i could shoot this same movie with a camcorder though without the obvious and sound editing br br first time i ever thought the money to rent this movie was wasted though i wouldn't watch it again unless i was paid a large sum of money
<START> assault on <UNK> 13 3 10 let us forget for a moment that assault on <UNK> 13 is a remake of a classic action movie taken completely on its own merits assault is a <UNK> br br lets start with the <UNK> bravo style scenario about a dozen people are trapped in a <UNK> police station in detroit if the detroit location is giving you <UNK> warm and <UNK> stop right now it could have easily said <UNK> in the opening credits and nothing would have changed in fact the last bit in the forest would have made more sense surrounding them are our bad guys corrupt cops br br now i know what your thinking corrupt cops were the nazis and drug <UNK> busy that weekend of course these are no ordinary cops these guys are right of the cover of the latest tom <UNK> video game <UNK> we have body armor <UNK> laser sights night vision <UNK> the works so we have thirty s w a t members special forces armed to the teeth <UNK> 4 cops drunk mind you it's new years eve 2 girls in party dresses and half a dozen criminals br br so how do our heroes defend themselves truth is they can't they all should be dead within ten minutes tops not to mention the characters inside have an annoying habit of walking past the windows now an illogical scenario is no reason to completely pan a movie <UNK> a b style action film however with the exception of laurence fishburne and ethan hawke all the other characters seemed to be comic relief at least i hope they were br br while <UNK> rules and <UNK> characters are bad enough it's <UNK> show that takes the cake rarely has a more stereotypical african american character appeared on the modern screen her performance resembles a frat boy in <UNK> and drag acting ghetto br br in the original assault a gang member takes over an ice cream truck and drives around the neighborhood shooting little girls in the head i have had an irrational fear of ice cream <UNK> ever since after this assault i have a perfectly rational fear of remakes
<START> as much as 'the <UNK> showed that we're still going to get classic x files drive showed that the x files was going to explore new territory they start by giving us a unique <UNK> to drive with the news camera footage it was an interesting transition from the the tv to the real events i would've liked it even better if they had kept that news footage camera for the entire <UNK> and not cut to the inside of the car upon viewing this episode live back in 1998 i was thinking am i on the right channel that first <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> me with big words that i don't understand i think she learned her lesson to always wear a mask before performing an <UNK> silly <UNK> what is the deal with the lighting in the <UNK> lab it's as dark as a tomb in there how are they supposed to see what they're doing in there assistant director gets his first lines in this episode i have no love lost for that man he is the third recurring character in a row that is introduced that you love to hate the first two being diana and jeffrey <UNK> i guess the producers felt that there was too much love going on for <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> so they needed to add some characters to give our favorite agents some grief and <UNK> our <UNK> as fans i love the <UNK> suits worn by <UNK> and her team with the cool helmet light <UNK> boy it's really <UNK> or <UNK> in dry northern <UNK> at night can we say the word effect drive is a cool episode but looking at route <UNK> on my u s <UNK> there's no way <UNK> could've <UNK> a speed of 70 100 <UNK> on that road if he had been on i 80 the <UNK> maybe but no way on a state road with that many <UNK> all of the filming inside the car looked very authentic excellent job by rob <UNK> it looks nothing like the old days of the obvious blue screen or clip of passing scenery outside a car window on a stage this was a fun episode but some of the inaccuracies keep it from being a great episode it keeps you on the edge of your seat so hold on for a fast ride
<START> i hate to say i enjoyed this movie as the subject matter does not lend itself to enjoyment however i was moved by the way the family relationships were portrayed and the sincerity of the performances it was the kind of film i told all my friends and family to experience as a reminder of how important we all are to each other
<START> one true thing is a very quiet film that opened in the fall of 1998 to glowing reviews but mild box office it tells the crippled story of ellen <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> who is forced to move back home to take care of her <UNK> ill mother meryl streep so that her <UNK> father william hurt can run his academic department these terms are only general the strength of one true thing lies in the way the actors elevate their characters above hollywood cliché territory br br streep is kate the perfect <UNK> whose ability to light up a room with her charm is evident in her opening scenes at a costume party celebrating <UNK> birthday but ellen has never been close to her mother and since she <UNK> from <UNK> university has a certain about her ellen almost thinks her mother is a simplistic air head while on the other hand she <UNK> her father who shares a special passion writing ellen writes for an aggressive new york firm and is almost <UNK> when her latest piece is torn down by hurt who seems to be a very lonely figure br br to get to the point as kate gets <UNK> <UNK> perspectives change and she grows closer to her mother and more distant to her father hurt keeps making excuses not to be there when the family needs him most and ellen assumes he's having an affair meanwhile she's given up her desk at work to spend time doing craft activities with her mother's cult group the and also learning that her mother isn't as weak as she first assumed br br without giving too much away one true thing is a masterpiece in character study streep once again turns in a beautiful performance this time working on a subtle level that starts slow but ends with a brilliant speech on the <UNK> of marriage streep earned her <UNK> oscar nomination for this performance hurt is also convincing as the father who carries a secret that isn't revealed until the closing moments but it is <UNK> <UNK> who steals this movie forget chicago cold mountain bridget <UNK> diary or whatever else you've seen her do and rent this movie she is remarkable in it working within her character's bitter <UNK> at understanding her parents <UNK> manages a realistic portrayal of a young woman fighting to keep her lip up while she's screaming inside
<START> it was a very well written movie and the actors had a very exquisite way of portraying all the character but as the movie came to an end i felt as if there was more but they forgot to put it on the dvd maybe they are planning on making a sequel well even if they don't it's a good movie and a good rental but even a better purchase
<START> ugh unfortunately this is one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time none of the characters are remotely likable which makes this film difficult to watch they're all miserable thirty year olds who don't take responsibility for their crummy lives i was only able to make it through a half hour of the film so there's a chance things got better afterward but i doubt it i can't imagine five people as self absorbed as they are would manage to remain friends with each other for ten years br br three sex scenes in the first half hour were also disappointing as they had no relevance to the plot and were clearly a gratuitous failed attempt to bring some life to this otherwise dull film br br save your time and money and skip this movie
<START> actor turned director bill paxton follows up his promising debut the gothic horror <UNK> with this family friendly sports drama about the <UNK> u s open where a young american <UNK> rises from his humble background to play against his idol in what was dubbed as the greatest game ever played i'm no fan of golf and these <UNK> underdog sports flicks are a dime a dozen most recently done to grand effect with miracle and cinderella man but some how this film was enthralling all the same br br the film starts with some creative opening credits imagine a <UNK> version of the animated opening credits of <UNK> <UNK> and rome but <UNK> along slowly for its first by the numbers hour once the action moves to the u s open things pick up very well paxton does a nice job and shows a knack for effective directorial <UNK> i loved the rain <UNK> montage of the action on day two of the open that <UNK> the plot further or add some unexpected psychological depth to the proceedings there's some compelling character development when the british harry is haunted by images of the <UNK> in black suits and top hats who destroyed his family <UNK> as a child to make way for a golf course he also does a good job of visually depicting what goes on in the <UNK> heads under pressure golf a painfully boring sport is brought vividly alive here credit should also be given the set <UNK> and costume department for creating an engaging period piece atmosphere of london and boston at the beginning of the <UNK> century br br you know how this is going to end not only because it's based on a true story but also because films in this genre follow the same <UNK> over and over but paxton puts on a better than average show and perhaps <UNK> more talent behind the camera than he ever had in front of it despite the formulaic nature this is a nice and easy film to root for that deserves to find an audience
<START> the first time i saw <UNK> of satan i was 12 <UNK> old i saw it in a little town in central washington state it played before tales from the crypt which we left early because my sisters were already scared from the <UNK> of satan all in all i thought it was a pretty good movie the beginning was good we had just sat down and that tank did a number on that station <UNK> br br what struck me about the movie was the scenery around the town in which it was filmed it looked almost like the area around <UNK> where i saw the movie especially when they were driving towards the town of which is the location of the movie a small town in <UNK> new mexico i have always liked jones and martin and also charles <UNK> who was on get smart another show i like i gave the movie a 7 and later on when i did get to see tales from the crypt i thought <UNK> of satan was better
<START> this movie is quite bad aggressive not played well not directed well seems low budget low quality weak and <UNK> after watching earlier comments went to see it but if u try to compare it with apocalypse now platoon or any others <UNK> really off the tracks this movie looks like a 60's old and purely made film with cast of grown <UNK> not to mention or actually do not paying attention to details like changing rounds low budget fireworks and all sorts of poorly filmed characteristic is watchable though if like to see it as an early development of the movies document not to go back br br p s <UNK> the guys are quite alright
<START> tedium as only the french can do it i checked my watch for the first time 7 minutes in and with minutes left i also considered walking out i won't even try to discuss the <UNK> of the plot or the inability of the characters to be <UNK> because at about 1 hour in i realized none of this <UNK> it was not merely self indulgent or pretentious it was a <UNK> a soul sucking <UNK> this film has no saving grace no enjoyable character nothing funny and nothing sad it isn't smart enough to be drama and there's no moment that's in the slightest bit <UNK> the most intriguing thing about this movie is how it has managed to get mostly glowing and positive reviews i was tricked by those reviews but you don't have to be gentle reader all i want for christmas is my three hours back
<START> i've never seen a show with as much story mystery suspense and hard hitting excitement before i <UNK> watch tv anymore but i own every season of this show and it's amazing every episode is extremely well acted written and plotted towards the end of the show i felt that the stories were getting too far fetched for being in a prison but the actors pulled it off sucks huge compared to oz in fact any show that is on a cable network hbo or not just cant hold a candle to oz i wish it would come back for one more season if it did happen they would probably kill off every character on the show but hey we all gotta go sometime as far as the characters i'd say <UNK> and were my favorites both were in a scene together but their individual stories i thought were the strongest of <UNK> except of course but still anyway best show ever best network ever some of the best actors ever period
<START> a beautiful magical thought provoking and heart warming story excellent direction perfect cast marvellous script excellent score beautifully lit need i say more br br if you love films that not only make you think but also warm your heart some that spring to mind are of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> then you're sure to love k <UNK> br br most highly recommended
<START> my first film saw it on <UNK> long ago and loved it it seemed absolutely artistic original fun and hilarious not a moment in the film let me down or made me bored and i was laughing a lot or had a smile on my face i mean this movie is truly funny but here's the catch it's also very artistic and creative if you don't know probably sadly because so many of his great films aren't available here he has a very original style like no one else's and for me this isn't even my favorite film of his right now it's the insane also i have to say as a russian this film is great because you really do see what russians are like and this is possible because this is a true russian film to me not a foreign film trying to be american or trying to appeal did not sell out nor has he since 1998 was as good if not better this is true russian style <UNK> that came out of communist social realism br br if you liked this film i think you have a very high chance of loving other films in fact i like quite a few of them more than this one i guess this one is his most accessible film a similar film is <UNK> taking place 6 years before during <UNK> it has the same actor in the leading role and more of <UNK> who you will recognize from window to paris this one has one supernatural twist in the end but is mostly a realistic comedy a great one <UNK> hopefully <UNK> will hook all of his movies up one day he's still working and his <UNK> is so great see any of his films if you can
<START> this <UNK> <UNK> absolutely no light on what it would be like to be <UNK> during the hard knock life tour granted i wasn't there but watching this film didn't make me feel like i was and for a film like this that's not exactly a compliment the whole time i watched it all i could think was what are they leaving out when it's all over the only <UNK> you feel like you have some insight into is and that's mainly because he just talks about his dogs a waste of time br br 3 10
<START> i first saw this film in 1959 at the <UNK> double bay cinema in sydney when fifteen years old i loved it then and still do the ensemble cast is great in those days the actors acted naturally and you felt for them in the respective roles a glossy film of the period the relationships <UNK> still relevant to today's world but now the <UNK> are on the same level women would not or should not allow the type of treatment displayed in the past the soundtrack music is wonderful and it is a delight that film score <UNK> released the cd in january 2005 pity scenes were cut prior to release even at two hours you want more i have <UNK> with amazon for the dvd they do now have a special page to view this film in <UNK> after forty six years of pan and <UNK> will be great <UNK> century fox please look further into your of fifties <UNK> productions for dvd there is a large market out there i <UNK> arrival from us of march 2004 vanity fair special article on the film which is said to be fifteen pages with many photos on set cheers
<START> this film an early william <UNK> has an important message particularly today it <UNK> the notion that sometimes there are things more important than your own personal or well being the film which has walter huston as the lead is stolen by the performance of <UNK> sales as <UNK> he's the most completely drawn character in the film and a joy to watch you'll recognize some familiar faces if you watch many movies from the and <UNK> your time to watch if you get the opportunity recommended
<START> i don't think i'm spoiling anyone's experience of this film by telling you not to see it if you have anything better to do like clean under the <UNK> it gets dirty under there and you've gotta clean it sometime br br i think the movie suffers from a lack of sex and violence though there is one car chase stunt that looks so dangerous it could only have been filmed in a country where life is cheaper than beer <UNK> 's heart is in the right place but its aspirations are conservative it is at least not pretentious but i had a great time acting in it playing the <UNK> idiot in the horror movie who says what's down this hole and dies for his <UNK> plus i got to meet michael <UNK> every film <UNK> should work with a b movie <UNK> at least once before death and <UNK> are the <UNK> people i've met literally the <UNK> walk down the street in if 7 of every 10 women aren't absolutely beautiful you're walking down a street i didn't come across and be <UNK> by the fact that at least 5 of the 10 are available for drinks br br part of the film was shot in <UNK> radio an abandoned unfinished classic communist <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> nightmare originally intended to house <UNK> propaganda i e radio not so free europe the <UNK> five stories tall and takes up a city block best of all while its <UNK> <UNK> big state <UNK> it <UNK> near the city center like a post apocalyptic ruin in a jungle of <UNK> and <UNK> by dozens of <UNK> and scores of wild dogs construction on <UNK> radio was suspended when and his wife were executed on tv in 1989 and still there are <UNK> holes that drop from the sun baked top floor offering surreal <UNK> of a modern quarter mile stretch of <UNK> roof <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> and old car parts <UNK> a <UNK> ancient city all the way down to the <UNK> creepy sub basement which <UNK> in the film for the <UNK> <UNK> no american style or warning signs for br br since the demise of the soviet union <UNK> radio has <UNK> several non union film shoots including <UNK> iii it is attractive to producers because it's a cheap location massive in terms of scale and available space bizarre looking and free of insurance <UNK> as it's still state property plus no one complains if you don't clean up after your production anything left is <UNK> into the resident construction of their <UNK> town in this actual urban jungle br br an assistant director was bitten bloody by a wild dog during the shoot of <UNK> the <UNK> provided by <UNK> were pressed into service by cast and crew as <UNK> in order to keep the <UNK> dogs at bay i too was bitten by wild dogs in once in a bar and once in a city park i also survived two car <UNK> in two weeks both in <UNK> and neither of which was seen by the drivers involved as grounds for stopping the cars br br geek note the sci fi network or channel or whatever was one of the <UNK> of this film the smaller the budget the more producers on set so it's a little weird that nobody had a problem with the original title <UNK> until it was almost time to show it on the network even though sci fi already had an unrelated series of that name the title was changed sometime relatively close to release as i have a color <UNK> copy labeled with the former title
<START> this film plays like a demented episode of <UNK> where are they now or behind the music in the first half of the movie that depict his glory days <UNK> hoffman is unintentionally portrayed as a sort of <UNK> rock star you know the kind the lead singer the pretty boy who didn't write any of the music doesn't have a clue but gets all the glory for nothing and chicks for free consequently he takes his success for granted <UNK> it and ultimately destroys it along with himself indeed <UNK> glory days ended abruptly when he was <UNK> for dealing cocaine <UNK> <UNK> and went into hiding br br the second part of the movie deals with that time in hiding in it we see hoffman as a pathetic <UNK> endlessly <UNK> everyone anyone but himself for his downfall eventually the times pass him by completely and he can never to come to grips with that how sad the end end credits roll and oh no we learn that <UNK> hoffman eventually committed suicide in 1989 br br i'm sure this is not the image the filmmakers intended for hoffman in making this movie given that tom hayden and <UNK> were involved i'm sure they intended this film as some kind of homage to the life of a man who was after all an icon of the 60's and of the anti war movement in this they have failed miserably the film presents <UNK> hoffman as a mindless caricature we are never told about what drives him how did he arrive at his views how did he manage to capture the imagination of a whole generation how did he <UNK> such a vast movement why at the height of his fame did he get involved in dealing cocaine why who knows and since the filmmakers don't seem to ultimately who cares
<START> the worst movie i have ever seen the sound quality was bad the cutting of the scenes was even worse and above all it was not logic and it had no speed br br i first <UNK> oh no i don't want the trail that proves that poor patrick was an innocent killer but this turned out to be even worse typically in this american film you get a super hint or no hints at all i want very tiny small hints that direct you to the killer the audience isn't involved and now when i don't get any hints at all you can expect a several 's he is the <UNK> <UNK> in the end and that is not all ah this is hopeless lets make an end to it br br in one word disgusting br br
<START> nothing about this movie is any good it's a formulaic predictable romantic comedy <UNK> to make females force their significant others to watch in other words it's a predictable <UNK> flick that is neither comedic or romantic and is extraordinarily forgettable if you like watching the same thing over and over then this movie will fit just perfect i was also forced to watch this with my g f at the time and it's no surprise we are no longer together i enjoy great movies that are wonderful to watch while she just wants to see the same thing over and over again just with different actors nothing good to say about this movie the title says it all 1 10 one b c i can't give it a zero
<START> i usually don't consider turning a movie off unless it's really bad <UNK> is a movie i wish i hadn't even turned on the plot is interesting but the acting and writing are too low key i didn't care about the characters any movie that has drug use and gratuitous nudity as its highlights is not worthy of praise the characters spent their time getting high and believe me that's the only way to sit through this movie
<START> about the movie itself there are ample comments br br i just wanted to say something about the german version which i have seen recently on tv it is heavily cut from <UNK> to <UNK> minutes it is usual that the most bloody scenes are cut for german tv i understand the reasons for that but this movie was something else they did not only cut gore shots they have cut entire sequences <UNK> only glimpses like we have to attack them one 5 second shot of explosions in the camp protagonist running away br br when the assault on the island begins it isn't even possible anymore to follow the storyline all the cuts create something that amounts to a string of <UNK> <UNK> scenes that don't make any sense anymore br br i could not stand to watch the end after spending 60 minutes on this nonsense br br i think i would have given the original 7 10 the german version is worth only 1 10 br br get it on dvd and check the runtime first or forget about it
<START> in his feature film debut yellow ' chris chan lee attempts to <UNK> hollywood's portrayal of asian americans by <UNK> from the stereotypes typically depicted in mainstream film however in so doing lee commits a far more <UNK> crime he <UNK> asian <UNK> own stereotypes of themselves to the point of <UNK> the result dreadfully one dimensional characters and an outrageously shallow script <UNK> the cast into a frenzy of over acting ultimately resulting in a film that is physically painful to watch br br don't be <UNK> by any of the positive reviews garnered by each falls into one of two camps in one corner e g right here on imdb com you find asian americans who are so <UNK> that an asian character can be depicted <UNK> without thick glasses and a <UNK> book that they somehow neglect the idiocy of lee's final product on the other hand you find movie critics who have simply presumed that it'd be <UNK> to give the <UNK> bashing that it deserves after all it's an edgy asian american film made by an independent asian american filmmaker <UNK> territory for now br br case example main character sin lee michael <UNK> writer director lee <UNK> a monumental feat with sin by editing in such a way that sin never appears <UNK> unless he is either <UNK> or yelling see sin his <UNK> support <UNK> see sin walk along the beach and <UNK> <UNK> yelling ensues see sin closing up his father's shop <UNK> see sin <UNK> <UNK> see sin breathing <UNK> br br gee i wonder if sin is full of asian american angst do you think i'm not sure <UNK> <UNK> br br just to be <UNK> lee introduces us to father lee soon oh throughout the movie whereas sin simply <UNK> or yells mr lee <UNK> and yells in fact this is principal role in <UNK> <UNK> and yelling br br gee i wonder if is an asian father with an authority complex do you think i'm not sure <UNK> yell br br if lee's one dimensional characters don't annoy you his story line will meet <UNK> mary <UNK> and joey john <UNK> two characters that exist in this film solely for the purpose of spinning a <UNK> and entirely irrelevant love story into the film you see lee learned in film school that every good movie must include some sort of love related subtext and these two characters allow him to fulfill the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> excruciatingly inane <UNK> dialogue consists of one liner insults culminating in a kiss nerd ' ' eyes meet understanding smile kissing ensues br br but rest assured somewhere out there sin is <UNK> while this all takes place br br that neither <UNK> nor joey contributes in any way whatsoever to the film's plot does not <UNK> me so much as lee's <UNK> on the most hackneyed movie cliches to accomplish his and trust me the <UNK> sequence is just the tip of the iceberg br br towards the end of the film we find lee attempting to explain his constant <UNK> and yelling to girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> in what i am sure lee meant to be a poignant moment what a surprise as <UNK> a <UNK> story about the <UNK> to illustrate his point ripped straight out of <UNK> <UNK> his voice <UNK> in that extra special <UNK> way the camera pans into an obligatory shot of <UNK> hands we feel compelled to roll our eyes except we realize that explanation makes no sense whatsoever but lack of substance didn't stop lee from making the movie so why would he cut this particularly <UNK> scene after all the world can always use another cliché br br well you say the movie may be painful but at least it must be a technical masterpiece say like what dreams may come ' sorry on a technical basis disappoints as well lee's edits are awkward and <UNK> what little rhythm exists in the film at all but i'm sure lee thought they would seem hip to make matters worse every frame is either or <UNK> although the light <UNK> was invented in 1932 somehow the technology didn't make it onto the set br br in light of the film's utter <UNK> supporting actor burt who plays best friend alex performs relatively well although overacts slightly you can't really blame him when lee's script consists solely of <UNK> and yelling <UNK> on the other hand show no restraint in their overacting whatsoever br br i have not seen a film as bad as in a very long time and i truly pray that i will not see a film as bad as for quite some time as well please do not waste see it life is already way too short thank you
<START> 1 thing this movie sucks big time i was into <UNK> comedy when rice war came along but this time even <UNK> well done acting cant pull this one of a total failure of following shaolin soccer next time do <UNK> own thing
<START> there is a famous short story about a man who becomes the prey of a <UNK> hunter who has lost interest in hunting anything except humans its quite good and its been done and <UNK> in film and tv many many times some are notable but this <UNK> version that <UNK> the tired old racism themes just flat out stinks <UNK> slapstick is almost as weak as the unfunny script chaplin this guy isn't there must be people who find a dwarf who cant stop dancing funny i mean i suppose it is funny in a pathetic <UNK> way but its just not enough to carry a movie you have the usual nazi or neo nazi whatever the heck we are supposed to think type villain who's son of course is gay german accents get the picture
<START> before i'd seen this movie i've heard a lot of praise about it and quite many <UNK> about how horrific it was not to take any credit away from this movie i think it wasn't all that horrible or even shocking it's just a movie about people living in the darker side of the town and a good one at portraying the point br br there's some great acting here and a well thought of <UNK> <UNK> is a renowned writer in the <UNK> movie scene and he's the best in what comes to describing the contemporary <UNK> culture albeit he's not the only one writer for this movie but i dare say he's the main writer anyway correct me if i'm wrong br br the casting is excellent except for <UNK> the pseudo main character who in my opinion should have stayed in the soap opera scene and the sets the cuts and sounds are very well done as well and give great atmosphere to this movie br br this movie is a story about loosely <UNK> sad <UNK> that according to a famous <UNK> <UNK> very well known song <UNK> which very roughly translated to <UNK> throughout the whole <UNK> society lead to a sad dark end accompanied with booze and the bad choices and it's the side of everyday <UNK> life about 80 of the population have no awareness of unless movies like this are made
<START> for those of you who've wondered what an art house monster movie might be like wonder no more the <UNK> trilogy circa 1966 was just such a series more period samurai epics than anything else these three movies just also happen to feature one of the most literally monstrous <UNK> et <UNK> ever there's not a single <UNK> of these gems that is <UNK> from the scenario s to the performances to the <UNK> <UNK> even the special effects are handled with well above average skill and are integrated in most instances almost <UNK> into the movie s if you're a <UNK> fan or a fan of samurai movies or one of us who just likes a good movie regardless of genre i highly recommend the <UNK> trilogy
<START> there are some things you just don't do so says the tag line of this a 2003 david <UNK> comedy about a young man caught up in one horrendous situation after another entitled my <UNK> daughter and it's the tag line which should speak for both the people that made this junk as well as those <UNK> watching it there are indeed some things you just don't do with the placing of mostly all of the sort of content to be found within my <UNK> daughter counting as wholly items you just should not do to the medium of cinema by including them in your picture my <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> creepy grotesque experience a clunky and heavy handed piece which is <UNK> beyond words and disgusting beyond expression to see it is to endure it to endure it is to survive it and to survive it is an accomplishment all by itself  if any of the cast writers extras hell even the guys that worked as <UNK> on the set aid in producing anything as earth poor as this again then it'll be either because they've been sent here by the devil himself to destroy the medium of film or it'll be because they've most probably garnered <UNK> on behalf of the <UNK> <UNK> mob br br my <UNK> <UNK> which i'm pretty sure ought to be titled my <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> speaking revolves around its hapless male lead named tom <UNK> and a night in at his <UNK> house as he chases that seemingly <UNK> <UNK> that is his young blonde daughter lisa taylor reid someone whom works within the same department as he does in a <UNK> chicago office block whilst under the strict eye of jack taylor <UNK> tom spies lisa early on she's taking the subway to work with all the other despite the fact she owns a car and that her father is the boss of the damn company after trying to talk to her but having his attempts <UNK> by a <UNK> baby and a dog for the blind more interested in <UNK> <UNK> than anything else he finally gets his chance in the office when talk of an after dark party elsewhere <UNK> and that he ought to come round to her house to visit her and yes she does still live with her father think hitchcock's 1960 film psycho with the gender roles between norman bates and his mother <UNK> and then played for laughs br br the distinct establishment of character is made painfully apparent in the opening scene in which tom sits on the subway train and travels to work with his <UNK> <UNK> they are a ruthless and smarmy bunch whom it's made apparent <UNK> the <UNK> of those unfortunate enough to get them stuck in the door in the ensuing morning rush without ever returning them one day it happens with tom there and his wish is to return it thus <UNK> into us that he's not like other guys this as he first sees lisa down the <UNK> and is somewhat shy to approach her as the other men treat the whole situation as if it would be a <UNK> if they were in his position this rather obvious and flat <UNK> attempt to try and get us to with tom sits <UNK> with what it supposedly takes to earn a place amidst these co workers in this company br br it is however as close as my <UNK> daughter comes to any level of film making from a seemingly harmless premise of a boy meeting a girl and wanting to get to know her arrives the comedy from hell <UNK> arriving at the house will not see him invited to the party instead he is charged with house sitting jack's pet owl and generally keeping out of <UNK> whilst maintaining a <UNK> house it's been established <UNK> <UNK> character means business in the <UNK> of manners firing people for the smallest of things such as the making of a bad cup of coffee it's not that jack is a <UNK> businessman he's a <UNK> freak obsessed with control and a borderline <UNK> in his <UNK> of bear traps in the garden so as to keep the children next door off his land you can imagine that when we're let into his large and exquisite house with the orders that nothing should go wrong there's obviously going to be trouble br br the film has fun with this premise of danger for about ten minutes the first time someone uses the to crack open a beer thus <UNK> the <UNK> top you may <UNK> but by the time half the house is <UNK> and michael madsen has shown up <UNK> all over the <UNK> you've got your head in your hands each joke in the film is set up in an almighty clunky manner before it is played out in a way that is closer to slow and excruciating than slick and <UNK> the only thing missing as it follows through to the next gag is the sound effect of someone <UNK> changing the <UNK> to a car as it <UNK> and <UNK> onto the next <UNK> <UNK> the gross out <UNK> the film takes time to roll down a route of <UNK> <UNK> driven romance as lisa and tom bond whilst talking of in <UNK> and out of <UNK> <UNK> and that maybe they have more in common than first thought by the hour mark the film's <UNK> for gross out gags and hate filled <UNK> more than anything when there's an entire scene that exists purely to target and a dumb subplot to do with a head injury sporting <UNK> on a blind date in which some truly unwatchable sight gags are <UNK> throughout <UNK> character enjoys putting people down and asking if the <UNK> of tasks are too difficult for them to which the common place <UNK> ought to be whilst <UNK> jack taylor was reading the screenplay first too complicated a concept for you <UNK>
<START> i just bought this movie yesterday night and i love it everyone did great acting in it especially ryan <UNK> and <UNK> the whole plot was great and as <UNK> said in the extras on the dvd they made it seem like he was <UNK> the whole thing all over again this movie has made my number one spot in my favorite movies i can't stop <UNK> scenes over and over again just to see it again i've never done that with any other movie i would definitely recommend this to other people to watch because it is such a great movie and if you like <UNK> it's a perfect movie for you the little montages that they show in between every scene are just great i think that those have to be my favorite parts of the movie they are very sad with mostly music from the band <UNK> ' which of course is my favorite band
<START> <UNK> moon had everything going for it for starters simon back a man who's name is <UNK> with high quality tv westerns unfortunately the problems with moon are something even the most talented director couldn't solve a poor script based on a lackluster novel br br forget historical <UNK> as any reader of the novels can tell you the biggest travesty in moon is that it's not even consistent with information from the original <UNK> <UNK> masterpiece so many wonderful rich moments in the miniseries and to an even greater degree the book are completely missing in moon considering the fact that most viewers of moon are probably coming with at least some sort of <UNK> background the lack of character driven and emotional <UNK> is downright painful br br that said moon is one instance where the adapted version could and should have been altered to make it more suitable for the screen for example the novel moon focuses largely on the themselves to its credit the miniseries tries to service the but in the end it gives them just enough that the viewer just gets a sense they're missing out on some important part of the story similarly val <UNK> <UNK> loses out here too the role should have either been expanded so kilmer and rachel <UNK> for that matter actually had something to do or the roles should have just been reduced to smaller supporting parts instead kilmer gets top billing for a character that just leaves you scratching your head after his appearance in the completely bizarre final act br br there's strange moments throughout the film that just make no sense to those who haven't read the book a killer parrot what further there isn't a single scene that shows us that call and are anything near the amazing texas rangers they claim to be not a single one of their in moon or dead man's walk for that matter ends successfully and call and just seem to <UNK> their way through one pointless mission after another br br frankly larry should never have been given the job of writing the script and only did so because of the praise surrounding that other cowboy movie <UNK> mountain can write good novels although there's some <UNK> over the <UNK> of that statement but he's never exactly established himself as a scriptwriter this production would have <UNK> from not only bringing back director but original screenwriter bill to adapt the novel to screen doesn't exactly have a of material to his screen writing credit but no one can deny he did a fantastic job at down the original <UNK> <UNK> with all this said <UNK> moon is almost a brilliant production aided by a terrific cast that unfortunately just aren't given enough to do steve portrayal of gus or rather his portrayal of robert duvall as gus is dead on and while some have criticized karl urban as <UNK> call saying his performance doesn't imitate the quiet stoic <UNK> of the original movie all i can say is blame because is the one who both in the moon novel and now the miniseries turned <UNK> from socially inept awkward but natural leader into some <UNK> character whose lines are just dull and whose character motivations are only clear if you've seen them portrayed far more adequately in the sequel br br still it's the cast that <UNK> in moon to the degree that i left the miniseries with that same feeling of melancholy i felt watching the original <UNK> <UNK> this time because i realized it's probably the last time we'll see these characters appear on screen for a long long time to come and quite honestly this cast could have done so well in a well <UNK> full blown network tv series br br all in all aside from wasted opportunities with the cast the biggest travesty is that the original <UNK> <UNK> novel contained so much rich <UNK> for the characters that would have been fascinating utterly fascinating to see translated on screen unfortunately all that has been tossed aside in favor of tedious inconsistent and ultimately irrelevant prequel
<START> well to start with <UNK> <UNK> is not a comedy film maker and this is really unfortunate because the only comedy film he has made is a masterpiece this film is really funny loud in bits <UNK> in a few scenes but still the dialogues r really laugh <UNK> and characters r really full of fun story line in simple a <UNK> daughter come to india for marriage and two young <UNK> r behind her the story has a twist as well with a connection of a gangster <UNK> playing a street smart guy <UNK> has played his role with brilliance and salman has played the role of an innocent stupid to perfection <UNK> has done fine but really turns irritating in some sequences but real show <UNK> r <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> kapoor they enter the frame and automatically u start laughing overall such an enjoyable film that u can watch it any no of times without getting bored
<START> despite later claims this early <UNK> melodrama has very little in common with citizen kane it's a biopic of a ruthless but human fictional told in flashback but <UNK> around time the scriptwriter preston <UNK> shows none of his later gift for <UNK> dialog and none of the <UNK> cinematic <UNK> of kane are evident still it's very watchable with a young spencer tracy his old man makeup makes him look just like well an old spencer tracy showing depth and authority and <UNK> moore a little past her prime and not physically well matched playing a <UNK> woman behind the man there's also helen <UNK> as one of the most <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in movie history sending the final third into <UNK> soap opera <UNK> the surviving print is <UNK> and has missing audio snippets and there are some plot holes left open how would she know whose son it was if she's sleeping with both of them and the music is awfully hokey for all that i was quite fascinated
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on war concerns a couple living an <UNK> existence on a small island off the coast of what country isn't <UNK> raging off in the distance is a war they know only from news reports as they go about their day the war comes to them and it soon becomes a struggle for survival as both sides seem not to care about them bleak look at the human cost of war and those not readily engaged in battle but caught in the cross fire none the less its a movie ahead of its time as some 40 years since it was made the notion of <UNK> at war where most of the <UNK> are the civilians have come of age this is a dark disturbing film that is told from the average person's point of view with the complete sense of hopeless and confusion best expressed in the thought that kept running through my head what do i do now as an intellectual exercise the film is top notch this is a film that will make you think as an emotional film it is touching but never fully moving i was never moved emotionally even as the horror of the situation made my brain do flip <UNK> i should state that i admire bergman intellectually for the ideas that he brings to the table however i have never been moved by his films i am not a fan i always sided with fellini in the old film class argument as to who was better since he had more emotion to his films <UNK> aside this is require viewing especially since we live in a world were war for most of us is just a thing on a tv screen
<START> having been interested in for many years i was surprised to learn about this film via e bay and bought a copy on dvd for <UNK> i enjoyed the film the twists and turns in the plot and that the file was mainly about the main character makes it more of a family saga rather than an action film the costumes and attention to detail was remarkable for its time 1955 the back projection during the <UNK> ride now looks clumsy my main interest was in the character of and his <UNK> religion in this film he was portrayed as being jesus like in his <UNK> to go to war with the even through they were <UNK> egypt and in his closing speech about the <UNK> of and political power initially one makes a connection between who was cast <UNK> in the river <UNK> in a reed basket and the old testament <UNK> but this connection is not carried no doubt this will be fully explored in a new film <UNK> a <UNK> like character carries <UNK> religion out to the wider world if such a film will ever be politically possible to make it is universally accepted that were women are concerned we man are stupid creatures but the relationship or lack of one between and merit the character played by jean simmons is hard to accept and that an educated <UNK> would be so smitten by the <UNK> femme fatal to the extent of giving her his adopted parents house and tomb is not really believable neither that his parents would even have a tomb in real life was the wife of and although did become <UNK> it was after a few others including who was the son of br br but of course this is just <UNK> picking and the film is enjoyable to watch and that it is about and his <UNK> religion is a big bonus maybe following the de <UNK> code book and film this film be re made with the central secret being the foundation of our current <UNK> i wait in great anticipation of such a film there are already numerous books on the subject
<START> i saw this movie when i was a kid and have been looking for it ever since it rates up there with cabin in the sky <UNK> weather and carmen jones as a must see in movies that <UNK> the awesome talent of african americans in the 60s the local los angeles tv stations would have a movie of the week and some stations would show the same movie for 5 days and <UNK> was one of them and my whole family would be there all 5 nights in front of the tv and only moved on the commercials south pacific <UNK> and the sound of music are all musical classics that you can pick up at any video store it would be a shame to let this collection of some of the best talent america had to offer be forgotten or locked in a vault please make the film available to the public
<START> what crack are you smoking this movie while <UNK> entertaining is awful br br the action scenes are so obviously fake it's kind of sad the <UNK> daughter is painfully irritating the ninja training camp is so hilarious it is almost not worth mentioning and when joe puts the bucket over his head and beat up the other army guy i just about <UNK> myself i could go on br br entertaining arguably so good no well made certainly not br br as a commentary on america as empire it's actually pretty good joe as a typical white <UNK> isn't all that surprising especially in the context of mid 1980s american cinema
<START> i've read just about every major book about the manhattan project most people know what it was but few people understand the depth and <UNK> of the project its scope was <UNK> massive <UNK> in us history perhaps only by the space program of the 1960's br br there were literally millions of people involved from all walks of life at numerous sites most <UNK> around the country each involved in a specific and different aspect of the project that they couldn't talk about to the person sitting in the <UNK> next to them much less their family the <UNK> are overwhelming particularly given the <UNK> of wartime communication security and <UNK> in the 1940's br br as an example my <UNK> father was a carpenter who worked for one of the companies that had a contract with the federal government for the manhattan project his job was to <UNK> a crew of about 30 other <UNK> who were responsible for <UNK> forms for the <UNK> of <UNK> for the massive research <UNK> at washington that's all he did six days a week for nearly two years these <UNK> needed food <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> just as much as did <UNK> and his crowd at the top of the <UNK> just think about it that being said it's simply impossible to do the subject justice in a 2 hour movie in defense of however i would say that they had an impossible task particularly since he chose to have a diverse screenplay with multiple plots multiple angles and multiple characters what exactly was he thinking and how could he be so arrogant to think that this would work that's hollywood i guess br br fat man and little boy has so many flaws that it would take a book to list them all horrible casting dreadful and politically motivated writing bad science the portrayals of and are particularly inaccurate and downright <UNK> notwithstanding the <UNK> all too obvious agenda it is still incredibly bland and sloppy br br these flaws have been listed elsewhere on imdb but i was particularly struck by the fact that the scientists had so much time on their hands <UNK> <UNK> riding parties semi <UNK> <UNK> ballet etc not to mention romance and of course <UNK> political according to <UNK> <UNK> if these great brains had gotten off their and actually spent some time in the lab instead of <UNK> laura dern we might have won the war before d day br br one final <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mentions that fat man and little boy were the code names of the two atomic bombs but it doesn't mention that these names were a semi good natured <UNK> at fat man for heavy stature and <UNK> little boy for his slight stature another reason paul newman should not have been in this movie
<START> john waters owes me 2 hours of my life back i saw a sneak preview screening of this way back in 1990 and i'm still in pain not before or since have i seen such a terrible piece of <UNK> waste <UNK> upon the screen there is nothing positive i can say about this film acting awful plot ridiculous music atrocious following the movie my friends and i <UNK> our money back from the manager of the theater he explained that since it was a free screening he couldn't give us anything in return no matter how much agony we were suffering through how johnny <UNK> career survived this <UNK> of a movie is anyone's guess
<START> first off i'm amazed to see that this film has got a rating of 7 on this site at first i thought it might be industry people <UNK> in to imdb and <UNK> up the rating but after looking on rotten tomatoes and seeing that this film has something like a <UNK> <UNK> rating it seems that maybe folks have just been <UNK> again into <UNK> pretentious crap for <UNK> i mean this film is simply awful the acting is simply terrible but the rest of the film is worse at least the acting provides some unintentional laughs br br the plot involves a teenage <UNK> boy who is being <UNK> along with his friends for a murder that happened by a park where they <UNK> and that's about it the rest of the film consists of the aforementioned terrible acting terrible dialog slow motion shots of people walking of people's faces of people <UNK> often set to music that does not fit the scene perhaps that was done to be cool or experimental or hip or perhaps it was done in hopes that it would fool people into thinking that it is somehow profound but it does not work nothing in this film works it's pretentious garbage i can't not recommend it enough
<START> as a serious i was seriously disappointed in this film its target audience is clearly those who have never run a marathon or <UNK> following the stories of 2 first time one senior one injured runner and two <UNK> as they prepare for the chicago marathon the film <UNK> the majority of its attention to one female <UNK> whose story is for lack of a better word boring while i did enjoy the brief glimpses into the training sessions of the brief history of the boston marathon and in general let me emphasize these were brief watching some joe <UNK> prepare for a saturday run with their water <UNK> and talking about how they view the marathon is not inspiring and the <UNK> clichés about achievement and feel good <UNK> <UNK> will make you wish the film were about an hour shorter if you are a first time this film may give you a feeling of i can do it for anyone else run away

<START> ok i read the director's comment about this movie featured as the and i have to admit that i can identify with his position br br micheal i hope your career <UNK> from this particular <UNK> and you went on to other better things i've seen this movie in the mst3k form even with all the chopped continuity and <UNK> remarks being tossed out by the robots i saw a potentially decent movie with an ambitious set of ideas trying to struggle out from under the limited budget and limited actors available to it and this is one of those films mitchell is another where the mst3k crew took a lot of cheap shots at the lead character even when she actually deserved better you know they had some unfair fun at the <UNK> expense because it made for a <UNK> episode br br imo the fact that the movie actually tried to be about something and had a few decent effective moments here and there should keep it out of the <UNK> time <UNK> is another movie with a plot and a heart that doesn't deserve to be there either br br but it is still not a very good movie i don't blame the writer lead actress for being who she is it's just that her acting and writing skills needed a few more years to mature before she could pull off a vanity project such as this or carry a feature film the writing and characterization is amateurish and <UNK> and the dialog is often barely up to abc <UNK> special standards the cast sincerely gives it their best effort and the acting in general is definitely head and shoulders above <UNK> like future war or space <UNK> but there aren't any really professional level performances here with the exception of <UNK> <UNK> who is hammy but suitably intense i never saw the full original cut but <UNK> <UNK> of was representative enough to make these facts plain br br oh and the film has robert <UNK> in it that is imo a real of <UNK> for any movie that hopes to be taken seriously yes he's big and scary looking in his role but i just hate the guy as an actor in real life i wish him well and hope he is <UNK> comfortable br br there were little things i liked about the film for instance the <UNK> between the male lead and his dead buddy added some warmth and humor to the movie and made it a lot more watchable the idea of an elevator in the hospital that opened its doors to the <UNK> was an inspired way to <UNK> some spooky <UNK> without <UNK> for special effects and i respected whoever worked that into the script in attempt to keep the budget <UNK> it didn't really work but it might have with just a little more <UNK> br br so anyway mr better luck with your other projects your involvement with this misfire wouldn't keep me from watching something else you did if the <UNK> was good and ms miller has nothing to be ashamed of she was young and ambitious and the movie wasn't that bad
<START> a <UNK> critic praised such a movie br br the film has a weird story <UNK> a lover sells his love to a <UNK> <UNK> he wants money to save his mother and then also gets for it lol br br the movie is crap br br the entire first half has it's focus on romance comedy which fails to work the twist shocks but the entire second half is a mess and the climax is clichéd br br direction by <UNK> is bad music is typical <UNK> br br <UNK> does his serious role well but his wardrobe his way of walking through songs etc is similar to his previous films <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> fails to convince this actor was good in murder only so far and then a downhill <UNK> some screen time and he is okay but his breaking down into a song is forced <UNK> is okay
<START> title opera 1987 director <UNK> <UNK> cast <UNK> ian <UNK> daria review the only other <UNK> movie i had seen was <UNK> and that one blew me away with its style colors and spooky story line i next decided to go with opera as i had been told it was one of his best man i think i'm discovering what will ultimately be one of my favorite horror directors br br opera is about a young opera singer who gets her big break when the main star of a creepy modern opera take on <UNK> beth gets hit by a car betty is the so she gets to do the part herself too bad for her there's a psycho after her who makes her watch the brutal murders of her friends and co workers br br wow id heard good things about this here flick but i wasn't prepared for the level of greatness to which this film would take me yeah the movie has its shortcomings to which ill get to later but for the most part the movie blew me away br br first off this movie is not as filled with lots of colors as <UNK> i was expecting it to be a bit like <UNK> in that department but no to my surprise it had its own look and feel the film is somehow devoid of color it does have lots in colors in certain scenes like the masterful kitchen living room sequence where <UNK> fills the screen with lush <UNK> and blues but for the most part the film has a <UNK> black tone to it all through out and i liked that it had its own distinctive look br br the real stars of this show are the incredibly well <UNK> death sequences wow every death scene was like a work of art beauty in destruction these are not just your typical hack and slash death sequences these deaths were carefully constructed to shock and get the most out of its situations loved every second of them there's plenty of blood and mayhem here but with style not gonna spoil em though br br then there's the direction man there's some really original and beautiful shots on this one i loved the inventive use of the camera on this one you thought that shot in kill bill <UNK> 1 where we see the bullet coming out of the chamber of the gun was original well this is the movie he lifted it from i honestly believe that tarantino was heavily influenced by this specific movie with certain scenes in kill bill <UNK> 1 heck in the making of feature he mentions that the whole scene with <UNK> in the hospital and <UNK> driver coming to kill her was influenced by italian <UNK> and here my friends is the proof of that <UNK> tarantino references aside this movie has some amazing camera shots like those scenes of the <UNK> flying through the crowd in the opera house great stuff and a main reason why becoming one of my favorites br br the acting from most of the cast was alright but the best by far was <UNK> as the tortured young opera singer betty the looks in her eyes as the murders were being committed were great the rest of the cast was a little wooden and stiff but nothing that would <UNK> your enjoyment of the film br br there were very few things i didn't like about this movie first off logic was thrown out the window in certain scenes specially those involving reactions after <UNK> seen the murders it seem to me that for the longest time she just went on about her business not telling anyone about the whole thing not even the police i mean if you see someone brutally murder a loved one in front of your eyes you don't just walk away from the murder scene and continue with your life someone would have connected her to the murders she might have even become a suspect herself but no also the ending is a bit anti climactic you'll have to see this to understand but it seemed a bit unnecessary the way the film ended it felt like it could have ended earlier it would not have felt so redundant but thats about it not real big problems for me really since i was enjoying the rest of this beautiful film br br i've still got a lot of <UNK> territory to cover but i'm <UNK> every step of the way like if i was eating a plate of the most expensive <UNK> this guys really good i think of his films as works of art and i've only seen two of em cant wait to discover the rest of his films <UNK> you the man br br rating <UNK> 2 out of 5
<START> man i loved <UNK> 11 br br smart movie all eleven characters were crucial to the heist as each had their own <UNK> skill that was necessary to pull of the grand finale br br what on earth was <UNK> 12 what was the purpose of the <UNK> person i assume it's supposed to be zeta jones but she wasn't really a part of the 11 as she was trying to trip them up and working against them the whole film it was more like the story of brad and zeta jones' characters boring relationship with some bits from the original movie thrown in just to get some <UNK> on seats to watch the movie br br with o 11 the gang were always a step ahead of <UNK> garcia they were always able to <UNK> him what happened here he catches up with them after a tip off and suddenly they're all <UNK> the whole movie is so that they can raise the money they stole plus interest to <UNK> back <UNK> for the heist they pulled on him 3 years earlier so next movie they're going to develop courage and brains again and get him back for making them pay him back for the first heist <UNK> <UNK> br br this movie could have been achieved with just brad pitt zeta jones and 5 mins of matt damon for the <UNK> scene br br slow moving movie not the energy of the first one i tried hard to like it and i'm usually very easy to please but i'm really disappointed br br spoiler the twist the whole movie didn't need to have been made as the real heist was done before everything you just saw over the past 2 hours br br end spoiler br br wait until it comes on tv or if you're a fan of the original from 2001 please don't watch this
<START> i originally saw this movie in a movie theater on times square in the late eighties who would have thought this film would <UNK> two sequels and have this cult following night of the demons was like most other films that came out at the time a group of horny teenagers find themselves trapped in some isolated local and then are killed off one at a time in various gruesome ways come to think of it the formula still is used and still seems to work as <UNK> by saw ii that i recently saw br br i saw <UNK> <UNK> at a <UNK> convention about six years ago and she was so gentle hearted i guess that makes her a pretty good actress if she could make a career out of playing this demon possessed woman in all these horror flicks anyway i just this film again on vhs <UNK> and this movie still holds up a little slow at the beginning as i remembered when i first saw it but then it quickly picks up pace one of the eighties horror classics and worth a look
<START> <UNK> high is considered one of my best all time movies it certainly reminds me of days of my youth growing up in the cities of cleveland and chicago during the early mid and late 1960's what ever happened to brenda and some one to track those two down brenda for her beauty and for his innocent wit they both deserve to be recognized even <UNK> years after this film was <UNK> i think a lot of the fans of this movie would like to find out what happened to them as well as others who acted in this fun filled movie i certainly think this movie should be entered into some type of movie hall of fame all of the cast of this movie was great my opinion is of <UNK> high is turn back the hands of time those were the fun years
<START> this is the worst waste of time i've ever experienced not even close to the first one the story line difficult to follow plot was weak at best the whole thing looked like three stories trying some way to tie them together and make a movie it had a few good lines here and there and the attempt at the message was admirable but they went from <UNK> through new york to get to dallas it was really hard to tell over what period of time the present time took up the movie was just over an hour and it felt like we had sat there watching the movie all afternoon points for being honest but a son should not have to do all that felt he had to do do your self a favor watch again
<START> i hated the book a guy meets a smart dog gets a virgin girlfriend and all the while they're being chased by a hit man and a ape beast thing both of whom want the dog dean <UNK> really can't write i read the book at my sister's recommendation i should have known better when i saw this mostly out of a morbid curiosity i actually found myself <UNK> it because of the fact that it was untrue to the book even though this is a book that its impossible to make a good movie of i figured at least if they're going to make a film adaptation of the worst book i've ever read the filmmakers might as well be accurate they turned the guy and his virgin love interest into a boy and his mother for some reason that bothered me most of all even though i seriously doubt keeping it a guy and his chick wouldn't have made it any better quite simply bad book bad movie don't see it
<START> a hundred miles away from the scene of a <UNK> murder in small town american jill johnson belle <UNK> in for a night of <UNK> with the children asleep and a beautiful home to relax in she locks the door and sets the alarm but when a series of eerie phone calls from a stranger says that she check the children jill <UNK> fear to terror when she has the calls <UNK> and what the police find turns the perfect <UNK> job into a 16 year <UNK> worst nightmare there aren't any other lead actors in this movie <UNK> belle is the main star with a cute face the day she arrives to <UNK> she really has no idea what in the hell really <UNK> her br br if i were in a house like the one jill was in i would explore everything that is around the <UNK> would be the first person i would looks at but i'm a male and i don't <UNK> but what i found funny was the size of the house i was thinking would the movie be the same if the house weren't so big anyone could get lost in that huge house but this movie needed a house with a massive size br br <UNK> belle has a cute face a perfect smile but it's like for a movie like this the lead actress needs someone with experience i found <UNK> not that good i don't know maybe she thought that this could be her breakthrough role i do like her she is a cute girl but someone to have a role in this movie has to be someone how is different to take it br br this movie wasn't scary i also found this movie more like a chick flick i think the only reason this was released during the <UNK> weekend was that the guys stay home and watch the game and the girls go out to go see this it also seems like a type of a movie when girls will enjoy more than guys but i did like this movie but for how it is girls just like et scared or scream this was just a pretty decent movie br br maybe anyone could like this movie there are many pg 13 horror films that never succeed this was on its own level so i kinda liked this movie i give it a 7 10
<START> most of the comments so far have nailed this one right on the head viewers under a certain age and with <UNK> of three <UNK> should avoid chance of a lifetime like a george w bush facing a <UNK> <UNK> br br the cast is composed largely of veterans who know their way around a well written script is the premise wildly original no but the movie stands out like a <UNK> at midnight in the current and non ending <UNK> of movies tv <UNK> to the most <UNK> audience <UNK> of teenagers and young adults br br in addition to betty white and leslie <UNK> in the leads the cast also has ever reliable veterans like <UNK> and william <UNK> the sharp dialog is effortlessly and effectively delivered by these pros br br chance of a lifetime is definitely not a movie for the will ferrell adam sandler saw slasher gore <UNK> american eye dull and ninety percent of the rest of the <UNK> ground out by hollywood and tv
<START> some people may call <UNK> high the same sort of thing as american <UNK> but i wouldn't for starters in <UNK> everyone was white whereas in <UNK> they're all black moreover this one has a <UNK> soundtrack specifically the movie focuses on several working class african american students in 1964 chicago and their antics the movie deals mainly with home life and relationships in their apartments we see that there's never any dad around but these young men always know how to live life to the <UNK> br br one thing that really <UNK> this movie from most other portrayals of black people is that the teenagers in this movie are portrayed as very responsible worrying about missing school two really funny scenes are the gorilla scene and the one white guy in the movie but overall the main star is the soundtrack it is truly one of the best <UNK> in movie history we even have it on <UNK> here at home a classic in the real sense of the word
<START> starting with a <UNK> poem and images of american <UNK> starving children and <UNK> <UNK> i quickly realised that this was not going to be a objective documentary 5 <UNK> convicted after the <UNK> <UNK> are interviewed and give a very confused <UNK> why they had to trash the and then oh my god actually have pay for what they have done i kept watching and many questions are raised were the trial properly done and did the cops have the right to do what they did lots of questions asked and then dropped no interviews with judges or going through documents about the trial nothing br br in short nothing new from what every <UNK> has seen on tv a hundred times just poor propaganda
<START> imagine the most cliche ridden b movie horror plot you can add more plot holes than plot have it scripted by a 10 year old have the acting done by a level drama students <UNK> really bad us accents in the <UNK> of man add monster special effects that the lovers of b w dr who shows will appreciate result duff film throw in samantha <UNK> taking her clothes off make a point of this on the cover and you'll probably sell enough copies to make a profit anyway
<START> awful waste of time there is no camp or trash value in this one seen better amateur movies done by 10 to 12 years old kids in movie <UNK> br br how on earth someone can spoil movie about vampires and lesbians br br it's not a movie to put together a few vampire <UNK> <UNK> in a same room and just shoot it br br could not find anything good about the film there was no plot no real actors no real special effects no humor a few overweight touching each other cannot be called a sex scene nothing at all br br well cemetery was nice but one should shot a vampire movie during dark br br purpose was probably good make a trash movie in a spirit of ed wood problem is that one cannot make a bad movie intentionally it takes talent and an effort to make a real movie ed wood might have lacked money but he sure had effort these guys lacked everything ed wood was a genius compared to these guys
<START> i guess the previous house movie was a hit <UNK> universal to <UNK> a few more drops from the monster cash cow the creative team must've been in a <UNK> mood starting with the opening theme lifted from <UNK> of <UNK> and some of the stock footage <UNK> through the film like one unintentionally funny bit of business where footage of glenn strange as the monster is mixed with clips of karloff from <UNK> bride and compared to how robotic strange moved karloff seems to move like a <UNK> in comparison br br previous film continuity is thrown by the <UNK> concerning the <UNK> death cheating abilities of the wolf man and dracula but when dr larry <UNK> discover <UNK> monster with the <UNK> representing boris karloff edward t lowe does at least acknowledge some of the past movie history though <UNK> curiously never mentions having met <UNK> dr <UNK> br br since this was to be the last of <UNK> horror cycle the supernatural elements of the wolf man and <UNK> get <UNK> <UNK> into medical <UNK> <UNK> is told he suffers from a blood disease a very rare sickness that allows him to <UNK> into a bat or <UNK> if <UNK> touches him and larry <UNK> just has a little pressure on the brain of course all of this is <UNK> explained with a of medical <UNK> being related in many scenes throughout this proves to be the biggest <UNK> as somewhere along the way the filmmakers seem to forget about actual horror or entertainment in favor of giving the monsters conditions that seem as as a <UNK> br br as a huge fan of the old universal horrors it's rare that i feel so bored while watching one the whole thing just feels like a movie that was made just because it could be but if this mess hadn't been slapped together the monsters might never have met <UNK> and <UNK> so i guess some good came of this
<START> my wife wanted to see this movie and i <UNK> went along i have never been a big fan of the biopic believing that cinema is more exciting when it isn't structured in non fiction beyond that although i like ray <UNK> music just fine i don't consider myself a fan of him or his music br br i expected to either suffer or coast through this movie br br i was wrong br br this is an engaging story told in a classic cinematic style the realism is in the nuances the <UNK> of a character's head after a dramatic moment or the look in their eyes while they sing i literally discovered myself involved in this movie during the course of viewing it br br <UNK> foxx of which much has been said heads a cast of <UNK> re creators of not just a time but an era a life that never really existed to those of us under forty this movie sinks the audience into time without the gimmicks and grand sweeping <UNK> of titanic or other period pieces of that <UNK> this movie doesn't present you with the 50's and 60's music scene it takes you there br br this is a movie about ray charles but your appreciate of it should not be limited to the story of his life this is the kind of movie like saving private ryan or <UNK> list that does what a movie should do bring you to another place another time
<START> as an adult i am grateful to have caught this movie by chance when i was a teen during the time i was experiencing <UNK> problems this particular movie managed to capture what i was seeing from a <UNK> world how much <UNK> pressure is too much i actually had to purchase this movie because it reached me on a level unlike most films try to reach an audience how far might an individual go for social acceptance who is the bad crowd teenagers do struggle trying to find out the answers to these questions but ultimately who is the pack leader if there must be one is it the strong the beautiful perhaps the person we just all seem to like could it be the moral character as far as the movie goes the cast worked together as if it were <UNK> i only hope that more directors and producers try to create a piece of work that reaches all of us like this particular movie reached me i wish i could vote higher than ten because this particular title deserves much more
<START> i watched this movie for the first time a few weeks ago and it was quite possibly one of the most boring unfunny films i ever had the misfortune of seeing first of all matthew <UNK> is a terrible actor and ruined most of the movie on top of that the plot is just way too silly the only reason a checked into this film was because of alec baldwin and his character was eliminated pretty quickly unless you are a fan of michelle you should probably avoid this movie like the plague many people can't praise this film enough but i just cannot figure out what people find so terrific about it if its supposed to be the black humor that makes this film so terrific then i guess anything can pass for comedy these days
<START> one of the few reasons to make these films is to give some actors a chance to hopefully star in better films if they're acting is any good the only good thing in this movie is the acting the three female leads are better than most horror films like this there's 2 scenes that may cause an unexpected jump br br young small children are use to crawl through holes and lay dynamite to explode mines when one does collapse causing a cave in all the children die becoming zombies the adults in the mine stay dead no reasons are given as why the children become flesh <UNK> when still alive they looked terrified before the cave in innocent so they must become <UNK> at any adult which exploited them <UNK> he mines only reason that come to mind br br a mother and her 2 daughters move into a house near the mine along with a land who wants to build a resort and another of those creepy people who seem to know exactly what's going on yet no one believes him br br nothing new here you're usual clichés predictable a lot of <UNK> for this film very few <UNK>
<START> there are one or two other <UNK> era shorts i like more i e <UNK> brains but i think one can say without much argument that in this particular episode <UNK> gives his greatest comedic performance as a <UNK> after the team in 1946 br br scene for scene this episode hardly lets up from professor <UNK> <UNK> voice lessons with the glass shattering dee green to his <UNK> attempts to win a hand in marriage this is your little will you marry me click to the <UNK> finish it never fails to keep me in <UNK> br br i would be <UNK> not mention that immortal scene with miss hopkins the always lovely christine <UNK> btw isn't she rather under dressed and over <UNK> in <UNK> the man she thinks is her basil who knows maybe the actual basil was a very distant cousin which makes it legal in some states as far as i know
<START> i just finished watching <UNK> at <UNK> fest 2006 with about 30 other people in a mostly <UNK> 1000 seat <UNK> the festival <UNK> after seeing the lack of audience started his opening comments with well at least a few of those attending the festival have good taste in film well mr <UNK> after watching this film i must answer back no we don't and either do you this back woods period piece follows young not so wild bill as he and his <UNK> family dangerously run illegal canadian <UNK> across the border during america's <UNK> the old time <UNK> kris kristofferson and company not only need the money to save their <UNK> <UNK> farm but want to introduce little wild bill to the virtues of <UNK> br br although <UNK> photographed this adventure story lacks what makes films of this sort good tension and believability <UNK> lackluster performance and dry monologue reminds me of a dream i once had where al gore was playing the role of willy <UNK> i just didn't care and when wild bills <UNK> grandmother appears out of thin air to give him advice it just didn't fit yes i almost fell asleep more than once br br gary farmer does do a good job as the cameron frye in <UNK> <UNK> character brother in law of big bill while the teenage chris mcdermott does uses those <UNK> blue eyes to his acting benefit br br but overall expect to see jay <UNK> <UNK> playing at a block buster 2 bin near you
<START> you know i really have a problem with movie lists i was reading <UNK> magazine a while ago and they had a list of the 50 greatest b movies of all time and knowing me i of course have to go through and watch them all and write reviews of all of them this is why you see reviews of movies like <UNK> bait and <UNK> wire and <UNK> on my list so i noticed h o t s at the video store the other day and recognized it from list of the 50 greatest b movies and i decided to rent it and check it out my only <UNK> is that i rented it because i recognized it from a list of b movies so i already knew it was going to suck br br given the type of movie that it is i can't say that h o t s is a total failure since it is nothing more than a late 70s t a film and it never pretends to by anything else the only place where it <UNK> widely from its objective is in a <UNK> subplot involving a couple of ex cons who have <UNK> a lot of stolen money in the house that the self named h o t s move in to because this subplot has absolutely no place in the movie despite the fact that the rest of the movie is as well this subplot is completely superfluous and unnecessary br br the story is based on a couple of rival <UNK> at the beloved f u which exists as one of those <UNK> that contains a grand total of one <UNK> until the rejects form their own in order to get back at the <UNK> in the other one this new <UNK> help out the <UNK> h o t s is a <UNK> supposedly based on helping <UNK> the seal subplot is another one that doesn't really belong in the movie and little attention is paid to the meaning of that name beyond having a seal running around here and there throughout the movie br br this is going to sound weird but there was actually one scene that i was pretty impressed with in this movie one shot that i was impressed with i should say about <UNK> through the movie one of the girls in <UNK> the rival <UNK> is <UNK> alcohol into the punch and she <UNK> some for herself in a glass and drinks it oddly enough what she does as she drinks that alcohol reminds me of something that charlie chaplin would do which really <UNK> up the movie obviously nothing in this movie comes close to anything that chaplin ever did but that shot alone raised my score for the movie from a 2 to a 4 br br as a whole however the movie is exactly what you would expect it to be a lot of people running around looking for excuses to take off their clothes i liked how the remove one piece of clothing for every score in the football game at the end was one of the girls' ideas and not much thought is put into much of anything else there is for example a scene early in the film when a couple of the <UNK> girls pour hot <UNK> into the <UNK> at a h o t s party accidentally getting caught in an <UNK> photograph the girl taking the picture didn't realize that she photographed them at the time although the photograph never comes up for any reason later in the film br br i've seen movies like this before it's kind of like <UNK> bait but without the violence and the <UNK> and <UNK> wasn't far off even <UNK> wire is much the same just with a bigger budget and more <UNK> thankfully 50 b movie list contains only a few more comedies because while these cheesy teen t a films are entertaining every once in a while as bad movies with the occasional semi nude scene after watching h o t s i think i've decided that i like the bad horror movies better than the bad comedies i'd rather watch a lot of terrible actors pretend to be scared than pretend to be funny
<START> it's not difficult after watching this film to see why post silent soviet cinema is held in such little critical <UNK> don't get me wrong the <UNK> are flying is for the first half at least <UNK> entertaining <UNK> a <UNK> of touch completely unexpected from its country of origin a fresh <UNK> <UNK> technique that eventually <UNK> as much as it initially charms two stunning <UNK> set pieces and a romantic <UNK> that <UNK> with but never quite <UNK> into <UNK> territory it's just that in its <UNK> of vast social national and world events to a love affair it is essentially no different from a conventional hollywood movie br br of course in a soviet union that <UNK> the state above all else and in an era world war two that <UNK> <UNK> and liberty to <UNK> murderous symbolism this of two appealing young lovers is a relief and the <UNK> similarities all <UNK> love rent apart by war with two of the most wonderful of all films seventh heaven les <UNK> de <UNK> also adds to its potential <UNK> br br the story is simple enough boris a young factory worker from a bright medical and artistic family and <UNK> a student conduct a <UNK> relationship at night their only free time cousin mark a composer also has eyes on <UNK> when the nazis <UNK> russia boris secretly <UNK> to the <UNK> of his family and lover he promises to write to <UNK> but never does thinking maybe she hasn't bothered to see him off or perhaps the mail is simply <UNK> parents die during an air raid and she moves in with family helping out at the hospital where his father tends wounded soldiers br br <UNK> by silence <UNK> is also by the <UNK> of mark who has gained from military duty by <UNK> a local official she is eventually worn down and marries him to the <UNK> of her adopted family boris meanwhile is killed in action <UNK> disgusted with herself and an <UNK> mark refuses to believe this and <UNK> his return <UNK> a young orphan bearing his name br br the title refers to the birds the couple see at the height of their love symbolic perhaps of its <UNK> power but this is <UNK> the <UNK> fly in a v <UNK> and this shape <UNK> the entire film through the <UNK> <UNK> of buildings interiors <UNK> of people composition camera angles the <UNK> name or by editing in which feet walking <UNK> in one story are met by feet walking <UNK> in another br br this serves to <UNK> trap the lovers who have no control over their <UNK> and also suggest the <UNK> power that is never specifically mentioned in the film although the pair seem to be free in space whether literally in an environment or <UNK> in generous close ups they are always torn apart by circumstances families by crowds see the brilliant if obvious sequences where <UNK> is <UNK> by tanks or the pair fail to meet in a huge crowd or simply by the film's structure which is constantly <UNK> through their <UNK> although at the beginning the <UNK> and <UNK> of style suggest a beautiful romantic <UNK> it is constantly being broken by strange edits or camera angles of distracting <UNK> of music br br what is most remarkable is how these <UNK> to romance are achieved by rather than <UNK> historical forces the whole film but especially the war itself is strangely unreal and <UNK> we are never shown its harsh brutal <UNK> just its effects on the lovers in fact it is transformed into a <UNK> spectacle devoid of nasty germans br br on the home front the air <UNK> create delicious effects of light and <UNK> or ruins of almost gothic <UNK> in the <UNK> the threat to the soviet empire is less important than perceived indifference the empty <UNK> spaces the lovers initially than <UNK> with her mother walk though are less actual locations than emotional spaces br br when mark tries to force himself on <UNK> the air raid is less a destructive reality than a symbolic release of sexual and emotional <UNK> this is a brilliant sequence filmed with silent <UNK> terror in which the screen seems to burst with <UNK> and violence all the more compelling for the earlier <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br it's not much different at the front either where fights over girls' honour are more <UNK> than tactics nazis or despair the movement of boris and his wounded <UNK> into a final space is a further of the experience of war its setting in a forest giving it a sexual dynamic and <UNK> final pre death flashback is an extraordinary mixture of dream wish <UNK> and <UNK> anxiety in which what is wished for becomes menacing and grotesque br br from this point on the film becomes a little less interesting slightly more obvious one more grasp for <UNK> <UNK> attempted suicide and her <UNK> the <UNK> is clumsily handled and her <UNK> guilt casts a <UNK> shadow over the whole film the use of deep focus at first ravishing soon becomes wearing devoid as it is of any of the moral force or meaning welles brought to its use in citizen kane after what seems a quietly sly critique of <UNK> in favour of the individual is <UNK> betrayed at the end when individual suffering as so often in russian art <UNK> into symbolic i e <UNK> hope a pity
<START> i was given a dvd of public enemies and was expecting it to be the 2009 version but it wasn't it was this sure it wasn't the greatest movie i have ever seen not by any means but heck folks it was worth more that 2 8 out of 10 when i saw that abysmal rating on imdb i wondered what i was going to get but since the disc was in the player i settled down to watch it as other <UNK> have pointed out public enemies is not a historical movie per se and i noted that unlike the 2009 version which i haven't seen yet imdb doesn't <UNK> it as such br br come on people it's a story based on some real people that's all if i wanted a history lesson i'd sit at this computer and read <UNK> or something ma barker actual name arizona or barker was never even charged with any crime and as other <UNK> have already pointed out she probably never even took part in her <UNK> activities they sent her to the movies when they were working i hope she wasn't as critical as some of those who watched this movie br br <UNK> russell had the never too easy task of portraying a woman from the age of 17 right through to her death at the age of <UNK> from a young girl running from home to the hardened mother of four <UNK> sons i think she did it pretty well the <UNK> little smile she used in more than one scene was classical ok i will agree with some of the critics that the direction of this film was below par and i <UNK> with the actors over that <UNK> should have told the director to forget the topless shots they didn't contribute to the story maybe some bigger name stars would have managed to <UNK> some of their own expertise into <UNK> the poor direction whereas the second <UNK> weren't quite that brave who knows br br but whilst this was certainly no block buster it was worth more than 2 8 i have all my dvds on a personal <UNK> where i score them before looking at the imdb score although that sometimes influences slight changes later i take what i get on it's own merits rather than holding one movie up against others of the same genre and this one i felt was entertaining enough to get 6 8 yep i'll accept that such a practice does tend to depend on my mood at the time but then isn't that also true of those who vote on imdb however you may imagine my surprise when i looked at imdb and saw the pitiful score it got here br br given the surprise i decided to read a few of the other comments in the hopes of understanding the low rating and i noticed that they are quite <UNK> i agreed with those who said the movie was worth watching and came to the conclusion that some people are just hard to please well since some were absolutely <UNK> why don't they get out there and make some better movies i will look forward to the gems they must be able to turn out on the other hand if they can't do that then why don't they just shut up
<START> is a film of <UNK> it has an exceptionally well thought out cast with being the <UNK> jewel a superb production and possibly pre production with at the <UNK> a fantastic journey of rural southern india through the eyes of a 15 year old a remarkable mixture of song and dance traditional and modern <UNK> perfectly and a beautiful backdrop of lush color of the <UNK> and <UNK> that make up the magnificent experience what a <UNK> achievement for a debut director the casting was absolutely dead on i wish india would come out with more of such films this film will remain as one of my top favorites for my entire life 9 10
<START> this movie made by the was made in honor of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> years in the 50's 60's and 70's my <UNK> grade teacher played this in class in honor of my <UNK> birthday in 1987 and also to celebrate my return from a serious facial injury in 1986 i have been a <UNK> fan for <UNK> of my 30 years of life on a scale of 1 10 i give this film a <UNK> all hockey fans should see this as i hope it will be placed in the hockey hall of fame in toronto and shown at the bell centre in <UNK> or here in <UNK> at place watch this film with your family it is a great movie i also recommend the book in both french and english go go
<START> this is a film that i keep coming back to for a variety of reasons as a testament to the suffering of the ordinary soldier on the eastern front in the second world war it is a powerful one there are a number of very powerful scenes in the film which help to capture the horror of war such as the tank battle for instance furthermore from what i can see the experiences documented in the film are by and large <UNK> if you read a book you will know what i mean the film is also successful in the sense that it doesn't allow character or plot to dominate it it is simply a tale of survival that attempts to depict the battle mainly from the ordinary german <UNK> point of view i've read somewhere that the original screenplay had to be toned down which doesn't surprise me at all if they tried to really show what the battle was like it would have been almost impossible to make i'm sure even so there are still some moments that are difficult to watch this was made before private ryan but is possibly even harder hitting in places just one word of caution don't buy the dubbed <UNK> version it's pretty awful and <UNK> the film try to get a copy in the original german version with english subtitles it's far more powerful you may need to buy a region 1 dvd of the film in this case as i did
<START> jesus christ what the hell happened here this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen how is it possible that they screwed up such a nice idea for a movie to tell you the truth i was so hyped for this i though it was like blair witch but with actual alien creatures chasing the camera guy <UNK> it i have been reduced to fast <UNK> this pile of sh t and i never do that while seeing movies the high rating here on imdb makes me believe that actual aliens are giving <UNK> for this piece of crap br br invasion is about well an invasion the movie starts by saying that everything you're about to see is real then they go and tell me about a special camera system used in cars as if i need to believe their <UNK> t to enjoy this movie next thing you know i'm seeing the most boring car driving ever filmed in a forest at night mind you is this a movie or a disney theme park ride the first 20 minutes is all boring dialog between cops while seeing grass and one straight road with a <UNK> where the hell were the aliens they were sleeping of course then we learn that bad acting is not only reduced to high school plays as the cop behind the camera goes out of his car to look for a missing man who was and had stumbled upon a mysterious <UNK> i wonder what happens to him out of nowhere we see the guy walking like a zombie the cop is apparently too dumb to notice that something is wrong with this man apparently he was indeed dumb as the zombie alien guy <UNK> in the <UNK> ear some sort of alien <UNK> thus changing him into an alien then the cop alien goes back into his car looks for a young couple that were having sex a while back in the forest gets to them changes the guy into an alien and then the girl runs to the <UNK> car and escapes if this quick plot introduction didn't get it in your head that this movie was bad then the following 40 minutes will watching this movie is as painful as stabbing yourself repeatedly with a plastic <UNK> the script while it may sound interesting on the back of the dvd box is badly directed and sadly we are left with another boring straight to dvd atrocity br br the only thing that kept me awake were the constant flashing and loud sound effects <UNK> if seeing the same forest trail for <UNK> minutes is not enough we must endure crappy flashing techniques to scare the viewer and constant <UNK> of a bad actress that gets old and annoying pretty quick br br if you feel you must rent this i say to you why there are better scifi horror films out there even the <UNK> remake of the invasion of the body <UNK> is more entertaining than this for the love of all things good don't bother with his crap my eyes <UNK> and for the first time i wanted suicide a 1 10 avoid this like a disease
<START> demon wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs it is definitely an awful example of a film so awful in fact that i don't even consider it a movie i describe it more as a thing a monstrous thing a thing that must be stopped at all costs my friends and i first discovered this thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my friend's house it was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies we unfortunately picked this one well during the 90 minutes that this thing played we ended up laughing so hard that we almost threw up the thing is literally pointless in every sense of the word it's just a cheap poorly done rip off of evil dead the whole story seems to be nothing more than some guy wanting to knock off his friends by <UNK> them to an abandoned house and letting demons rip them to pieces i have a bet that the writers were actually writing the story while it was being filmed i've seen bad horror movies before <UNK> <UNK> 2 hobgoblins <UNK> i would have to say that demon wind could definitely <UNK> with any and all of these films on terms of sheer stupidity watch it only if you enjoy laughing at stupid films br br fun fact this film is like a <UNK> on <UNK> much like the board every time we try to get rid of it it always seems to mysteriously <UNK> kind of scary huh
<START> i reveal two <UNK> at the end of the film do not read if you want to watch this movie for some reason br br oh my this is bad and for some reason sean bean one of the greatest present day actors has sold his soul and appears in it the only <UNK> is that the <UNK> must have realised that someone as ultimately pathetic as steve <UNK> could never in his life <UNK> to kill someone as cool as sean bean instead he is killed in what must have seemed like a marvellous twist at the end by the good guy who was meant to be be killed by bean but was actually his boss and <UNK> his own death don't worry i haven't ruined anything for you the acting itself is spectacularly <UNK> with <UNK> hey look i can pull a chuck norris face hard man stare <UNK> most of the two hours of hell on earth added to a plot that i could have written whilst being tortured and hung upside down with both hands cut off there is also a completely nonsensical critical error in the fact that one moment the virus will escape if they so much as look at it wrong while another moment steve <UNK> is <UNK> running around with it throwing catching bashing and generally <UNK> this which has the distinct look of a collection of those little balls of soap you put in your bath my final word if you are <UNK> depressed and feel like you want to laugh <UNK> at something that should be a bad comedy but even worse isn't tape it next time it's on channel 5 at midnight then burn it when you realise that i am indeed telling the truth
<START> eddie monroe is he is a great actor and i could be his girl anytime he's so fine i was so sad at the end i'm not going to ruin the end but wow girls are so vicious his girl was wrong if eddie was my man i would never <UNK> those <UNK> were spooky the moral of the story is trust no one your friends will hurt u if they can oh and eddie tell your girlfriend that <UNK> mine she should move <UNK> i would suggest seeing the movie why i said so it kept my eyes on the screen my sister loved it also so i am going to see it again because now my friends want to see it and its worth seeing two times peace happy new year
<START> this is a love story set against the back drop of television news the three main stars william hurt holly hunter and albert brooks create a love triangle whilst working at the washington <UNK> of a tv network br br tom hurt is the handsome reporter who is being <UNK> to be a star jane hunter is the producer who <UNK> that tom lacks the intellectual <UNK> to be a real journalist but falls for him anyway aaron altman brooks is the man who shares her beliefs in <UNK> standards is also the man who truly loves her br br holly hunter was nominated for a best actress academy award but lost out to cher moonstruck she was robbed this is <UNK> film her character jane is smart ruthless and totally driven she is also hilariously neurotic her performance is perfect just watch her face when she watches the tape of <UNK> interview of a rape victim the <UNK> literally fall from her eyes br br <UNK> <UNK> performance is less <UNK> he plays a man who is well aware that he is a and a fraud but is smart enough to know that his rise will be <UNK> by people like jane he gives little hints of a man who is extremely <UNK> br br the film comments on celebrity <UNK> integrity and the commercial <UNK> on news in a medium that is focused on the bottom line it predicted that news would be <UNK> down that standards would slowly be <UNK> due to commercial <UNK> br br think about this this film was released before the end of the cold war and before rise of reality tv yet it predicted the <UNK> down of the news paris <UNK> release from jail was treated like a major news story to see how <UNK> this film is just watch your evening news and note the set the graphics and the <UNK> tom and his <UNK> are well and truly alive
<START> one would think that anyone <UNK> upon a <UNK> to the groundbreaking naked civil servant of 30 plus years ago would at the very least try to honor the original with some kind of inspired vision but no here we have a sort of biopic of one of the most stylish people of the late 20th century that itself boasts no style whatsoever true the filmmakers have assembled some outstanding actors and handed them a <UNK> <UNK> of drab <UNK> to work with everything in the <UNK> of this film is wrong starting with the script which is another one of those tv movie of great lives <UNK> every other line is a famous quote by the subject and every other scene is an in your face introduction to the next pivotal character in the <UNK> life we get <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> crisp as a <UNK> entertainer denis <UNK> as the editor of a gay <UNK> who hires crisp as film reviewer becomes somewhat <UNK> from him when he appears indifferent to the passions of 80's aids <UNK> and then returns to the <UNK> as a compassionate friend of the dying <UNK> jonathan tucker in a fine performance as a shy insecure painter of gay themed <UNK> who is <UNK> by crisp and finally <UNK> <UNK> as performance artist and woman about <UNK> penny <UNK> who intrigued by persona offers him a spot in her traveling <UNK> act <UNK> is a <UNK> and gifted performer but is given no chance by the script to <UNK> the down to earth and <UNK> <UNK> crisp spent the last 20 years of his life in a one room flat in an old <UNK> building in <UNK> east village he <UNK> said that he never <UNK> because after a few years the dust doesn't get any worse or something like that but looking at the depiction of that flat in this film you'd never get the flavor of that he <UNK> a local coffee shop on a busy <UNK> and would be seen pretty much each day of the week <UNK> tea and watching the world go by in this film we get a diner that looks like something on <UNK> <UNK> by the hudson river most of the streets of new york scenes have a <UNK> unreal look with no sense of the period br br the soul of this film is the great john hurt in the title role after nearly 35 years he can still grasp the essence of this peculiar post <UNK> <UNK> and put it across to third his every line every gesture is exquisite in the later scenes he even his vocal projection to suit that of a person whose life is <UNK> down toward death crisp wrote shortly before he left this realm that when one grows very very old one's skin takes on the character of a <UNK> <UNK> that cannot be removed and one <UNK> for death one senses that feeling in <UNK> performance so for him and him alone this film is worth a look
<START> personally i loved movie my best friend told me about it so i rented it out a watched it it's amazing the music the acting the story lines the emotion everything well except for one minor fact absolutely no loyalty to the books at all i saw this movie before interview with the vampire and before i even knew the books existed so i was shocked to find how many people actually hated the movie i picked up quickly that the book fans weren't at all happy with the <UNK> not wanting to be <UNK> i hate the harry potter movies due to lack of book loyalty i stayed silent eventually i picked up the vampire <UNK> and understood immediately why everyone hated it it is completely different the movie queen of the damned is a combination of the vampire <UNK> and the queen of the damned but i still loved the movie from when i saw it before reading any of the books so if you haven't seen this movie or read the book watch the movie first or you'll hate it if you have read the book then you have every right to hate this movie
<START> a blind person could have shot this movie better seriously the director is clearly a <UNK> he must be dennis <UNK> coke dealer or something to convince him to be in this movie i felt so embarrassed for dennis br br to john the director please <UNK> from directing your contribution is not needed nor wanted the medium of film is stronger without you you are terrible at directing stick to <UNK> <UNK> or something br br this movie should've <UNK> straight to video and gone to the <UNK> i'm a dumber person for having seen this movie do not see this movie if you respect yourself and respect the of film
<START> it is often hard to decide what the best film is that you've ever seen since this may <UNK> by genre <UNK> for actors actresses or even the mood you're in on a particular day having said that this movie is by far in my opinion the worst movie i've ever seen i thought the acting was terrible was there any the plot was just idiotic and the props were totally <UNK> could a lower budget production be created without being an amateur production i don't think so even the friends i watched the movie with agreed that it was the worst video we ever rented and to this day we still joke about the night we saw this movie
<START> being a huge laura <UNK> fan i picked this up at a rental <UNK> just to see another <UNK> film boy did i make a mistake br br <UNK> in egypt has nothing to do with <UNK> laura <UNK> is in it along with her husband <UNK> but that is the only connection to <UNK> here laura plays laura original huh a beautiful <UNK> who goes to visit her wealthy friend pia annie belle in egypt in <UNK> are her a hole photographer <UNK> a <UNK> looking <UNK> and some blonde woman who is never named also living in <UNK> mansion is <UNK> the sexy but dumb al <UNK> a <UNK> who speaks nothing but nonsense arriving for the weekend are <UNK> two daughters one a short haired lesbian and the other a brunette lots of sex is implied but hardly shown one good looking actor plays ali the egyptian servant who gets lucky with three of the women in the mansion laura has sex with the lesbian the lesbian has sex with <UNK> pia and the blonde have sex with <UNK> at an egyptian orgy laura drinks blood and is possessed during an egyptian ceremony <UNK> rapes laura it all happens with so little flair that <UNK> in egypt is one of the worst movies i've ever seen far from erotic even the actors themselves look bored during their sex scenes br br considering there were two famous couples in this film laura and <UNK> al and annie the number of available sex scenes are <UNK> instead a film that offers a top notch <UNK> cast and never delivers the goods will <UNK> every viewer off except the hardcore laura <UNK> <UNK> otherwise steer clear of <UNK> in egypt
<START> people talk about how horrible the script was and how horrible the animation was but <UNK> and the star <UNK> really is a japanese anime aimed towards children if you look at the anime today it's done in the same style and it's immensely popular i don't think this movie was ever intended to be viewed by adults just as i don't think it was ever intended to be serious the very things that people seem to hate about this movie are the things that i love <UNK> is one of the best cartoon characters ever created in my opinion she's smart she's funny she cares about the she cares about her friends this movie can teach so much to young kids my little brothers even liked this movie i have to say this movie taught me a lot when i was a kid when it came out on dvd i was first in line to buy it it's a great kids movie so what if it's not perfect nothing is really perfect when you look closely enough at it
<START> landscape after a battle opens with escaping prisoners over a snowy field full of <UNK> in rather funny movements accompanied by four seasons a touching opening but we soon enough learn to know these prisoners as a mob and when they also treated <UNK> a man alive the protagonist stops for a moment but is soon more engaged in finding books from the camp than caring about his <UNK> br br the rest of the film is set in an american camp from where the prisoners are not released in some kind of semi freedom semi camp a perfect set for a study of war <UNK> american camps polish <UNK> grief and human misery in general br br film makes an important turn in comes women and with them film changes light colour and temper at the same time it turns out that these prisoners were slaves in holocaust i think a main underlying political theme of the film must <UNK> <UNK> of jews under and after the world war and not only the nazi but mankind letting it happen and even forcing them out of europe after the war on an emotional level the film is about grief and the problem with letting grief come how environment makes grief difficult and how difficult it can be to share grief for people with different experiences br br but the film is a carpet of underlying <UNK> humour irony and sudden beauty a couple of times during the film a gypsy prisoner plays on an <UNK> an emotional tune brutally rejected speaking by the protagonist that example picks up an important essence of the film's style and theme when it comes to humour its very comic how the protagonist constantly <UNK> and finds back his glasses in crowds in <UNK> <UNK> etc br br its not hard to understand spielberg's respect of when you see this film the great treatment of light can be compared with spielberg on his best the <UNK> speaks for itself it only brings the film out of the camp but it brings the film to dream and eternity with profound beauty anyhow there is also another scene i can't let go without comment its the christian <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but simultaneously deeply religious we see the moment everybody falling on their knees while the protagonist is saved from isolation by the priest to serve as a comic <UNK> boy his <UNK> are mocking the scene but also gives it emotion and love when nina gets her bread sun light falls upon her and <UNK> ring its the peak moment of the film br br main actors are excellent in their roles as the perfect protagonist the <UNK> <UNK> mind unable to put all the aspects of his mind and emotion into life beautiful is with great body acting <UNK> in a character unable to express all her inner in her proud movements br br those who try to describe everything often are unable to take nothing in consideration this is what manages his films are either very moving deep or beautifully shot but pays attention to life's and <UNK> a moment of joy for one is the moment of irony for a second the moment of grief for the third a moment of nothing for the fourth br br there is at least two reasons to pay attention to films of this period first is the remarkable free expression of deep political impact this country was the first to <UNK> communism twenty years later second is the development of a and narrative language that kusturica has rose to <UNK>
<START> ok so some of the plot points might be a bit obvious but over all an interesting idea which works towards a tight ending the acting is solid particularly <UNK> <UNK> who plays one of the central characters in this ensemble piece he certainly has a screen presence and he is interesting to watch it has a low budget feel which works for the sort of thriller horror genre four <UNK> belongs to the film doesn't try to take itself to seriously which adds to the overall charm the character of phil dave has to be one of the most annoying character seen on screen since rupert <UNK> king of comedy worth adding to a weekend pile of dvds
<START> this movie was downright awful most of the comedic scenes seem stale and trite and possibly the funniest scene in the movie had already been given away in previews the entire premise of the movie is so unbelievable and ridiculous its hard to really get into it the actors themselves portray the most unrealistic characters its not just the fact that the movies so hard to swallow but its how they keep forcing it down your throat expecting you to dumb down and accept it the plot itself is so shallow and easy to predict boy somehow gets rejected from every school he applied to i suppose he completely forgot about attending community college and decides to create his own school for fellow rejects all goes well for awhile until the <UNK> of his school comes into question all the while the <UNK> character manages to woo his beautiful neighbor into falling for him with his witty sarcasm which apparently is a skill only he possesses then comes the final struggle with the students somehow all bonding together and fighting for the survival of the school of course the main character then <UNK> the state board of education to allow his school to stay alive with some inspirational speech this movie would have been more fun to watch if i was under the age of 16 and still ignorant of all college matters and issues
<START> as i am a fan of hospital and medical shows i have found this one gripping and sometimes humorous especially the scenes with dr <UNK> which brings a bit la light relief however i was looking forward to the last episode because i expected that the bad ones would be <UNK> and the good ones <UNK> instead of that the hospital management are making even more fools of themselves in an unbelievable manner and it's getting worse and worse for the good ones you can't help wondering what the <UNK> are doing or doesn't rob donna and maria know what <UNK> are there for besides never seeing the outside trees grass <UNK> is a bit oppressive anyone understood what the last words were i e the answer rob lake gave to mrs children question why are you telling us all that it was very frustrating not to be able to understand it
<START> even die hard john wayne fans will have to <UNK> that this film is a mess wayne's character john <UNK> is after the gang that killed his parents led by half <UNK> half white <UNK> <UNK> earl posing as a mexican br br there are almost too many silly plot points to count but those that stand out include sheriff williams jack <UNK> a captured around his boot so all has to do to get free is remove his boot friend dusty george pre <UNK> hayes takes a thrown knife in the back and comes back good as new for the rest of the story in a chase scene <UNK> rides a <UNK> <UNK> through a <UNK> <UNK> surrounded by <UNK> walls in the middle of a desert and missing his mark chases actually walks after on foot through the desert seeks relief and drinks from a pool of water but <UNK> he didn't see the sign above the that states don't drink poison as <UNK> dead <UNK> <UNK> his chase after the remainder of the gang and captures the whole lot by blowing up a rock wall that <UNK> a secret passage into cabin how convenient br br in the closing scene the new sheriff <UNK> is seen on the phone talking to the new mrs <UNK> sheila terry daughter ruby who earlier in the film was a kidnap target of gang apparently the studio was intent on wayne's getting the girl in virtually every film they made with him as this type of ending is completely predictable for almost all of lone <UNK> films
<START> there are many so called anti war anti <UNK> policy films around now which start off as a <UNK> and end with <UNK> poor boys are getting hell out there so let the world <UNK> with them it's not their kind of stuff i was half afraid that this would be another in that style even if it treated another subject aspect of the same subject i nearly didn't go and see it for that matter i almost did not write this review what did we get here an egyptian gets taken off to a secret off shore torture centre on u s orders but it is another egyptian who has to do the torturing not an american <UNK> we americans have clean hands ' and the <UNK> are a bad lot anyway so let them harm their own oh and the <UNK> had to be an american with a conscience indeed many americans have them but here the concept was misplaced yes we all know it is called extraordinary rendition and it began in <UNK> time and it is now used for reasons well beyond control otherwise it was very hackneyed and nervous about really <UNK> the u s for being party to torture as if the makers were afraid to go the whole way for fear of being as <UNK> or whatever take a look at the message board anyone <UNK> gets a <UNK> of heavy verbal <UNK> torture is a terrible thing whether one is guilty or not in the 18th century king of <UNK> <UNK> it for convicted murderers though i must say a life sentence for a child <UNK> is far less than what i want to see all right what about torture this film did not really bring out its horror and <UNK> enough when you are under torture now come the <UNK> for emphasis i am not shouting you will say anything even if it is not true even if you have not done the thing you are accused of in the vain hope that if you say <UNK> to whatever they are it will stop it does not but you never learn and you keep on saying that you did whatever it is they say you did <UNK> you <UNK> another thing the film did not bring out enough was that torture is exceedingly <UNK> <UNK> and that feeling stays with you your whole life it somehow changes people inside how do i know all that don't ask br br re edit two things the <UNK> that was used in the film was not the egyptian <UNK> it's sort of worse than setting a film in new zealand with locals as the characters and everyone has american accents also the dreadful little preacher who was <UNK> his ignorant audience to violence was telling them things unknown to that religion which should have been brought out nor was it anywhere explained that any can become a <UNK> he doesn't need any special <UNK> and that is a <UNK> which needs to be put right many are acceptable because of their <UNK> views and u s a 's great ally <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> so many of them many thanks for this space

<START> in red letters <UNK> is at the <UNK> of as a college professor who writes to a female prison <UNK> and gets more than he <UNK> for there are two reasons to watch this flick kinski is one and <UNK> the other although it's difficult for their sparks to shine in such a complete directorial disaster everything is wrong with red letters convoluted lousy screenplay camera editing and most of all acting which is <UNK> for <UNK> etc has taken a story with potential and turned it into a seriously flawed and amateurish flick not worth the time
<START> it has a bit of that indie <UNK> edge that was hip in the 90s and which places an explicit sell by date on the visual style characters are uniformly <UNK> and <UNK> deadpan street <UNK> in <UNK> wear new clothing out of the box without or <UNK> they all appear to visit the same marine hair <UNK> all uniformly exhibit the same low iq when making their <UNK> underground business deals when things go wrong its all because they aren't real <UNK> they're <UNK> sunshine boys caught in a strange night city world makes a big <UNK> about <UNK> immigrants but never bothers to actually investigate the problems with russian <UNK> <UNK> cultures if had the proper perspective on this project it might have made a wonderful <UNK> <UNK> production the fleeting glimpses of toned boy <UNK> is the only spark in this generic small time mobster <UNK>
<START> there are two ways to regard either it is a dazzling mind blowing <UNK> of music old film clips <UNK> and t v sitcom style comedy or a plot less pretentious rambling mess the truth probably lies somewhere in between it is also one of the best movies of all time br br 'the <UNK> jones peter mickey <UNK> and mike had just finished their hit series and wanted to do a movie in collaboration with writer jack nicholson and director bob they made br br it begins at a bridge opening ceremony in san francisco where the <UNK> gate crash the proceedings mickey jumps over the safety <UNK> <UNK> hundreds of feet into the water <UNK> rescue him to the <UNK> of a gorgeous jerry carole king composition called 'the <UNK> and visuals that make the stargate finale of look drab by comparison by now you will either have switched off in puzzled disgust or be completely captivated br br more bizarre happenings unfold mickey uses a tank to destroy a <UNK> <UNK> machine in the middle of the desert the entire italian army <UNK> to him the group are hired to play to play the in victor <UNK> hair for a television commercial an overweight waitress insults the group describing them as <UNK> gift to the eight year a surprise birthday party for mike goes wrong the group are sucked into a <UNK> <UNK> and to cap it all are driven away inside a giant glass tank br br you will either hate this or love it i found it a refreshing change from mindless pop musicals of the <UNK> do the show right <UNK> variety the songs are good too <UNK> is superbly choreographed by toni basil later to appear in and boasts wonderful editing with clothes changing colour at lightning speed <UNK> we go is a lovely king number whose accompanying images carry a strong <UNK> message br br frank <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are just two of the guest stars to crop up did victor mature read the script before <UNK> to do this one wonders he's hilarious in it though br br so mad there just has to be real genius behind it is a little <UNK> gem and one worth <UNK> time and time again shame it did not find an audience at the time if only had been like this
<START> i've read a lot of reviews on the imdb well all five of the ones that have been written at the time that i'm writing this and i'm surprised at the amount of praise <UNK> upon the <UNK> <UNK> which is undoubtedly one of the lesser comedies performed by the stooges i prefer the older ones where it was larry curly and moe although <UNK> gets credit for most of the funny scenes in sing a song of six pants another stooges short which is only moderately amusing but far superior to <UNK> <UNK> indeed there is a single slightly amusing scene in the film the don't hit a lady scene which is barely amusing at all and is 15 minutes into the film not very promising in a 17 minute comedy br br <UNK> is a voice <UNK> whose uncle has passed away and left him an inheritance of 500 000 provided he get married within 48 hours which is short enough notice as it is but by the time <UNK> learns about it he has only 7 hours left this is a premise that had been done and <UNK> before but was not i don't think a massive cliché at the time this film was made as it is now there are a series of gags throughout the film none of which are even close to the level of comedy for which the three stooges are so widely known it seems that the stooges have run into the same troubles that plagued so many of shirley <UNK> films  there is too little <UNK> on content and too much <UNK> just on the fact that they're there br br the standard characteristics of the stooges are here moe is the mean one whose <UNK> is certainly not used <UNK> in this film and the slapstick sound effects although with more exceptions than usual are fairly amusing but are <UNK> into their standard <UNK> in this film the line hold hands you <UNK> is immortal the rest of the film is not br br there is much talk among the other people who have reviewed this movie for this site about this being one of the best of the stooges shorts that you won't find one weak moment about how this is their best since the early 30s shorts it's just not true i can certainly understand a level of automatic respect for <UNK> classics and for the giants of early comedy which the three stooges certainly are but that respect is damaged when <UNK> films are praised more than they should be the <UNK> <UNK> deserves some respect because it is a stooges film but for exactly the same reason it should have been better the three stooges were just better than this
<START> this is a movie that was probably made to entertain the middle school early high school age kids maybe to them it's funny they may possibly even see something scary in it to me the acting is poor and plot is poor there's just not much value at all for the adult viewer i saw this film as weak and boring at times there was the possibility that the movie could become interesting but it never really <UNK> the creatures look pretty good but after seeing them for a few seconds they don't seem to have any substance other than the look at times i wasn't sure if the movie was trying to make another attempt at comedy or was it just another attempt at horror that failed again this movie just wasn't good for me
<START> i wrote this as a two part review part two has spoilers br br part 1 br br no this isn't that one about the sex with car <UNK> this is the one about racism in l a you know the one where everybody is a racist and race is the topic on everybody's mind at all times race br br its like the movie has a form of <UNK> syndrome where race is the constant theme race racist racism race relations <UNK> race br br paul <UNK> made a movie which took the structure of <UNK> which was used to show the <UNK> of people who are <UNK> connected and then screwed it into a mental vomit about racism in america race in the 24 hour period we have 7 stories running parallel all connected and about race the first hour people say ridiculous stuff and do absurd things in an effort to be real about racism in america br br for example the story with ludicrous and <UNK> <UNK> provides the comic relief too bad the first half of their story is lifted straight from the bonnie situation in pulp fiction racism their section is the quentin tarantino section where instead of being cool and talking about foot <UNK> and religion the characters talk about race and racism constantly br br the other good thing about it is the mexican story when the mexican guy is talking to his daughter he gives her his invisible <UNK> cloak to protect her from bullets decent writing but that's only because the writers have had daughters and know what they would say in his place br br the rest of the stories are extremely ludicrous the hindi does not act in any semblance of realism the scene where he's trying to get the lock fixed and the mexican tells him he needs a new door is <UNK> and stupid why would anybody act like that is it realistic <UNK> it reminds me more of the <UNK> store clerk from the doom generation six dollar sixty six cents <UNK> if i ever watch the second half of the movie i hope his head is shot off and his head starts <UNK> up <UNK> br br i haven't mentioned race in over a paragraph race racism race for the sun better then there is the black guy who wants to be white matt dillon who has a chip on his shoulder against blacks ryan <UNK> who looks beautiful and does nothing and various other bad actors acting badly with bad dialog when matt dillon the black producers wife could i help it if i was cracking up when <UNK> is second guessing his writing up of his partner for racism can i help but crack up the movie is so funny when it is being racist racist racist i tell you br br now mind you this movie was nominated for best picture best director best screenplay and best editing besides a nod to matt dillon who actually did attempt to do a decent job who was paid off for that one i have no clue br br don't see it unless you feel like being <UNK> at about the racism in society through a bad and unrealistic script from 2 white men over fifty who have no semblance of reality or interaction with real society in any way shape or form br br d br br part 2 br br the second half of crash takes any and all story lines in the first half and <UNK> them back out in a sort of <UNK> the world is a big coincidence kind of way and it is in fact one of the worst ways to do it br br take <UNK> <UNK> people weren't conveniently tied together over and over again they were just connected in a strange way that happens more often than you think you know somebody who knows somebody who did something that you knew somebody else was also involved in crash takes this <UNK> into a serious extreme br br the stories are <UNK> up so everybody meets again are there only 5 on the <UNK> force aren't these people working weird shifts dillon and <UNK> were a late shift then an early one the next day and why did <UNK> have to be the murdered <UNK> wouldn't it have had more emotional tension as well as realism if it had been somebody we had not been following all day long like <UNK> just picks up a random <UNK> and then freaks out be freaking out br br eventually in the second half the touching invisible cloak scene is used to get the hindi to shoot the daughter it <UNK> me off and made me feel dirty not that the hindi shot the daughter but that they created a beautiful touching scene and then had it be the direct cause of people <UNK> up it really <UNK> me off at the writers not the scene br br the whole movie is fake and totally <UNK> for the <UNK> are far too many and they require an extreme suspension of disbelief unlike <UNK> which was connected mildly this had connections upon connections upon connections which were just so over the top the only good part in the second half was when sandra <UNK> falls down the stairs she doesn't die though she should have i <UNK> when she fell br br the worst part about the movie is it pulls a <UNK> not just in structure but it has a montage over the song in the deep where you see everybody being depressed <UNK> took this and had post modern commentary on it by having all of the characters singing along to <UNK> <UNK> wise up unfortunately <UNK> came out in 1999 while crash came out in 2005 its hard to make commentary on a movie which won't be made for another 6 years but it happened somehow br br utter waste of my time br br first half d second half lowest grade ever overall f
<START> this documentary on dinosaurs was undoubtedly fascinating and very well made however i found myself watching many of the bits with <UNK> the film generally took a rather confident stand on anything it said and showed but inevitably much of the behaviour of the <UNK> their interaction with each other what they looked like how they moved what they ate etc much of that is surely guessing sometimes guessing with reasonable confidence sometimes just wild guessing but the viewer is never made aware of that the film pretends to actually observe real dinosaurs and their real behaviour etc that makes probably better viewing than confronting the audience with mountains of <UNK> but it makes it just a bit too <UNK> in my <UNK>
<START> as someone who was in a pan <UNK> <UNK> i wasn't sure what to expect when i tuned into this show after seeing so many over <UNK> in made for tv movies and the <UNK> of the reality shows i was curious to see if greek would be able to show the true college and greek life experience br br i was very pleasantly surprised at how the show was able to give the viewer the satisfaction of <UNK> the ever familiar characters of this genre but it was also able to add depth to the characters greek life isn't just about parties and petty conflict although those things happen within greek life they also happen in any other social or professional circle throughout a person's life to <UNK> it as some <UNK> experience to those in a greek organization would be false most of the story lines and situations taking place in greek can and do take place everywhere in every circle of friends on sports teams in real life but i've watched both episodes and my little sister whom i'm still very close to and i have spent both episodes laughing and being reminded of how they've truly captured the spirit of our college years and experiences br br i liked how the second episode showed how the characters struggle with the other <UNK> of their lives school relationships goals etc telling rusty that school comes first and going to your brothers for help that was very true to life you can't stay in an organization if you have bad <UNK> the way rusty got his assignment to his professor was far fetched but it was entertaining even the dynamic between <UNK> and rusty it happens you grow up and whatever your relationship with your sibling s was it changes so you must <UNK> br br the bottom line greek is a great show great entertainment value and enough real life in there to be believable and definitely worth the viewers time
<START> i found this movie to be quite enjoyable and fairly entertaining good characters good actors and enough suspense to keep your interest throughout the plot twists might have been a bit much but overall a decent thriller if you liked this film i would recommend the spanish prisoner the house of games and no way out
<START> wings <UNK> and son cole <UNK> team up to make a film about neo nazi thugs <UNK> a gay man and <UNK> a city wings plays the hero and his real life son is the villain fairly low budget film that has not many redeeming features and for some reason no one has seen it perhaps because it is quite a laughable and ridiculous film and the studio realised this maybe wings <UNK> himself prevented the distribution of after seeing it himself maybe people just didn't want to comment on such a bad film oh well i generally like wings and cole as actors but this was a film that they both should have <UNK> wings directed wrote and was the lead actor in an extremely bad and stupid film 1 2 out of
<START> poor diane <UNK> whoever she was not only was she according to this movie a spoiled but sweet acting upper east side brat she was a bad wife bad mother awful business partner plus there is no evidence in this picture that she was any kind of an artist except in the bold statement in the prologue br br nicole kidman who incredibly is more attractive today than 25 years ago and actually looks younger indeed gives an excellent performance but what can an actress do with a wife and mom who seeks out and falls for an incredibly weird werewolf looking guy living in the apartment upstairs set in the early 1970's manhattan was a virtual <UNK> for freaks and of all <UNK> and <UNK> most not looking like human so why is this affair worthy of a minute movie br br robert downey jr used to be one of my favorites but i'd say his well known and prolonged use of drugs has taken its <UNK> one might think he'd be to be in a movie that treats drug use as casually as it does smoking <UNK> br br fur has already taken a beating at the box office but in view of those who <UNK> a score of 10 for this <UNK> slice of trash i'd like to say so <UNK>
<START> it really is terrible from start to finish you'll sit and watch this ridiculous idiot thinking hes cool when he's really not rubbish plot line terrible acting and complete waste of time and money do not bother
<START> <UNK> of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius pointed out the real dilemma in which an artist is br br the decision whether to ease the demands of the popularity or to create something new and to define <UNK> own style br br desperate seek for inspiration and his conscious led him to live the way he did restless outrageous and yes very drunk br br but still he <UNK> and <UNK> the most important <UNK> rules for an artist respect to his master respect to the nature and the <UNK> seek for improvement and to perfection
<START> this movie is a cinematic <UNK> of gangster clichés the writing is grade z and the plot and story are constructed without care or logic it a messy <UNK> of stereotypical gangsters think of bugs bunny cartoons and silly supporting characters the lady doctor and the writer there are much better bogart films out there in fact bogart looks like he slept through this performance he puts very little effort into this character i think the directorial advice he received was something like he's a bad guy act bad this guy is the <UNK> equivalent of darth vader obvious evil and the anti hero don't waste your time with this one
<START> this was a dreadful boring movie even for a documentary at times it did provided insight to life and also had humorous moments but overall it was not worth seeing every time i began to feel sympathetic towards mark and began to hope he would be successful i would become disappointed by his lack of responsibility and drug and alcohol abuse
<START> i missed the beginning of the film i came in when the were in the farm house i can <UNK> say that it was horrifying the moral <UNK> are <UNK> br br my fear of pain and torture leave me unable to see myself other than cowardly i see the christ like ability that was depicted by the brave <UNK> and i can only pray that i could or would have the moral to follow his example br br i see that a main theme of the film is to show the weakness strength of the tortured but what a dismal decision to have to be confronted with all because the soul of man can be distorted in such a way that pain and suffering being brought to bear on a fellow human being is in some way satisfying be it mental or physical br br i found the film very thought provoking
<START> as an avid gone with the wind fan i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters luckily the film on its own was a wonderful piece when the book scarlett came out i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters <UNK> on their journey together while the book lacks any true quality it remains a good story and as long as i was able to separate it from the original was and still is enjoyable however i consider the six hours i spent watching the scarlett miniseries to be some of the worst spent hours of my life any of the original character traits so well formed in margaret <UNK> book this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape <UNK> murder and relationships that even the book scarlett stayed away from the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well formed in both the original novel and film and even carried through in the second book and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character in the novel scarlett o'hara butler follows her estranged husband <UNK> butler to <UNK> under the <UNK> of visiting extended family after coming to an <UNK> with <UNK> she agrees to leave and proceeds to <UNK> with her o'hara relatives in <UNK> eventually she <UNK> her cousin a passionate leader of the <UNK> to ireland to further explore her family's roots that go deep and is eventually named the o'hara the head of the family while her duties as the o'hara keep her engaged in her town of scarlett <UNK> out into the world of the english <UNK> and instantly becomes a sought after guest at many of their parties she having been <UNK> by <UNK> time and time again eventually agrees to marry luke the earl of <UNK> until <UNK> comes along in a clichéd night on white horse type of a rescue the scarlett miniseries fails even to do this justice raped by her fiancé and <UNK> by her family the series shows scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed br br i <UNK> advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to <UNK> this decision
<START> death wish 3 is the movie equivalent of a shooting gallery all the characters apart from <UNK> paul of course exist merely to be killed either as <UNK> the good guys or as <UNK> the villains the director simply <UNK> on the mindless violence people even get burned alive and blown up turning this into an urban version of <UNK> and charlie like arnold rarely bothers to protect himself from the enemy <UNK> fans of this short of thing and apparently there are many will enjoy it others beware 1 2
<START> i fail to understand why anyone would allow a sub par director to put drivel like this onto celluloid this movie has already been made at least two other times that were better than this here comes mr jordan 1941 and heaven can wait 1978 the only saving factor for figure <UNK> fans might have been some nice ice <UNK> done by a professional cast of <UNK> but this just does not happen the closest thing the audience sees to good <UNK> is when tara character takes a turn on the ice for a just a moment others like nancy <UNK> and elvis are hidden in the background and do not do any figure <UNK> at all there is not much real emotion shown and there is not really any reason to tune in to this obviously made for tv movie my advice rent the original
<START> i enjoyed this one because i can relate to it br br at one time in my life i was trying to make films and experienced many of the same problems mark did in trying to make his film and i also went through a <UNK> period of self absorbed arrested development where i refused to grow but then miraculously i got married and had kids i realized that being a struggling filmmaker was in all <UNK> not going to feed my family so i got a decent job and did what i felt i needed to do to make that happen that is what an mature responsible adult does br br mark hasn't faced up to that reality as yet and so in that sense he is a retarded adolescent for this reason there is a <UNK> about him like don <UNK> he seems so inept and self <UNK> that he doesn't realize how bad off he really is the viewer feels a sense of <UNK> and pity for him and his circle mark has kids and an ex wife and bills to pay but the film depicts him caring basically only about pursuing his artistic vision br br despite this mark comes across in the film as a likeable individual surrounded by a very interesting family and group of friends unfortunately mark lacks many of the things necessary to be successful both in life and in a career maturity responsibility education knowledge life experience financial <UNK> etc yet he <UNK> on much like ed wood apparently without any semblance of a clue br br i guess we are supposed to feel encouraged by the spectacle of the never say die attitude of this noble individual struggling against the odds and man what odds there are <UNK> sutherland colin hanks <UNK> spelling and angelina jolie are all <UNK> of big time film or tv people no doubt they will all want to direct some day if they aren't already how much room is there for an independent like mark it's like watching a guy hit himself in the head with a board over and over again come to think of it that is pretty close to what happens to one of <UNK> actors with the kitchen <UNK> door in one of the funniest scenes i have ever seen in any movie br br despite these <UNK> and seeming criticisms i truly enjoyed this movie and would <UNK> recommend it to anyone uncle bill is amazing i have a friend who met both mike and mark and he told me that in real life these guys are just exactly the way they appeared in the movie
<START> without actually giving away my age i saw this for the first time over 20 years ago when it first came out on video maybe it was a <UNK> tape and i was old enough to drink barely and perhaps i had had a few because i remember thinking how great this movie was i have since seen it sober and have to admit it is a pretty bad film as mentioned in other <UNK> the plot is absolutely ridiculous and the poor acting just makes it worse it's a poor attempt to <UNK> that teenagers too can be <UNK> although i am surprised to find out it actually was to be released the same time <UNK> as top gun and not actually meant to be a poor imitation but for all it's worth i do find myself watching it if it's on and i have the time it's one of those movies you watch because it's just so ridiculous and tries so desperately to take itself seriously like that other film moment by moment with john travolta and lily <UNK> don't get me started on that one
<START> i never fell asleep during a movie never this movie did the impossible br br while many people claim the <UNK> of japanese horror films over their american counterparts this movie was a lesson in over abundance as in the movie was 30 minutes too long it would have helped if the movie had a little more movement in the plot and the camera work but instead all we got were awkward <UNK> and a lot of slow movement the acting was absolutely terrible <UNK> on bad student film levels while everyone <UNK> to ad <UNK> something called a script did these people even get any direction were they <UNK> to be boring and dull either wouldn't surprise me br br what was even worse was the rather <UNK> make up involved with the creatures from the other side either way they all <UNK> don't watch this film that's all i can say unless you're an <UNK>
<START> i got to watch this one without commercial <UNK> and let me tell you even for a tv movie it was pretty predictable the actors did a <UNK> job with what they had and the cast was pretty accomplished barry <UNK> jane seymour frances fisher etc however the script was not only predictable except for the last scene but the dialogue was <UNK> and sounded as if it was lifted from a third rate romance novel jane <UNK> psychotic monologues were laughable i'm sorry but i find it hard to believe that anyone that creepy would <UNK> no <UNK> whatsoever as bad as <UNK> russell was in black widow and she sure <UNK> it up she at least had the sense to play her pseudo characters somewhat straight seymour is a much better actress but didn't overcome the material here br br lastly the musical score is incredibly cheesy it's almost a satire of its genre like a kenny g <UNK> a movie with such a lackluster and derivative script really should have gone for something <UNK>
<START> even though some unrealistic things happen at the end i e a cop shooting a gun into a crowded merry go round where any number of innocent could be killed this still was an intense enjoyable thriller one of alfred hitchcock's better films robert walker is excellent as the chilling <UNK> really convincing giving a fascinating performance that is almost too creepy at times his co star in here <UNK> granger is okay but is no match for walker either in acting or in the characters they play it's the typical hitchcock film with some strange camera angles <UNK> themes innocent man gets in trouble etc unlike a lot of his other films i thought this one was a fast moving story with a very few dull spots being an ex <UNK> player i enjoyed his footage of some excellent old net matches that featured some good <UNK> hitchcock's real life daughter patricia has an interesting and unique minor character role in here she didn't just get the job because of her dad she can act also of note the dvd has both the british and american versions and there were some differences in the story this is a classic film that is still referred to in modern day films even comedies such as throw <UNK> off the train
<START> mystery science theater 3000 would have not been able to bring any redeeming quality to a showing of this gem br br this one is like a cheesy pirate copy of 80's porn you could have purchased on vhs from an <UNK> on <UNK> st before disney bought the whole smash and closed them all down br br but wait all the sex scenes have been cut i challenge anyone to find a worse film this film could replace water <UNK> as a <UNK> method of <UNK> br br no i take that back i would prefer water <UNK> br br the only credit this movie could earn apart from being the worst movie ever made would be to <UNK> the middle east into solving its problems under pain of having to watch this movie
<START> don't worry no spoilers here just saying there is a very predictable plot a couple decide to live in his father's love nest so they can write a book article <UNK> on his <UNK> with a famous tragic hollywood <UNK> this whole production ran kind of like a high school <UNK> doing an episode of murder she wrote the only acting i was sold on was the old they interviewed for sources in the story apparently the directors thought the movie was getting too long so towards the end they stopped pointing their camera to a kind of creepy image of the <UNK> and brought in plot <UNK> to wrap this thing up don't waste your time even the tried and true horror intrigue classics fail in this movie
<START> the great thing about <UNK> <UNK> latest film is that it's the anti twilight some of you may take that as a minus but in reality it's a big plus park takes the method of <UNK> seriously and as well the <UNK> love story between sang and <UNK> we see the conflicts of both of the characters sang being a priest who <UNK> a medical experiment that <UNK> to him turns him into a <UNK> but true blue vampire and <UNK> with her mother and idiot brother the latter is killed by sang as in a very strong melodrama there's nothing terribly <UNK> or insipid with the story and characters at any point and the <UNK> put forth from religion early on sang for example is seen as a <UNK> of sorts since he rose from the dead thanks to his <UNK> even as he just can't be that and knows it on top of those about good vs evil push it up into another plane <UNK> br br that <UNK> also rises up to the awesome standard of artistry that park has displayed with <UNK> lady vengeance and the underrated i'm a cyborg but that's ok should be taken as a given <UNK> is a film with a <UNK> narrative and bizarre suburban characters and is shot and edited with an eye for a mood that is part <UNK> part romantic erotic part dramatic and lastly <UNK> and it doesn't always treat as something of a simple horror movie set up though as a horror movie park has more than his share of scary scenes it's more akin to the movie near dark which never mentioned the word vampire but let you know it was and treated it with sincerity and a kind of <UNK> track of attention and that the disease itself and its effect on a person's existence is perhaps scarier than the killings or bloodshed once you see one vampire jump up really high or <UNK> its wounds you've seen <UNK> all br br <UNK> also has a wicked sense of humor much like <UNK> only here with a bite pun intended meant to emphasize bizarre physical states of being an example of this can be found with the <UNK> <UNK> of sucking off of blood from people in <UNK> by taking their blood tube and <UNK> on it on the floor or the manner in which <UNK> holds on to one <UNK> of humanity by keeping her mother alive even as she's had something like a stroke and can only blink her eyes and tap one finger as a means of <UNK> to the blood <UNK> who've brought pain and horror to her home but these moments are like <UNK> on the cake to make it a complete experience what makes <UNK> last in the mind is how elements come together of drama and existential pains of a surreal sense of <UNK> i especially loved the dynamic between sang and the other priest who gives his arm up for blood sucking but really wants to be a vampire too and of the erotic the scenes where the priest finally gives in to <UNK> are incredible in their pace and length of shots and how real it gets not in a pornographic manner but in the sense of these characters' release and escape which doesn't last long over the scope of the story br br if it's not as great as <UNK> it's not something to about not all films park directs will reach the stature of his masterpiece and at the least he'll always be known as the man who directed that movie but is an excellent addition to his <UNK> and to the serious streak of vampire movies in general the film making is crisp and exciting and even dangerous and what a white room of the characters live in the humor is dark and hilarious the acting is intense and moody especially from subtle <UNK> from song <UNK> ho and the quirky evil and surprising vulnerability from kim ok <UNK> and the ending when it does finally get there is one of those truly superb vampire movie endings you'll be talking about for years in a good way in a battle between <UNK> and twilight <UNK> takes the knock out in the first round between let the right one in or near dark it's <UNK> to call 9 5 10

<START> looking back on jim <UNK> works years after his death is like taking a look back into another time for unlike most so called creative types attempting to sell to or worse yet <UNK> exploit children nowadays jim never seemed to really forget what it was like to be a child and if there ever was a moment in which he demonstrated this <UNK> aside it is <UNK> muppet movie filmed as an <UNK> story about how <UNK> came to work in children's television as a <UNK> and ended up with a half hour show of his own on <UNK> television the muppet movie ends up an <UNK> of everything more <UNK> understanding sorts would say to children who did not quite meet the expected norm during the 1980s and as we enjoy the <UNK> of an era in which we are <UNK> and bound from speaking about anything <UNK> someone might get offended the open celebration of difference or diversity that formed a large part of the muppet show is on offer here i have said it in other comments but i must say it here a great light in the world went out the day jim <UNK> died br br the muppet movie begins with its cast sitting down to see the premiere of what were about to see for the next <UNK> or so minutes in short precise <UNK> we are introduced to the major players as well as some of the <UNK> and when the story proper begins boy are we given a great song to bring us into the moment the <UNK> connection painted both a beautiful and sad image of what the muppets especially <UNK> were these were not just a bunch of felt puppets with <UNK> personalities who combined to put on a show they were living things based upon a part of all of us only <UNK> so much more <UNK> than we are used to as each muppet was introduced to us in turn we saw another reflection of part of ourselves and of course the children in the audience would respond differently to each character hence everyone had a favourite when animal appeared behind a drum <UNK> and attempted to eat a <UNK> i knew i had found one of mine nowadays i am more of a swedish chef fan but what the hey br br <UNK> the characters was a string of musical numbers that further developed their motivations and personalities can you picture that shared an insight into dr teeth and his band as well as the creative soul of <UNK> but the most relevant song to me was <UNK> number asking what he is and where he came from many of us would spend a lifetime <UNK> into the stars and like <UNK> saying we knew we would be going back there someday not that all the songs were so deadly serious of course and <UNK> share a number after they decide to combine their talent or lack thereof and hit the road if any evidence were required that present day musicians have lost the ability to use the pop structure to create something <UNK> this number would be it never before and never again would the group dynamic of a cast and the music so perfectly <UNK> one another with the and voice actors so perfectly on top of their game the human cast had a lot to live up to br br which makes it all the more amazing that the human element also lived up to their end of the deal cameos literally pepper the film with everyone from steve martin to telly <UNK> popping in to offer their support even richard <UNK> the last man one would expect to see in a film about the muppets appears to set up a hilarious moment mel <UNK> cameo is just as disturbing to me as an adult as it was when i was a small boy but i suspect that is because <UNK> knew why i would find it disturbing now the big acting strength though comes from charles <UNK> who as doc hopper <UNK> everything both <UNK> and his audience determined to resist at every <UNK> hopper comes to either offer <UNK> the chance to sell out and <UNK> his own kind or perhaps offer stops being the right word when <UNK> attempts to ensure <UNK> <UNK> become <UNK> more <UNK> and violent the whole thing is one big metaphor for how every artist has his heart broken by the world br br of course animal also shows up to remind us that just because our friends are not sweet and <UNK> does not make them any less of a friend in point of fact animal turns out to be the best friend that <UNK> has in that moment and that has been the core message of every good show or film <UNK> has been involved in ever since that <UNK> or <UNK> others simply because of <UNK> or <UNK> differences could literally be the worst mistake one ever makes there can be little doubt that in today's world where a moron in a purple suit can tell my sons they are not good if they do not have good feelings for fifteen seasons and still not come under serious investigation by child <UNK> authorities <UNK> creature <UNK> could never have got off the ground to <UNK> the album title daring to be stupid is one thing but <UNK> the choice upon others is another matter the muppet movie demonstrates how <UNK> <UNK> to ask us all to think both inside and outside of the proverbial box there will never be another entirely like him but he never would want us to stop trying br br therefore the muppet movie is the epitome of a ten out of ten film if we were to send a film out into the <UNK> to prove to intelligent life that we are worth more than being <UNK> this would be it
<START> it was riveting i just could not look away as the movie rolled on i started to feel that it was powerful and confronting but i had no idea how much more intense it would get br br the movie gives an insight into what unfortunately is everyday life for a lot of school kids some of us live outside that environment and would walk by and not know what is happening br br parents need to see this film in particular just to see a glimpse of what their kids go through often parent dismiss their kids problems as trivial but unfortunately to a high <UNK> they are massive and unfortunately the problems can <UNK> into a tragedy br br <UNK> a must see for all
<START> <UNK> intense and enthusiastic is a documentary like story of a male choir up in in the very northern part of <UNK> where the weather is cold and hostile the days are dark during the winter and the towns are faced with young people moving to the more populated parts in the south of <UNK> where the climate is <UNK> and there are more opportunities br br the most beautiful part of this movie is the humans themselves the people in the choir who are aged from 30 to 95 all have unique colorful lives and are very enjoyable beings they are <UNK> by the harsh climate and the <UNK> of the north and have adapted to the way of living required throughout the movie we learn a bit about many people in the choir and we follow them through songs some events in a church and on the <UNK> and in the end a trip to br br the outside environment filmed in the movie is very beautiful and <UNK> by the norwegian nature the <UNK> is also natural and taken directly from the choir and from the peoples lives that we meet r the bathroom the <UNK> on the <UNK> there is nothing artificial about this movie not the people not the environment not their music and not their feelings everything is as real as can be br br it all loses out though when it comes to giving a story it is very beautiful and real but why do we see it is it because of the songs is it because of the nature or is it simply just to see a story about <UNK> choir about their life and some of the <UNK> they have the message if there is any is that this small society <UNK> with life through such social events like the choir the choir have kept the people together for many many years br br it is all nice but being as popular as it has been seen by almost 200 000 in <UNK> there is something wrong there is no beginning or end to it nobody <UNK> or loses anything nobody reveals any message or tries to convince the audience of that this is good or that life up there is great why was this movie made br br i am sorry it is a nice movie about good people but compared to the average european <UNK> or norwegian movie this does not deserve a 9 out of 10 it is closer to 4 out of 10 and that is what i will give it br br if you see this movie in a theater you should expect the average age on the audience to be around <UNK> 60 it has reported to be consistently high in all theaters maybe this is also the reason for it receiving such very high praise in the news and good <UNK> also on the imdb it is a movie about <UNK> for <UNK> it is a movie of i regret nothing in my life and a story saying that living in a small town like might be a nice life too
<START> <UNK> the <UNK> is one of the modern day television productions that prove that some television can be just as good or even better as this is than what you see at your local theater br br if you want to read the plot read this and if you want other details skip down to the next paragraph this is the unforgettable portrait of an unconventional young girl named <UNK> who works as a naive <UNK> girl until she discovers her repressed homosexuality when she falls in love with a successful woman named kitty who dresses as a male for her stage profession the young girl soon joins the act as another male <UNK> and they are a major hit soon the both of them <UNK> on a tender affair kitty eventually becomes <UNK> in a marriage of <UNK> and <UNK> young heart from then on <UNK> works as male <UNK> prostitute to men looking to have sex with boys then she becomes the private sex slave to the evil and <UNK> diana where <UNK> experiences severe emotional abuse when that ends badly <UNK> is on the streets again where she recalls a young woman named <UNK> a good hearted <UNK> who had the true potential of being a wonderful partner that's where <UNK> will discover the power of <UNK> and learn how to get back to fame br br the region 1 transfer is of exceptional picture quality there is a very good scene selection an <UNK> photo gallery and a fun interview between novelist sara waters and the film's writer andrew davies br br the sets costumes cinematography and music are gorgeous the acting writing and directing are extremely strong and filled with realism class and originality i loved the film and the novel section iii in the film is much different in the film than in the novel because section iii in the novel is great written down but isn't screen material i will be brave and say that i love the films interpretation of it much more br br this breathtaking historical <UNK> combines drama comedy <UNK> and romance to vibrant perfection in a way that is both deeply moving and <UNK> uplifting for every mature and open minded adult who has ever felt the pleasures pains and power of falling in love and living life to it's <UNK> a revolutionary production an absolute must see
<START> i'm not here to tell you <UNK> is <UNK> or fellini esquire nope <UNK> directors are more like don <UNK> charlie and walter hill the warriors those two didn't fool around with like putting women in their movies no <UNK> need apply they <UNK> made guy movies guns lots of guns men met violent death with a <UNK> of the jaw their movies were like a <UNK> to the head you want a friend get a dog br br <UNK> is so a guy movie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bloody <UNK> wounds exploding money if that doesn't get the lizard part of your brain excited then stay away br br at <UNK> minutes <UNK> is all muscle without an ounce of fat we meet six security guards who drive <UNK> <UNK> three per truck the six led by matt dillon scheme up a fake <UNK> involving two <UNK> their mission one day is to deliver <UNK> million from the federal <UNK> i think the idea is to drive both <UNK> to a warehouse <UNK> the cash then stage a <UNK> sure the cops will suspect them but if they stick together they'll get through it br br trouble is one of the six played by <UNK> short is a at first but he faces <UNK> and he's the guardian for his messed up younger brother he needs cash bad br br matt dillon <UNK> <UNK> the no blood on anyone's hands a clean <UNK> all good no bad you'll be rich forever blue <UNK> smiling at you br br right br br everything goes to hell of course it's one damned thing after another and the stakes keep going up and it almost all happens <UNK> inside an abandoned warehouse somewhere in los angeles in fact the movie goes out of its way to project a backdrop of industrial urban <UNK> i happen to like industrial urban <UNK> br br kudos to matt dillon who plays the top bad dog he goes from charming to disappointed to frustrated to <UNK> to totally <UNK> insane in the course of the movie love that guy br br also credit is due to the menacing <UNK> <UNK> and totally sinister electronic soundtrack by john murphy i am guessing he's heard a few <UNK> dream records br br also it's surprising that this is a pg 13 movie i caught one  one  f bomb in this entire movie about violent tough guy robbers on some level i like that take the kids br br the director is a hungarian who made a fine noir set in the <UNK> subway system called screenwriter is an out of nowhere guy called james v simpson br br a lot of the people in this movie are just starting out i am willing to bet the <UNK> given to this movie will rise as time goes on and these filmmakers advance in their careers
<START> while in <UNK> i was able to see a <UNK> copy of this film wow <UNK> is amazing in it very unusual performance he gives aside from <UNK> genius the film however is a dull a film i have ever seen in my life and at times is so poorly done it borders on laughable i am also a val kilmer fan so he was part of the reason i made such a grand effort to view the film the problem is val is really only in one scene having his name in the cast as the lead is an insult to my intelligence and to the rest of the cast i have only seen stranded of the directors other films both films are far far below average but both contain very interesting vincent <UNK> performances if you are as much as a <UNK> fan as i then see this film regardless of how bad it is if you do not like <UNK> then there is zero left to love
<START> anyone looking to learn more about the development of <UNK> should find <UNK> and z boys adequate research material this is not to be confused with <UNK> of <UNK> that sorry hollywood attempt to cash in on the success of the original <UNK> revival br br directed by <UNK> <UNK> a former z boys himself as well as pro <UNK> and mastermind behind the 80s bones <UNK> and co written with <UNK> <UNK> craig this documentary <UNK> how a group of surfing kids from southern <UNK> mean streets known as <UNK> who formed the z boys <UNK> team actually there was one girl peggy <UNK> <UNK> the film contains interviews from nearly all of the z boys chris <UNK> <UNK> are unknown with the most being bad ass tony and the youngest jay adams who's talents along with seemed to <UNK> the rest of the teams there are interviews of the <UNK> and the <UNK> shop <UNK> <UNK> designer jeff ho skip and craig there are also interviews of folks like tony <UNK> obviously ian and henry <UNK> who were young kids in the 70s when <UNK> was making it's influence on <UNK> <UNK> was a whole other context in previous years as the documentary explains br br it really shows you not only who the <UNK> team was and how they formed but why their style changed not only <UNK> tricks pool <UNK> became popular and thus gave way to <UNK> <UNK> but also <UNK> the sport though not into the extreme <UNK> it is today as more than just the fleeting <UNK> it had been earlier as these surfing kids who's waves ran out in the early morning needed ways to spend their time and eventually got into <UNK> the days of russ <UNK> and alan were long over as the <UNK> at least through the publicity of their <UNK> team <UNK> the way for the new generation of <UNK> because <UNK> got all the attention they were able to push <UNK> to the next step br br it's a great documentary in the way that it is put together though <UNK> <UNK> always knew how to do this even when producing the bones <UNK> mini movies <UNK> like <UNK> this and search for animal <UNK> narrated by sean penn the film is accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack contains lots of terrific archive footage and lots of interview to give you a genuine feel of who the z boys were and how they made their mark on <UNK>
<START> viewed this the other night on cable on demand and thought this is the type of movie that might have starred alec <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> if it had been made in the late 50's a farce in the english tradition alfred <UNK> and brenda <UNK> are very sweet and sincere in their portrayals <UNK> <UNK> simply <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ish if she could have acted way rest of the cast have some great turns and bits the <UNK> landscape is delightful an absurd premise indeed and not at all believable but that doesn't get in the way of enjoyment not a great movie mind you but a truly fun watch and walken is at his wacky best a joy to behold
<START> i did my best to watch this two hour fiasco it combined the awful special effects and plot of the original blob with an <UNK> <UNK> of the outstanding in the original screenplay of runaway train the only explanation for this movie is that someone needed to take a huge tax <UNK> and figured they'd combine it with a shot at <UNK> a casting couch what an incredible stinker lou diamond phillips is anxious to show us why he will take any part no matter how bad barry corbin continues his career as a <UNK> creep a u s senator from texas and plays it well he should next do the lead role in the story of <UNK> <UNK> or jesse <UNK> the women in this flick all seem to have gotten their roles as <UNK> <UNK> in the fay <UNK> <UNK> screaming contest special effects are unbelievably bad h s kids in film class in north <UNK> could have done a better job the writers must have pulled a heist at the cliché bank to <UNK> this many i couldn't watch any more without being forced to sit in the clockwork orange chair i have no idea how it ended except obviously minutes too late ugh <UNK>
<START> this show was incredible but too <UNK> for most people if you had never truly seen a european variety show in the 70's or 80's or at least a mexican one the entire show would probably be lost on you if you had this show was a dead on <UNK> satire of the phony spectacle and <UNK> that these shows dive into at their worst <UNK> by a chain smoking suave wannabe with a <UNK> <UNK> and his ultra glamorous and <UNK> of an ex wife <UNK> variety is a variety show that tries to get off the ground every episode but always <UNK> into in fighting and acts gone very wrong the <UNK> are joined by johnny a dim witted side kick who seems to have been named because blue <UNK> are a very popular product in his country and that means the kids will like him which of course they don't br br the result was a hilarious spoof of variety shows in general imagine the arguing that probably happened <UNK> during the last days of the sonny cher show now imagine it's happening <UNK> in front of you and the stars are trying to keep their <UNK> now add cheesy acts and a euro mentality <UNK> booze accents and <UNK> now you have <UNK> variety br br have you ever heard a musician whose music was pretty much written for other musicians too <UNK> <UNK> variety did this for comedians way too <UNK> for the standard american audience it was funny as hell and doomed
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and i watch it from time to time still i've used it in my music classes at the school where i teach the kids seem to enjoy it although they wish it were in color br br the best thing about this movie is for me who grew up after had died is the chance to actually see the master <UNK> work his craft i was surprised at how up to date the story line is although references to <UNK> school are outdated a boy whose father had died and is being raised by his mom and <UNK> most of our kids today are being raised by although the movie makes it seem like most are cruel i get very angry when his mother doesn't take his side and defend his actions against the step father br br also the musical <UNK> are difficult to believe i find it unbelievable that a child who looks to be about 8 can play the minute <UNK> or that a 13 year old girl could sing an <UNK> from <UNK> br br other than that it's a really fun feel good movie and i do recommend it i wish it would come out on dvd
<START> this is a ravishing yet spare adaption of thomas <UNK> <UNK> of the same title <UNK> <UNK> gives his finest screen performance he himself believed so the dialogue is minimal so his face must register the nuances of his <UNK> character a composer a writer in the <UNK> the only major <UNK> who travels to <UNK> in <UNK> visconti <UNK> in the portrayal of beauty it's passing and the <UNK> of <UNK> beneath trained as an opera director visconti <UNK> music and imagery <UNK> in his finest film since the <UNK> another stunning film which greatly influenced <UNK> <UNK> in the godfather
<START> this movie moved much too slowly for my taste the concept of the story is <UNK> different in that it explores the family dynamics of living with a mentally retarded family member in a way that i have not previously seen on screen however the execution of the concept was flawed each character was developed fully within the scene of her first appearance then one had to endure the feeling that each character was <UNK> water the rest of the way that is each character about <UNK> in her <UNK> relationships with others in the movie which i found to be a form of emotional and social <UNK> i suppose this has artistic merit given the irony that the story centers around an intellectually retarded individual surrounded by way above average intelligence friends and family the acting however was well done without exception i agree with other reviewers that the cinematography was beautiful in summary i think the film has strong artistic merit because of the fine acting and cinematography but fails on an emotional level due to the shortcomings described
<START> wow what a strange film it's a david lynch movie so it's no surprise that it is weird br br i defy anyone to totally explain everything in this film i can't be done after some research following my second viewing of this film i pretty much know most of the story but on a first look and with no aid from other reviewers or outside help it is hard to figure things out so if you're in that boat and was confused don't feel bad that's normal let me just say the key to the film is <UNK> <UNK> character br br at any rate i find the film fascinating i love the wonderful visuals and rich colors and find each character in this movie really different and fun to watch the camera work is excellent and the music is creepy a la lynch's blue <UNK> there also are some good sound effects to help some of the dramatic scenes in all it's very well scored br br like lynch's twin peaks television series this was a film in which the end was <UNK> together afterward since lynch thought this film was going to be a long drawn out tv series when that didn't happen he <UNK> at the last minute this ending that may account for some of the confusion at the end and the lack of explanations concerning characters we see earlier in the film but who mysteriously disappear br br the theme of the story supposedly is a negative comment about hollywood and what it does to people especially those whose dreams of being an actor are crushed br br both <UNK> and the other leading lady laura are very interesting to watch especially in their celebrated lesbian sex scene looks wise both women were looking average at times stunning at other times br br i enjoyed this movie more on the second viewing than the first it's not just a curiosity piece it's a very intriguing movie just don't feel stupid if you can't make sense of a few things
<START> okay i agree with all the barney <UNK> on this site i think barney and his friends are all ugly looking and obnoxious and the show is very <UNK> sided and unrealistic br br but the thing that <UNK> me off the most is how barney presented gays lesbians and on his show when talking about same sex parents and relatives that wouldn't be so much of a problem if the creators of this show didn't use so many <UNK> stereotypes of <UNK> i mean not all gay men wear <UNK> and love the colors purple and pink and not all lesbians are ugly and <UNK> looking with a <UNK> that <UNK> to their <UNK> as a <UNK> female i just think this is terrible for a children's show if this were south park i wouldn't mind it because south park is for people who can <UNK> fantasy from reality a lot of people who watch barney are little kids or handicapped people who can't usually <UNK> fantasy from reality br br and now that i think about it barney sort of comes off as an ugly gay stereotype himself let's see he doesn't have a girlfriend he's <UNK> colored and wears clothes with <UNK> yes it's true on it if you claim to be for the rights of gay and <UNK> individuals then stop making a mockery out of them in front of people who don't know any better if barney went black face and ate fried chicken and <UNK> at the same time the show would be pulled off the air before you know it br br i give this show a negative one out of five don't show your kids such hateful crap there are children's shows out there that are so less insulting
<START> i recently watched this film on the sundance channel and it kept me interested from the start however it seems to take forever getting itself where it wants to go and in the end i felt somewhat cheated in a nutshell noble <UNK> of walker texas ranger fame plays a boat salesman who starts getting <UNK> by <UNK> from a man claiming to be his son according to the mysterious <UNK> <UNK> has a dark dirty little secret that affects the son and he the son is enjoying reminding him of it i won't spoil anything for anyone but for me three things kept me from liking this movie a great deal one the movie has more foul language than <UNK> scarface casino and <UNK> <UNK> ross combined 99 of it is <UNK> from <UNK> himself it didn't take long to wear me out with constant four letter words two i simply could not believe that anyone would answer the <UNK> that many times especially when one knows that a <UNK> <UNK> is on the other end of the line no matter where <UNK> is in the movie whether it be at work home a diner etc the phone rings and he always answers it <UNK> <UNK> at the son and then hanging up only to answer it again when the <UNK> calls back in about ten seconds how many of us would do that now i realize that we probably do not have a movie if he doesn't keep answering but i just could not suspend disbelief on that particular matter three and this is the most minor of the criticisms why is the director so opposed to showing us the man a k a the <UNK> son most of the time he's just a redneck sounding voice on the other end of the phone i could have lived with that one if other things had fallen into place but since they didn't it's just one more to <UNK> on i do give the movie credit for being a somewhat original idea and for holding my attention with suspense from the beginning but that's about it do see it if only one time however if you're like me you'll be saying triple k marine in your sleep for a night or two after you finish watching it
<START> i saw this film as a kid about 30 years ago and i haven't forgotten it to this day i couldn't say whether it's a good picture but in those days i instantly fell in love with jean simmons the memories concentrate on the very erotic feel of the movie but i still remember the plot simmons was very young then and there is another film that gave me the same feeling david <UNK> great expectations and again it was the young jean simmons it's a pity that blue <UNK> is not available on video i'd like to correct my memories
<START> wow i caught this on <UNK> recently after i watched but im a <UNK> id never heard of this movie but the description sounded remotely interesting i went in with low expectations and now i must say this is one of the best love stories ever in film robin <UNK> does an excellent job portraying a person with the relationship between the two and just the slightest details in the film are so and believable i usually hate romance and love films but this movie truly touched me i so recommend this movie to anyone with the ability of vision
<START> the <UNK> for this show is he's speaking his mind we're hiring extra lawyers if you look back in time any classic raunchy comedian never <UNK> himself in being controversial richard <UNK> <UNK> wasn't i'm crude racist and daring that's basically how comedy central is marketing this show in your face non pc and honest but how can a television show pride itself in being this way where's the <UNK> and <UNK> and what suddenly has made carlos <UNK> this huge figure for comedy central let's start at the beginning dave <UNK> his show which became unexpectedly popular and controversial and comedy central is looking around for someone new to push they hire this guy named ned who claims to be a mexican even though he isn't they splatter his face on a few tv ads and make it look like they're being daring by <UNK> him upon the public br br i've seen a lot of hateful topics on the <UNK> for this show and i don't agree with <UNK> <UNK> this is not an awful show it had me crying in laughter a few times when it's funny it's very very funny yes it's juvenile but so was <UNK> br br the problem with carlos is that he uses a lot of the same material over and over and he's too obvious the overt marketing put aside carlos has now said so many times i have lost count he's trying to make it the next famous line like i'm rick james b but it's way too obvious br br in terms of repeating himself carlos uses many of the same jokes over and over for example on one episode he said he'd love it if all <UNK> disappeared from america overnight he'd wake up and an american guy would be saying room in a southern accent br br he used this exact same joke <UNK> when he appeared as a guest on adam talk show it was a great deal less funny the second time around because he seemed more desperate br br is carlos funny i think so there are some outrageous moments on his show but he focuses too much on trying to be controversial rather than just going with the flow and letting his comedy naturally progress repeating silly little <UNK> over and over again coupled with goofy faces and loud vocal screams does indeed get old quite fast i just hope carlos or his writers can give a new edge to this show because right now it's starting to <UNK> in repeat hell
<START> mark <UNK> played <UNK> and hyde br br michael <UNK> was the dad br br tim <UNK> was the plastic surgeon br br did you even see this movie i doubt it br br <UNK> was fairly popular at this time for playing the <UNK> popping doctor on <UNK> <UNK> has been funny in anything he does from movies to series to stand up comedy if i ever find this movie on dvd i will definitely buy it i recorded this movie off of hbo back in <UNK> and have pretty much worn out the tape one of the funniest takes on the <UNK> hyde theme ever br br of course with all the cocaine references in this movie it'd be <UNK> as being way too politically incorrect today as would cheech and chong too bad because it is funny funny funny
<START> i was unsure of this movie before renting and did so on the <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> has always given excellent performances in her movies she seems to rely on restraint to gain the emotional impact that she does and she didn't prove me wrong in this movie br br however the movie also had fantastic performances from all other members of the cast both speaking and non speaking i have to single out jamie <UNK> and the two main protagonists for their outstanding acting abilities and portrayal of true human feelings and <UNK> the whole movie ran almost like a documentary br br i must applaud tom hooper as the director and <UNK> as the editor for keeping a multiple layered story being revealed smoothly whilst keeping dialogue and action moving along in an understandable fashion the opening sequence of the south african landscape was striking and i had to push the pause button to <UNK> the photography br br why can't a movie like this ever get nominated for an international award it seems to me to hit the high rating button on all counts it was not just a film it was a true experience of life in a country coming out of apartheid a life of poverty was all around but it celebrated the dignity of the human spirit
<START> the biggest problem with this film is that it's nothing like bruce <UNK> the first film played upon every fantasy of being able to control ones surroundings as one sees fit <UNK> experience though is entirely different he has none of the control that jim carrey fools around with and instead the story centers around the power of belief now this would have been fine since the first film was preaching the same message the problem is that the sequel does it's preaching at the expense of the comic relief and to add insult to injury it also throws in politics into the plot you get the distinct feeling that there is a clear message with this film and it's main objective is not to make you laugh to sum things up this movie is failed mixture of eddie the distinguished gentleman and charlton <UNK> the ten <UNK> i'm not sure if steve <UNK> is at fault here you get a sense that it's his character that limits his abilities as a comedian the former news anchor <UNK> <UNK> is not supposed to be funny he's basically an antagonist made into a protagonist which in this case only adds to the confusion of what this movies message is supposed to be about
<START> while my kids enjoyed the movie and announced afterward that they want to buy it later i think i got more out of it that they did the scene in the airport shop at the beginning is real life i did not use the cutting comment <UNK> but i thought it it is a feel good mid life movie a bit sappy and some scenes work less well than others why does the kid stay with bruce willis after he knows his mom is dying but all in all and good time it also gave our family something to talk about did my kids think my life was boring what do they expect at 40 how can you not like a movie that gets a good conversation going with your kids
<START> one of the intriguing aspects of this historical drama is the way the <UNK> or british american <UNK> are portrayed and the sort of <UNK> given to their <UNK> support for king george iii in many ways the american revolution was definitely a family affair in that some of the <UNK> colonial families were split <UNK> by it if there is a strong criticism to be made of this film it is that perhaps the people in this story are made out to be a little bit <UNK> than they were in real life br br in some regards the actions of the character of major played by <UNK> <UNK> make him the least likable member of the cast and the flaw in the storyline he seems to <UNK> from being a <UNK> kind of <UNK> to being a kind of for the cause ' fellow this film does concentrate heavily on the notions of personal honor and personal <UNK> which were a major social in that day and age br br in its subtext the fact that about twenty five percent of the colonial population was decidedly pro british is <UNK> over too but the strength of the <UNK> element is not obviously <UNK> although the good doctor character is about <UNK> five percent upper class <UNK> to steal a fine phrase from monty <UNK> flying circus anne francis does a whole lot with a rather thin section of the script and it stands out she was a good choice for the woman of divided <UNK> a who was rather more modern than the social conventions of that day might have allowed if there had not been a life and death struggle going on br br one good aspect of the film is the way the <UNK> of the american revolutionary leaders <UNK> into outright <UNK> and how these personal conflicts very nearly <UNK> the entire revolutionary effort all in all the leading characters are very well drawn the minor characters are not just human props and the fight scenes are believable enough to carry the dramatic action br br this is a great spy movie it's not quite a great historical drama but it does satisfy well enough it rates a seven largely because <UNK> <UNK> is so deeply immersed in his role and does it so well and because anne francis makes the most of her supporting effort br br the color print used on turner classic movies was very clear as well and so it was an enjoyable presentation in that important regard br br hope it runs again soon
<START> it's the 1980's and the teenagers are ready to party it up in a scary old house that is <UNK> to be haunted by the ghost of murder <UNK> after <UNK> <UNK> the dead through an unfinished conversation on an board the kids are forced to fight to the death battling a vengeful ghost who possesses and kills all of their friends one by one sound familiar it's supposed to it's clearly <UNK> to pay homage to the classic 80's slashers with the <UNK> excessive violence gratuitous nudity zero budget br br can't get enough it's pure entertainment i enjoyed the humor and the way it <UNK> fun at all the horror <UNK> but at the same time <UNK> what was fun about movies from this time there is something you get with this movie you never got with the old 80's slasher films though good acting the entire cast was very talented and you don't see that very much in any low budget flicks recent or otherwise there was a lot of chemistry between the characters i was very entertained throughout the entire film and i am fully convinced the writer director and cast will go a long way in their separate careers the script was very well written and the dialogue <UNK> naturally br br the effects were a bit amateur and the scenes were not lit well but the fact that this movie admits on its cover there was practically no budget i already know this going in this film makes it simple to <UNK> ignore its faults and just sit back and enjoy although this is not an oscar award winning <UNK> it never claims to be and props to that it's a lot of fun if you like slashers you'll really appreciate this film if you like blood and <UNK> you'll appreciate it also
<START> i consider myself to have a decent sense of humor but this movie left me stunned in my chair br br it's so bad that it could just not have been any worse not once did i laugh at the sadly attempted jokes in this movie i have watched and enjoyed several parodies of big movies but unfortunately this one will be the one i remember best in my nightmares br br the only reason anyone should want to watch this is if they want to enter a coma for a brief period of time br br this is the worst movie ever
<START> wow why aren't more british movies like this great rights of passage money with a big heart and some stand out performances the comedy is quirky and original and the kid is really great one to hunt down and watch look out for it ten out of ten
<START> you just cant touch the new crop is just awful the jokes are not funny some of the <UNK> make me want to stop watching tv all together <UNK> you have let your creation go down the toilet the guests sometimes are good the bands are mostly garbage weekend update seth has to tell the audience when to laugh seth would get a proper reception in a <UNK> <UNK> though make sure andy goes with him the show has about 10 jokes in all and they just keep <UNK> them over and over even the segments that are obviously not funny <UNK> people has become the name of the game but they cant even do that right just <UNK> i am so disappointed with what has happened to the show but now i also know it is safe to go out on a saturday night
<START> some days ago in rome a young romanian man with criminal <UNK> <UNK> and tortured to death a middle age lady coming back home after an afternoon of shopping a romanian girl who had seen everything reported what happened br br therefore it started a debate about the too much intense flow of immigrants from romania <UNK> them as criminals everyone <UNK> br br i'm only 15 but i thought what idea of <UNK> does italy give to these poor people how ever do they regard us as the land of plenty yesterday evening i finally saw and my question had an answer when you have only a <UNK> and some <UNK> those propaganda <UNK> showing united states as a land with milk rivers and huge <UNK> makes such an impression br br is really a must see film it <UNK> an <UNK> symbolism milk rivers play hard and rocky mountains the name and character lucy and a cruel realism the mass of hopeful people on the ship the <UNK> at <UNK> island there's a mixed cast going from the <UNK> charlotte <UNK> to the realistic vincenzo <UNK> till a bitter and <UNK> <UNK> as the mother but was it really so hard to enter in the new world
<START> heart of darkness a short novel written by joseph conrad about greed corruption and traveling through africa was to say the least a tedious read the narrator follows <UNK> a <UNK> who travels into the deep of africa to rescue <UNK> somewhat of a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who supposedly went crazy this conclusion <UNK> when the <UNK> stopped coming into the main <UNK> the basis of the story is conrad writing <UNK> of the surroundings he sets the scene wonderfully but possibly a bit to <UNK> the story seemed more like a water color painting as <UNK> to the slow <UNK> mild action story that conrad might have intended to pan out br br it sometimes happens that after you read a book maybe watching the feature film might help <UNK> some thoughts with those in the book or <UNK> versa not so with heart of darkness even with the supporting role of masterpiece actor john <UNK> the movie only confused me more there seemed to be no real main characters in the film no one stood out to the others non of the extensive symbolism was explained it was rather bland and to say the least br br in all do respect to the author the heart of darkness is a true short novel masterpiece it touches on some very severe subjects the lies of <UNK> and the greed of <UNK> it is not a book to be taken lightly and will put you in a rather somber mood a book like this i feel might be to heavy for a lot of people i would however recommend this book to those who <UNK> a sad pseudo action story without a <UNK> happy ending
<START> i agree that this film is too pretentious and it is not easy to know where it is going i have been teaching literature and film for many years and i find this film to be one of the most over rated according to some of the previous reviews here br br however let me remind you that this is the same director who has <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> my mother's smile to his credit a gem of a film br br was he trying to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 2 here the scene with the dogs which has also been pointed out is absurd and excessive  just one example others would take too much space and some reviewers have already noted them br br overall a most frustrating and annoying experience
<START> yes it's <UNK> but writer director alan <UNK> has put together a gem of a version spectacular above and underwater photography from jaws veteran bill butler and haunting music by joel and crosby stills <UNK> make this truly memorable family entertainment <UNK> whose last film was <UNK> the crush shows himself once again to be an extremely talented and versatile filmmaker rent it
<START> are you kidding me this is quite possibly the worst amateur movie i've ever seen the casting was horrible the acting was worse than horrible and i'm sorry the guy at the <UNK> speed <UNK> his plate full of food was somewhere near pointless and the demonic turd and chamber pot chasing drew around was nothing more than comical when i herd about the bell witch i wanted to believe i read some literature on it and thought it sounded like it was possible a plausible story but this movie just destroyed that <UNK> white director writer lead actor etc takes himself a bit too seriously and i think he gives himself a little more credit than he deserves do yourself a favor skip this one
<START> it's not hard to imagine what the main problem for a screenwriter is who wants to have 18 equally well written characters with about the same amount of screen time in a movie that last around 90 minutes it's almost impossible not to fall back on stereotypes and that is also what writer director <UNK> does here very few of the characters can be recognized as people that you and me know in real life many of them are just <UNK> with two or three attributes and stay vague i am aware of that but still think that is successful namely that it <UNK> just what it wants to it is a film with very well written dialogue extremely good acting and a film that made me laugh out loud really often i don't think that this film wants to make a deep going analysis of loneliness in our modern society or that it wants to be moral commentary on speed dating it's a movie about something that exists and people and their motivation to use it funny and entertaining
<START> this movie really left me thinking but not about the plot the direction the characters an underlying message or a clever script far from it i was left wondering what in sam hill went wrong behind the scenes clearly something was badly <UNK> from the beginning br br i'm amazed at the positive comments for the movie and for jodie <UNK> performance from the get go it was clear that foster had <UNK> this one in one earlier comment even made a <UNK> mention of her facial expressions i must have been watching a different movie since ms foster usually a personal favorite seemed to be totally <UNK> br br in one of his first scenes with foster fred ward looks as though he also is distracted by her lack of energy and he struggles to deliver his own lines with any enthusiasm by the time he's called upon to take part in a supposedly desperate search for runaway foster ward also seems to have become embarrassingly half hearted about the project br br in my opinion dennis hopper has always been a <UNK> dimensional performer so i wasn't expecting much from him and he delivered br br yes this one left me thinking long after it ended the fact that joe <UNK> and charlie sheen refused to have their names attached to the project suggests that this was a real stinker for everyone involved but to then learn that the director preferred to hide behind a <UNK> speaks volumes br br but why listen to me i always think foster looks ridiculous in a dress yet she's sensational in <UNK> underwear
<START> mighty like a <UNK> is one of many short films director leo <UNK> did starring <UNK> chase what a dandy it is charlie and his wife both <UNK> plastic surgery to improve their hideous appearances <UNK> <UNK> to each other they then meet at a party and become smitten with each other now they can't allow each other to find out they're cheating that's the preposterous premise of this frantic farce <UNK> <UNK> one of the few comic short leads to have a <UNK> career long after the <UNK> is perfect as long of nose wife <UNK> has an awful case of buck teeth which are quickly <UNK> at the <UNK> after a party is <UNK> by police for no other reason then to practice <UNK> <UNK> and his wife <UNK> try avoiding each other at home for fear the <UNK> in appearances become known both have been photographed with their new features at the party the hilarity back home <UNK> in <UNK> trying to teach the no good nick cheating with his wife a lesson the no good nick of course is the new <UNK> which his wife comes to realize long before <UNK> teaches a lesson in <UNK> this is one of <UNK> <UNK> better efforts of 4 stars
<START> just saw the film tonight in a preview and it's a film for kids only it does not improve or add to the original disney film in any way there is a corny scottish <UNK> style throughout not helped by weak writing where motives are <UNK> in by the and acting that is uneven and often <UNK> despite what reads like a decent cast i have no problem with the wee dog although there is a certain <UNK> the bush <UNK> see below quality about his shots br br for those that don't know <UNK> was an australian kids' tv series from the 1960s where the <UNK> would be an essential part of all the stories it is said that to get poor old <UNK> to act they stuck an <UNK> band round his <UNK> that he then tried to get off with his <UNK> sort of appearing to be <UNK> with the human actors bobby has a similar range and you just don't buy his series of heroic <UNK> at all br br advice would be to take kids aged 8 12 below that they might be scared above that if they or you love it good luck to you but this is strictly cardboard cut out film making for the <UNK> it's a missed opportunity since there is real pathos and <UNK> in the story of bobby and this film fails to deliver it
<START> this movie is a gem it is the story of juliette a perfectly ordinary cleaning woman who works in the large corporate office of a <UNK> company and the president of same he takes no notice of her he takes no notice of anyone until several plots to <UNK> his company away from him all hit at the same time he is lost no one to turn to and no one to trust when he discovers juliette as the cleaning woman no one pays any attention to her so they say and do <UNK> things in front of her that she is smart enough to catch on to and use to help her helpless and hapless boss br br i have been keeping an eye out for years for the dvd of this and to see a previous comment about it being released in <UNK> 2007 raised my hopes alas i cannot find a dvd does anyone know if there is was one
<START> when me and my <UNK> went to see this film we didn't know what to expect however she assured me that it had good reviews so i went along with it we got into the cinema and bought tickets and went into the screen after a while of sitting there waiting for the film to start no one else walked through the door i was very suspicious as you usually get at least a couple of more people in any film screening the film began eventually and we sat there after a while of very little dialogue and very arty type moody scenes i was starting to realise why we were the only people there it was disjointed with random cuts from the main story to kids in a <UNK> park the story it's self made no sense the kid was meant to have committed a crime when he didn't and if he did writing a letter to no one is not an answer and you shouldn't feel not guilty just because you wrote that letter he should have been <UNK> there was no point to this film at all i have no idea why we didn't go and get our money back part of the way through the film i tried to give it a chance i guess there was little concept to this film and the execution was <UNK> the writer and director and just about everyone else who made this film should have realised what they were doing and stopped it is an hour plus that i will never ever ever get back i'm sorry to anyone who liked this film but it's just so so awful i mean really really really bad oh well at least i never have to be subjected to it again
<START> would a different translation have made it or scarier are the subtitles too <UNK> to convey the nuances of the original language does it even matter you may have heard that great actors can make reading a phone book exciting well this is an opportunity to judge for yourself br br if this isn't about homosexuality murder <UNK> <UNK> insanity <UNK> psychology then it is about acting acting helped along with lots of dialog so enjoy the acting or <UNK> about how <UNK> the dialog actually is br br for english <UNK> twelve angry men might be a better choice there's a bit more interaction and you can judge if the acting is consistent with the dialog you don't have to wonder if you're missing something br br i would recommend andy <UNK> empire to those who like this film
<START> a good x evil film with tastes of james bond romeo and juliet and maybe even star wars br br the evil count von bruno receives an english gentleman as a guest for a very dangerous hunt <UNK> the beautiful simple and well <UNK> lady that was forced to marry the count provides the love triangle the count missing eye points to a terrible past the <UNK> is not what the count thinks and is a terrible treat to him there is also the terrible <UNK> <UNK> and even the side appearance of some torture <UNK> br br boris here in a support role makes an strong but somewhat stiff presence the other actors and direction are the symbol of an era the strong <UNK> of black and white movies since the beginning there is no doubt of who is the evil guy who is the good one even <UNK> and <UNK> can be identified somewhat easily
<START> lame is really the best way to describe this movie it has a real poor script uninteresting dialog and characters and it's lacking in basically everything else as well br br there are too many characters and problem is that you don't care about any of them what the movie is lacking is one good and clear main character instead now the movie has a bit of everything it has a bit of an hero it has a bit of a love interest and it has a bit of villain i wish it only had a bit less <UNK> though <UNK> they are just mostly very annoying in this movie br br <UNK> are supposed to be <UNK> creatures who murder for pleasure in this movie however all they want to do is drink beer and watch naked college girls besides someone had the idea to let the <UNK> be able to talk this time this works out really poorly and annoying the <UNK> puppets had been definitely <UNK> for this movie and they are more detailed looking and are able to do more however at the same time they are way more fake looking than the ones from the previous <UNK> movies br br it's obvious that the aim for this movie was more comedy than horror this time the movie is like a lame <UNK> high school comedy even though this movie got released in 1991 it's humor is really the worst and most lame thing about the entire movie it's so incredibly annoying and simply not funny at all br br the story is not going anywhere with its story and the movie is just basically one big mess that never seems to end the <UNK> plot line seems basically to have nothing to do at all with the other plot lines of the movie involving the human characters the movie is not at all about the <UNK> <UNK> a college with the humans trying to hunt them down and stop their rampage no big surprise that this is brent only written movie as of yet he simply has no talent for it and i think that he has discovered this as well and has gone back to college himself instead br br even when compared to the previous <UNK> movies this movie is just simply terrible br br 2 10
<START> i don't dislike cary grant but i've found his performances annoying in enough films to notice this <UNK> old <UNK> and bringing up baby i don't dislike him in north by <UNK> but i really find that movie <UNK> silly on top of that i find the endless raving about <UNK> class tiresome i don't have a clue what his class does for the viewers who <UNK> it it doesn't do a thing for me br br in the behind the scenes feature included with this dvd hitchcock says that grant was her fathers favorite leading man i think he was wrong jimmy stewart was a better leading man in a string of better hitchcock movies br br with it's ruined ending this is really half a movie and doesn't bear discussion and can't support the high ratings it's getting even if the movie had it's ending intact there's not much to it fontaine is a completely unsympathetic sucker she has to remain <UNK> and unwilling to contact anyone but johnny for the whole movie in either ending for his <UNK> to work that's not much to work with cary grant begins every line with until i wanted to <UNK> him he says it about sixty times it's positively grating <UNK> technique here is shockingly shallow an endless succession of rooms sets have a phony <UNK> projected on the rear wall as a effect and a light <UNK> in a glass of milk may make fans excited but it can't save a movie this poorly made br br peter bogdanovich should <UNK> if he does one more hitchcock cary grant imitation on a dvd i think that's his whole career now as soon as i saw him i thought oh crap here comes an imitation that only he's impressed with instead there were two oh joy
<START> don't waste your time the plot drags the characters are wooden and uninteresting the motivations of their actions are completely <UNK> kept waiting for the romantic or comedy to occur and nothing happened worse yet the love letter isn't even romantic but sounds like it was written by someone desperate to make a <UNK> did i mention that the plot twist which we saw coming from 15 mins into the movie was hollywood clever meaning it is intended to shock but given the hollywood mentality does nothing of the sort and instead is vaguely offensive br br it's not even worth the 2 to rent don't bother seeing it
<START> hi i have to say you got some wrong information about the series here the main author was richard carpenter he created the series later on there were some other authors but they only did a few episodes br br the first director who did most of the series i think complete series 1 was ian sharp who created the distinct look of robin of <UNK> br br did indeed see some of the material and they read the i know this for sure because richard carpenter told it on a con in england last year br br i think this is a masterpiece of television entertainment because it has great characters and cast good costumes and great story lines for me still one of the best tv series ever
<START> i would suggest that only the <UNK> is one of the most original and intriguing and in some ways weird movies that peck ever did daring surprising and one of his few best westerns no no of course not a western really but a military <UNK> which sometimes is better it's quite but oh very original and striking it's one of those treats a true buff sometimes gets movies that no one yet told you they exist you sounds intriguing or it surpasses your expectations br br all in all the script shows a level of maturity unusual for the it somehow reminded me <UNK> of it's also straight suspense br br peck looked dashing as a young and tough somewhat gloomy and stoic officer and there are many unexpected the blonde babe kissing and <UNK> with the one she's decided not to marry perhaps a feeling of hers for justice and <UNK>  br br even only  is so much more than a military is as well an action drama a suspense movie a <UNK> action <UNK> <UNK> imaginable a bunch of soldiers in a special mission to <UNK> and stop a possible attack  the insane decision not to take all the available troops to the place where those natives could be only a handful of people  and this plot never takes a crap most would and did  the interest for humans for people and their reasons and actions never <UNK> br br a due word about peck himself he performs with <UNK> and though i usually find his famous movies to be rather insipid and boring in such small <UNK> i find intact all <UNK> somber and even chilling <UNK> he was an unusual star br br i gladly recommend this extraordinary movie
<START> let's begin by <UNK> that there are arguably three types of horror films good bad and utterly embarrassing <UNK> that make the entire genre suffer in every way dark <UNK> promises big with its <UNK> dvd cover but rest assured that is where the show stops following a <UNK> opening montage we soon discover that the film consists of a very poorly written script extremely under <UNK> even for a <UNK> film acting disastrous lighting and even worse special effects seriously could no one afford anything more than a mask for the villain or did they just think it was good enough for jason <UNK> and michael myers so it's good enough for us well it did not work at all to create a scary villain at any rate this is one of the movies that make you check your watch sigh and curse your own <UNK> the timing in every scene is painful and the entire production has a middle school feeling to it come to think of it i have seen better middle school stage productions right down to the special effects i'm trying to think of some way to end this review on a positive note so let me suggest that all copies of this train wreck be <UNK> as drink <UNK> <UNK> wind <UNK> i'd say go see your yourself but that would just be cruel br br check out the rest of this production <UNK> reviews and you'll find the same for every one of their movies they claim to honor the contract between film and audience i e please the fans but all they have done is chuckle and dumped a load on our heads for the cash of which i am sure they saw very little for this br br sorry people the high ratings and <UNK> reviews are obviously posted by those either directly or <UNK> connected to this travesty br br 1 star out of 10 because it is the lowest possible rating giving it even one makes me angry
<START> the last sentence of this review is a major spoiler br br i have enjoyed joe <UNK> work since <UNK> he's done a great deal of different genre parodies that were both funny and honest br br but this is pure crap this is the kind of satire in line with thank you for smoking that is so literal and direct that it leaves nothing a to be laughed at and b to leave the audience to think about br br it's a shame because the plot and the material is so rich <UNK> and <UNK> for intelligent commentary br br by the way there is absolutely no reason for the main character to shoot the ann <UNK> character at the end of the film it's just flat out ridiculous
<START> billed as a romantic comedy set against the early years of wwii it fails to deliver the problem is that while beautifully photographed it has no consistent story line or narrative starting as a murder mystery it offers no hope to its actors as it <UNK> through recent history depardieu is wasted in a trivial role he obviously is not comfortable with playing <UNK> cannot carry the picture the hero is not obviously an imitation of a hitchcock wrongly accused role it lacks balance neither heroic comic nor suspenseful br br this could have been a good film i am reminded of the lady <UNK> which did combine suspense romance and comedy in a serious film dealing with <UNK>
<START> this is a big disappointment the main problem is the acting le is pretty poor as <UNK> and the rest are not much better everybody is very stilted and unnatural also the <UNK> is very 1980's ie <UNK> and <UNK> compared with the likes of <UNK> p p for example br br the script is if anything too faithful to the book and there are some cringe worthy expressions that should have been cut br br in every way this is far inferior to the recent film version which though it took huge liberties with the book seemed far more faithful to the spirit of the book and was far more enjoyable
<START> <UNK> <UNK> moore is getting out of prison and getting revenge often referred to as the godfather of rap he should also be the godfather of great movies the non stop action will keep you on the edge of your seat and will leave you begging for more luckily <UNK> comes back as <UNK> in human <UNK> so sit back relax and have the <UNK> button ready because you won't believe your eyes
<START> i survived the first hour of this and came back for the last ten minutes just to say i saw the end if you want real mythology <UNK> executed look for <UNK> the odyssey great storytelling doesn't need to be <UNK> the stories are fantastic on their own i only hope sean <UNK> needed the money and <UNK> and <UNK> must be <UNK> in their graves wherever those may be br br at least with version the tongue was <UNK> relentlessly in cheek we knew it was mostly but perhaps enough interest was generated in the <UNK> to send someone to the library i'm surprised could turn out something so amusing the tv series and follow it with something so devoid of quality
<START> yes it's a fast times wannabe but it's still decent entertainment br br some of the comedy parts are really funny the scene when the three guys visit the spanish lady is hilarious with a little flamenco music in the background the reaction when her sailor husband comes home is a riot the <UNK> exploits in dealing with <UNK> are funny as well when they try to <UNK> them and when they visit the <UNK> br br the abortion scene is a fast times ripoff too but it does do a good job of capturing the terror of the situation you really feel for what karen is going through and for gary in his mad <UNK> for cash to pay for the abortion and <UNK> her <UNK> br br the ending is painful to watch but <UNK> realistic first time viewers will not be prepared for it and it will be a shock br br there is a decent eye candy for guys with young girls and the <UNK> spanish lady but <UNK> guys will probably want to skip the penis <UNK> competition br br underrated soundtrack too check out early early <UNK> the cars in their prime and an appropriate <UNK> song by james <UNK> for the surprise ending br br some people will hate it and it is somewhat dated but those who like teen flicks or grew up in the early 80s should like it
<START> <UNK> is definitely not the worst movie ever it does have its flaws such as borrowed footage crazy script and non existent special effects these are the worst but it also has some good points too the acting is surprisingly good there are lots of familiar faces whom you probably know if a b movie fan like me br br i was very glad to see brent <UNK> playing one of the heroes knowing him mostly for his 80's action films and i must admit he is not a bad actor at all fred <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> tim <UNK> get some limited screen time but are believable in their parts the eye <UNK> in this fred <UNK> ray movie are <UNK> <UNK> and nicole <UNK> both looking very sexy and very mean michael <UNK> smith adds some muscle to the background as a navy seal unfortunately the only cast member who in my opinion is completely out of place is <UNK> he doesn't act at all talks like he didn't even read the script and being a <UNK> in the beginning of the movie gets shot like a <UNK> a hour later not a good choice br br to sum this movie up this is not such a bad choice for late night entertainment if you can get over the special effects thing so many guns so much fire and not a single wound on anyone <UNK> annoying performance and the recycled footage from airport <UNK> you might like this no <UNK> after all
<START> la <UNK> <UNK> 2005 br br a completely unique take on silent cinema in this fairy tale like story by <UNK> beautifully shot in black and white and practically without dialog la is a feast for the eye and a must for lovers of german <UNK> cinema with most of the <UNK> to the works of fritz lang and <UNK> <UNK> br br 'the city without a <UNK> <UNK> sin is ruled by mr tv he has taken the inhabitants voices and is in total control of all spoken words and images forcing everyone to eat his own brand of tv food mr tv is not just a <UNK> he is the <UNK> of evil and <UNK> even the <UNK> appears as a symbol a number of times he secretly works on a <UNK> device to control all the citizens minds through his television <UNK> for this purpose he kidnaps the only one left with the voice a beautiful singer but a tv <UNK> witnesses the kidnapping and <UNK> to an old tv <UNK> in the mountains in order to halt mr tv's evil plans br br the production design is stunning with beautiful sets and imagery although shot primarily with the basic language of silent cinema <UNK> also adds a number of fresh techniques of his own like a combination of <UNK> and animation techniques everyone talks with each other through text <UNK> usually floating near their mouths the <UNK> they talk the larger the characters the <UNK> themselves can be pushed away or crushed in the opening sequence we see a book titled la that opens and a city of paper rises from the pages there are hardly any references to <UNK> it's constantly <UNK> which gives the film a very un feel while the surreal setting suggests any large city in the <UNK> with only some of the songs revealing the film's <UNK> background br br the pace is swift and there is so much happening on screen it's hard to keep track of the film's surreal narrative not only <UNK> beautiful to look at we're also given a few messages about media <UNK> corruption and <UNK> but they are <UNK> one of the most original films i've seen in years a delight br br the film was shown as the opening film at the <UNK> <UNK> 2007 br br camera <UNK> 9 10
<START> i usually like period films but this one just seemed to drag and drag i'd <UNK> up during rupert <UNK> scenes but vanessa redgrave just put me to sleep br br i was disappointed in the film it lacked a little punch at the end that i'd hoped it would have
<START> in fact parts of it i liked a lot it had some interesting twists but it just left me with a been there seen that feeling after all of the saw movies granted the ending was different from a typical saw but let's face it a group of guys unknown to each other or so they believe tossed together in an abandoned chemical factory br br but then it loses something there's no intensity there's poor group dynamic there's no sense of urgency br br some nice twists at the end and definitely worth a watch if there's nothing else on your plate but it just left me empty it passed the time but it didn't satisfy
<START> ask a thousand people what the greatest unintentional comedy of all time is and they will almost <UNK> tell you battlefield earth or plan 9 from outer space they're wrong american ninja has those two <UNK> beat down for a number of reasons not the least of which being a script that was quite clearly not thought through while i fully support the b picture industry for keeping <UNK> like michael <UNK> in work a little work on the product would have gone a long way br br for those who give a <UNK> <UNK> my next few <UNK> will give away significant parts of the plot br br first of all when we are given some background information on the titular hero we are told his date of birth next of <UNK> parents and so forth are all unknown i don't know about you but i expect the us army to take fact finding about its <UNK> a little more seriously they also manage to screw up the continuity of dates quite effectively although i don't remember quite which dates were screwed up and when this is actually one of american less obvious flaws br br it has been pointed out before but a common failing of many martial arts films is that when our heroes are confronted by large numbers of <UNK> said <UNK> attack one at a time more recent films such as the matrix <UNK> defy this convention but just about every film from the 1980s has the audience screaming hey why don't you attack all at once martial arts films tend to be a lot more impressive when the fights are more extensive than one on one br br the central premise was originally a joke but in light of recent events where the us army cannot crush a mob of <UNK> simply because they won't <UNK> to the <UNK> it seems strangely ironic are stealing weapons from the us <UNK> local division for sale to wealthy <UNK> never mind that such a <UNK> would <UNK> the army to give the local <UNK> responsible or even believed responsible an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this is a cheesy 1980s action film after all br br by far the funniest part of the film is the climactic battle however as joe and jackson turn combining posing and fighting into an art form evil ninjas start to explode for no readily apparent reason i agree with one previous <UNK> in that this film should have been called ninja holocaust because i'm willing to bet a total of at least three hundred evil ninjas bite it during the film's running time on top of that the black star ninja starts fighting with rocket <UNK> laser <UNK> and all sorts of ridiculous <UNK> that are not only poorly thought out they're flat out poorly executed you'll never see a laser <UNK> effect that looks cheaper br br what tops it all off is that the film takes itself so damned seriously during the scene when joe is meeting up again with his old mentor i dare the viewer not to laugh at the hideous dialogue not that i know any modern of <UNK> but the logical part of my imagination has a hard time believing that they have spoken like this at any time in their history during this <UNK> scene i half expect the old guy to tell joe he must prove his <UNK> by cutting his own head off with a blunt plastic <UNK> br br in all i gave american ninja a 1 this is a special score in my system in that it is reserved for the worst most appalling most offensive films i've ever seen or films that make me laugh without even bothering to try american ninja is definitely an example of the latter
<START> this movie was nothing like the book i think the writer of the screenplay must have wanted the job of writing the sequel to gone with the wind and been turned down this was his or her way of getting their ideas in anyway the only similarity between this movie and the story it was portraying was the names of the principle characters and the location of the main action none of the events that are shown in the movie happened that way in the book for a gone with the wind fan of both the book and the movie this was deeply disappointing if you loved the book scarlett don't watch this movie hoping to see it played out on the screen they only share the title in common
<START> i watched cold mountain and the english patient again this weekend the former is a civil war melodrama about jude law a <UNK> soldier who <UNK> the army to return to <UNK> monroe nicole kidman a girl he barely knows both films were lovingly directed by anthony who does an exceptional job although cold mountain is very good it could have been a great movie with the right casting and less <UNK> backwoods dialog br br romantic epics need a convincing heroine the english patient had <UNK> scott thomas who was perfectly cast as the smart <UNK> and beautiful <UNK> <UNK> the main problem with cold mountain is <UNK> who seems silly and dim witted and lacks that quality would make you believe that could become obsessed after one kiss as an actress kidman has a limited range she usually plays stern faced women who face <UNK> with <UNK> kidman was also too old to play the <UNK> and <UNK> love interest the film needed a young actress who could play charming warm and vulnerable for someone who was supposedly enduring <UNK> and near <UNK> she seemed ridiculously well fed and over dressed kidman was so <UNK> <UNK> that it looked like she had spent three hours getting made up for each scene <UNK> <UNK> in her younger days could have played the part perfectly even natalie portman would have been an improvement br br <UNK> was more appropriately <UNK> but her animated performance <UNK> the scenery but maybe she was trying to compensate for kidman jude law was in his own silent movie in the <UNK> role but played his part well ray <UNK> was excellent as the london southern villain br br during the civil war people were probably not very well educated by today's standards and maybe they did speak in <UNK> however if you watch bbc adaptations of dickens austen or mrs everyone is <UNK> maybe this is unrealistic but it would improved my entertainment
<START> i can find no redeeming value to this movie it appears to be loosely based on the lion king school of thought father gets killed son can't fill the shoes and tries to run away etc etc etc the only difference other than being in a <UNK> instead of a jungle is that <UNK> tries to <UNK> things up with club type music they go way over the top in trying to be cool the problem is that it really isn't cool it's like that guy everybody knows at least one of those guys who are older and still hang out with the younger crowd in a <UNK> attempt to <UNK> onto their youth they try to be cool to fit in but they really aren't that's this movie br br but hey if you have money to burn and you feel like paying someone to suck 90 minutes of you life away by all means don't let me stop you
<START> this film was set filmed and premiered in <UNK> miss the hometown of w <UNK> the locale of the 1948 book most of the extras were locals i've been to <UNK> and it has greatly changed this film features will <UNK> as the sheriff he was later <UNK> it was the writers and actors of social dramas such as this film and <UNK> of wrath that were targets of the <UNK> a few years later i don't recall if the actor playing the young boy claude <UNK> jr did anything after the tv series <UNK> 1978 but he was terrific in this earlier film and do not miss elizabeth <UNK> who later played in little women
<START> recently i borrowed a copy of this mess of a movie which took me three sessions over three days to get through that's another comment in the making br br but what i wanted to comment on first was the <UNK> on the special features of the dvd it included a game of memory which asks the player viewer to match up <UNK> of animals in order for them to board the <UNK> however every time it reveals the chosen animal the screen <UNK> the player to find or <UNK> the player on finding it's mate this is a spelling error since it should be its mate as <UNK> <UNK> not a for it is it is an annoying error to keep repeating 16 or more times to finish a game of course it's a kid's activity really but teaches kids incorrect spelling br br and oh yeah the game never changes it is the same game with the same locations of the same animals each time plus it doesn't keep score like the number of moves it took to solve the game so there is no lasting value or challenge to it it's just a feature to list on the <UNK> br br simply put there could have been more thought and care put into this special feature just like there could have been more thought and care put into this muddled film
<START> this must be the dumbest movie i've ever seen and <UNK> it deserves a special award ok so it begins pretty good logical humor and then rapidly changes to complete and utter uh f <UNK> ss stupidity that makes total sense the strange thing is that i hardly laughed at it though i guess it is supposed to be funny with a very serious message after a moment of thought why i didn't laugh the answer was pretty clear this movie is a lot more realistic then i would like it to be so it is extremely dumb yet very wise if the object was to reach people which aren't with a whole lot of <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> huh <UNK> this movie might actually be understood at some level by a big audience br br although they probably just laugh br br ah well nice try br br i am now editing well adding to my comment cause i read some of the other comments first i noticed some people see racism in this movie well that did not at all cross my mind when watching it however i can imagine if you are looking from that perspective you will see some we could of course debate the link between intelligence and race but i think this is not the place to do so i wonder if we were to rate the family here would you complain about them all being black i don't think so but i guess you could aside from that from the 2 <UNK> people in the world half the woman doesn't seem totally <UNK> to me so <UNK> the problem is ' br br secondly the movie gets very mixed ratings from <UNK> to <UNK> and everything in between but a lot of there which means the movie does its job very well it people up makes them want to speak about it and judge it that means it is a good movie whether you like it or hate it after 5 minutes it becomes very <UNK> and boring even yet you keep watching this utter crap i guess you keep hoping that it isn't so or maybe it's our sick way to look at terrible <UNK> well this is one for sure
<START> it pays to watch <UNK> <UNK> or time if it was the original source of the article that served as a supposed inspiration to <UNK> to make this masterpiece based on a true story of an adopted girl who goes in search of her <UNK> parents mr paints a classic that <UNK> as much as it <UNK> <UNK> as much as it and <UNK> as much as it <UNK> br br where does one start the foreboding <UNK> that <UNK> fresh <UNK> in northern <UNK> <UNK> the chaotic household of a family headed by a <UNK> engineer author and 3 <UNK> naughty children or that murky region where reality crosses the point of providing a comfortable existence and becomes a monster of <UNK> and sinister events and <UNK> <UNK> way one looks at it this film is worth being in your collection if you happen to like <UNK> compelling dramas br br mr is a past master in <UNK> fictional tales within real life incidents and in this film he <UNK> class in adapting two real life stories into one i will not go into the story as it is better seen than read but what i will <UNK> upon is the impact it had upon me and why for all the war <UNK> that happens in this world it cannot destroy that simple yet <UNK> force called hope br br innocence in its <UNK> cannot <UNK> the complex desires of adult <UNK> and greed nor does it recognize <UNK> when it is accompanied by the fierce determination to seek what it wants it is an innocence of such nature that drives to seek her <UNK> parents despite <UNK> that they could be lost in the <UNK> of civil war having survived a <UNK> experience of <UNK> with a physically challenged man only to realize that he is a more lethal <UNK> in disguise sticks to her cause in a manner that tears down her well resistance and finally when the <UNK> do meet mother and daughter the reunion is so taut with emotion that even the <UNK> <UNK> father is reduced to tears aided by a background score from a r <UNK> the scene that follows is poignant to melt even the of hearts a list of questions that has to ask her <UNK> mother in a <UNK> as dramatic as the sequence of incidents leading to it a child discovers its mother alive in body but lost in spirit with the <UNK> realization that she has no hope of staying with the one who bore her does to her <UNK> mother what this film's title means a peck on the cheek br br as for the cast the trail is clearly <UNK> by the brilliant ps mr has a gift of <UNK> spectacular performances from little known child <UNK> but this should take nothing away from for an award winning performance with an able supporting cast of <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> she <UNK> the scenes in almost every frame she is in the music may be not as memorable as other <UNK> offerings but that still didn't stop him from <UNK> another national award for the best music direction is as much an <UNK> for the need to <UNK> human life as it is for nature the dialogues are top class <UNK> the touching exchange and <UNK> have on the swing shortly after the revelation that she is not <UNK> daughter and the cinematography superb br br this film is a clear statement to drop arms as much as it is to respect human life and expressions do not judge it as a lesson in film making you will only lose out on experiencing one of the very best from the <UNK> a r <UNK> stable
<START> here is a movie of adventure determination <UNK> bravery plus it's set back in the late <UNK> which makes it even more interesting it's a wonderful adventurous storyline and <UNK> <UNK> is wonderful at playing the wholesome confident no nonsense <UNK> a great role model this is one of my favorite movies it is a movie to be watched again and again and will inspire you and <UNK> your life without a doubt not only is the storyline excellent but the movie also has fabulous scenery and music and is wonderfully directed this movie is as good as gold
<START> this film is about the worst i have seen in a very long time <UNK> <UNK> talent is totally wasted and just about the only thing that i enjoyed was hearing a favorite song of mine if i had a million dollars by <UNK> in the opening credits br br <UNK> <UNK> plays the main character a nice guy who gets <UNK> into house sitting for his boss <UNK> ensue blah blah blah if you have time to kill and having nothing better to do then this is the movie for you otherwise watch something else br br there are not necessarily any redeeming moments but it is nice to see molly shannon and jeffrey <UNK> on the screen they are always pleasures to watch though this film managed to even these bright spots
<START> <UNK> pretty boring and they might as well have shot it in black and white it was so <UNK> br br the movie starts with rolling text explaining and asking whether god or satan is behind it there are some <UNK> outside a lab some people rob a bank and many of the robbers and guards get shot the father of one of the robbers i think <UNK> to have his son frozen there's a lot of jumping around in the beginning from scene to scene introducing characters without us knowing how they relate br br there's a power <UNK> and the containing the frozen people get struck by lightning and they emerge as zombies they're all wearing silver like suits and their skin is dark green and <UNK> no idea why they look so bad being frozen evidently didn't <UNK> their looks and they have silver eyes they go around killing people sometimes <UNK> like zombies sometimes moving like normal people br br linda blair keeps showing up every once in a while to what purpose i'm not really sure i think her character works at the lab but she's not very important to the plot and her role is very small br br the movie ends with some freeze frames with text <UNK> that tell us what happened to the characters next which are pretty silly
<START> taking its <UNK> from backwoods classics deliverance and the texas chain saw massacre jeff just before dawn might not offer much very new in terms of maniac stalks and kills a group of still manages to be an effective shocker thanks to the director's <UNK> handling of the material great use of the stunning scenery even greater use of women in hot pants a brooding <UNK> score from brad and a nifty twist towards the end although one that should be apparent to those who have been paying attention br br thanks to solid performances from its capable oscar winner george kennedy as forest ranger roy is a sense of realism to just before dawn that is all too often missing from this kind of fare the film also offers a pretty creepy maniac who like dick dog and uses a nasty <UNK> to kill and delivers a couple of very imaginative sequences which help lift it above many of its <UNK> a topless woman gratuitous nudity box well and truly <UNK> in a lake discovers that the hand that has been <UNK> her underwater doesn't belong to her boyfriend and a <UNK> character makes out with his <UNK> girlfriend as a joke unaware that the person who is slowly approaching is not his friend but the killer
<START> this is a really great film it gets you thinking about your parents how we all have fragile relationships we all have with them unless we really make an effort to know who they are as people and just as important we should remember to open up and show them our real <UNK> not just who we think they want us to be definitely see this documentary imdb is making me write more text before they will post my comment how odd usually online comments need to be short short and here i am being asked to write more well i went to see the film with my parents i thought afterward they would want to talk about their parents but my dad kept wanting to talk about himself and things in his life he feels he screwed up which was unusual my dad is not a <UNK> man but i was surprised that he wanted to talk about mistakes he thinks he made mike and kitty came to the film to do a q a and there was a hilarious moment afterward when my dad was talking with mike while my mom spoke with kitty really just disregard my last few sentences to pad this comment and just remember <UNK> <UNK> street ' go see it
<START> okay i haven't read the book yet but i have to say that the lead character was miscast how can i say such a thing haven't read the book you ask it's simple as a viewer of this miniseries i grew irritated by the mannerisms gestures and look of the lead character <UNK> price it's one thing to be a good person but it's quite another to be a stick in the mud creature who <UNK> from looking anyone in the face or otherwise meeting their <UNK> apart from the overdone susan b anthony profile she seemed <UNK> in <UNK> to look at another person the scene where <UNK> is <UNK> his heart out to her she is looking straight ahead the whole time forcing him to do the same as a result it was just awkward and i just couldn't <UNK> anyone being in love with her let alone both henry and <UNK> many have said it was true to the book if that is the case i find it hard to believe that jane austen would create such a character as her lead heroine it's possible to create a character who has been put upon by others and succeeds in <UNK> their trust and <UNK> but the portrayal of this character in this miniseries just didn't do it for me
<START> i fully agree with the previous reviewer there's no chemistry between spencer tracy and hedy <UNK> and the focus of the film is on their relationship hedy <UNK> isn't at her best and spencer tracy appears to be naive simple and overly hopeful both in love and life an <UNK> role that played out best in <UNK> if you can make it through the ridiculous crowd scene by the train station <UNK> it's rather slapstick and not worthy of any actor in the cast not the best acting on <UNK> part miscast and <UNK> story is empty and various and <UNK> <UNK> is apparent hedy <UNK> is her absolutely stunning herself which is truly the best part of the film spencer tracy can't match the sophistication of her beauty and wardrobe and the film doesn't come off as believable for at least that reason
<START> life is too short to waste on two hours of hollywood nonsense like this unless you're a clueless 16 year old girl with no sense of reality and nothing better to do dull characters poor acting artificial emotion weak story slow pace and most important to this films flawed existence no one cares about the overly dramatic relationship
<START> the <UNK> legend a la warner brothers epic there's no casting against type here with the flamboyant flynn as the flamboyant <UNK> in this rousing tribute not only to <UNK> but to the men of the <UNK> <UNK> the story <UNK> the life of the famed <UNK> general from his <UNK> days at west point to his final fight at the little big horn great liberties are taken with facts here and we are presented with a <UNK> that is much more sympathetic to the plight of the <UNK> than history relates but this one is done on such a grand scale the battle scenes alone provided <UNK> for every extra in hollywood down beat ending and all this is great fun
<START> i love bad movies <UNK> plan 9 from <UNK> so on and this movie fits right in don't believe anyone who tells you this is good film it's downright awful tim accent moves from german to portuguese to hungarian there's a person in a gorilla suit who is supposed to be able to communicate using a <UNK> that <UNK> the sign language there is a scene with a killer <UNK> that moves around a river like a great white shark there are people <UNK> up and down <UNK> as if there were <UNK> <UNK> on it this thing is laughably ridiculous so ridiculous i was rolling on the floor it is totally implausible i loved every minute of it
<START> <UNK> paul plays a secret agent called she teams up with another drag queen agent to fight the evil manners and get her kidnapped niece back or something like that seriously i had trouble <UNK> on the plot the movie is seemingly directed by somebody with severe add quick camera cuts <UNK> that make it impossible to focus on anything the dialogue is incomprehensible at times and when you can hear it you wish it remained incomprehensible the acting is actually pretty ok except for <UNK> paul who overacts to an embarrassing degree also the film is full of disgusting bathroom humor that is just revolting and not even remotely funny after 30 minutes i had to leave because i was bored sick and just couldn't stand it anymore i pride myself on sitting through anything but this went way beyond my limits people are comparing this to the early work of john waters i disagree <UNK> work is sick but good this is just sick avoid
<START> there was talk on the e hollywood special about the making of dirty dancing which still is considered by many women including a dear friend of mine in her fifties to be one of her favorite all time movies maybe the music the dancing or the melodrama around the plot of baby frances becoming a dancing sensation with johnny castle of course this film established jennifer grey whose biggest role to date was the <UNK> sister in <UNK> day off patrick <UNK> is perfectly cast as the heart <UNK> leading man who <UNK> baby away literally dirty dancing has it all to become a broadway or west end smash hit it has the love story the music and most of all lots of dancing jennifer and patrick could revive their roles easily it is nice to see jerry <UNK> play a doctor instead of a police officer and kelly bishop as the mother it all took place in the <UNK> in the sixties where many jewish families in the area during their summer <UNK> at the end of the film it is sad to see the hotel owner <UNK> be <UNK> by the next generation it happened anyway most people prefer <UNK> and traveling through europe than spending the summer in the <UNK> those old grand <UNK> are becoming indian <UNK> <UNK> let broadway bring dirty dancing alive and well after all they could do it for <UNK> and saturday night fever this should be a no <UNK> i know that this film is one of the favorites that you don't get tired of after watching <UNK> times there are people that have probably seen this film a 1 000 times by now somehow watching the making and the story behind dirty dancing made me long for my childhood days as a thirteen year old dirty dancing may not be the greatest film ever made in the history but its universal appeal still draws crowds and repeated <UNK> like the <UNK> club whose members have watched it so many times i watch it <UNK> now with all the <UNK> of <UNK> first days and her first true love with patrick <UNK> as heart <UNK> johnny castle nobody could have imagined this little film as a big hit then with the sixties music two <UNK> and even a tour in the late eighties i hope they bring it to broadway in a musical it would work for the audience to be part of a film no wonder it still <UNK> kids and even adults particularly women of all ages to watch it over and over again well australia and london both have had productions of dirty dancing it looks like it will come to broadway in 2007 just in time for it's 20th <UNK>
<START> set in paris in the year <UNK> a retired old rich opera singer decides to give her fortune away to her beautiful cat <UNK> voiced by eva <UNK> and her <UNK> but the jealous butler edgar comes up with a plan as he kidnaps the cats and leaves them in the countryside luckily for them with the help of a <UNK> and independent <UNK> named thomas voiced by phil harris helps them get home especially meeting some of his good friends like the <UNK> cat voiced by <UNK> <UNK> and try to foil <UNK> plans br br very entertaining and edgy post walt disney's death animated movie with a couple of nice <UNK> tunes like the memorable everybody wants to be a cat good voice acting and some terrific animation for it's time even in these times of computer animation not one of the greatest disney animated movies but a cult disney animated <UNK> and one of the few gems of it's day that works well highly recommended
<START> it's hard to work up any enthusiasm for this awful cartoon like epic that for some reason has become a cult classic it certainly can't be because of the totally artificial look of the set designs or the <UNK> acting of an all star cast these days it's shown much too frequently on fox movie channel or <UNK> br br it pains me to report that veteran actors like walter <UNK> and joan fontaine are even cast in this muddled science fiction travesty none of which rings true it's like watching an expensive budget being spent on a saturday afternoon kiddie show full of cardboard characters and unconvincing dialog it's a comic book version of the jules <UNK> novel br br the <UNK> fontaine was still attractive but wears a <UNK> expression on her face perhaps <UNK> that she had accepted the role of the psychiatrist before reading the script she contributes absolutely nothing to her cardboard role but an <UNK> and uncomfortable presence and looks totally out of place most of the time <UNK> no better are robert sterling barbara <UNK> and most of all peter lorre as well as frankie <UNK> who gets to sing the title tune which it's safe to say did not become anyone's favorite title tune br br an awfully frustrating experience to sit through a film like this which wastes an attractive cast and is an insult to almost anyone's intelligence totally unconvincing from start to finish the film as well as the fantastic submarine sinks to the bottom of the sea long before the fight with a rubber <UNK> brings the film to a dreary conclusion
<START> this movie was a masterpiece of human emotions and experience i think that a lot of people get caught up in apparent mental illness as the storyline but i was drawn into the relationships of many of the characters and what they reveal about the force of human emotions much of the message of the movie is that we never know the good without the bad which is a little cliché but what makes this movie so good and so original is that it very <UNK> portrays the <UNK> and devastating force that the bad can have whether you see the bad everywhere like <UNK> or are experiencing the utter <UNK> of <UNK> love or a relationship that just isn't going to work no matter how bad you want it to this movie captures how helpless relationships and emotions can make you feel better than any movie i've seen and it is as depressing a movie as it is good
<START> this movie is all about <UNK> there is absolutely no plot at all a <UNK> stops some bad guys with his kung fu to try to get his nightclub back rated r for strong language and a brief sexual situation
<START> it's hard to tell if this ham <UNK> b movie adventure is a spoof a homage or just plain <UNK> but it doesn't work <UNK> way you look at it based on michael <UNK> so so novel it's a nutty mixture of lost cities giant <UNK> monster monkeys <UNK> visual effects and corny dialogue the first thing that this <UNK> is the gorilla that can communicate in sign language and needless to say the film doesn't get any better from that point on making all this old rope somewhat worthwhile are tim <UNK> turning in a <UNK> slice of ham and sporting a bizarre accent that defies <UNK> and ernie hudson who also seems to know that this is all a load of old rubbish
<START> i bought this film as i thought the cast was decent and i like jennifer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br first off let me say the acting is not of a high standard stephen baldwin makes his character look almost retarded at times and at other times <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is so so but not too convincing in some scenes and the supposed poetry she <UNK> in a particular scene in her hotel room is utterly meaningless rubbish ms <UNK> is certainly very suggestive and sexy here but ultimately i think jennifer <UNK> is by far the best in this film ms character is at first innocent then sexy as she plays stephen <UNK> character travis for a fool the supporting cast includes adam baldwin no relation to his more famous m walsh who has appeared in many films also i noticed art evans who was one of john allies in die hard 2 the movie is decent and there are a few nude scenes with <UNK> <UNK> a bit of action but this is certainly not a fast moving or intelligent thriller there is a particular scene when they are in the car about to commit a crime and stephen character is wearing <UNK> and when you see him again the area around his eyes etc is painted black instead then the <UNK> <UNK> later when they are leaving the crime scene and police are in pursuit a very obvious error in editing br br if you are fans of either of the ladies or either baldwin then you may find something to like here but others should steer clear this is a reasonable but <UNK> thriller and not really worth more than a couple of dollars if you want it
<START> i saw this movie when it first came out in france in my hometown <UNK> years ago i was nine and today i still remember each black and white frame especially the black ones because it was so tense scary those <UNK> attacks through that dark pass in the mountain the two soldiers prisoners forced to fight each other by their <UNK> the last battle with the <UNK> of the <UNK> with the <UNK> in it firing away the last fight between peck and the chief and the happy end which let me take back my breath i haven't seen it since then and i don't know if it would be a good idea to see it again today it was such a fabulous moment for the kid i was
<START> the opens with the memorable scene of a monkey in a cage attacking a ripping apart a small toy robot as part of a scientific experiment this random act violence sold it for me and i'm happy to say the rest of provided a <UNK> feast of cheese br br the is about a scientist david who is nearly killed an explosion in his lab whose <UNK> remains are put inside an experimental body suit <UNK> for some <UNK> reason he is <UNK> with a rage response a device <UNK> into his brain that will turn him homicidal if he comes into physical contact with any other person they give some <UNK> explanation about how it is a necessary <UNK> <UNK> but i cannot see the logic in <UNK> such a device unless you wanted a <UNK> cyborg killing machine it is especially ridiculous when it is <UNK> the suit carl is wearing is actually an experimental space suit what possible need would there be for an astronaut to turn into the incredible hulk whilst on a mission he predictably breaks out of the lab and proceeds to battle the dodgy scientists who put him in the suit along with the ninja assassin hunter played by pam <UNK> no really br br the itself looks pretty damn goofy it is basically a dude in a <UNK> golden foil suit he also has a <UNK> <UNK> look in his eyes that doesn't inspire fear or even compassion i guess you can't blame him for that most people watching the movie will have that same look on their faces br br the acting is of the really bad stilted <UNK> not sure what the character's emotions or thoughts are that this point so i'll take a <UNK> and <UNK> out my dialogue in a random tone of voice whilst trying not look at the <UNK> school of acting the actor playing the funky black scientist even struggles with this last part br br it is after this initial accidental death that the goes after the scientists strangely enough the whole rage response <UNK> me and i'll kill <UNK> thing doesn't play as big a role as you might expect with carl going after his former <UNK> in a reasonably detached manner there was one scene where he rather brutally kills some street <UNK> who push him around i know that it is de <UNK> for street gangs to randomly assault the lead characters in eighties movies but surely one of them must have realised it might be a bad idea to attack the <UNK> cyborg guy even if he does look like retarded cousin as it is they don't even seem that surprised to see a <UNK> golden cyborg walking down the street as though it was an every day <UNK> for them the only other time this rage response comes up in the movie is when old carl can't give his wife a hug when hunter tries to turn this against him by throwing her into him so he'll be forced to kill her he casually remarks he has himself off screen naturally so this doesn't happen they could have left out the whole rage response thing and just gone with a straight revenge story and it wouldn't have made a huge difference to the movie br br there is an amusing sequence in the <UNK> as <UNK> and her <UNK> track down the due to his <UNK> hide they are all armed with weapons which fire acid ' for some bizarre reason when these weapons fire it is represented on screen by cartoonish red lines that streak toward their targets ala <UNK> the fights back by ripping a gas <UNK> out of the wall and <UNK> all of <UNK> <UNK> in an enormous streak of flame that comes out the resulting <UNK> is so huge and powerful that it comes out of the <UNK> out of a man hole and blows up the van a couple of the scientists are strangely enough <UNK> escapes by throwing herself down into the inch deep water despite the fact she was closest to the this is one of several fake fiery explosions throughout the movie including the death of funky black scientist when the sends his van of a cliff this is after they capture the by <UNK> him in a giant <UNK> of no seriously br br there is also one unsettling and long and out of place sequence in which <UNK> <UNK> overweight friend who looks like a poor man's ned beatty reveals his <UNK> with <UNK> wife and tries to rape her it goes on for about 5 10 minutes and is full of disturbing shots of the guy <UNK> over the wife's face <UNK> on top of her and trying to pull her dress off it is <UNK> to say the least and seems really out of <UNK> with most of the rest of the movie which is kind of cartoonish and larger than life in its violence br br the movies finale involves the battling a whole bunch of other <UNK> in battle suits for whatever reason all these other <UNK> are less kick <UNK> than carl some of them being <UNK> by the wife simply by having a <UNK> tube in their side ripped out luckily for carl the suit he is wearing lacks this crucial design flaw the only really memorable part toward the end is the death of <UNK> doing something i've never seen a baddie do in a movie before in the middle of her confrontation with the she decides she really doesn't stand a chance against him and in a rather of matter of fact manner blows her own brains out with his pistol
<START> i know what most of people will think about this movie without even seen it 'the typical movie from a famous singer it will be a pink movie a teenage film it will be stupid ' and stuff like that and yes it is i mean it's a pink movie but you know what i loved it seriously it's a very romantic film i think that every girl in this world has <UNK> with something like the plot of met his favorite singer know him as a person and even have a romance with him right i really enjoyed watching that in addition it's really funny br br i think the actors did a great job there's a lot of loving characters and aaron carter <UNK> is not the exception to be honest in the first five minutes of see him act i thought <UNK> will be but then he surprised me really <UNK> br br also i gotta say that the music performances on the film are great i specially loved the part when <UNK> aaron sings without music only with a guitar a very beautiful song this guy is really talented time will tell br br my advice to you watch it don't make a prejudice
<START> br br i used to like some of the hollywood action blockbusters of the 80s they had icons such as arnie and sly but i think the action movie in the <UNK> has <UNK> to new depths the worst of these i believe was <UNK> br br the plot is shamelessly contrived and pulls off the worst cliches as it seeks to <UNK> viewers the melodrama is so <UNK> <UNK> and awful that you actually cannot wait for bruce willis to disappear from the screen <UNK> tyler who had acted admirably in several fine independent features directed by such masters as <UNK> and robert altman <UNK> decided to jump onto the commercial <UNK> this movie the new hollywood aesthetic of grand special effects and precious little good dialogue or authentic melodrama that is the norm these days and i begin to wonder if there is a role in hollywood for screenwriters it seems as though they just employ <UNK> and <UNK> to write the <UNK> scripts the rest they leave to technology there is not a single piece of grand heartfelt human emotion in <UNK> it just feels empty and bland i can think of only one good aspect of this movie and that involves <UNK> <UNK> dad who doesn't even make an appearance in the film steven <UNK> band provide a theme song for the movie a <UNK> that really <UNK> and at least <UNK> at the <UNK> a little when the end credits come up br br i <UNK> for western civilization if people like this predictable <UNK> movie it stands for <UNK> <UNK> and a decline in the human intellect i would even prefer to watch the <UNK> friday the 13th
<START> another brilliant portrayal by <UNK> sutherland who plays mickey hayden a cop dealing with psychic visions of murdered victims i absolutely love movies dealing with the psychic realm and i wasn't disappointed with eye of the killer aka after alice i only wish the movie had been released theatrical first
<START> i am completely into this type of story line but once the movie fired up i honestly said out loud i just rented a two dollar budget christian <UNK> the only thing i could find to like about this film was it has a descent story but it was awfully executed horrible actors horrible direction and producing br br the director and producer need to go watch the cube before trying to pull off a movie in a single room there was absolutely nothing that kept you intrigued to the point that you didn't notice you were in the same room the entire movie horrible the two main actresses were very easy on the eyes and you could tell that was the director counting on to hold your attention but these two and their <UNK> can speak to this are horrible in front of the camera br br don't rent this unless you are blind because it might go up a few stars if you only listen to it
<START> this is possibly the single worst film i have ever seen it has no good features at all br br it looked as if it was made in about 20 minutes with the other time filled with title graphics br br the lead male transformed from deaths door to superman eh you what br br other than that totally predictable and not at all interesting br br i left the cinema feeling cheated br br needless to say i could not <UNK> this film to anyone
<START> i can't believe this movie has 6 stars on imdb this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen that wasn't an episode of mystery science theater 3000 the plot is predictable i couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters the dialog is cheesy several moments in the movie actually made me <UNK> out loud including <UNK> crazy neighbor and the incredibly lame joke that ends the movie jeff <UNK> accent is goofy i can't tell what country he's supposed to be from it has to be one of the least thrilling thrillers i've ever seen as well after sandra <UNK> character disappears absolutely nothing happens to advance the story for a good 45 minutes i would give this movie a negative amount of stars if i could
<START> the movie is a very good movie one of the best from <UNK> raj films the direction is incredible the screenplay is brilliant the story is excellent it tells about <UNK> who is of <UNK> his college friend he is a full blown psycho doing things like talking to his mother on a phone anyway she died 15 years back etc <UNK> is engaged to <UNK> does everything so he can get her he even <UNK> to kill but he survives it he even goes to the place where they are going to their honeymoon the movie is every <UNK> delight <UNK> is superb <UNK> is fairly good sunny is average is okay and so is <UNK> did good the movie belongs to <UNK> the dialogues are brilliant <UNK> ones and a lot if not the overacting and comedy <UNK> and <UNK> mere are absolutely <UNK> tracks
<START> i watched this movie because of <UNK> <UNK> and lauren holly i <UNK> them together on <UNK> <UNK> so it was a treat to see them together again this was not the best movie ever made but it was cute very predictable but sometimes <UNK> fun movies are just what i need br br the <UNK> were gorgeous and i wanted to eat all of them i did love it when that one fell apart though i bet it still <UNK> good br br <UNK> and lauren still had the great chemistry that they had back on <UNK> <UNK> and i <UNK> as they <UNK> in this movie br br i wouldn't watch this again but it was a great filler for one night
<START> the people who came up with this are sick and twisted freaks how the hell can you exploit people like this <UNK> people into thinking that this is real which i probably don't doubt that it is i saw this thing for the very first time today series 7 and it made me sick to my stomach i almost threw up i just couldn't stop crying my eyes out for these poor people and if that woman really did have that baby you should all be ashamed of yourselves i have a 4 month old daughter and it is just absolutely appalling that would put a real pregnant woman in so much <UNK> danger you people are bloody animals and should be locked up for life allowing something like this to put on t v if this so called show is for real then why isn't anyone being put in prison for allowing people to die and not doing a god damn thing about it you all deserve to be <UNK> hunted down
<START> video vault by shawn k br br my architect a son's journey 2003 <UNK> <UNK> not rated vault rating 7 br br what a thing to be <UNK> my architect a son's journey follows philadelphia filmmaker <UNK> <UNK> as he desperately seeks answers from his father the renowned architect louis i <UNK> dead these 30 years br br louis <UNK> died in a train station in 1974 and left behind more than one family the funeral service when the filmmaker was just a boy was shall we say an unpleasant surprise br br we find that <UNK> only knew his father en from his <UNK> visits with his mother whom we are told he loved deeply this movie is about a boy seeking his father and perhaps himself by visiting his work as if the magnificent <UNK> hold some secret br br to be sure louis <UNK> was a gifted architect but architect is a cold word the man was a <UNK> on a grand scale who spoke of his craft in <UNK> terms of silence and art br br among his notable works explored lovingly in the film are the <UNK> <UNK> 1965 the <UNK> art museum 1972 and the monumental <UNK> complex in <UNK> 1983 the portion of the film where <UNK> first visits <UNK> finds the work but not the man br br the film benefits greatly from having much footage of the very public man as he worked in new york city and as a professor at <UNK> and the university of <UNK> many of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> also help flesh out the <UNK> ghost father br br even so the viewer seems not to come to a particularly satisfying place the answers <UNK> khan is looking for seem hollow not good enough br br in scenes where the director meets with his half sisters both from different mothers one can feel the tensions of the years the and hurts one might expect them to burst into anger but only the camera saves them from <UNK> each of these children has <UNK> lost something br br it might be pointed out that khan who seemed a driven <UNK> never became rich instead he became noteworthy it was as if he sacrificed his family for his art this is a <UNK> sad and great thing br br april 28 2005
<START> watching <UNK> is not unlike watching a group of people playing a word game in portuguese or some other language you do not understand you get the idea that they are playing a game and if you watch closely enough you may just begin to understand the rules but why bother since it is clear you can't join in and you wouldn't want to if you had the chance br br director robert altman is not one to beg an audience to like his films let alone understand them sometimes he lets you slip into the picture to be a part of the crowd like in m a s h <UNK> and a wedding films so full of and <UNK> chaos one or two more bodies in the scene wouldn't make much of a difference and other times he seems to <UNK> the fact that someone might even be watching his film as in images or three women where the stories are almost personal monologues made for an audience of one altman with <UNK> altman seems to <UNK> dare anyone to become involved with the narrative br br you can't depend on altman to do the logical or the expected which is sometimes the thing that makes his films so remarkably <UNK> but sometimes doing the unexpected isn't daring just dumb for instance in <UNK> we are introduced to a young woman who is apparently the last person on earth capable of getting pregnant and she is indeed with child this last ray of hope in a <UNK> society is almost immediately <UNK> altman doesn't even wait until the end to play his last depressing card in this elaborate <UNK> and <UNK> tale he lets us know how empty and meaningless life is right off the bat brave maybe stupid definitely devoid of a purpose he tries to build a story on a rapidly melting iceberg all the while reminding us how pointless the effort is br br for the record <UNK> can at least claim to be <UNK> the story is centered on a <UNK> game played by the various bored characters it is a form of tag the assassination game a handful of people target each other for <UNK> each as a would be assassin and each as a would be victim two or more can form <UNK> to kill a third as they die off new targets are assigned whoever lives wins all of this happens at some exotic <UNK> <UNK> it is to a great extent an extreme sci fi version of survivor minus the commercial <UNK> and <UNK> reality br br it is not a bad concept for a sci fi epic a post apocalyptic setting a <UNK> of the world the cast is <UNK> <UNK> a game where no on can be trusted or least not for long and where no one really wins literally a cold war a <UNK> eyed director with a taste for dark humor and violent invention could have a field day the mystery in <UNK> is not in the game or how it is played but in why it exists it all if the game <UNK> is a metaphor for life then altman seems to see nothing in the material but a chance to show life to be an empty meaningless game a conclusion as obvious as it is untrue given the lively albeit cynical nature of the rest of his diverse films i don't believe that altman believes in <UNK> either and if altman has no faith in his material why should we
<START> camp north star and it's camp <UNK> <UNK> harrison bill murray sure would like to end a decades long losing streak to rival camp <UNK> an <UNK> league type place where only the wealthy kids can attend meanwhile we watch as tries his hand at love when he <UNK> <UNK> with fellow female <UNK> <UNK> kate lynch as other teen <UNK> pair up and also fall head over heels the film comes to head at the camp <UNK> as the rivals square off in <UNK> athletic <UNK> with almost realizing their doomed to fail yet another year the film also shows the growing bond between and a quietly lonely puppy dog eyed <UNK> chris <UNK> of <UNK> fame whose dad is often away all the time <UNK> doesn't seem to fit in with the other kids his age and he seems to spend most of his time either <UNK> in the <UNK> with or taking his <UNK> at <UNK> the film mostly contains hi <UNK> of fellow teen camp <UNK> cutting up and <UNK> around br br you have <UNK> <UNK> total nerd <UNK> jack <UNK> with his taped glasses and bad <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> matt craven who likes to blow things up fat kid <UNK> keith knight who is often <UNK> his face amongst others in the film there's a basketball game where poor <UNK> can barely <UNK> the ball against rival camp <UNK> much less shoot an accurate shot with poor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> between his knees fly balls that <UNK> over the back board there's camp fire <UNK> with a spirited scary tale by about a hook handed killer and boys <UNK> over the lovely ladies br br yes i know it's desperate at times trying to squeeze out every laugh it can and occasionally <UNK> in <UNK> of sentimentality such as the scenes with a sad <UNK> and murray but just as much as this recent viewing i found myself <UNK> away i'm <UNK> and just can't help loving this it's a summer camp movie through and through which simply wants to entertain you i can't explain or <UNK> enough the overwhelming joy that <UNK> forth when i see a sleepy <UNK> hand reach from the covers for the alarm clock that's <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a summer camp movie is about to begin his jokes are especially amusing but the flick is let's be honest a series of comic vignettes with murray dead <UNK> endlessly not that there's anything wrong with that the film though couldn't quite survive without him could it hard to even think of this movie without murray in the lead it's a happier time and i think nostalgia of that summer camp experience plays quite a hand in why we grown ups still connect with <UNK> <UNK> and poor <UNK> harvey the camp head who so badly wants things to run smooth and to beat camp <UNK> for a change is the constant source of and <UNK> amusement as they often play gags on him especially when he's sleeping on his bed great enthusiastic cast who seem to be having as much as us
<START> the curse of monkey island has always been my favorite of the series a vibrant visual look an excellent soundtrack and brilliant voice cast all create a memorable and adventure br br graphics wise the game is definitely not a let down though some <UNK> have been cut the over all feel of the game is reminiscent of disney feature length animations the <UNK> is simple and even a <UNK> will get the hang of it soon enough the game also offers a little extra for the more experienced players with its mega monkey mode br br the voice cast is one of my favorites dominic sympathetic voice makes complete and alexandra <UNK> is simply charming as <UNK> earl <UNK> makes for a wonderfully sinister yet over the top villain also the <UNK> charm is added by memorable characters like <UNK> neil ross murray <UNK> and one of my personal favorites <UNK> allan young voice of scrooge <UNK> my hat also goes off to the late great kay and his memorable secondary role as <UNK> br br michael <UNK> and wonderful soundtrack once more <UNK> the monkey island adventure <UNK> of some of the best tunes in the business the game isn't perfect and some locales are not as well detailed as other but i had no <UNK> with the simple ending of the game which i found very satisfying
<START> this film is an almost complete waste of time i am studying the book for my english a level and the film only contributes in one way and that's getting across that the whole scenario is set in a rural <UNK> the acting is wooden the filmography is laughable and the so called dramatic scenes in the film had the majority of my class including me <UNK> into their <UNK> the book although not my favourite literary choice is miles better than the film is and the sound track is just plain irritating don't watch this film unless you are looking for a timeless quality storyline transformed into mindless media waste
<START> just thinking about the movie i laugh to myself anne <UNK> plays an unforgettable part as ' probably the most nasty yet hilarious <UNK> ever captured on film danny <UNK> and billy crystal make a fabulous duo bringing a true warmth to the film though not exceedingly complex the cute story holds your attention and keeps you laughing the whole way through it's a fun comedy to <UNK> things up and even will entertain the kids i give it my full recommendation
<START> i am not a fan of the original book but was expecting to see a better adaptation than the natalie portman movie which i found awful this version is even worse br br first there is very little of ms <UNK> book in this script the whole subplot of george sexuality is completely eliminated and in this version george is merely a <UNK> <UNK> between his duty to the <UNK> family and his duty to the king i thought the title of the book referred to mary as the lesser known of the <UNK> sisters but here it is used to refer to anne br br second the script has the characters <UNK> address the audience as if in confession apparently this is intended to give a bit of back story and explain their motives but it is amateurish in execution br br on top of the bad script the direction is stunningly bad there are too many shots done with a <UNK> camera which is none too steady at best and downright shaky at worst several of the speeches are delivered <UNK> as if in a first rehearsal the production values for <UNK> flamboyant court are minimal the costumes <UNK> some are copies of historical <UNK> and others are from some costume <UNK> <UNK> imagination and the king the source of all power and <UNK> is often shown alone no <UNK> <UNK> no servants in the background where are all the people i am <UNK> to hollywood turning history into fantasy but i expected better from a bbc production even based on a flawed book this production is bad
<START> this show drives me crazy it goes against everything a family should be even if it is intended to be a comedy the show is suppose to follow dave and <UNK> gold michael <UNK> and anita <UNK> as they raise their three teenage children <UNK> larry and mike a good premises for a comedy yes but it does not mean it will be a good show br br i don't think i've ever heard <UNK> talk from parents to children and vice versa the only talk that seems to be in the show is control of children by the parents and sex i know that sexual <UNK> is usually a subject talked about by teenagers often but it is brought up in nearly every episode with no point to it the one episode i was just watching involved the parents giving their daughter <UNK> a car not once do you think they are related in anyway by the way they talk to each other and how the parents talk about how <UNK> is like their slave br br the show fails on the comedy level the most i haven't laughed at this show once in the numerous times i have attempted to watch it and i'm a person who gave such films as animal house and dumb and dumber very high marks michael <UNK> is a very good actor and why he choose to ruin his career by making this piece of filth show is beyond me br br parents make sure your children never and i mean never watch this teenagers you'll probably get a laugh out of this just for the blatant sexual references but nothing comes out of it and afterwards you feel rather empty br br 1 1 2 5 stars
<START> due to this show getting cut early i never realized why until i recently read the story behind the series i felt this show never got its <UNK> as one of the greatest shows this show is iconic in nature and deserves the movie it was always intended to have if not with the original a team cast at least with the cast <UNK> into the story line or a lengthy cameo perhaps at the end <UNK> it to the late <UNK> smith this cast gave so much to bring happiness to us growing up they deserve one last <UNK> ho the fact that the series ended openly because they <UNK> the series is reason enough this crew and cast made us realize as children the essence of being one of the good guys especially seeing how screwed up the world is today i think a <UNK> version like the original should be put into motion i have already read the previews and i know these are not the plans but if anything a straight to dvd movie i sure would buy it i really do not get how crappy shows get series <UNK> but this great show which still runs regularly today and probably gets watched more than some of the current garbage shows of today don't we will always remember the incredible hulk series knight rider <UNK> and the a team because those kind of shows carry through time i am almost positive these knew ones you see about detectives will not even be remembered in 10 years so why not bring back something and show the people what staying power is all about and how these old shows really are all about
<START> i wish i knew what to make of a movie like this it seems to be divided into two parts action sequences and personal dramas <UNK> it follows <UNK> through survival <UNK> school guided by master chief kevin <UNK> then to <UNK> where a couple of spectacular <UNK> take place the last resulting in death br br i must say that the scenes on the beach struck me as so stereotypical in so many ways that they should be <UNK> <UNK> a typical bar room fight between navy guys and coast <UNK> <UNK> pirates the experienced old <UNK> <UNK> who is as an elderly bar tender tells him married to the coast guard the older chief who keeps trying to prove to himself that he's still <UNK> the neglected ex wife <UNK> to whom <UNK> pays a farewell visit the seemingly sadistic demands placed on the <UNK> by the <UNK> all in pursuit of a <UNK> goal the gifted young man <UNK> by a troubled past br br the problem is that we've seen it all before if it's kevin <UNK> here it's clint eastwood or john wayne or lou jr or <UNK> <UNK> or robert deniro elsewhere and the climactic scene has elements drawn shamelessly from the perfect storm and dead calm none of it is fresh and none of the old stereotyped characters and situations are handled with any originality br br it works best as a kind of documentary of what goes on in the <UNK> school and what could happen afterward and even that's a little weak because we don't get much in the way of <UNK> it's mostly personal conflict romance and tension about <UNK> out br br it's a shame because the u s coast guard is rather a noble outfit its official mission being the safety of lives and property at sea in war time it is transferred to the navy department and serves in combat roles in world war ii the coast guard even managed to have a <UNK> of honor winner in its ranks br br but again we don't learn much about that we don't really learn much about anything the film <UNK> into a succession of visual displays and not too much else a disappointment
<START> first a word of caution the dvd box describes this film as a comedy i don't think that was the intention of anyone connected with the film other than some marketing morons while light and a little bit funny in places it is not a comedy and if you expect that you will be disappointed br br i had never even heard of this film and had absolutely no expectations one way or the other considering that the other two dvds i picked up were big <UNK> i was so happy when i saw this film the acting writing and direction were excellent the story itself definitely interested me as you don't usually see films about the final month of france before the nazi <UNK> in 1940 it gave some insight into the <UNK> that gave up so quickly and agreed to their beloved country along the way there are plots involving a selfish and weak actress played very well by isabelle <UNK> who looks marvelous after all these years she kills an ex lover and then finds a poor <UNK> to take the fall this <UNK> escapes from prison and finds her with another lover a high government official and <UNK> played by gerard depardieu in addition a subplot about a jewish <UNK> trying to <UNK> out of the country is introduced and eventually this becomes the main plot the story has a lot of nice twists and turns a light sense of humor without trying to be a comedy and some genuine suspenseful moments together they create a nice package this is sure to please
<START> i just checked out <UNK> <UNK> from the local library and wasn't expecting much imagine my <UNK> at this gothic treat <UNK> <UNK> is one of the most eerie places that you have ever seen with empty <UNK> and <UNK> rooms full of hidden secrets the glory of the movie is that it never reveals all your imagination runs free running with the imagination of the main character one m she is a girl of wild <UNK> a reader of gothic fantasy that she brings into her and our real world br br if i were to use one word to describe this excellent movie it would be <UNK> dreams are woven throughout the movie <UNK> the mood sometimes it is hard to tell what is real and what is not this is intentional i believe br br atmosphere <UNK> supreme the music is not what you'd expect of a movie by jane austen it is eerie <UNK> and drum based high and haunting with an <UNK> of fear if a soft pleasant tune were playing in <UNK> <UNK> it would be positively <UNK> now it is foreboding a grim and stark <UNK> palace of <UNK> but the characters you shall have to see them for yourself br br if you are looking for a most enjoyable evening look no further than <UNK> <UNK>
<START> <UNK> banks needs to teach these girls that it's not all about being beautiful on the outside the inside counts for something too a lot of the past winners have looked semi decent but are horribly cruel and starting trouble for the other girls i see <UNK> less involved with the girls in every season about the only thing worth watching top model for is mr jay <UNK> recently <UNK> had a contestant who was a pre <UNK> <UNK> i felt that she should have done more to encourage her it was obvious that she had <UNK> about her original <UNK> showing through her feminine look <UNK> should have given her <UNK> or perhaps she could have sent resident ms jay to help the girl out instead the contestant was met with harsh criticism and not enough positive criticism it's a shame because i truly enjoyed the first 3 seasons there's a reason why project <UNK> has all 4 seasons out on dvd and top model only has 1 season on dvd it's called taste top model seriously needs a lot of an some more humanity
<START> despite a few acceptable adaptations of the <UNK> main themes queen of the damned the vampire <UNK> did not stay true to anne complicated story telling the deep layers that build up all the characters were <UNK> apart to only their surface if not a completely different identity the <UNK> order of the major events in the movie seemed <UNK> and uneven br br however there were quite a few things the movie did to deserve my rating of 7 one was that the film strongly captured the affect that <UNK> among other vampires had to the public especially young girls the movie also did a fairly good job focusing on the importance of <UNK> and history that the vampires took pride in the scenes of <UNK> were also <UNK> satisfying br br the acting in queen of the damned was <UNK> if disappointing stuart <UNK> and <UNK> have a surprising chemistry though it only shows when the acting is at its best not very often the characters are nothing compared to the ones established in interview with a vampire it also lacks the emotional intelligence of the feast of all saints which is a shame because <UNK> queen of the damned book had that and more br br this movie doesn't give all that it appears to be the effects are dull and very disappointing the <UNK> needed in many scenes is not given and the dialog is <UNK> the settings for many scenes are not how i <UNK> them in the book and i think that many of them weren't even taken from the story there are only a few areas of <UNK> near the beginning and middle of the movie but it <UNK> itself up fairly neatly giving the viewer a full story if they had not read the book br br somethings that i feel the movie needed include a good original score howard shore or elmer <UNK> instead of the mix of rock music though i had no problem with some of the songs another thing that would have made the movie better is better set direction the scenery was boring as well as unclear which is important in a story that moves around quite frequently br br overall queen of the damned was an <UNK> disappointing yet somewhat satisfying adaption of the important novel with a few simple changes it may have been a very successful piece of film work i'd recommend this movie for people who has seen interview or have read the books so that they can make their own opinion on the adaption
<START> joseph <UNK> timeless novel heart of darkness was depicted in the 1994 movie i have read <UNK> novel and i must say even though i prefer the novel itself the movie was a great depiction the set and costume designs brought <UNK> novel to life on the screen as we followed <UNK> journey the acting also brought the characters to life through the mannerisms voices and personalities if you have read the novel i recommend that you also view this movie if you have not read the novel however the movie may be harder to follow <UNK> heart of darkness is too full of action emotion and information to be made into a movie that is a little over an hour and a half long therefore if you have not read the novel the plot in the movie may seem too <UNK> to follow overall i gave this movie a seven out of ten the basic plot of the novel was brought forth to the screen with great sets costumes and acting nothing can replace joseph <UNK> original work however
<START> i had a hard time staying awake for the two hour opening episode it was <UNK> down to such an extent i doubt if i learned a single thing the graphics were <UNK> any small idea was repeated ad <UNK> contrast this to the <UNK> series <UNK> by carl <UNK> that had a good musical theme there was no music coming from these <UNK> 10 dimensional strings
<START> i never saw the other two ninja movies and for all i know there are known but for some reason i watched this one this one starts out rather fast as this one ninja goes on a super killing spree he is almost <UNK> as it takes quite a number of bullets to take him down he is not out for the count though as he ends up <UNK> a woman and he then continues his killing ways by using her as his tool another ninja enters the <UNK> and apparently the only way you kill a ninja is with another ninja so he <UNK> this leads up to a big battle at the end as the dead ninja goes back into his body and they have it out in an all out war sounds better than it actually turned out being but at least it was not boring
<START> while trying to build a major mall or complex or something like that a wealthy <UNK> ignores ancient native american <UNK> buried on the land and <UNK> the bone eater a creature who goes around and kills people in search of his fallen friends or something like that br br indeed this movie had to be a sci fi channel original if it wasn't then the director should never direct anything again the effects in the film is laughable at best and the bone eater monster is nothing but a cgi animated being added into the frames at a later date the actors don't even look all that frightened when they see the thing probably because they really don't and they're just terrible actors it's a great comedy though even if it's supposed to be pure horror
<START> i saw this movie last night and thought it was decent it has it's moments i guess you would say some of the scenes with the special <UNK> forces were cool and some of the location shots were very authentic i won't be putting this movie in my dvd collection but it is fair enough to recommend for renting i guess nothing set the movie at another level compared to others of the same genre the action is good the acting is decent the women are extremely seductive and exotic in my opinion and the story is pretty interesting 7 out of ten
<START> a lot about usa the movie can be summed up in its title it draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of hollywood like <UNK> that <UNK> things that shouldn't be <UNK> i'm not sure i agree with the <UNK> take on recent events although <UNK> i can't always tell exactly where he stands but i admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across audio tracks of speeches radio interviews poetry etc play as large a role here as visuals most of the time the visuals of the story are accompanied by these audio elements to good effect i'm kind of a radio buff so it was satisfying to hear the way that radio was integrated into the pace of the movie in fact most of the dialog takes place over the story rather than having characters talk to one another that's not to say that there aren't characters real people but except for jim the protagonist a kind of <UNK> drop out with an <UNK> state of mind the others come and go pretty quickly a few make a very powerful impression especially a guru like taxi driver who seems to be the voice of wisdom itself when he breaks out into a spontaneous song of <UNK> while driving jim to the subway it is a very powerful moment on the cover of the dvd is the quote the danger is clear which is taken from president <UNK> speech that <UNK> the way to our <UNK> into iraq in retrospect hearing that speech at a climactic moment in the film brought home how we are living in a historically charged moment which will always be remembered
<START> well it certainly stunned me i can not believe that someone made another australian film that's even more boring than <UNK> the story is implausible the characters with the exception of and characters are unlikeable and wooden tom long possesses a vast array of facial expressions happy and not happy and the sex scenes which could have been very confronting and <UNK> erotic would have been at home in a low budget porno flick br br this is the first movie i have seen in 30 years of cinema going that has had me on the edge of my seat ready to get up and leave br br the best thing about this movie is the <UNK> poster
<START> if you are looking for a movie with beautiful shots of <UNK> <UNK> then you may enjoy this movie just skip ahead to the views of the mountain br br spoiler alert however if you like me believe that lives are precious and not to be wasted then this movie will leave a bad taste in your mouth 6 people died 5 and a member of the japanese party just so that one man could attempt to <UNK> down <UNK> <UNK> br br the question is raised in the movie about whether the <UNK> of the expedition to meet his personal goal was still worth the cost in lives and he answers an <UNK> yes br br the part about <UNK> is in the last 15 minutes he <UNK> for a short time then falls the rest of the way until he comes to a stop in the snow
<START> this movie was quite a pleasant surprise i had anticipated it for a long time and was afraid going in that it couldn't possibly live up to my expectations br br it <UNK> them br br i <UNK> this movie br br hilarious from start to finish stay until after the end credits it is absolutely remarkable how a movie about dumb and annoying characters can be so intelligent witty and engaging br br with it's obvious <UNK> paintings the movie's future earth recalls the planet of the apes series and other sci fi movies of that era br br in fact this movie is essentially planet of the apes but with people who are the mental equivalent of apes br br it moves at a fairly <UNK> pace and luke wilson carries the movie quite well with a character that recalls the one he played in bottle rocket there's even a not so subtle nod to bottle rocket in an early scene br br <UNK> is also surprisingly good as a former painter who was frozen as well br br despite all its strengths <UNK> has the distinct feel of a movie that was taken away from the director editor before it could be fine tuned br br i cannot for the life of me understand why a movie this funny would just be dumped into a few theaters with no advanced <UNK> no trailers no marketing whatsoever br br it's as if the studio decided they were not going to spend any more on it and just walked away br br or maybe they thought the movie had the <UNK> of a cult classic and the only way for it to become a true cult classic was to set it up to fail br br whatever the case it is a shame because mike judge and this film in particular deserve better br br i predict this movie will have real legs on dvd and word of mouth will <UNK> it to the success it deserves br br perhaps the fox executives saw themselves in the characters were confused and thought it was a documentary
<START> it's been 3 months and you know what that means a new seagal movie seagal has really been on role making horrible film after horrible film each time every movie getting worse and worse he's really amazing i don't really know what to say about first it's a piece of crap the story makes no sense at all secondly he uses stunt men in all his fight scenes and last but not least a lot of the footage is taken from other movies it <UNK> how this guy continues to find work he comes to the set late and leaves early and because of that his films are full of plot holes and stunt men why do we continue to buy his movies why do we continue to have hope that maybe just maybe he will make a great movie
<START> oh man this series has to be the worst possible anime i've ever seen in a while br br it started out new exciting and fresh and i really liked it then was a good female role model for the show and <UNK> <UNK> was funny and hot headed br br then it just kept falling more and more downhill as the series progressed and i'll tell <UNK> the reasons why warning spoiler alert br br okay they basically destroy <UNK> relationship with early on by <UNK> his 50 year old dead girlfriend who's <UNK> sappy and a total waste of time br br they introduce a <UNK> named who's supposed to be a sort of religious figure for the show which really <UNK> me 'cause it was out of place and stupid then they introduce a demon <UNK> named whose only purpose in life is to try and fail to save her <UNK> brother br br the big bad of the show while starting out as a really good bad guy lost his touch after a while he got pretty old pretty fast and it bothered me that he was the only baddie in the show who did anything br br the characters all became wooden and <UNK> and then the ending of this terrible series was a disappointment to any anime fan out there nothing happened never got killed or defeated and <UNK> <UNK> never fully fell in love 'cause he was still all in love with his 50 year old dead chick plot holes were left open the animation got worse and worse as the series progressed and nothing changed in the plot i mean they dragged it out to over 150 episodes and nothing changed in the plot at all and they expected me as well as other fans of the show to be satisfied i was <UNK> disgusted and annoyed as crap i at least had high hopes that <UNK> be a good ending to the series instead all i got was a dragged out commercial for the manga br br seriously if you wanna see a good anime about swords and stuff like that i strongly recommend that show progresses and goes somewhere plus it has really good animation too br br but stay far away from this bland excuse for anime as best as you can
<START> the film has weird annoying characters strange <UNK> slapstick and an <UNK> amount of dialogue about smoking the movie has a contrived plot of a bitchy empty headed woman's <UNK> <UNK> search for love although who would ever like character personality or reading of the dialogue i really cannot say except that she likes to smoke br br sarah jessica parker gives an interesting character performance who likes to smoke dylan mcdermott does his best to look pretty and <UNK> as he <UNK> and hey what is jennifer aniston doing there oh she's not really in it enough for anyone to care about her but she likes to smoke br br this is a waste of anyone's time i don't even know how i was able to sit through as much of the movie as i did i can't even believe i spent the time to write this except to warn others of its <UNK> anyone need a cigarette
<START> this is a very strange product from hollywood apparently it didn't test well because actors who have footage in the credits have been edited completely out of the movie which means a <UNK> cut job was done on it it feels like it was <UNK> out of the usually competent <UNK> hands and just thrown away on the other and it is so totally lacking in substance that maybe nothing could save it it has no real center either <UNK> or time wise although it says the running time is <UNK> minutes i seem to recall it ending abruptly around the 80 minute mark it's over before it even gets going it's pretty much laugh free br br the merits of the matthew <UNK> picture were as <UNK> then as the luke wilson picture is now
<START> ronald colman plays a <UNK> son while he is not a bad guy he is a bit <UNK> and hasn't done a lot with his life other than travel the world and have a jolly good time now that his latest venture in africa has failed he's on his way home to england his rich upper class father plans on <UNK> him out on his ear though thanks to winning style he is reluctantly welcomed back with open arms br br at this point there are two women in his life <UNK> myrna loy and rich girl loretta young who is already engaged how will all this work out and will ronald wise up and act like a responsible adult these are the main themes of this pleasant little film br br this isn't a great movie and certainly won't change your life but it certainly is very entertaining and fun most of this is due to the always <UNK> acting of ronald colman heck in the <UNK> of his career in the 1930s he could have played in <UNK> madness or some other dreck and still made it entertaining and likable due to his charming persona his seemingly <UNK> style in this movie make it very easy to like him and it's easy to see why both loretta young and myrna loy are in love with him in the film plus the writing is very witty and make this a nice romantic comedy
<START> i have to admit i'm not a big fan of satanic horror movies and in fact i seem to like them less and less every time i see a new one and that isn't really surprising when i end up watching films like <UNK> of satan despite its low rating on imdb i was surprised to hear some good things about this film and my expectations went up this turned out to be a big mistake as this is exactly the film that its rating suggests it is namely a very bad one the plot is your basic bunch of <UNK> causing trouble and we focus on a small town where people have been murdered and kidnapped and it's not really clear why naturally <UNK> are behind it and this is bad news for a mother father and daughter on a road trip who become trapped in the mysterious town i had a feeling that this film might be along the same lines as the crappy <UNK> flick 'the devil's <UNK> and while it's not quite as silly as robert later film it's not much better either the plot seems to be fairly down to earth but it's also rather boring and i can't say that i enjoyed myself at all during this movie <UNK> of satan obviously has its fans but i'm not one of them this is a film that i see no reason to recommend
<START> hello all you lovely dirty dancing fans i came across this message board when i was bored one day and think it's cool i absolutely love <UNK> i first saw it at my friends house when i was 13 now i'm 17 and got hooked i saw it there at least 10 more times and soon after i bought the dvd for myself at this stage i have <UNK> most of the script and can <UNK> it whenever anyone asks me about it carried a <UNK> <UNK> it's gotten so bad that i bought the soundtrack and recorded <UNK> and song and now it's the on my phone most of my friends think it's a crap movie but i don't care what they think of it i know it's <UNK> i was reading the comments earlier and i have a few questions for you lot 1 why are you asking trivial questions like what ages lisa and baby are i don't think it matters that much they are teenagers in the 60's isn't that enough 2 where did <UNK> get this special edition that you're all talking about it sounds very interesting please <UNK> to this i'd like to see other fans opinions cheers <UNK>
<START> the devil in the dark is william <UNK> favorite episode it is also one of my favorite episodes the program is pure star trek because it deals with one of the <UNK> main themes the respect for other life forms i do not think one could get a <UNK> example of one of the show's most interesting ideas in this episode kirk and his crew have to confront a monster that is killing <UNK> on a distant planet the story is an excuse to explore the right that humans have to destroy creatures that are a vital part of the environment today's concerns with <UNK> causes make the show more relevant now than ever before it is extremely well written and performed with gusto by our beloved cast one memorable sequence involves spock joining with the mind of the monster plenty of tension between spock and kirk they want to solve the problem using different methods adds to the fun shatner and leonard <UNK> do some of their best work here
<START> kevin spacey again picks a winner with k <UNK> an endearing movie that expresses profound revelations at human existence via the character's naive yet at the same time <UNK> wise point of view br br it's enjoyable trying to work out <UNK> he is or he as the plot <UNK> and the robert porter character gets fleshed out however some may find the ending a little unsatisfying but in reality it couldn't have been any other way br br my few issues with the film <UNK> around the rather <UNK> and over <UNK> portrayal of mental patients i was surprised because the films plot shows a great deal of intelligence and i don't feel it would have lost anything by being more honest regarding how people with mental health problems behave br br that said i realise this was a movie and not a documentary and the film itself is shot and the story <UNK> at a pleasing rate br br bridges is great and spacey delivers a <UNK> and relaxed performance more like a stand up than an alien br br a good film that will get you talking with your friends
<START> chances are i'm gonna spoil valuable plot points while writing this and because i can't determine and don't really care what you think is a valuable plot point then if you are thinking of watching this film and have an issue with learning such things then i suggest you hop right on to the next review you know i don't mind the cult films being <UNK> under the cult section and people who believe it can go there and get their fill of the reality i mean is it too much to ask that the overtly pseudo christian propaganda films be <UNK> with the other special interest movies br br i couldn't have been more <UNK> had pat robertson made a porn movie or would that be br br it was bad enough that there was an <UNK> count of kicking and <UNK> in this it was bad enough that the same story has been done repeatedly in much better ways it was bad enough that it wasn't <UNK> under special interest with other cult films it was bad enough that it somehow is receiving <UNK> for being realistic as if we live in the world where towns get possessed by the and the really profound and nasty evil isn't done by human beings usually in the name of <UNK> based on the god of abraham it was bad enough having to simply shut the thing down because people were complaining so <UNK> that it was awful br br no the really bad part was when one of our guests stood up after we finally had to just turn the damn thing off and <UNK> i for one would like to see something really violent or pornographic now just to get that out of my head preferably both if you have it and we had just met her
<START> i would say <UNK> of is a return to greatness but the series was never really great very good 1 was 2 3 were <UNK> and i think this 4th installment is equal to or even better than the first movie and it contains the best <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gets lucky so he does in the role of jennifer <UNK> who thoroughly <UNK> this series as <UNK> ryan did for <UNK> trek voyager ' <UNK> didn't just create a presence she added much needed humor back story drama tension and a great little sidekick play thing for <UNK> and as much as i liked her in the feature she can't get all the credit the props watch the first 1 2 minutes for horror <UNK> the writing the inside jokes again the opening <UNK> and <UNK> lines were great in fact if this were a movie it would take 3 4 sequels just to do it justice among others mercifully <UNK> and the series has given up on andy the hide the soul quest and just settled for a new way out of his body he teams up with his ex <UNK> whom he <UNK> into a bride doll and a couple of bonnie clyde teens really <UNK> to regain this <UNK> buried with <UNK> human corpse this is for any <UNK> fan 1980s slasher horror fans or even to those who's never seen any of the previous films it's funny dark harmless gory  but not over the top and despite <UNK> literal 20 minutes of screen time it's always great to see her after all you barely see her play poker anymore side note of course i picked up on the superman reference  <UNK> <UNK>
<START> although the premise of the movie involves a major coincidence the actors all do a <UNK> job and look great bringing the story to life i found myself rooting for the characters played by mary tyler moore and christine <UNK> with both and wanting them to <UNK> sam <UNK> and ted <UNK> are fine in their roles as well doing a decent job with the stereotypical buddy relationship while the story tends to leap through time occasionally leaving the audience perhaps a little hungry for missing detail it still flows and avoids any real confusion this interesting storyline has all the elements for a good chick flick
<START> the murders in opera are not actual murders as much as they are symbols of past events and parts of <UNK> own <UNK> personality in fact betty is the same person a male that <UNK> is in <UNK> only a decade later in life <UNK> was a boy of ten who <UNK> another boy of ten with a more mild version of his own background br br it helps to think of <UNK> luxury apartment as a military <UNK> bay she spends most of her time in her bedroom in bed next to her <UNK> it seems and other parts of her apartment seem foreign to her somehow as though other people live in those other rooms br br <UNK> <UNK> movies sync with a wide array of rock music as well as <UNK> <UNK> starts the right at the beginning of his films the flash of the eye in opera and the start of a drum roll in <UNK> there are also standard movies that opera and <UNK> sync with for example opera with with a record album by <UNK> priest called priest live as does <UNK> and <UNK> very well with a kiss record album entitled kiss alive ii movies like rosemary's baby the exorcist the image and the vampire happening are sync movies <UNK> uses which deal with the same subject matter as <UNK> films these along with many others reveal betty to be a male who suffered sexual torture at the hands of his father since birth even in the <UNK> according to a certain anne rice novel entitled br br anyway large budget films are occult works which <UNK> spy information <UNK> by occult means all in <UNK> symbolic <UNK> fashion usually the sync point in a film is the beginning of the sound score or it is the first image of the film beyond any film company lead in sometimes it is more creative the heavy metal music used in opera and <UNK> are simply music that were <UNK> out of other films that <UNK> movies sync with an intellectual game of sorts among the elite within the industry br br so betty doesn't respond normally to the murders she witnesses because she didn't ever witness a murder of any real person she herself simply suffers soul murder she witnesses her own murder this <UNK> father almost dropped him down an abandoned mine <UNK> in at age 4 in 1970 he was on the verge of falling off a wood <UNK> his father balance him on before dad changed his mind and grabbed him and <UNK> him back off it the kid felt nothing <UNK> memories of sexual torture are lost to this individual via extreme sexual <UNK> and the vague memories which remain are of the big square deep hole in the desert and no significance is placed on this memory because of the lack of conscious trauma the loss of trauma also a buried <UNK> is portrayed in the 1975 film entitled the image those <UNK> up in the attic in <UNK> are each individual memories of the first three or so years of a life toys in the attic br br the reason betty or <UNK> is a female character is because the individual christina character mirrors is a male who has been trained into a female role of sorts since birth all of the dvd's of the simpsons cartoon sync with <UNK> with his very nature having been <UNK> along queen lines the x files episodes sync with opera this has even altered his body to be beautiful in the way a woman's is behavior <UNK> <UNK> a more recent movie entitled death proof deals with the same ideas and the same individual br br virtually the entire life of this person is <UNK> on large budget films record albums and books made since 1966 and father prior to 1966 and after the <UNK> album entitled virgin killer is a <UNK> sync album the original album cover acting as a symbolic mirror image of the fall through the <UNK>
<START> ben rupert is a deeply unhappy adolescent the son of his <UNK> married parents his father nicholas farrell is a <UNK> and his mother laura <UNK> is well let's just say she's a somewhat <UNK> soldier in <UNK> army it's only when he takes a summer job as an assistant to a foul mouthed eccentric once famous and now forgotten actress <UNK> julie <UNK> that he finally finds himself in true and fashion of course is deeply unhappy herself and it's only when these two sad <UNK> find each other that they can put their mutual misery aside and hit the road to happiness br br of course it's corny and sentimental and very predictable but it has a hard side to it too and <UNK> who could sleep walk her way through this sort of thing if she wanted is excellent it's when she puts the <UNK> to one side and finds the pathos in the character like hitting the bottle and throwing up in the sink that she's at her best the problem is she's the only interesting character in the film and it's not because of the script which doesn't do anybody any <UNK> on the other hand isn't just unhappy he's a bit of a bore as well while <UNK> <UNK> bitch is completely one dimensional still she's got the english accent off pat the best that can be said for it is that it's mildly enjoyable with the emphasis on the mildly
<START> this movie scared the hell out of me for no good reason the eerie music was well written but other than that its a complete waste of time and it really disturbed me i'm not really sure why either if you just want to see a bad <UNK> horror movie i guess you could give it a shot but only as a last resort
<START> the romanian cinema is little known out of romania no directors from romania came out to the attention of the international public as some from other countries from eastern europe like <UNK> or <UNK> succeeded to do one of the few great directors in romanian cinema is <UNK> <UNK> who 35 ago directed a great movie quickly taken out of the circuit by the communist censorship after that film still a reference for the romanian cinema <UNK> was not allowed to create <UNK> in romania until the communist rule fell in 1989 br br reminds me film 35 years ago the title means 'the <UNK> and i cannot imagine why the <UNK> chose to translate it differently it is about a lost generation while in the classic of <UNK> the root of evil is in the <UNK> and lies of the communist regime here the young folks need to deal with the <UNK> of the sub culture and the moral filth that filled in the void left by the <UNK> rule the end is tragic and painfully expected br br the movie is well directed and the acting is good without too much complexity it succeeds to create an emotional link between the characters and the viewer one would say that some situations seem similar to <UNK> <UNK> or 'the fast and the <UNK> but look at the date of the production this film was made at the same time if not before the western peers if this is indeed the first film of director dan as imdb says it is an outstanding debut in any case a good movie can compete and may sell well on the western market br br there is hope for a new generation of romanian films that with some luck and good distribution will make its place in the international cinema scene br br 8 10 on my personal scale
<START> if you are a fan of early duke movies this lone star <UNK> is a good one what more could you ask for than duke <UNK> and <UNK> lots of good and <UNK> i found it amazing that <UNK> singing voice was bill <UNK> who is none other than bob <UNK> twin brother it has been reported that bob steele was a high school <UNK> and friend of duke so twin brother bill may have been too anyway if you like good clean early western movies don't miss this one we don't have to wonder about hidden meanings or try to figure out underlying themes just sit back relax and enjoy a western movie from a simpler day and time it's called entertainment folks
<START> this absurd movie was about a <UNK> two shoe teen girl that really wanted to be <UNK> but finds her <UNK> in a teacher name mrs <UNK> katie holmes who plays this <UNK> two shoe is faced with the biggest dilemma of her teenage life when this <UNK> guy of hers comes along with the final <UNK> <UNK> that should help them nail mrs test mrs <UNK> comes along catches holmes the <UNK> guy and her best friend with the <UNK> of her final <UNK> convinced that the three of them planned on cheating on here <UNK> mrs <UNK> <UNK> on her opportunity to ruin holmes once and for all with <UNK> that can take away any chance of holmes passing her class and the <UNK> guy who apparently has his eye on holmes always wondered why she never gave him the time of day he's an idiot feeling desperate holmes and her friends visit mrs <UNK> in the middle of the night to try to <UNK> her in believing that holmes was planning to cheat it all backs fire somehow when the <UNK> guy points a bow and arrow at mrs <UNK> threatening her to make things right for holmes mrs <UNK> fights back but ultimately ends up as holmes and her friend's captive br br during mrs <UNK> <UNK> under holmes they do everything from <UNK> her up and <UNK> her in her own bed to <UNK> her with false pictures that they took of the unconscious coach in bed with mrs <UNK> i found myself cringing when the kids were making themselves at home in mrs house eating up her food and going though her private work at one point holmes found mrs grade book and <UNK> changes the grade in her favor the grade of her challenge for <UNK> the end played out like a childish attempt to bring back the comedy that was <UNK> in the beginning of the film <UNK> on pure irony slapstick and absurdity br br this has to be the most unlikable and <UNK> evil character holmes would ever play in her entire life i wanted to help mrs <UNK> get free to really dig a grave for holmes she was manipulative selfish and conniving she even slept with the <UNK> guy despite her best friend's overwhelming interest in him and she didn't like him from attempting to ruin her <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> mrs grade book to taking her best friend's man you would think that holmes would get what she deserves in the end right unfortunately she <UNK> everything her heart desires showing that being wicked manipulative selfish and whining can get you what you want br br mrs <UNK> was suppose to be the character you didn't like they didn't bring me to that point once to believe that she was this woman that needed to be taught this lesson she was like every other strict teacher who even gave valid reasons for her <UNK> of the next generation personally i felt that her opinions about young people were <UNK> with holmes and her friend's actions every time i kept hoping she could get free to call the police and nail holmes they kept her tied up in bed ate up her food like a bunch of pigs <UNK> up the woman's wine messed with her personal <UNK> and we're suppose to believe that she didn't deserve to take a bat to each of their heads and the <UNK> guy has to be one of the most disliked characters in the history of film forget idiot we need a new word for him that isn't in the <UNK> <UNK> he brought the major trouble into life then made things worse when he came into mrs house <UNK> behind holmes and <UNK> mrs <UNK> with a bow and arrow i was thrilled every time mrs <UNK> had a chance to slap fire out of him or choke the wannabe actress best friend br br if you're a teen out there and want to see when a <UNK> manipulation and wrong doing can get him or her the world see this unfunny caricature filled unintentional film noir
<START> after a somewhat slow start i thought this movie about the italian <UNK> of a greek island during world war ii picked up and became a quite enjoyable watch for a couple of hours from primarily two points of view br br the love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as believable because i know it happened in various places under <UNK> penelope <UNK> played a young greek girl engaged to be married to christian <UNK> i had questions about the depth of their love from the start but their future was torn apart when italy <UNK> <UNK> and went off to fight after german <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> and the island lives on comes under italian <UNK> during which meets and begins to fall in love with captain nicholas cage this of course was a dilemma that came to many young women in occupied lands as they got to know their <UNK> they started to see them not as the enemy but as real people and sometimes fell in love often to the <UNK> of their <UNK> i just finished reading an interesting book about the german <UNK> of <UNK> channel islands in which this was a major issue once returns to the island is torn between them br br the second background issue is the italian <UNK> itself which i thought was quite realistically portrayed first was the contempt with which the island treated their italian <UNK> <UNK> defeated italy quite true from a historical perspective and was really <UNK> by the germans the <UNK> of the town to surrender to the italians and instead to insist on <UNK> to a german officer struck me as something that could well have happened and was quite funny in fact i loved the line we would rather surrender to this dog than to you italians the portrayal of the italian troops also struck me as believable the italian army was never <UNK> of their german ally and never enthusiastic about fighting with them although hitler and <UNK> were close friends their soldiers tended to treat each other with contempt here the italians are more interested in singing than fighting which the german troops on the island simply can't understand and are <UNK> when italy makes peace and <UNK> from the war until they discover that this may well make them prisoners of the germans it was all quite well done i thought br br it <UNK> a bit at the end with an all too predictable finish but still deserves praise br br 7 10
<START> a <UNK> is tossed into the sea and dreams herself into a pirate fantasy as a damsel in love with a <UNK> apprentice energetic and good natured perhaps but a shoddy enterprise a failed musical send up of the pirates of with a cheap <UNK> feel wan <UNK> songs and constant <UNK> overacting <UNK> film career took a real hit after this while leading man christopher <UNK> cannot get a grip of any particular emotion his voice <UNK> about in search of an appropriate tone you have to wonder if that's the best title they could come up with what's the level of wit going to be in the actual script the movie's grease like affection for musicals doesn't <UNK> with its <UNK> for slapstick a la airplane although works <UNK> being <UNK> and nearly makes the limp handling look endearing for the most part it is an embarrassment 1 2 from
<START> <UNK> did a fantastic job with one of those films that <UNK> in the back of your mind for years it was see comments and synopsis here in imdb br br now carrying the magnificent young talents he had for the first time on screen then he takes the audience into a dark void a literal <UNK> into dangerous waters the subject is <UNK> in this case from italy to the new world the name of the film a big deal calling it for its american release the golden door br br the story of a family that leaves everything and risks the rest that is their lives for a dream br br i hate to spoil the show telling the story so i'll <UNK> a bit in the work and all his team did so brilliantly br br first of all choosing to stick to what he knows direct sound as much as possible this means the whole film the <UNK> the pain the nuances of reality are always <UNK> with the <UNK> the heat or the cold the sweat and the blood life and death as as it is in real life br br the <UNK> of bent metal and <UNK> wood the infamous <UNK> of the wind and the ominous sounds of big <UNK> and ship <UNK> are among the points that make this film so involving br br cinematography is in the hands of a french the symbolism of light is present from the very first shot again almost the very first shot from and <UNK> throughout the film with <UNK> and a terrible sense of desperation the subdued tones and the very gray and grim depictions of people suffering the <UNK> and filthy boat they <UNK> to hope is <UNK> br br light is used <UNK> almost to discover every character in the dark the beauty of every shot and every scene is <UNK> by the period costumes and the perfectly selected physical features of the actors br br again as he usually does vincenzo <UNK> is definitely on his own he plays the father of two sons the same actors who were fifteen and twelve and now are <UNK> and sixteen with all the power he always conveys to his very complex characters br br charlotte <UNK> is so so i guess she's never achieved again the perfection she reached in the <UNK> garden and in her very first film br br maybe it's just that she seems a bit awkward in her role br br the locations and sets are harsh and compelling almost playing a character on their own br br maybe the most remarkable character is the one played by the mute younger son the contrast here with his first role is complete then he played a <UNK> kid that was as relentless as anything around him now his character is all expression and just that no words at all his eyes tell the whole story with sublime power br br maybe this is one of those films that will not be very well received in the states it's absolutely italian in everything it's so italian that most of the time the language is one of the many <UNK> that is much older than italian itself in the usa this film may be a bit too much for americans because of the subject but anyone who remembers the story of their families when they arrived in the states will see this films with awe br br and again the <UNK> that goes hand in hand with ideas is back with a closing scene in the water only this time it goes from underwater photography to <UNK> br br all in all another great and very well told story from this filmmaker that only this year 2006 has <UNK> 6 <UNK> and was nominated for the golden lion not a small deed
<START> this movie was nothing like the book i think the writer of the screenplay must have wanted the job of writing the sequel to gone with the wind and been turned down this was his or her way of getting their ideas in anyway the only similarity between this movie and the story it was portraying was the names of the principle characters and the location of the main action none of the events that are shown in the movie happened that way in the book for a gone with the wind fan of both the book and the movie this was deeply disappointing if you loved the book scarlett don't watch this movie hoping to see it played out on the screen they only share the title in common
<START> this film fails on every count for a start it is pretentious <UNK> to be significant and failing miserably the script was banal in the extreme nobody at any time said anything remotely interesting it was impossible to care about any of the characters <UNK> was a self regarding waste of time whilst <UNK> miller was just a waste of time the bit about the soldier who went off to war was a cliché even before the film <UNK> used it the use of the second world war as a backdrop was in itself a cliché the bombs the in tube stations etc employed to <UNK> a bit of much needed drama why anybody thought for a moment that this film was worth making is quite beyond my <UNK> it was yet another case of let's get the costumes looking authentic never mind about the story the script or the acting
