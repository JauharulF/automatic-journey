<START> crap i accidentally watched this film thinking that it was the swimming <UNK> that was released in 2003 i seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it shame on whoever gave this junk an award i thoroughly <UNK> this film in fact i didn't see it through to the end after an hour i could no longer stand it i am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such <UNK> ad acting painful i rate it 1 star out of 10 an amateur could make a much much greater movie
<START> fun with dick and jane failed to entertain on so many levels there were loose ends with the writing for example it seems as though one of the major conflicts was the <UNK> of jim <UNK> character dick <UNK> but the writers never follow up that particular conflict basically the story is weak and mostly unfunny but carrey saves a few scenes with his physical humor but honestly jim carrey wasn't very funny in this movie and tea <UNK> might as well have been there just for her appearance because she wasn't funny either this is just another example of hollywood <UNK> off franchise actors with a lousy unoriginal story
<START> the hysterical <UNK> wars is finally out on dvd has earned its <UNK> among parody classics and is not only a <UNK> little 20 minute short but a <UNK> in low budget film production classes which is where a lot of the film's cult status is derived from and <UNK> with the dvd not only do we get a chance to <UNK> the original parody <UNK> <UNK> head <UNK> <UNK> et al that ernie f did in 1978 but there is a lot of additional material <UNK> the wit <UNK> <UNK> is a dead on parody that is very funny but makes a statement about the of ignorance and greed at the same time the director's commentary is also hysterical as is the creature feature which parodies taking a film out on the talk show circuit and actually is based on taking out on the talk show circuit albeit the public access circuit i'd love to see ernie michael and crew take on some other contemporary overblown and targets to parody like just about any film that hollywood <UNK> out at 100 million a pop these days not so much the <UNK> films like spider man or men in black actually parodies themselves but any number of overblown <UNK> overwrought and <UNK> features br br
<START> i can't say i was surprised at this atrocity when i watched it a couple months or weeks ago can't remember i saw it as a two part episode of <UNK> 101 because that's how they showed it here in canada br br i was incredibly annoyed at the <UNK> a nerd thing it's just an example of how <UNK> superficial negative biased and stereotypical the people in the entertainment business is and frankly i'm extremely <UNK> it wasn't at all funny a nerd is a stereotype and it makes people very offended br br secondly the people in <UNK> 101 don't have real problems logan has a big house he has a famous dad he has everything and <UNK> is rich too they never have to deal with the things that today's <UNK> and teens have to do deal with such as <UNK> pressure and stereotype problems also the actors are horrific jamie <UNK> spears doesn't deserve to be in a television show as successful as <UNK> 101 what is wrong with the world she doesn't have any talent as an actor in fact she's worse than britney the chase and <UNK> thing was incredibly predictable i mean how could the show go on with <UNK> and chase dating what other problems could they possibly have except for the fact that chase doesn't get the girl he wants everything is perfect the absolute worse 48 minutes of my television watching life ever 0 10 and that's being generous
<START> my first <UNK> in many years and the first of his war films that i've seen this was gripping and brutal from the very get go in the very first scene <UNK> hero <UNK> is told that he can't continue on with his unit to which he has returned from the hospital he apparently has <UNK>  but he is not sick enough for the hospital to take him given the <UNK> of war wounded they have but his old unit won't take him back either his co gives him a <UNK> and tells him that if he feels truly hopeless to blow himself the honorable thing to do br br the <UNK> 1945 and the situation really does seem hopeless for <UNK> and everyone else is an odyssey through hell or rather <UNK>  <UNK> <UNK> dead rocky <UNK> and the dead and dying japanese soldiers hoping just for an end through peace or death film is photographed in stunning b w scope which serves to highlight both the <UNK> felt by <UNK> and those he meets on his journey towards his doom and to show how truly small and naked they all are amidst the <UNK> of the mountains and the this small affair of humans will end soon the earth seems to be saying but i will survive and barely notice it br br <UNK> travels back towards the hospital but is not surprisingly rejected there and spends the rest of the film trying to stay alive stay human and get out of danger he doesn't manage to do very well on any account slowly starving and eventually committing some fairly <UNK> acts eventually he <UNK> up with two other desperate men who have lost or survived their <UNK> and have <UNK> to in his <UNK> state facing other armed men finds that the only way to live is to break with everything that he believes in br br film is as brutal <UNK> and intense as any war film i've seen there are moments of humor and <UNK> but they are fleeting and don't stick in the memory such as the scene with the man on the who practically begs <UNK> to eat his recurring black comic bit with <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> shoes for the better of a fallen the that humans will endure to the truth that this is any war all wars all mankind as long as we continue thus a masterpiece that i probably won't watch again for a long long time watched via the beautiful <UNK> collection dvd
<START> you'll either love or hate movies such as this thriller set inside a <UNK> asylum in a far off <UNK> land it's not so much of a horror show but a <UNK> of frightening and mental patients scream is the best term to use in what was obviously a popular drive in classic noted for some strange and wicked <UNK> notice the judge who's about to put on the <UNK> from behind the doctor r r r not much else can be described here other than some bloody tasty goodness but when you get a chance remember the familiar old saying by the <UNK> lady get out get out and never ever come back don't you wish you haven't looked in the basement
<START> remember back when this movie was made by robert downey senior a very good entertaining black awareness feature which was an underground hit in california los angeles and new york at the time a <UNK> loved classic where changes which occur in the business world are striking refreshing and interesting comedy non <UNK> not like basic society at the time of 1969 now watched is still very good but today's life in america totally <UNK> from <UNK> good for the baby <UNK>
<START> while i'm normally a big fan of john <UNK> work as an actor and director is a great disappointment although the film has some charming moments overall it falls flat worst of all the film is confusing where is the movie set italy or an italian <UNK> in new york why bother making a historical film if it fails to convey a setting if you want to see a well made inspiring historical film also about theater go see tim <UNK> the cradle will rock this movie has many <UNK> including a fine performance by john <UNK>
<START> while i agree with the previous post that the cinematography is good i totally disagree with the rest this is nothing more than a porno movie disguised as an artsy film showing little boys naked is not art and amounts to child porn steer clear of this dud stupid is what this film is
<START> <UNK> one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years <UNK> <UNK> has been pushing the boundaries of cinema perhaps more so than any other commercial filmmaker i've been <UNK> with <UNK> for a few decades now and i've never not been impressed by both the man and his work last year i went to see rescue dawn and was somewhat surprised at how relatively mainstream the film was yet couldn't help but imagine <UNK> taking his actors and crew into the actual jungle to not only make the film but to live it no other filmmaker is as crazed about the <UNK> of the film making process and the subsequent <UNK> from such productions as has been <UNK> into cinematic legend br br today i sat down to <UNK> morgana a 1969 <UNK> film that could be described as an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> without <UNK> the actual locations i'm assuming it was shot somewhere in africa both <UNK> and desert a region that could have once been the cradle of <UNK> man <UNK> civilization <UNK> life on earth it is these origins the biblical notion of the garden of <UNK> and the apocalypse that <UNK> is concerned with as is voiced by the narration <UNK> throughout the <UNK> minute run time br br watching <UNK> i couldn't help but feel i was a passenger on a profound journey in the opening sequence the title is translated as <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> this translation with multiple <UNK> of commercial <UNK> landing on an <UNK> these images are perverted their 3 <UNK> crushed flat by a long lens <UNK> layers of <UNK> heat waves and light <UNK> all on top of one another the effect left me to conclude things are not as they seem br br <UNK> is divided into 3 very distinct chapters 1 creation 2 paradise and 3 the golden age chapter one opens with countless <UNK> images where bleak <UNK> landscapes <UNK> by dead animals <UNK> broken <UNK> of crashed <UNK> and abandoned cars slowly <UNK> in the desert sun the people this <UNK> landscape are <UNK> <UNK> and apparent prisoners of the desert the narration talks of a time before life a time where the <UNK> of earth was blank and all that existed were the heavens while the narration <UNK> to a simpler <UNK> era a portrait of a young boy holding a fox like animal by its throat evokes a chilling depiction of man's cruel ruthless attempt to <UNK> a <UNK> over nature br br in the next chapter we are introduced to more of the same yet the images and people are more animated and seem <UNK> with a <UNK> of life and <UNK> we listen to a <UNK> talk about the <UNK> a <UNK> lizard has hunting for prey in such a lifeless environment as he holds the <UNK> <UNK> its tongue <UNK> at flies he also describes how difficult it to capture these creatures in the <UNK> <UNK> degree heat the parallel is <UNK> noted and <UNK> continues to explore this concept through repeated <UNK> <UNK> of individuals <UNK> by the sun the desert and the <UNK> efforts required to exist in this harsh realm he also pushes forward the theme that if not in control man <UNK> his control over his environment and not always in the most pleasant of ways br br the last chapter takes us out of the blast <UNK> and into the more familiar <UNK> territory populated by <UNK> and absurd behavior no one seems to have a more effective <UNK> relationship with the <UNK> of the world than <UNK> possibly this is where he feels most at home much like errol morris <UNK> chooses to place his camera in as seemingly objective a position as he can before he lets the film roll the subsequent <UNK> <UNK> has with his subject is the result of him being able to continue shooting well beyond the point when most directors would have <UNK> cut as morris does this extended roll pushes past the on moment the subjects feel <UNK> to offer and through their <UNK> of being pushed into <UNK> their <UNK> gives way to something real the most humorous portrait in this chapter is of the 2 person band playing an odd <UNK> like song that <UNK> <UNK> throughout this chapter the drummer of the band wears the same <UNK> as the <UNK> as does another guy doing a magic trick begging the question what's with the <UNK> they definitely add some <UNK> to the film but one has to wonder if they hold any deeper meaning or significance or is this just another example of <UNK> br br the narration aside <UNK> <UNK> folk and blues music as the experimental <UNK> soundtrack leonard cohen grabs the most screen time two of his beautifully <UNK> songs so long <UNK> and suzanne perfectly <UNK> the <UNK> landscapes adding to the convincing feel that we are truly along for the ride by the end of the journey <UNK> comes back to one of the many shots that <UNK> throughout the film the distant framing of a lone vehicle <UNK> the endless desert <UNK> by a water <UNK> that fills the horizon despite the overall <UNK> of <UNK> the <UNK> of the film and the <UNK> <UNK> leave you with a hopeful spirit belief that against all odds life will <UNK> and possibly even <UNK> br br having finished writing this post i <UNK> <UNK> to discover that <UNK> shot it in <UNK> <UNK> only weeks after a bloody coup true to his legend <UNK> and his crew were arrested beaten and imprisoned while imprisoned <UNK> fell ill with a blood <UNK> it's truly hard not to love such a hypnotic and <UNK> film as <UNK> morgana knowing the filmmaker was willing to die to get it made only makes you respect it all the more br br http <UNK> <UNK> com
<START> this movie is simply excellent for some reason it wasn't a success at the box office in india in new york however i have yet to come across a person who disliked this movie this is definitely the funniest movie to come out of india everyone gives a good performance <UNK> khan however just takes over and puts the movie over the top
<START> i absolutely positively loved the movie i just saw it and can't wait for it to come out on dvd it is a beautifully well drawn masterpiece i am always amazed with the <UNK> drawn work of <UNK> studios br br others have commented on calling <UNK> by her first name he never calls his father by his first name unless he is speaking about him to someone else i didn't get the impression that <UNK> was his mother it was never even mentioned or implied by anyone it is quite obvious that she is his step mother that is why he makes her promise to come home and why he gets so upset when he finds her empty car his mother must have died when he was an <UNK> because he mentions being <UNK> by <UNK> this coupled with his father being out to sea a lot is why he has <UNK> issues everyone also talks about how mature he is this usually occurs when a child loses a parent
<START> this is just a long <UNK> for the movie the death tunnel although it is an interesting history of the <UNK> hills <UNK> the whole ghost theory is up to your interpretation more ghost <UNK> which you can <UNK> with dust in front of a flash camera and the <UNK> is just someone's cigarette smoke lit up with the camera flash i couldn't see any shadow people until they drew an outline around the <UNK> <UNK> of the image no scientific explanations were suggested for the <UNK> only <UNK> perhaps these are only events one would have to see to believe so be sure to make plans to visit the <UNK> on your next vacation in <UNK> kentucky
<START> when i saw on the voting <UNK> that some people had given this film a score of 10 i assumed they were unaware that the score wasn't out of 100 this is a disaster movie in the real meaning of that term poorly written and <UNK> directed with so called actors unable to act but able to <UNK> when ordered to for the first 60 minutes the story appears to be going in one direction then it changes <UNK> and gets involved in a power fight with extremely poor special effects unable to work out an intelligent way for the hero with limited powers to beat the villain with super powers the writer <UNK> it is obvious that the father was added to the so called story line because it was easier than working out an acceptable denouement not that the write would even know the word denouement some movies go directly to dvd this one should have gone directly to the <UNK>
<START> the original story and funny compelling characters went over well for a teen girls <UNK> party movie 2 times now i loved it it was fun and moved quickly no boring drawn out scenes it is violent and has a little language though most of it is covered up its a great movie david <UNK> was a terrific actor ron <UNK> gave a wonderful performance i watch it with the girls every time
<START> ed harris and cuba gooding jr where cast perfectly in this film it's a heart warming story that <UNK> the belief that we can all make a difference if we just care i think there was a lot of realism with the characters the screenwriter didn't <UNK> racism in the film in a way that most films do which i thought created a more realistic story line br br writers tend to <UNK> incidents of racism in an attempt to create realism but usually go overboard br br there are so many towns like this one where people of different races live <UNK> ed harris should have been nominated for an academy award because he was great as a leader and coach realistic as a father and showed a warm caring side when helping radio
<START> pretentious horror film that looks like a soap opera gone <UNK> about a drug that send you to a fantasy world where strange creatures <UNK> the film has some good imagery but its odd mix of whats real and whats not doesn't go anywhere worse are the vague <UNK> in voice over from one of the characters it seems to <UNK> a more serious more meaningful film but i don't think they even got into the serious or meaningful territory to begin with so trying to over sell the meaning comes off silly there isn't a great deal to say people talk take drugs have visions they talks some more its not bad so much as pointless and dull the dull is the sin here and the reason you'll want to avoid this
<START> i saw this movie by accident while in paris i went into the wrong theater by accident and by the time i realized it wasn't a preview or a short film i was hooked br br does a phenomenal job of holding your attention with her acting i can't say enough how impressed i was with her portrayal of this real femme fatal the rest of the cast performs very well too don't get me wrong this is not the greatest film ever made but given i knew nothing about it i was left with a lasting and very positive impression br br finally not speaking french in france paid off for once i didn't stop talking about this film for 3 weeks after seeing it
<START> bears about as much resemblance to dean novel as jessica simpson does to a rocket scientist if you've read the book i suggest you put it as far out of your mind as possible before watching the movie br br <UNK> is your typical boy meets dog dog turns out to be super intelligent government lab experiment dog and boy are pursued by super intelligent and emotionally disturbed monster created by same lab and oh yeah did i mention the shady government agents pursuing the monster pursuing the dog movie br br corey <UNK> is the boy barbara williams is his mother michael <UNK> is one of the evil government guys and sandy the dog is well the dog named here einstein in the book br br the monster effects are ridiculously cheesy much of the dialogue is laughable the script rarely makes sense or is believable a good example is <UNK> character's acceptance of the <UNK> intelligence as if every fido off the street can type messages on a computer keyboard or <UNK> once for yes and twice for no hmm it's gotta be the puppy <UNK> right <UNK> performance is enthusiastic but shaky as he carries off the stupid dialogue with the least amount of skill <UNK> has been the highlight of many a bad movie and this is no exception he easily gives the best performance of the movie although i'm compelled to add that the dog who's a pretty darn good actor himself comes in a close second br br all in all an <UNK> dumb movie and yet and yet i watched it three times within a week and yet i can't help liking it hey what can i say i have a taste for junk and michael <UNK> not that i've ever actually <UNK> michael <UNK> i'm sure there are laws against that but any movie that can make me laugh that hard yes even unintentionally can't be all bad <UNK> it up to a guilty pleasure a yes i know it's <UNK> stupid but i like it anyway movie br br it's tough for me to rate this on a normal scale i'm forced to give it a d but on my own personal cheese scale it gets <UNK> up to an a br br yeah i know i'm weird like that
<START> it's a male bashing bonanza i saw this on sci fi a while ago and the idea seemed interesting it could have been a good movie and the plot itself i don't see as male bashing but certain specific references to men get really annoying i might still watch the movie again though because it does at least try to redeem itself by <UNK> that maybe the women in the movie aren't really as non violent as they claim but it still doesn't compensate for the really <UNK> male bashing i mean i can understand a little it's part of the movie's plot but come on it gets really <UNK> after awhile not only that but to assume that the majority of women in the world would accept becoming homosexual that easily and that the few remaining <UNK> would be such a minority as to go in the closet it's just too unbelievable there are far too many women out there with cultural or religious <UNK> that would <UNK> at this it is totally implausible i mean i know its sci fi and i love sci fi but the best sci fi has at least a hint of it being possible and this is too implausible the phrase truth is stranger than fiction came about because fiction has to at least seem plausible to be welcomed but truth isn't always this movie is not that other than that the movie does have some good acting and the eventual morals of the story that something like what happened was wrong do redeem it a little but not enough
<START> just like most people i couldn't wait to see this <UNK> 11 sequel but it really stinks i must say it stinks because there's simply no good screenplay it was just cheap i hope the producers <UNK> all the money this movie has made or will make to the <UNK> victims in asia so this movie will have at least one good reason to exist it is so bad i even can't write a decent comment about it but i still advise the creators of this thing to make <UNK> 13 <UNK> 13 will be about the same thieves who are trying to steal a screenplay well hidden somewhere in hollywood the 13th member will be a foreign maybe russian screenplay writer who knows all tricks to write a copy of this well hidden screenplay so they can replace the original they'll have to steal or they need to find at least 13 people to write a decent screenplay for a movie in which not only julia roberts plays herself but even all other star members of the <UNK> films 13 people because it's the lucky number of andy <UNK> character
<START> first let me say that i find films like <UNK> redemption and green mile and most of spielberg to be absolutely horrid and stomach turning although national <UNK> on the surface would seem to be in the same genre and has what should be cringe worthy moments i thoroughly enjoyed it laughing and <UNK> throughout the film br br the premise of the plot a young girl with an unknown horse from a small village entering the grand national is certainly as implausible as could be but it is the only thing that you have to accept for it to work as a fairy tale or allegory the characters have depth and grow throughout the story ann <UNK> gives an absolutely stunning performance as one of the <UNK> women ever depicted in an american film her interaction with the good hearted donald crisp is funny and sweet while liz taylor tries a bit too hard to be even <UNK> than margaret o'brien she succeeds btw her passion and love for her horse shines through her face mickey rooney gives a beautifully nuanced performance of the <UNK> br br this is far from a perfect movie some of the situations and scenes are a bit corny and dated the kids' antics and <UNK> scenes at the track and in the pub for example but it doesn't matter the plot remains true to the characters and leaves quite a bit <UNK> we don't have unnatural overly dramatic and preachy moments sometimes more is less the final scene is a great example of this the emotional dialog is left to the viewer to fill in br br strong understated performances rounded characters <UNK> dialog intelligent and <UNK> consistent storyline we believe in the characters and are moved by their story <UNK> they just don't make them like this any more
<START> i thought this be totally different than just another teen slasher well i was totally wrong there's a <UNK> nun coming out of the toilet seat and something really odd i know that spanish culture is a bit different and their movies too but i didn't expect to see a fake hollywood film they certainly <UNK> it pretty well though <UNK> they make a movie without any new aspects this is just plain boring and it'd been done totally without any imagination br br i thought that having a nun as the bad guy in the be something really original it turned out to be a teen slasher if been done ten years ago then it'd have been something new br br i can't recommend this movie for anyone but it certainly has some comedy value it's like a horror parody in some points
<START> i and my brother are very big asian movie fans so when finding this movie hidden in a shop i bought this one on dvd because it sounded very promising and i couldn't wait to watch it so i watched this movie with my brother and i must say in the beginning it was very promising both of us really loved this brutal ball scene in the first scene but i guess that was all there are some interesting fights but it is not a action movie as it claims to be instead it's a love movie with the cliché of love so extremely played over the top even shakespeare would vomit on this title sorry for my language by the way the characters act like being picked up from the street and given for playing in this movie br br well i and my brother watched it to the end because we thought it can only become better but heck it never did this movie challenged place 1 on my and my brothers worst movies ever seen list only followed by fantasy mission force do not watch this either
<START> i put in the dvd expecting camp <UNK> from the creators of society and re animator and was quite surprised to become involved in an <UNK> suspenseful tale acting was top notch nice to see <UNK> in a protagonist role after a long string of villains the storyline involving and the few twists fairly surprising i figured i would fast forward through much of it to get to the <UNK> scenes but instead watched it through only being let down at the very end br br maybe i'm being too <UNK> but as i stated before i wasn't expecting much more than alien sex of course if you are looking for some hot alien sex you will be let down it was mostly quick cut <UNK> table nonsense with a blink and you'll miss it glimpse of an interesting alien
<START> i was very interested in seeing this movie despite the article i read about the director in magazine i don't judge movies by what the director may or may not have done this debut feature was very difficult to watch i found the split screens to be a distraction to the drama in the film some of the supporting characters gave bad performances and the film to be a copy of several other films i have seen there really wasn't anything fresh about this
<START> miscast badly directed and <UNK> written this is watchable if you have an hour or two to kill or are suffering from insomnia but only just robert <UNK> fully realises his potential as an actor of supreme mediocrity with only one expression to his <UNK> that of a <UNK> <UNK> football <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> complex which he manages at times to alter slightly by <UNK> his <UNK> and <UNK> a row of <UNK> yellow teeth this to indicate anger <UNK> grief surprise horror hilarity compassion etc in his role as the best marine engineer in the uk and son of a university professor he is about as convincing as my cat tom equally miscast <UNK> and every line appears <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> and would seem no more able to tell a <UNK> from a <UNK> of his own <UNK> if he were standing in it all in all another silly attempt on the part of the british to imitate hollywood pulp at its most <UNK> the dialogue is a series of badly delivered clichés the action is disjointed the plot is pointless and <UNK> and the characters if you can call them that do not even make it into the basic two dimensional <UNK> of their american counterparts
<START> on the whole one wishes this was a better film but it has enough flashes of intense power to make it worth while peck made this film during the same period that he made the <UNK> before he apparently decided he was a <UNK> rather than an actor a pity he was a fine actor perfectly willing to tackle characters that were not very likable and to do them extremely well the character he plays here is driven and when necessary ruthless given the mission the character has been assigned and the men with which to do it those characteristics are essential br br without being a spoiler think of this film as an early <UNK> example of the dirty dozen genre br br the dialog in this film is a bit ham handed but it is atmospheric and intense and definitely tells a story worth telling it contains good work by all the character actors and even barbara <UNK> turns in a credible performance br br this one isn't often shown on television so your local video store may be the only place to find a copy go ahead <UNK> an evening to it it is worth your time
<START> bad script check awful effects check horrible actors check lame direction check br br after seeing the dvd box at blockbuster video and being a fan of the horror genre i placed my 4 28 on the line and rented this film my girlfriend was out of town and i was bored so on a late <UNK> night i decided this would be a perfect time for me to watch what appeared to be based on the box cover art a horror movie what i got instead was the worst film ever made up until that point i had always <UNK> <UNK> party massacre 3 the worst film ever made br br if you are the type that wants to see a movie because you heard how bad it is this is for you if you don't want to lose 4 00 and 80 <UNK> minutes of your life steer clear of this garbage br br an added note i noticed a few of the actors come on here and post comments on the <UNK> board how can you <UNK> about being in this film you were all horrible i mean really bad if there was an american idol for actors you all would be laughed at in the first few episodes br br peace br br cain
<START> if you're looking for an original horror flick this might be the one for you it's strange and at times <UNK> on stupidity but it's just such a good looking nice sounding and original movie it never fails except maybe during the over long climax is a must see for horror fans or for fans of monster movie make up br br <UNK> craig <UNK> has been having dreams of a town called full of mutant creatures in therapy his psychiatrist dr <UNK> horror director david <UNK> has come to the conclusion that <UNK> is a murderer and gives him <UNK> <UNK> and tells him to turn himself in after almost getting killed <UNK> ends up at the hospital where he runs into a mental patient who also knows about and tells <UNK> where to go located in a graveyard is inhabited by vile mutant creatures that don't let <UNK> in after escaping with only a nasty bite <UNK> is shot dead by the police who were lead to his location by dr <UNK> but <UNK> isn't dead the bite causes him to live and he goes off to meanwhile <UNK> girlfriend <UNK> anne bobby tries to find <UNK> and get to the bottom of this when dr <UNK> also finds out about this place chaos ensues br br the plot seems long and complicated but it really isn't hard to understand the plot among other things makes this movie really interesting the make up effects are astounding the creatures look unique and amazing and make this a very appealing film to add to more senses appeal we have a musical score by danny <UNK> that is both lush and <UNK> and fits the film like a <UNK> the shots in the movie are also set up beautifully the cinematography is lovely and the movie sets up an atmosphere that is never broken even the acting is good with the biggest surprise being director david <UNK> giving a great menacing performance as the man who for one reason or another wants to see <UNK> dead it's odd for a horror film to be this well done br br the problems with the movie well there are a few but the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> the script features the occasional lame jokes to try and add some humor but almost every one falls flat the mutant creatures look great and for the most part are well acted but sometimes it feels like they are just posing their awesome makeup for the camera the worst part of the film would have to be the climax it takes so long and is just constant chaos it's the portion of the film that moves from individual characters and nice tight <UNK> shots to fiery explosions from each direction and violence happening to characters we don't know or care about br br overall this movie is amazing to look at it's a well done horror film but even with that said it has the occasional failure in character's lines and a messy climax nonetheless this is one to check out br br my rating out of 101 mins r for strong violence and language
<START> i hate a movie that doesn't have an ending i don't care how good or bad the rest might be i don't like to be left without a conclusion such shows should insist upon a <UNK> something like the movie you are about to watch has either no ending or is so ambiguous as to not be <UNK> br br in the movie the last scene we are left with is dee and dominic having a bit of a row and he says almost <UNK> i thought that it couldn't be him because the fingers were either that of a girl or a child then it ends well sure the smoking gun so to say is in the hands of the <UNK> son but what about <UNK> daughter i actually thought we might discover it was her anyway unless you like <UNK> movies then i'd avoid this one otherwise i thought the movie generally good
<START> i was enchanted by debut i hope that we'll soon see more of his work i was lucky enough to catch the film during its brief nyc run and it struck me as a worthy <UNK> to such downtown 80s flicks as desperately seeking susan and after hours but with a gentle european that made it fresh and fun a strong ensemble cast playing mostly against type was a pleasure and i thought the inter <UNK> plots were just right sandra <UNK> puts in her best performance since king of comedy while peter <UNK> is hilarious and <UNK> <UNK> touching see it
<START> it finally hit me watching my vhs of christmas in <UNK> what other film this one reminded me of if it weren't for the fact that the other was done 20 years later i'd say it was a remake br br just as rock hudson was a phony fishing expert for <UNK> <UNK> who had to get some on the job training at a fishing <UNK> barbara stanwyck plays an forties version of martha stewart br br <UNK> a cooking <UNK> who's built up this whole image of living on a small <UNK> farm with husband and baby cooking all these marvelous <UNK> trouble is she's <UNK> <UNK> writes her <UNK> from her apartment in new york and doesn't know how to <UNK> water but her writing is a hit with the public br br trouble comes when she's <UNK> into cooking a home christmas dinner for a war hero sailor played by dennis morgan who gets to sing a couple of songs as well got to keep up the image at any cost and her <UNK> sidney <UNK> likes the idea so well that he invites himself to the dinner br br so with borrowed farm baby and <UNK> <UNK> who'd like to make it real with stanwyck she tries to <UNK> it through br br christmas in now a <UNK> classic and deservedly so the leads are warm and human and they get great support from the assembled players s z as the hungarian restaurant owner friend of stanwyck from whom she gets her cooking information and <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> have a nice chemistry between them <UNK> <UNK> and stanwyck have no chemistry at all obvious to all but <UNK> and he's funny in his stuffed shirt way br br most people remember this film as one of sidney <UNK> few <UNK> into comedy if he's not an outright villain a cynical <UNK> of life or a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is few other things on screen christmas in <UNK> gave him a rare opportunity to <UNK> his own image and he made the most of it br br in a biography of barbara stanwyck she mentions she enjoyed making christmas in <UNK> as a welcome change from some villainous parts like double <UNK> she'd been doing recently one of the things that made doing the film so enjoyable was that between takes director peter <UNK> and <UNK> would do some <UNK> entertaining of cast and crew with english music hall numbers made for a relaxed and warm set and the cast <UNK> <UNK> br br now if only someone had been filming those numbers
<START> to be completely honest i completely intrigued by the original concept of cell ' having watched the best part of the series on fx channel uk my sky got broke meaning i missed the crucial finale but what i did see of it i assumed it to be a great story line good acting and as i don't watch <UNK> i thought it was great and it's been confirmed for a second season br br one of the best tv programs i have seen much more realistic and believable than 24 excellent character development and plot line does not bash islam but gives a thoughtful and considered approach showing the difference between radical terrorist islam and true islam everybody should see this show br br <UNK> <UNK>
<START> before i saw this film i read the comment of someone who wasn't very fond of it this i must admit made me <UNK> to <UNK> 1 hour and 48 minutes of my life to it but i'm glad i did ryan <UNK> is a fantastic actor i especially loved the believer don cheadle was also fantastic the film presented an interesting view on life and death it was very touching and very sad yet it kept me interested which most touching stories cannot do it is a film that reckless of whether or not you like it you should see it it was unique and i don t think that anyone will ever be able to <UNK> it all of the young actors did surprisingly well given the subject matter and the emotion that must have gone into it i was pleasantly surprised
<START> for all the homicide <UNK> out there this movie was great every single character that ever was on the show made an appearance in the movie it helped to resolve some but not all issues from the series unfortunately unless you actually did watch the series most of the enjoyment would be lost as the movie made heavy references to every season of the show's existence this probably would have been appropriate as a series finale as opposed to being a separate movie but we gotta take what we can get i hope they make more movies and continue to feature homicide characters on law and order
<START> this movie stands for its the funniest movie i have ever seen the lines the acting and the clothes wow talk about 70 s if you ever see this little gem buy it its worth every penny by the way the opening song is <UNK> if anyone know where i can find it send me an e mail
<START> a gem of a cartoon from the silent era it was re discovered by cartoon network and was broadcast for likely the first time in decades if ever br br what makes this so enjoyable are the varied cameos douglas fairbanks is attacked by giant <UNK> will <UNK> pays a visit as <UNK> of static studios as well as appearances by chaplin keaton and william s hart the image of chewing <UNK> the shoes of the <UNK> a money making idea for <UNK> near <UNK> shoe salesman boss cannot be described it must be viewed a terrific cultural gem
<START> what the heck do people expect in horror films these days anyway does is have to be something grisly like or it's just crap now i don't claim to be an all knowing expert but i'm about <UNK> i've seen and own literally thousands of films and i honestly think this director really gave this film a good sincere effort believe me i was getting ready to cringe as soon as the dialog started assuming it was gonna be awful and i was pleasantly surprised it's no mamet script that's for sure but come on with all the horrible garbage out there especially in horror i thought this one was way closer to the top of the pile than most br br the director used a lot of neat clever camera angles the soundtrack was excellent and moody perfect for the atmosphere needed for this kind of film the editing and timing were very good and it didn't resort to the tired worn cliché of excessive <UNK> violence for example minor spoiler during an absolutely delightful and fully gratuitous but tasty uh i mean <UNK> nude shower scene i fully expect her to get <UNK> and <UNK> but amazingly we just get to enjoy her heavenly <UNK> and that's it end minor spoiler also the tension was built very well leading up to a nicely ambiguous ending where you are not quite sure what's what spoiler especially where in the scene where the psychiatrist leaves the girl and <UNK> alone in the office we see the doll actually talking to her but in the video recording we do not also the mom sees <UNK> moving about and being quite nasty so are both the mom and daughter mentally ill also there is the original <UNK> and what the mom had <UNK> about a possible evil influence but even with all that we are still not quite sure who was doing the killing end spoiler so all in all i believe that it was a good strong sincere effort to create some good ol' early full moon type style and with a lot of restraint on the violence and with no typical sleaze thrown in for no reason just the lovely innocent beautiful shower scene which i will remember to the end of my days compared to the absolute mindless drivel out there a definite strong 8 10
<START> after starting watching the re runs of old columbo movies i thought they would all get about the same vote from me 6 but apparently i'm now starting to see differences in the movies it happened in some of just previous episodes that showed some pretty genius directing and it shows in this one but in the negative way br br the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied <UNK> in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away the directing seems too pretentious the scenes with the oh so mature <UNK> girl are a and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode then scene where they <UNK> whether or not to sack the <UNK> who <UNK> was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid br br some applause should be given to the <UNK> however in this episode a lot of focus is given on how the murderer tries to secure his <UNK> and hide the evidence etc i really liked that but alas no focus on how columbo reveals all this and the proof that in the end leaves columbo <UNK> is the <UNK> ever br br rating lies between 4 and 5
<START> simply i just watched this movie just because of sarah am also giving these 4 stars just because of her on the other side this movie was easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen was horrible the script was uninspired this was a movie that kept <UNK> itself the film was sloppy and unoriginal its not like i was expecting a good film just something to give me a jump or two this did not even do that br br he worst thing is that the more i think about the overall plot the less sense it actually makes and the more holes we keep finding a real shame really as i'm fairly sure that there was a good idea lurking in there somewhere br br i'm perhaps being a bit harsh giving the film a 4 10 but given the actors involved and again sara obvious writing talent this film really should have delivered far more
<START> jeff <UNK> has such alert eyes and a <UNK> smile that every character he plays seems villainous therefore it doesn't really work to cast him as the good guy of the piece the audience is just waiting for his character to crack and start blowing people away drew barrymore fresh off her acclaimed role as poison <UNK> must have done this film simply as a favor to director <UNK> <UNK> he was the cinematographer on <UNK> playing a character named daisy drew she's <UNK> off right away which leaves us with no one to look at but jeff <UNK> and sean young who hasn't had a single subtle moment on camera since blade runner this witless script by michael <UNK> concerns a police sketch artist who draws his own wife's face from a murder <UNK> and while that's not a bad idea for a plot it would be much better suited to an hour long tv series this cable made movie is short on inspiration beginning with the casting and shorter on surprises from
<START> okay br br i realize that there are some <UNK> <UNK> out there i was one of them but then i saw this masterpiece of celluloid br br all i can say is that the scene in which george <UNK> gets sucked out of the spaceship by his a left me <UNK> i sometimes sit <UNK> <UNK> in my bed screaming like an old man on a table thinking about it if the director is reading this i would pay to be an extra in the sequel
<START> im hoping this was made before half past dead and exit wounds because it was rubbish seagal <UNK> to blame it was down to the crap directing when the few action scenes took place the plot was also confusing and basically just felt rushed out maybe it was <UNK> and released to <UNK> on <UNK> newer films br br 3 10 br br he's not through yet bring on under siege 3 and loose some weight
<START> if you are 10 years old and never seen a movie before maybe this film may be entertainment for you but if you've seen several movies this one will be a silly fully cliched cheap and predictable for you don't waste your time with this
<START> well i saw this movie during the last san sebastian film festival the reaction to it was let's say as funny as the movie is it happened that they showed a copy with terribly wrong spanish subtitles they seemed to be a translation from chinese to english and then to spanish it was all confusing the <UNK> were switched girls appeared as boys and boys as girls and my friends and i remember great lines but because they were so absurd all in all not a good movie but if they ever show it on tv and you have nothing to do and if you want to laugh again not so much with the movie then go ahead visible secret is your film
<START> the muppet movie br br directed by br br james <UNK> br br <UNK> the frog and friends <UNK> the tales and stories of how they all came together br br the muppets star in their first feature film bringing the magic they are known for to a bigger picture the story is not too complex and is written as a prequel of sorts the well written jokes appear as each character gets a worthy introduction the cameos aren't just thrown in either but written in as interesting characters making one of the many peaks for our <UNK> friends
<START> this movie just was not very funny there's not much else to say other than that it was kind of embarrassing for laurence fishburne and david hyde pierce both of whom deserve much better than this also i don't understand why after this movie completely and utterly bombed wb insisted on making it into a tv show
<START> the horror the film about the nazis the germans the murderers of babies young girls <UNK> for that they regret what are they interested in doing thousands of miles away from germany you do not come to mind is <UNK> are now good think killed tortured 27 million people no of course they do not want they were forced to hitler he gave each of them and forced to kill every fourth <UNK> of peace all jews <UNK> killing the the facts at the beginning of the great patriotic war when taken prisoner by fascist german they were <UNK> and <UNK> we kill you all and so on since 1943 when they were taken captive they suddenly became anti <UNK> and peaceful <UNK> who were forced to hitler and personally for such films should be put to prison for life for the <UNK> of <UNK> br br if you want to see what they did yet went to <UNK> then watch the movie come and see 1985
<START> never has the words hidden gem been so accurate bad movie lovers might search all over for the next hidden obscurity sometimes coming up short with stuff like <UNK> rip my flesh but other times luck will <UNK> and you might end up with something like death bed then hopefully realizing it's not a bad movie at all it just has a bad title and not even a bad title but a humorous one that might throw you off but somehow death bed still fits into the bad category with a vibe that's somber and empty death bed is a true masterpiece of low budget horror reserved only for those fortunate enough to appreciate such a dark shadow of a vision br br death bed involves an incoherent yet intriguing relationship between a demon in the bed and the sympathetic ghost trapped in the portrait who only wishes he could spare someone from the awful fate of being <UNK> by the yellow <UNK> although not all that scary considering it's about a killer bed death bed possesses the qualities that make for successful horror a dark desolate vibe confusion an eerie subtle score and that dream quality that this masterpiece almost <UNK> such a quality or vibe usually seems unintentional not only is it intentional but from what i've read death bed is based on an actual dream george barry the director successfully transferred dream to film only a genius could accomplish such a task br br old <UNK> make for good quality horror as do <UNK> not sure what to make of the killer bed with its killer yellow <UNK> quite a bizarre dream indeed also this isn't quite the brand of b horror i was expecting considering the title and all before viewing this gothic gem i expected something more like class reunion massacre now thats a bad movie if you've seen it you know what i'm saying after considering all of the above i feel like death bed deserves only eight stars but since it stayed so obscure for so long we'll say the bed that eats deserves nine
<START> what can have been on irene <UNK> mind when she accepted the role in this <UNK> account of a woman of morals certainly the irene dunne of the 1940's whose reputation as a faithful roman catholic who <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> any film scripts or hollywood society that might be even be remotely <UNK> as <UNK> public morals would never have become associated with such a dubious project as this br br perhaps new <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in his private audience with her gave her a good dressing down over this role that we will likely never know <UNK> as she never spoke of it in later years though she did <UNK> her morally suspect though quite successful 1932 film back street as trash br br certainly by the time she received the distinguished st robert award in 1965 for <UNK> public <UNK> ann <UNK> was no longer <UNK> by the general public br br suffice it to say that ann <UNK> works neither as entertainment or social commentary br br miss <UNK> role as an <UNK> social worker who sleeps around between <UNK> <UNK> and writing a best <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> doesn't <UNK> with her <UNK> or on screen demeanor and one keeps <UNK> that the whole thing is a kind of tongue in cheek gag what else can we think when we witness a montage of miss <UNK> sympathetic <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> over a shot of a female prisoner being by films end she has <UNK> in favor of marriage to <UNK> convict walter huston no less and what kind of <UNK> would ever <UNK> of pairing these two <UNK> br br irene dunne <UNK> will no doubt wish to see this curiosity if only for the chance to hear her promise to <UNK> a cocaine addict under her charge i'm going to get you off the snow cold turkey br br well if nothing else such <UNK> goings on do present her light years from her usual <UNK> of operatic <UNK> and <UNK> cocaine addiction not being the first subject one associates with the <UNK> miss dunne
<START> 'the is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and i mean this literally the film is about the journey about the world it shows during this journey the destination does not really matter in my opinion this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images other things do not really matter as long as they are not distracting in fact the story is pretty good br br we start with catherine <UNK> jennifer lopez in the mind of a <UNK> boy how this works exactly does not really matter but it looks a lot like virtual reality she and other scientist including henry west dylan baker and <UNK> kent <UNK> jean <UNK> believe that this method might work catherine enters the mind of the boy and speaks with him there in a world that is completely created by the boy she hopes she can let him do things that in the end will give results br br the real story then a serial killer named carl vincent <UNK> just dumped the body of one of his victims fbi agents <UNK> jake <UNK> and novak vince vaughn are on this case another girl tara disappears and at that time after <UNK> research on the dumped body carl can be <UNK> and captured two problems occur 1 carl just went into a coma he has been sick for a long time 2 his house and the house with his last kidnapped victim are not at the same place in a way this part of the story is pretty standard br br things are about to get interesting again to find out where the girl is catherine has to go into <UNK> mind this is dangerous for a lot of reasons in short carl is unknown territory <UNK> and a serial killer if catherine starts believing <UNK> mind is the real world then her mind can convince her body she could die in the mind of carl a tape of how the last victim was killed a fate this girl will have in about twenty hours makes sure catherine will try to get the location out of <UNK> mind br br it is the journey through this sick mind that makes this film more than worth watching director <UNK> who did music videos before this in a way goes back to these music videos every room in the imaginative world is another short clip that exists out of beautiful and sometimes haunting images for me the visual style felt completely new the way <UNK> <UNK> had a new visual style one year earlier if something like that can make you like a film 'the will not disappoint but fans of the thriller and horror genre can like this film anyway the story itself without the great fantasy world is good enough for that i think you have to be a little open minded of course events are not yet possible in our real world still a very entertaining film with nice ideas that looks terrific
<START> this lesser known film starring roy <UNK> from tv's <UNK> is actually what i consider a lost gem it was made at a time where the story was more important that the special effects though the effect are fairly good for its time a scientist that there is another world in <UNK> <UNK> directly behind the sun since the sun always <UNK> it from us we can never see it from earth roy <UNK> is selected to go on a mission to get to this world i don't want to tell the rest of the plot because it will give the rest of the movie away let's just say there are some real surprises br br the movie is british and has that good british flavor of acting that was in such tv series like the <UNK>
<START> after his success with a nightmare on elm street in 1984 director wes craven for some reason decided that his next project would be this tv movie i'm not a big fan of this director on the whole early exploitation flick the last house on the left as well as his modern slasher scream sit well with me but the rest of his work is very hit and miss and i'd hesitate to call him the master that others have <UNK> him as the main theme here is <UNK> although it's more a <UNK> for the plot rather than an important part of the movie the main influence here is obviously the excellent 1974 zombie film and we focus on miles a businessman <UNK> frozen for ten years before an accident that means he has to be out immediately miles is a part of a project for people that are ill they pay to be frozen in the hope that they will be <UNK> in the future when their <UNK> can <UNK> miles is successfully <UNK> and it's seen as a miracle but the person that wakes up is not the person who was frozen as miles returns without a soul br br this film could actually have been quite decent judging by the idea behind it but instead we're given a plot that doesn't really have a lot to it and it has to be said that craven doesn't make the best out of the potential of the film the <UNK> is the main <UNK> point but it would seem that not having a soul and simply having a murderous intent no compassion are the same thing which feels a bit unimaginative the film was made for television so it's not particularly nasty and it's obvious that not a lot of money was spent on it as the whole production feels very cheap michael <UNK> never became a very popular actor and that isn't surprising judging by his performance here while he is passable he largely lacks charisma and is not <UNK> in the central role the plot doesn't flow too badly but there's a real lack of suspense and or tension and things slow down too much too often which results in the film being rather boring on occasion it all <UNK> down to a predictable ending also overall i have to admit that i was not impressed at all by this film and as far as craven's filmography goes <UNK> would have to go down with shocker the scream sequels and the hills have eyes ii as a miss
<START> <UNK> had its moments i enjoyed the action sequences but i <UNK> the screenplay and plot i hate this film so much i'll just write about the dumbest part first of all the plot would never happen second the <UNK> of the chinese president was <UNK> for that would never happen finally the dialogue <UNK> non chinese actors to play chinese roles is understandable but to write dialogue for them that's totally off is dumb for those of you who understood the chinese in the film you know what i mean
<START> <UNK> of the follows the <UNK> cruel journey of gangster <UNK> <UNK> and his associates through drugs violence sex violence guns violence and did i mention violence br br protagonist <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> member of the i c f inner city firm a group of football <UNK> turned professional gangsters <UNK> the audience through the events leading to the 1995 <UNK> in which three gang members fell victim to particularly vicious professional <UNK> success as a <UNK> and talent for <UNK> <UNK> violent friends to control <UNK> <UNK> at a local nightclub <UNK> him into the company of notorious drug dealers and gangsters <UNK> from the 80s 90s rave scene and drug culture br br opening with brutally realistic shots of the dead men the viewer is left <UNK> to understand what happened but left wholly <UNK> the next 2 hours <UNK> through a series of countless character <UNK> each of these basically <UNK> yet another typical man' shows him <UNK> usually <UNK> victims before probably coming to an even <UNK> end what little emotional understanding the audience is allowed to form for a few of the characters for example a family man blamed for missing drugs is quickly destroyed when they are either anti killed or their storyline left <UNK> the hints of a plot introduced in the beginning are <UNK> <UNK> with vague impressions of how the murders occurred as the events are <UNK> into place with little reward for <UNK> with the <UNK> <UNK> of previous events br br this film has been made with a standard formula in mind for an audience who prefer violence and <UNK> <UNK> to an actual storyline <UNK> of the borrows too much from <UNK> leaving out the good bits <UNK> no moral <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> or establishing empathy with the protagonist the violence although brilliantly shot seems excessive and implausible because no one is around long enough for the audience to form an emotional <UNK> the <UNK> that the gangs are <UNK> by the police is fair enough but <UNK> wielding regularly committing blatant murder in public places pushes the imagination of even the most willing viewer the audience are left <UNK> as to the relevance of many key events and developed characters that had no knock on effect on the eventual conclusion attempted is further destroyed with a substance called which the turkish mafia use to <UNK> honest answers from unwilling individuals this is not the genre in which to <UNK> psychologically unrealistic drugs and <UNK> the <UNK> almost absurd br br the actual scenes of violence before becoming repetitive hold some tension spliced with rapid flashes of colour or the end of a film reel <UNK> choreographed <UNK> coupled with obligatory but effective shaky hand held camera work saves the film but unfortunately the plot or lack there of limits it to a <UNK> <UNK> br br in essence the events this film is based on aren't deservedly represented and an adequately <UNK> storyline is sacrificed for stereotypical characters and an unoriginal plot this film has a place in the market but if you like a bit of brain with your brutality this one isn't for you br br http www com
<START> a surprisingly good documentary my surprise was mainly due to the fact that i was confused by the title i assumed this was about the influence of the drug culture on film making but no it is a much more far reaching and intelligent film than could have been expected <UNK> has done a great job in <UNK> the period from the late 60s to the late 70s from and the collapse of studio influence through all those <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> movies where brilliant young directors tried to express themselves politically sexually and artistically through to the <UNK> of the blockbuster and the return of the <UNK> to the money men and their studios as someone who saw the <UNK> <UNK> movies of britain and the rest of europe through the sixties and then the revolutionary us films of the 70s and is sad that the sequel to the sequel is so much the order of the day this was a most fascinating film the interview clips are <UNK> thanks to dvd the full interviews are available as extras and the film clips well considered also as someone who has only just caught up with <UNK> i am impressed that this important little film gets its well deserved entry here
<START> joseph <UNK> novel heart of darkness had a vivid sense of description that made this book astonishing when reading this book i had every scene totally drawn out in my head and i knew what every character looked like this book had many pieces and when i finished reading this book it seemed as the puzzle had been completed after i finished reading heat of darkness i watched the movie which was a mistake the movie cut out so many substantial parts for example in the novel <UNK> waited a very long time for the <UNK> to come for him to fix his boat this was a big source of <UNK> in the movie that part was just left out the movie added more parts that were useless and made no sense for example when <UNK> was talking to <UNK> at the end of the book and <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> neck and killed him what purpose did that scene have other than to make the audience feel sorry for the monkey it's as if the script writer didn't even read the whole book and just put the parts that he read in the movie if i had not read the novel before i had watched the movie i would have been thoroughly confused the book was amazing and it is truly a classic in american literature but the movie could have <UNK> been nominated for the worst picture in the <UNK> awards
<START> this film basically try to portray the <UNK> of <UNK> by making the whole movie <UNK> around a american dad with a good heart that puts others before himself now i know they try to show jack <UNK> <UNK> phoenix as a typical american father that is a <UNK> but like there is just nothing interesting in about him what so ever thus when the movie gets to the climax there is just little to no emotion this movie basically tries to make the life of a <UNK> exciting but it just comes off as boring as any other jobs except you save lives or property by <UNK> the fire john travolta plays the captain of the fire station but anyone could have played his role and he is a dull character as the rest of the film what could have been a good film is that the <UNK> are put way up as heroes because they are <UNK> and turns the whole scenario into a uninteresting melodrama br br 4 9 10
<START> this movie was so bad i don't know where to begin apparently neither did the filmmakers it starts off with a guy in his mid thirties to late forties watching tv the news tells of a corn <UNK> that's open for halloween he has a vision of god knows what and rushes off the save his kids who are walking into a <UNK> <UNK> and are somehow linked to this vision how you ask i don't know and as i said before neither do the filmmakers they're simply visions of people's feet how did he get these visions it's never explained we're just supposed to go along with it he enters the <UNK> to find his two daughters who are lost inside and twice the girls he's looking for walk right past him one time they actually run into him what does he do does he chase after them no he stands there like an idiot calling for them when they just ran past do the girls stop no they run off then ask was that dad then someone dressed as demon jumps on the star the dad character he beats him up in a pathetic fight only to find out he's a worker at the haunted <UNK> the police are called and after finding the star which is a really bad term to use they <UNK> him they <UNK> his hands in front of him so that he can find something to pick the lock with which he does first off anybody who's ever been arrested knows that cops <UNK> your hands behind your back and secondly why does this average guy seem to know how to pick the lock on <UNK> well he eventually gets away from the cops who give up and leave after a the <UNK> wife sets off the <UNK> in the police car as a distraction by the way it's now night time and all the workers running the <UNK> have seem to have left once the sun went down leaving a man who attacked one of their workers and two missing children in the <UNK> considering it was a slow night that these are their only customers why not besides the cops apparently have better things to do as well by the way the star who goes by the name of walker we figure out it's his last name a name in which his wife even calls him by somehow he knows there is something buried in the middle of this <UNK> <UNK> and starts digging i say because i couldn't figure out why he started digging in the first place he finds a what does it mean nothing to anyone who watches this but to him it's some sort of clue to a crime somebody killed their kids in his vision and i guess that's what he's going on real detective work and by now he knows there's a killer loose in the corn <UNK> one he somehow knew was there from the start of the film which is why he's looking for his girls every time we see the killer or rather the killer's feet we hear a weird robotic sound like a sci fi reject toy that changes a persons voice to sound mechanical why do we hear this sound is it in anyway related to anything again who knows certainly not the filmmakers the peak of all the bad acting and bad dialog was when walker yells out hey you mr bad man i'm gonna get you another time his wife is attacked by the bad man at the entrance to the corn <UNK> which like i mentioned before is oddly empty of any employees or policemen the bad man calls walker on his cell phone to tell him that he plans on killing his wife and kids and him as well walker can only <UNK> with hey hey before dropping his phone and running off with no one on the other end to talk to the killer drops his phone too he drags the wife a few feet then leaves her alone for the rest of the film losing the first opportunity to hold true to his treats if this script wasn't written by a child i'd be surprised <UNK> it wasn't it was written directed and produced by the same guy and not only that he also did so much of the crappy camera work as well where we get random shots of feet walking through the <UNK> <UNK> and meaningless shots of the <UNK> that waste 90 of the film time in the end walker uses the <UNK> to <UNK> the bad man who also seems to know how to pick locks with the same metal object that walker had picked it with apparently there are lots of small metal objects just laying around this <UNK> but after the killer insists he's still going to kill the kids walker kills the bad man and everything is right with the world again now in reality this makes walker a murderer he's killed a man who supposedly murdered his own daughters and was trying to kill his he knows this not because of proof but because of his visions he never found a body nobody else knows this guy was even in the <UNK> and the he gives it back to the ghosts of the two dead girls no proof so he kills a man without any <UNK> reason i can't imagine what the filmmakers were thinking with this one it must have been a way to cover up a of <UNK> for the production company i would rather watch the blair witch project five times than see this film again the actors should be ashamed the director producer writer cameraman should also be ashamed in fact the entire production company should be ashamed if there is anyone associated with this film please <UNK> what were you thinking
<START> i just can't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense it was never supposed to make sense duh the writers were completely wasted on at the time it was just supposed to entertain and mock and it does both wonderfully br br the <UNK> are good actors they wouldn't have been hired if they weren't good actors mike has a thing for deadpan and darkness <UNK> is the best at sheer psychotic comedy <UNK> is a broadway veteran and peter actually had people believing he was that dumb in real life don't tell me they can't act because they most definitely can br br they can also write sure jack bob get the sole credits but in reality they got a big helping hand on that script from the <UNK> who were also in that smoke filled room br br it is absolutely impossible to spoil this film head is very highly symbolic among the more memorable elements is the black box which was actually based on 2 things the image that the boys were bound to and the real black box on the screen gems lot where the band was kept between takes there's so much more symbolism in the movie that i'll just let you watch it and figure it out br br the music is awesome circle sky is one of <UNK> best tunes ever and song as we go along will have you enthralled if you'd rather be <UNK> out then <UNK> diego can you dig it and long title should be satisfactory great songs that they are and then there's <UNK> song without a doubt a homage to broadway days and the editing color scheming for that sequence is superb at least for <UNK> br br oh for those of you who won't watch a <UNK> film you're missing out especially since head was originally rated r in 1968 the rating was <UNK> about twenty years later br br now where was i ah yes we were speaking of beliefs beliefs and <UNK>
<START> oh dear just what we need another <UNK> cockney garbage effort <UNK> the rise of the uk <UNK> rave gangster who did of course follow west <UNK> east <UNK> style didn't anybody tell you that they won the world cap and then of course the inevitable <UNK> into uk rave culture underworld blah blah blah why how and who would want to <UNK> a film like this i do not know but lets pray that it was from private <UNK> lets see ex drug dealers <UNK> <UNK> we all know what to call them and the rest of the rather than <UNK> <UNK> means hopefully with the <UNK> we will not see the like of this again if we do we will be calling the death <UNK> for british films and of course we will all be able to blame <UNK> number one <UNK> country <UNK> <UNK> gangster guy ritchie
<START> how can you make a joke about mafia it is not the kind of subject to laugh at a near movie cannot make me laugh because i am comparing it to jane <UNK> mafia mafia wasn't a good movie but <UNK> is really worse in mafia there were some good jokes but in this one there are maybe two or three that make you smile not too bad actors but very bad scenario we sure prefer something serious like the godfather i give it out of
<START> my expectations were high after seeing the trailer they were even higher when i saw the movie had the same director as <UNK> day and godzilla the special effects in independence day were much better then in this movie the whole movie i was waiting for the <UNK> to show up the rest of the storyline was really boring and when the <UNK> came they had a very <UNK> look like the special effects were from a movie made in the 60's i didn't watch the whole movie when it was played for about one hour i switched off my dvd player i watch 3 movies almost every night and i have never walked away from a movie even if it was that boring the only thing good in this movie was the pretty sheriff that's why i voted 2 instead of 1 so don't go see this one instead you should go out and rent starship troopers it's like the same only 10 000 times better
<START> i really wanted to write a title for this review that didn't come off as corny or <UNK> but still described my feelings for this show i can see now that it is not possible american family is one of the best shows i have ever had the pleasure of watching on television several reviewers here on imdb have mentioned the word beautiful when describing this show never has a word been more fitting the cinematography for this show is stunning every scene and shot looks like a masterpiece the lighting camera moves scene composition and colors i have to keep reminding myself that i'm watching a tv show and not a motion picture masterpiece the score by lee and nathan wang brings tears to my eyes and most importantly the acting by the all around amazing cast is honest and sincere i do not feel like i am watching performances i feel like i'm watching real life if only real life could be this beautiful br br american family has indeed raised the bar for quality entertainment on television i highly recommend this show to anyone who is willing to watch it i could easily <UNK> cbs for passing on this show but i have to say that it doesn't matter to me who <UNK> it i'm just glad it's out there for everyone to see so i do thank <UNK> for not allowing this show to disappear into <UNK> br br i have to give special recognition to the way each <UNK> finale ended the first one was pure creative brilliance and it moved me to tears i was waiting to see if season two would also end in a creative way and sure enough it did again tears br br my thanks to all of those involved you really have made a special piece of art with this show and i sincerely mean that it is a shame that we only got two seasons but a miracle we got anything at all
<START> the violent men is a good western perhaps the story is not an original one big ranch owner dedicated to run out small <UNK> out of a valley he needs for his increasing cattle but the film has many ingredients that raises its level and makes it worth seeing br br the cast is a highlight there's the reliable glenn ford john <UNK> as a former army officer and now one of the small <UNK> who tries to stay out of troubles until he is pushed to hard edward robinson <UNK> <UNK> is as good as always as the crippled big man and barbara stanwyck martha plays his <UNK> wife in one of her usual mean woman roles she deals with easily others were in double <UNK> and blowing wild brian keith cole does it perfectly as <UNK> <UNK> brother an ambitious man trying to take over his brother's big ranch no matter what regular 50's westerns villain richard <UNK> <UNK> is there too and ends as usual no surprise there <UNK> foster <UNK> <UNK> plays <UNK> daughter who does not <UNK> his father mother and <UNK> way of handling things with their neighbors br br <UNK> mate brings a standard but acceptable direction perhaps helped by beautiful and wide open scenery and a fine and appropriate music score helps too br br the inevitable final showdown between ford and keith is one of the best in western movies each man in his own <UNK> style notice ford's shooting with his straight arm and aiming at its target in the military way settle their differences then and once and for all br br this is for sure one of glenn ford's best western appearances second only to the classic 3 10 to <UNK> he made two years later it's probably the cast that puts the film as an a rate and as for me it enters the top 10 list of the genre
<START> this pathetic excuse for a movie doesn't have a decent structure or a sensible closure the characters were confusing and the entire plot kept getting off track i'd have to say that perfect was a disgrace this is what happens when you let disney channel make movies
<START> murder over new york is an entertaining entry in the charlie chan series of films but if you're paying attention a lot of plot holes reveal themselves to the <UNK> eye while traveling to new york city for an <UNK> police convention chan sidney <UNK> meets former scotland yard investigator hugh drake <UNK> on the same flight now employed by military intelligence drake is tracking paul and his <UNK> servant suspected for acts of <UNK> around the world drake believes that by <UNK> <UNK> wife he'll be able to pin down the <UNK> of the master criminal br br when drake winds up dead in the library of george <UNK> president of the <UNK> aircraft corporation charlie that he was killed by a recently discovered <UNK> gas called <UNK> via a glass <UNK> that releases the poison when broken <UNK> <UNK> to bring all of his dinner party guests together chan and police inspector vance donald <UNK> question those in <UNK> as one of them may be the killer among them are herbert <UNK> <UNK> cooper a fellow <UNK> student of <UNK> actress june preston joan valerie unknown to drake but <UNK> by him to attend ralph <UNK> kane <UNK> the chief designer at aircraft company and keith jeffrey john <UNK> stock <UNK> <UNK> butler is also a suspect especially after number 2 son jimmy victor <UNK> <UNK> catches him steaming open a the <UNK> of which concern himself br br there are some other cleverly planted characters in the proceedings as well mrs turns up as patricia west <UNK> weaver and contrary to <UNK> suspicion that she might lead him to is actually on the run away from her former husband and a disastrous marriage she's involved with david elliott robert <UNK> principal of a chemical research firm and thereby a suspect in the angle br br as with many chan films racial comments must be taken in <UNK> with the proceedings this one offers two glaring ones when black servant is brought in for questioning he states that he doesn't know anything about <UNK> murder that he's completely in the dark chan's response condition appear <UNK> br br later following inspector <UNK> order to round up all the in new york jimmy chan comments on their arrival with they're all beginning to look alike to me actually the scene provides one of the elements of comic relief in the movie as <UNK> howard <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the great <UNK> but is actually <UNK> by the police to be con artist <UNK> mccoy br br before the movie's over two more victims fall to the clever his <UNK> and aircraft <UNK> <UNK> himself to <UNK> the killer chan in concert with elliott <UNK> for a test flight aboard a newly developed <UNK> after discovering a <UNK> capsule planted by <UNK> on the plane the day before before it can release it's deadly poison the brit <UNK> catches the falling capsule in mid air revealing that he knew about the plant arrested and brought in for questioning chan <UNK> that <UNK> is not the real reveals himself when he offers a <UNK> cup of water to the nervous <UNK> anxious to maintain secret but chan was clever enough to be <UNK> of such an attempt and reveals the real murderer now in the <UNK> of stock <UNK> jeffrey having <UNK> surgery following a car accident br br now for the plot holes when first investigating hugh <UNK> murder it was <UNK> by the police that <UNK> found in the library did not match those of any of the dinner guests however jeffrey was present at the dinner party it had already been established that drake had one non party visitor in the library <UNK> elliott if the <UNK> really did not belong to then making them an issue was pointless br br also at the end of the film when offers <UNK> the <UNK> water how did he think he would get away with it with everyone there as a witness but going even one better than that how would a world traveling <UNK> like have the time and <UNK> to establish himself as a new york city <UNK> it just doesn't make sense br br for trivia fans a few more points bear mentioning in the film number 2 son jimmy is a college student studying chemistry as he comes to <UNK> aid to solve the case in the prior chan film charlie chan at the wax museum jimmy was a law student br br the poison gas formula would get <UNK> in a later chan film this time by <UNK> with <UNK> winters in the chan role in <UNK> of new orleans in that story poison gas is released from <UNK> radio <UNK> in similar fashion to claim its' victims
<START> as a helpful warning for others i believe <UNK> man is actually worse than <UNK> island i have been using <UNK> as an example of the worst original movie presented on the sci fi channel but <UNK> is the most laughably incoherent and <UNK> designed movie i have yet seen yes i did watch almost the whole thing coming into it about 35 minutes into it it drew me in with its pure <UNK> what was sci fi thinking once <UNK> man and the surviving platoon leader or whatever he was i'm not good on military unit <UNK> reached the chemical plant the movie moved into a zone of impossible nonsense that was almost mesmerizing i had the same idea as another viewer who wondered if more than one movie had someone been edited together to make one terrible whole
<START> some guy named karl learns how to live on even after death through <UNK> he's <UNK> in a <UNK> that same night julie meg <UNK> has to spend the night there to get into a group called the sisters and <UNK> power is in full bloom br br silly movie i saw it in a theatre when i was 21 and was generally bored the pg rating should have <UNK> me off this is a horror movie for kids one real stupid scene at the end has a corpse breaking through <UNK> to hit a young guy for starters corpses are put in head first making it impossible for the corpse to use his arms and there's no way anybody is going to break through <UNK> when you're <UNK> silly mistakes like that the movie is not doing its job br br it has two good scenes two of the sisters are attacked by floating corpses <UNK> them in at one point one of the sisters punches a corpse in the stomach her hand goes in the body and she can't pull it out that scene has stayed with me every since and there's a cute little bit involving a corpse and a <UNK> at the end which had my audience laughing but the rest of the movie is a dim dull memory for kids only adults will be bored i give it a 3
<START> <UNK> film about film making shows the intense and strange relationships that can develop between directors their actors the manipulation and mind games the <UNK> <UNK> of performers as in any <UNK> sexuality <UNK> matters but here to the <UNK> degree as they are filming a sex scene br br absolutely fantastic performances from <UNK> colin as the fragile wannabe macho male lead and <UNK> anne as the director's self portrait the image of her laughing eating a banana at the end having finally got what she wants out of her puppets is pure delight
<START> total garbage no reflection to washington heights what so ever if i had four arms i'll give it four <UNK> way down acting performance worst than storyline truly over rated hour and a half of visual torture rather watch ben movies for the rest of my life feel bad for the films that lost to this crap what were the judges at the film festival watching total garbage no reflection to washington heights what so ever if i had four arms i'll give it four <UNK> way down acting performance worst than storyline truly over rated hour and a half of visual torture rather watch ben movies for the rest of my life feel bad for the films that lost to this crap what were the judges at the film festival watching
<START> gore <UNK> beware this is not your movie this little nail bitter has very little blood and guts its basically a version of open water that is effective and worthwhile but what sets it apart is that we actually like the three leads unlike open water who find themselves up a tree when a crocodile <UNK> their fishing boat and <UNK> up their guide we don't want any harm to come to any of them so when they start getting into dangerous situations we actually care br br now i like killer animal flicks but i haven't been too impressed with lake <UNK> up to <UNK> although i'm still waiting to see rogue and hoping it is somewhere as good as this one but this little <UNK> did the job and did the job well it's scares are creative and it only <UNK> into the run of the mill frantic crying <UNK> and arguing for brief <UNK> of realism so i never got annoyed br br i remember reading the true story that inspired this where three guys went fishing and two ended up in a tree while their buddy was killed by the crocodile but the thing that always <UNK> me that gets left out from the film was that the crocodile didn't eat up the buddy no for hours and hours he <UNK> around the tree and <UNK> the dead body still in his mouth at the friends in the tree seeming to stay if you come down here this is what will happen to you
<START> this is a snuff movie i'm shocked it is even considered to be in the imdb library and bill julia and all other professional actors involved should be ashamed to be part of this sick flick i thought i was going to view a somewhat classic horror film with a creative end that writers like to <UNK> that usually make no sense when writing a horror film but as a viewer we try to <UNK> and understand this ending was not creative it was sick and has all the <UNK> of a snuff movie i am shocked it was edited to this ending and more shocked that it will be out for distribution by the end of june 2009 it should not be shown in a theater it is <UNK> to innocent minds on many levels watch the movie the ending and you will understand this statement plus included in the plot is a sweet little girl not yet 9 her character says she is not in the snuff ending but she is an integral part of the movie why do directors feel they need to shock with a sick flick in order to get recognition the director is in the wrong line of work if she thinks this is an art film
<START> i see that c thomas <UNK> has appeared in many movies since his <UNK> in the 80s as an accomplished young actor br br i bought this dvd because it was cheap and in part for the internet related plot and to see how much older c thomas <UNK> is i do not recall seeing him in any movies since the 1980s br br in just a few words what a very big disappointment i give some low budget movies a chance but this one started out lame within the first 15 minutes of the movie this <UNK> woman is <UNK> with an asian guy in a they basically <UNK> themselves to their own chat she then insists on meeting the <UNK> in person she meets him has sex ties him up and then murders him in cold blood the plot then <UNK> further br br the plot is thin and flimsy and the acting is very stiff do not bother renting it much less <UNK> it even if it is in the 1 dvd bin i plan to take my copy of the dvd to <UNK> i am truly amazed that any of the prior reviewers here gave this movie a bad rating
<START> mercy the movie actually starts out as a somewhat decent film and ellen <UNK> does give a strong performance but if you have read the book and actually got to know the characters and cared who done it the movie just does not compare it is always hard to brink a book onto film and this one ends up failing 3 out of 10
<START> does anyone remember braveheart it starred mel gibson who also directed and was scripted by randall wallace the film contains over 200 errors does anyone remember the green <UNK> that s the john wayne western where the duke saves a <UNK> called vietnam from a bunch of <UNK> from the <UNK> tribe if you watch we were soldiers you can t help but be reminded of these two films br br first of all what s with that scottish <UNK> that s played three times in the movie four if you count the end credits i mean what s the connection between scotland and <UNK> maybe wallace is using it in the vain hope that because braveheart was <UNK> <UNK> i might add with several oscars then so might this film whatever reason it s included it really <UNK> gibson plays hal moore as a cross between william wallace and john wayne and i was expecting him to say something like they ll never take our freedom the hell they will and it s impossible not to notice other similarities with the green <UNK> like the subplot of a journalist picking up a gun and turning into a warrior and moore telling the journalist about guilt in a scene almost identical to the one seen in the wayne movie br br when not reminding the audience of other movies also fails to stand on its own legs it s based on real events in 1965 but seems to lack an integrity needed to do the story justice it never feels like 1965 and lacks a sense of time and place probably because it was filmed in america not asia hal moore might have <UNK> up on the french experience in <UNK> china but if that s the case then he was unique because the american military went out of their way not to read up on the french <UNK> china war indeed when asked about the previous conflict <UNK> he had nothing to learn from the french who <UNK> t won a war since the days of <UNK> so i was confused as to the portrayal of the <UNK> in this movie when in 1965 the american high command <UNK> with <UNK> held the north <UNK> and <UNK> in contempt it s like history has been <UNK> in order to show the rice <UNK> of vietnam are <UNK> warriors they are but very few americans believed this in the mid 1960s br br there s a couple of other things that confused me like how the wives back home get <UNK> telling them their husbands are dead no bodies are shown being <UNK> back to base and no one on screen is seen referring to who s been killed in the la <UNK> valley likewise we re not seen <UNK> arrive on screen so how do we suddenly see the americans out number the <UNK> i put these down as directorial editing <UNK> on the part of wallace who <UNK> t strike me as much of a director and his biggest problem seems to be <UNK> the horror of the battle take the scene where the american burned to a crisp is <UNK> away screaming tell my wife i love her this should have an emotional impact similar to that death scene in platoon but here there s no impact in fact i found the scene cliched and <UNK> and he s not the only character to mouth the words tell my wife while <UNK> or dying i counted at least two other characters use the phrase did characters actually say this at the battle i <UNK> no idea but since randall wallace wrote the script i do have <UNK> br br i sat in shocked awe watching apocalypse now platoon and the killing fields made my eyes water i laughed at full metal jacket i kept looking at my watch with the deer hunter and after seeing we were soldiers i felt totally <UNK>
<START> susan sarandon is for lack of a better word incredible in my opinion and yes i do understand that not everyone will agree with me here she is one of the greatest actresses ever and should have at least 2 oscars to her credit i mean that was an amazing performance in <UNK> oil but then i think every performance of hers is amazing and they gave it to emma thompson what was that about and by the time she got this oscar she'd been in the industry for some 25 years i couldn't think of anyone who deserved it more especially for a performance as brilliant as her portrayal of sister helen but then again she is over and above all the <UNK> of hollywood and doesn't need an oscar people know she's good anyway br br this film carries some very deep thought messages so needless to say it is not to be taken lightly tim robbins of course can't escape credit here you would think that because of his person feelings against the death penalty the portrayals made in this movie wouldn't be accurate however both sides of the death penalty debate are given even weight on one side you see the interesting side of matthew the human side which makes witnessing his death rather heart wrenching at the same time you see the way he <UNK> his victims and the constant torment of the understandably grief stricken parents one word for tim bravo br br a brilliant movie and like i said a well deserved and long <UNK> oscar for susan
<START> i'm a christian and i have watched pretty of christian movies but this one is too bad they try to make this good but it's too hard for them i think br br you can see the film is badly dubbed in many places you can almost think that the in this film was the only ones left behind i think there will be a lot more of them br br the quality is poor and the acting could have been better too the story is not so very bad but could've been better the only plus i give is to the story in this film but totally i can't rate it more than 3 10 watch left behind instead
<START> i do not have much to say than this is a great finish to the story most people have said that there is not enough plot and its just eye candy but think about it everything was explained in you cannot add more plot to such a grand story it would ruin it they did the best that they could do and i think that this should be taken more as a final <UNK> the last fight br br graphics 10 10 absolutely amazing br br story 8 5 10 don't think they could of expanded it that much more and the stuff they could put in there was clever enough i thought br br characters 9 10 well most of them have already been explained during the game but still could not fit it all into 90 mins br br sound 10 10 since i am a metal fan i loved the fight music and piano just reaches right in there it is a great st and i was not disappointed br br <UNK> replay 10 10 enjoyable every time br br overall 9 10 <UNK> fan view 10 10 br br i personally think this is what was needed a fight to end it all the plot was already in place the action was necessary as much as people complained i loved every second of this movie it was a pleasure to visit the world of just one last time br br just remember this most movies that have been made form a game have been directed by movie directors i think this is pretty great for a team of game directors don't think i've seen a better game to movie br br <UNK> square i think you did it right
<START> not really worth a review but i suppose it's my duty to warn you all especially since there are some pretty good reviews of this canadian bomb floating around out there bad acting and a slow moving absolutely <UNK> boring <UNK> of <UNK> tale in which 3 boys lives are turned upside down when a man on the run shows up at their <UNK> in the woods at the boys make good with the intruder and at one point even view him as some sort of a role model however all this changes and you still won't care you will recognize chris penn whose biggest cinematic impact is corky <UNK> and a young <UNK> <UNK> whose career <UNK> at i was hoping for a <UNK> and 'the <UNK> or and all i got was a waste of time this film struggles to keep it's audiences attention and never makes an impact or maintains a note of anything remotely interesting
<START> it opens with your cliche overly long ship flying through space all i could think at this point was <UNK> and hoping <UNK> be a <UNK> on back that said we break for nobody the movie then shows some with <UNK> <UNK> narration i've always thought his voice sounded cool ever since i saw fast and the furious from when i found out he was as criminal i thought the movie was going to be cliche it was it was very cliche and fate seemed to be against them at every turn black out every 22 years lucky them they land on that day aliens can only be in the darkness hey it's a <UNK> <UNK> as much as i thought it was too easy and just a cliche the movie pulled through and kicked major ss i even went out and bought a copy of pitch black after seeing it i really can't wait for chronicles of <UNK>
<START> of the four main players in here john candy jean kelly amy <UNK> and <UNK> the only one i've never heard about at that time was the one that annoyed the heck out of me and ruined the film well she must have done a decent job of acting to make me want to throw her and the vhs into the garbage <UNK> i am referring to kelly in the role of teenage brat <UNK> russell ironically six years later she played a stunning and extremely likable role in the person of morgan in mr <UNK> <UNK> br br candy as usual is fun to watch as buck russell or the title character uncle buck few actors were better at playing a lovable hapless <UNK> than candy i enjoyed his character in here but i cannot watch that spoiled teen girl more than once also in the first few minutes of the film the little boy miles says the word g damn how bad is that having a six year old kid saying the <UNK> name in vain on film these hollywood people are such <UNK> no wonder many of their child actors turn out to be mentally screwed up being a case in point
<START> <UNK> high was actually a drama with moments of comedy it was a reflection of high school life back in the day i attended <UNK> high in washington d c from 1976 to 1979 and much of what was in <UNK> high was an every day thing at <UNK> as a matter of fact after the movie came out everybody started calling <UNK> <UNK> high getting high shooting <UNK> chasing girls basement parties and fights that sums up high school life for many in d c back in the day i can't forget <UNK> because <UNK> music began and ended many a day back in the 70s the hits just kept coming however <UNK> high adds a <UNK> of humanity over the <UNK> because when all was said and done just like in <UNK> high my classmates and i had a lot of love for each other and like the characters in <UNK> high there was life after high school but there was nothing like waking up every morning and experiencing each day to the <UNK> from to seventh period thirty years later we are getting ready to celebrate those good times <UNK> high is definitely a period piece that just gets better with time because like it or not the only thing left from those days are memories some good and some bad
<START> being a russian myself sometimes it's hard for me to get the reference jokes about american tv personalities or celebrities apart from that family guy is the <UNK> funniest and most politically incorrect shows seen on earth the voice acting is excellent and sounds clear enough even for a non english <UNK> as myself to comprehend animations are good too maybe even too good for a tv show here we have the equivalent of the adult swim channel but nothing there simply <UNK> to this gem not even simpsons or south park hope the creators will continue to entertain and <UNK> us don't want to see the whole thing <UNK> down into mediocre entertainment
<START> i never ever ever thought i'd write the above four words but actually she's the <UNK> of this little flick br br as the movie was <UNK> when i rented it it supposedly is a comedy about a girl who is kidnapped but doesn't have her <UNK> which keeps her stable it sounded like a cute concept for years all we ever saw of spelling was as donna martin in <UNK> and an endless parade of dull lifeless tv movies it sounded like a chance for her to stretch a little and considering that with her tv success and her rich daddy she couldn't have any financial reason to do this movie i figured she took the part because this must be a low budget jewel br br wrong br br instead <UNK> part is small and the bit about the mentally <UNK> kidnap victim is just one of several <UNK> when she's not on the screen the movie <UNK> so badly i could've <UNK> it was longer than the 85 minutes that were listed on the tape this would've worked so much better if <UNK> storyline had dominated and it had been changed into a romantic comedy with her and phil the least irritating <UNK>
<START> the best british comedy film ever for years english comedy television programs have turned into films and have <UNK> <UNK> you being served ' <UNK> the list goes on however the popular dark <UNK> bbc television show 'the league of <UNK> has managed to not only create a film which has managed to not be a flop but has also managed to be the best british comedy film ever with its dark and horrific twists and turns the league of <UNK> apocalypse is british talent at its best its intriguing demonic storyline written by the league of gentlemen mark <UNK> steve <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and jeremy <UNK> matches with the <UNK> and guest cameos superb acting this i hope is not the end of <UNK> <UNK> not after this great success anyway don't think that if you have not seen the league of gentlemen on the telly that you will not understand whats going on its all well explained and by the end of the film you will be happy with the result but you are still left hungry for more <UNK> special stuff
<START> a film that reveals the <UNK> of modern men and women in life when confronted to death we are beyond the simple religious belief in the <UNK> and what's more in any kind of hell or heaven religion is <UNK> dead yet human beings are more obsessed than ever by death especially since we can push it away for quite a long time what's more the scientific and technological development of our societies leads us to believe we can explain everything know everything and do everything that was quite typical of the end of the 20th century today things are changing especially when the president of the united states himself <UNK> <UNK> in a public speech to <UNK> speaks of their search for truth and qualifies that truth as being of course relative because it is more a quest than a final end objective or achievement the film shows the end of the good old <UNK> thinking that was starting to <UNK> into a truth obsession an obsessive conception that truth was unique and <UNK> <UNK> post <UNK> had not reached hollywood yet though today it seems to have reached the white house so some young doctors and medical students decide to go into death and come back technically it is possible but the result is not surprising it old guilty feelings and <UNK> that had been buried into the unconscious one has to do with a drug addicted father of a vietnam veteran who commits suicide another with a young boy who was stoned to death by some others the death included another still with a young black girl who was <UNK> and <UNK> in grade school out of racism <UNK> and hatred if not fear in front of her <UNK> it is so <UNK> that you could cry out of shame for these young adults who are highly <UNK> and behave like babies who are crying for their <UNK> of <UNK> fruit juice the film though is interesting but in something quite different the setting and the shooting and every single detail or treatment of any detail is <UNK> morbid <UNK> quite in the style of death in <UNK> or <UNK> or some other works of art that deal with making friends with the basic enemy that death is of course that does not save the film but at least that makes it worth watching br br dr jacques <UNK> university paris 1 <UNK> <UNK> university <UNK> saint quentin en <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i have seen this film probably a dozen times since it was originally released <UNK> anyone who calls this movie trash or horrible just doesn't understand action films or recognize a good one perhaps to some the incidents and <UNK> may seem far fetched but in my opinion screenwriter <UNK> black lethal weapon kiss kiss bang bang crafted one of the most well thought out action adventures you will ever come across over the top or not this film flows like clockwork and the action just keeps coming the final action sequence is one of the best i have ever seen in any film the cast in this film <UNK> davis gave a tremendous performance and its a damn shame there was never a sequel samuel l jackson is hilarious as her sidekick mitch a down on his luck private eye trying to help her discover her lost past and make a few bucks if <UNK> me how anyone could not like this film it packs so many thrills and its so funny the <UNK> in this film still make me laugh just as hard 10 years later in my mind the first matrix film and the long kiss <UNK> were easily 2 of the best and most original action flicks of the 90's incidentally <UNK> black made a fortune when he sold this script at the time it was the highest selling screenplay and its worth every penny it's so sad that audiences never gave this movie a chance cause they would have witnessed <UNK> <UNK> best film and davis like you have never seen her before long live the long kiss <UNK>
<START> i am a big fan of british films in general but especially gangster movies unfortunately this film was shockingly bad i think its pretty depressing that this film is getting any good <UNK> reviews the idea that this film is gritty and realistic is laughable i have read and heard fist hand quite a lot about the real life events shown in this movie and they have nearly all been <UNK> with over the top violence etc the only gritty true to life event in the whole film was the range <UNK> murders where some overblown <UNK> got <UNK> out for messing with people they could not handle this film is a disgrace to british cinema it has no plot and no decent acting and just relies on being violent gritty and realistic as some people like to put it the sort of people who made this film should not be allowed near a budget or film camera just as the sort of people this film is about should not be given the opportunity to tell this pathetic violent little tale of no consequence
<START> this movie sucks did anyone notice that the entire movie was shot in like 2 rooms there are never any outside shots and if there are its obviously film taken from somewhere else this movie blows hard painful to sit through too stay far away
<START> some people have the ability to use only 3 <UNK> one for eating one for breathing and the other one for s <UNK> this is not a movie for them br br but for those who enjoy using the brain the whole movie is a metaphor everything is there for a purpose every single detail the coffee <UNK> the red couch everything is a <UNK> masterpiece br br it is hilarious is raw and totally realistic that's how we actually interact it is a royal comedy total <UNK> br br just hang on don't let the first scene shock you hang on and enjoy the show
<START> during world war ii two soviet russian soldiers try to avoid being captured by <UNK> nazis as they <UNK> through snowy <UNK> searching for food and safety if you happen not to like black and white foreign films you may still enjoy in english the <UNK> director <UNK> the film extraordinarily well despite its being a largely <UNK> piece of work her <UNK> death in a car accident made this ms final film unfortunately br br after the opening mission is <UNK> there doesn't seem to be much that could happen in the snowy woods but and a changing setting make it unexpectedly exciting leading players <UNK> as the <UNK> wounded and boris as the physically wounded successfully avoid being crushed by the ever increasing symbolism their <UNK> performances under sharp direction provide a memorable and thought provoking take on a familiar story br br 4 2 <UNK> <UNK> boris <UNK>
<START> this movie was an absolute waste of time it's nothing but a wanna be gangster movie it contains a very predictable plot my feelings are unsympathetic to the characters and the dialogue is mediocre at best half the time you are looking for something else to do because the movie is that boring since you already know what's going to happen the other half of the time you're desperately hoping the protagonist grows a pair of balls or just ends his life by jumping off a bridge or something also the secondary characters are for the most part one dimensional there's no depth to any of the characters in this movie no depth
<START> wicked little things has an excellent synopsis empty house beside abandoned mine in woods with tragic past family moves into house and strange things begin to happen little creepy children begin to pop up here and there doing creepy little children things but that is where the <UNK> and potential fun ends this group of kids was sealed in the mine many decades earlier and now appear <UNK> the woods poor make up with weapons looking for flesh to eat oh i get it this is a ghost zombie movie hmmm while i can appreciate someone trying something new with this genre this just didn't work what was the children's motivation in seeking to <UNK> flesh why did they need weapons did anyone else imagine the filmmakers all gathered around the daily footage <UNK> because they felt this was going to be a cool scary movie i found that after thirty minutes i felt the familiar <UNK> that i had just wasted my time on another modern crap fest while the acting was good and the setting cinematography of good quality as well the script itself suffered from what seems to be a lack of knowledge about the supernatural horror genre altogether a bunch of kids walking down the mall is scarier than this pack of poorly disguised <UNK> br br this movie is not scary and while i can appreciate the story perhaps have even enjoyed it if i had read it instead of watched it i still have to say that wicked little things is more accurately called wicked little turd
<START> one day a red alley cat is fed up of being kicked by people and attacked by dogs and <UNK> that life would be better if he were a <UNK> he then paints himself black with a white <UNK> down his back and adds a bit of <UNK> cheese to make him stink at first life couldn't be better for him the dog <UNK> and the butcher <UNK> his shop letting the cat walk off with a pile of meat just as he is thinking everything is perfect he is noticed by a real <UNK> not just any <UNK> but the overly <UNK> le <UNK> mistakes the poor cat for a female <UNK> and <UNK> him thinking his <UNK> are just <UNK> our poor cat thinks he has escaped when he throws a <UNK> skin from a tall building so that will think he is dead at first it seems to work but as he <UNK> off sees him and instantly forgets the dead <UNK> in the end the cat realises he was better off being kicked and attacked than being <UNK> after by a randy <UNK> there is a nice ending for the <UNK> too when his wife finds out what he has been up to br br this was a fairly funny introduction to le <UNK> who back then was just overly <UNK> but now looks like a randy sexually <UNK> stalker although he was <UNK> for his behaviour in the end
<START> linda <UNK> was the victim of a sadistic woman <UNK> chuck <UNK> i don't understand how having sex with a dog which is animal abuse as well can be found to be entertaining or funny linda <UNK> was a virtual prisoner who was <UNK> into making these films i know some people will criticize this comment but i feel strongly that these types of films fuel the fire of hatred and further misogynistic feelings towards women this society continues to portray women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings we call ourselves <UNK> however i feel we have a long way to go before we can ever scratch the surface of being <UNK>
<START> this is the most energetic and entertaining ten minutes of film i've seen in a long time as a film student at <UNK> where this short has been screened several times i <UNK> jim cox for his <UNK> sense of style and pace for our generation i'm sure i'll see his name later on the big screen hopefully this short will find a market on tv or somewhere so this inspiring work can get the wide distribution it des
<START> as a canadian history major my first thing to say historical facts are not accurate how can a producer do that the <UNK> of the wasn't in when we see franklin in london but in how can he pass that in the movie the scenes in <UNK> were useless too then for the story for anyone that read les <UNK> you have the story line right there it's the story of la that witch add a love story too and a tragic relationship between mother and daughter ending sure it brought tears to my eyes but that's it then there's the fact it's apparently set up in city but it's mostly shot at the de sure it's a historical site and it's accurate to the time but it was obvious that the scenes were not all set in city overall if you're looking for a documentary of new france go get a people's history a real documentary on the history of and new france if you want a love story that will bring you tears a story set up in a wonderful forest watch new france
<START> george <UNK> is and always will be one of my favorites the <UNK> hero of his generation nobody mentions <UNK> in the same breath as john ford howard <UNK> william <UNK> or billy wilder and yet look at his filmography from <UNK> comedies the philadelphia story <UNK> <UNK> holiday psycho <UNK> <UNK> a double life a great semi western <UNK> in pink <UNK> not to mention my fair lady or travels with my aunt he was at the service of his actors he never put himself in front of the camera i feel a certain <UNK> watching rich and famous flashes of the old master still very much in evidence <UNK> <UNK> gives us for the first time in her career glimpses of the wonderful comedian she was about to become <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> to the days of <UNK> <UNK> and loretta young and hart <UNK> steps in <UNK> us promising something spectacular that will eventually <UNK> in 1989 with apartment zero meg ryan as <UNK> daughter is already meg ryan as tired as the formula is it remains a <UNK> film and for what i gather one of <UNK> favorite movies
<START> as a professional poker dealer for over 25 years i found this movie very hard to watch too unreal it seems the producers of this movie either had done little or no research or just didn't care the card tricks are something you never would see performed in a real poker game common sense right plus it was full of film cuts and such during the tricks who couldn't do that the cheating was amateur stuff marked cards etc would you sit in a high limit game where they use opened deck cards would you sit in a game where the players push their <UNK> into the middle of a pot constantly mixing them in then just how much they bet c'mon i gave it a 4 because the twists and turns might be interesting to some people but for those who know how to play the game it will be pretty painful next time they should use real players and get some insight on how to do it right <UNK>
<START> i would love for members of the cast and crew to sit down and do an audio commentary on this movie all of the different places that they went to film this movie should provide for some very good <UNK> fans of this movie would love to know br br what kind of <UNK> did they have to get to film at certain locations br br were there any memorable <UNK> br br were there any scenes that were deleted br br what challenges did the cast and the crew face br br did any actors have stunt <UNK> br br what was it like to work with other members of the cast br br were any of the scenes ad <UNK> br br what are members of the cast and crew up to now br br what locations are still there and what locations are no longer there or are now a different business br br it is one thing to read trivia about this movie on this site and other web sites but there is just no comparison to getting it straight from the <UNK> mouth br br come on guys get together and do a commentary never walk away from a challenge go for the gusto
<START> like curse of the <UNK> was for the creature feature genre jim <UNK> massacre is a straight faced parody of slasher movies such as <UNK> party massacre a psycho who has escaped from his padded cell he was sent to the loony bin thanks to killing eleven people is working across the <UNK> backwoods countryside of <UNK> county attacking anyone within his reach a van load of <UNK> their teacher two equipment hands and the driver are on their way to a contest when their vehicle runs out of fuel while taking a supposed short cut to avoid having to turn back luckily the group find a cabin up ahead but fall prey to a killer who attacks each victim one by one the psycho loose in the county couldn't have killed one girl because she was in the locker room while he was elsewhere which means someone among their own is the <UNK> meanwhile the sheriff of the county and his deputy pursue the <UNK> of their psycho while also trying to find the location of the missing <UNK> squad br br shot cheap on video <UNK> does what he can with the limited budget having to find clever ways to <UNK> characters off screen without the luxury of properly effective special effects in other words lots of <UNK> were stabbed the sound effect used to let us know that certain victims <UNK> away into the darkness by a black <UNK> hand died <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a scene from <UNK> party massacre regarding <UNK> <UNK> character linda her being pursued by a killer with a <UNK> that killer and linda both wound up dead but i guess <UNK> wanted to connect his film to that one albeit rather poorly still it was nice to see her even if it was a <UNK> cameo <UNK> as ms the teacher of the students in trouble has a long bathing scene in the shower her naked body and fake breasts the girls who make up the <UNK> are a bit unconvincing because their obviously in their <UNK> aging soft core porn stars samantha <UNK> as a police officer who is attacked by the psychopath she's searching for and <UNK> fritz a <UNK> who is <UNK> while <UNK> across a dangerous bridge surprisingly don't have to strip <UNK> vets bill monroe as sheriff <UNK> and melissa as a detective who <UNK> <UNK> on his case contribute to the sub plot of the search for john <UNK> serial killer <UNK> interesting enough the <UNK> story serves as a as in truth the meat of the film is devoted to the <UNK> group and their <UNK> situation i'm not sure if slasher fans will embrace this movie because it takes too long for the kills to <UNK> up and when they eventually enter the picture the violence isn't potent or shocking enough to satisfy
<START> i went in to this thinking another gross movie with gross humor telling from my first sentence i don't like that humor and this movie had it's moments but i loved it justin long has really never done comedy like this where he's sarcastic and clever and i loved it lewis black enough said the ending i really did love because it had to take itself seriously i mean how else would you end it yes it's another underdog story but not in your typical format and the movie wasn't their ups and downs it was people coming together for one common goal to go to college where they were accepted the cast was amazing and yes i did laugh at loud when i didn't think i would and the laughter lasted longer then i thought to the parents and sister played their roles well but their characters are put in when necessary the movie was not focused around them but at the same time they showed up when you expect and not expect them to they played in to the story very well and i loved the familiar faces anthony boston public jeremy howard i galaxy quest with justin long ross <UNK> the new guy and sam brink blake lively added her certain something to the movie which made it even more enjoyable as well as <UNK> friends i recommend this movie to whoever hated those gross comedies of the last 4 years and really want something with humor and an actually story line
<START> as a <UNK> show attack of the show is <UNK> of the larger fall of <UNK> tv it is a show and a station that has fallen so far that it <UNK> sex to try and cover its glaring faults its predecessor the screen was a <UNK> for technology problems and <UNK> out the latest and greatest in technology it was a nice show with a likable staff and it was fun to see some of the and other experiments the crew could put to together br br the <UNK> of by <UNK> bothered some longtime fans of the station but early returns were actually promising the emphasis on <UNK> was a nice addition and i really enjoyed a lot of the coverage of and other big entertainment events br br unfortunately now stands as but a shell of its former self those <UNK> the channel have <UNK> the focus of the channel away from technology and <UNK> and toward anything that might <UNK> <UNK> from young adult men the result is that spends as much time <UNK> olivia <UNK> or <UNK> the adult film industry as it does covering games it is so bad it is practically unwatchable br br while some may get <UNK> joy out of this sort of thing those who genuinely enjoy <UNK> may wonder where the good coverage went equally <UNK> young <UNK> who might tune into <UNK> thinking their getting <UNK> that active <UNK> group between 10 15 are instead being fed things aimed toward a more mature audience on a channel like hbo or <UNK> things like that are expected on <UNK> it's tragic br br at least another male aimed channel has good programming like <UNK> and <UNK> has very little good left to offer br br too bad really
<START> <UNK> in paris is a truly <UNK> film it presents thomas <UNK> nick nolte in the most <UNK> light possible painting him as a liar racist and <UNK> yet offers not a shred of <UNK> for those sins this is the way he was the film seems to say end of sentence end of movie the <UNK> behind you br br after arriving in paris with his daughter <UNK> paltrow <UNK> proceeds to win the heart of maria greta <UNK> the wife of a homosexual english painter the criminally underused simon <UNK> a turn of events sends maria to england however and <UNK> proceeds to forget her with astonishing speed for a man who mere minutes of screen time before was asking her to live with him in america br br he's been <UNK> you see by sally <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> one of his slaves just arrived from america just why he's <UNK> is hard to tell although sally is undeniably beautiful she acts like a simple minded child in front of <UNK> when she isn't telling ghost stories in exaggerated speech <UNK> she's <UNK> around his bedroom practically <UNK> lust for her distinguished br br if her behavior is an attempt to excuse it doesn't work <UNK> <UNK> himself further when maria tired of waiting for his letters travels from england to see him i've not changed toward you he insists offering weak excuses for not writing to her credit maria sees through his <UNK> lies immediately when sally appears and she and <UNK> <UNK> openly and <UNK> to my mind in <UNK> very presence the illusion falls apart completely br br no one today believes that <UNK> washington and the rest were utter of virtue and morality yet are we supposed to believe that the learned distinguished <UNK> would be attracted to sally a woman whose most intelligent conversation is about how <UNK> friends <UNK> corn and who <UNK> herself against his front as she passes right before <UNK> eyes br br even if we let that slide it's followed by the horrifying revelation that sally was only 15 when this affair took place <UNK> was <UNK> strangely this fact comes out only toward the very end when <UNK> brother james is furious at her <UNK> <UNK> that she is carrying child br br <UNK> is equally <UNK> when told that sally is carrying his child and tells her that she'd be far better off under his protection than free and living in france with her brother but he promises i'll free her when i die and our children including any more that come <UNK> says in a chilling <UNK> of sally as his when they reach 21 oh thank you you feel like telling the screen big deal br br the worst scene is still to come however involving daughter <UNK> she is already angry at him first for breaking his <UNK> made to her mother on her <UNK> not to marry again obviously the woman wasn't just talking about <UNK> <UNK> has also refused to allow <UNK> to become a nun as she wishes despite earlier <UNK> about freedom of religion that seems to mean freedom to agree with him br br having promised sally and her brother their freedom <UNK> calls in <UNK> to witness the bargain and promise to fulfill it should anything happen to him <UNK> brother <UNK> out the impending birth of the child and <UNK> asks do you swear <UNK> performance in this scene is brilliant although she has almost nothing to say her face nearly <UNK> in <UNK> pain at this revelation yet she controls her grief and <UNK> yes br br if anything and the filmmakers could have had something if they'd <UNK> this point more <UNK> in paris is an indication of the status of woman in the late 18th century viewed even by men like <UNK> as attractive property pleasing but without true intellect or souls we see <UNK> shed a few tears over a letter from maria obviously telling him where to get off but he's soon laughing away at a wild dance from sally complete with tossed hair and <UNK> <UNK> br br i don't know whether this is an accurate portrait of <UNK> or not i don't care to watch it however just for the sake of watching it this <UNK> is no hero or even an anti hero he's a selfish lying child and one who gets away with it not the kind of man i want to see a movie about
<START> it stars war <UNK> william <UNK> separated who falls in love with a stunning <UNK> doctor jessica jones set against the stunning backdrop of hong kong the cinematography is magnificent as they <UNK> on a hill <UNK> hong kong the story deals with racial tensions society <UNK> on mixed relations and extra marital affairs but what i love about it is the strong character of the heroine portrayed by jessica jones who is a <UNK> doctor who stays humble and <UNK> in her <UNK> mission and stays loyal to her love despite that she gets <UNK> at her hospital for <UNK> with a married man by high <UNK> one day william <UNK> is called to the korean war which he covers and then that ill <UNK> day she gets the news of his demise the end of course is tragic i cried when she went to their hill it was a very sweet ill <UNK> love affair it <UNK> all the odds the fact that she got fired from her job how his wife would not grant him a divorce yet their great love <UNK> they experienced a great love despite it all i personally do not believe in <UNK> affairs and think he should have not started something when he was bound to someone else and she should not have allowed herself to let it happen but despite that a truly magnificent movie i think the heroine overshadowed the hero jessica jones is <UNK> and gave a magnificent performance although i thought it strange they didn't not hire a real asian actress or someone with asian blood i agree with one review jessica jones <UNK> sexuality when she lays on the ground and looks up at william <UNK> speaking <UNK> but her eyes say come take me now br br i find it a pity most great films were made before i was born it seems many hollywood movies are lacking in depth great acting and depend entirely on stunts and heavy sex scenes this is truly one of the greatest ill <UNK> love stories in movies
<START> this is a spectacular production i have seen the show live twice in chicago and my only problem with the production was the fact that i was able to perceive only <UNK> of what was going on the stage consisted of three giant <UNK> and the platform and as the action moves from one part of the stage to the next sometime you loose track of what is going on no matter where you are located as always this is a thought provoking <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> captured in high definition with 15 cameras the footage was masterfully edited one of the best concert dvds of all times in my opinion i only hope and wish that they will release this on <UNK> ray of <UNK> dvd so that we can re live this <UNK> over and over again
<START> rush in <UNK> is no doubt one of the most exciting dvds i have purchased although i am a biased rush fan of almost 20 years i found this performance to be flawless the music is heavy and sharp which sounds great on any surround sound system the band is energetic the crowd has a constant smile it's like they were able to capture every concert i've been to for any rush fan this dvd is a must if anything just to see the boys in brazil documentary which reveals the travels of this rather isolated personal band for any non rush fan this dvd is an enjoyable concert rush fans know the talent of these three <UNK> we have rather firmly stood by them for years i've shown this dvd or portions of it anyway to those who have never heard of rush or those who think rush is less than good because they do not appeal to the <UNK> masses of rock i e sex drugs and a drunken frenzy the bottom line is this dvd is worth every penny and more than worth the time to view it
<START> out of any category this is one demented and over the edge film even in todays standards filmed entirely in crap o <UNK> this film will blow your mind and something else too br br the amount of hilarious bad taste and sleaze is astonishing the dialog is <UNK> fast and campy you'll either love or hate this film but give it go i've seen it 4 times and absolutely love it divine is in the quest for being the <UNK> person alive but so are her rivals too in this obscene and disgusting but funny and stylish little film br br divine was phenomenal and she will always be missed greatly edith massey does the unforgettable performance as the and don't forget the energetic <UNK> stole br br crazy s t br br recommended also for you sick little <UNK> br br female trouble br br desperate living br br <UNK>
<START> michael caine might have tried to make a larger than life character to a successful degree but the whole storyline and character's around him where not likable or interesting at all it was all very boring and somewhat predictable martin <UNK> a favorite actor of mine had a nothing role he was useless michael caine got a bit irritating after a while and the film couldn't decide if it was a comedy or a serious thriller caine tries hard and good on him but i felt the direction and storyline let him down don't waste your time it starts off well for the first 10 minutes and then that's about it a film for die hard caine fans only stay away from this one
<START> <UNK> from germany so please excuse my style of writing as <UNK> seen <UNK> 4 for the first time i was a bit surprised i knew <UNK> as a usual 80s but bride of <UNK> was very different from the old ones first there is the artwork of the very good director <UNK> <UNK> who we still have in mind from a chinese ghost story his visual style is in a <UNK> kinda way comparable to francis ford coppola also the voices of <UNK> an <UNK> are very impressive <UNK> also liked the screenplay very much especially the scene in which <UNK> throws the in the br br i give it a 9 0 vote for funny gory and <UNK> entertainment if you have any comments on my opinion just send me an e mail

<START> the <UNK> 2006 was written and directed by ned <UNK> <UNK> portrays jane <UNK> a former world class <UNK> who was seriously injured and now earns her living as a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br the <UNK> material leads you to believe that the plot <UNK> around jane's accidental reunion with a former <UNK> although this meeting takes place that plot line is secondary to the main plot which involves jane her husband and a professional dancer named <UNK> the two women develop an act of the type performed by de <UNK> the two <UNK> each other jane is more experienced with heights and has tremendous upper body strength <UNK> is more elegant and artistic although obviously also capable of incredible physical <UNK> br br the film works because we can understand how jane would turn to who is caring and compassionate while jane's husband has taken her for granted for the many years of their marriage br br both women are incredibly fit and athletic and has the lean body and well defined <UNK> that are characteristic of <UNK> they clearly are truly performing their act and the results are so excellent that we can believe they would indeed be a success in las vegas or anywhere else they traveled br br the sexual tension between the women is obvious and the situation becomes even more complex when the act requires them to kiss while suspended in the air a woman with a <UNK> husband and an attractive woman partner make for an explosive situation which isn't resolved in a neat and <UNK> fashion br br of the six films we saw at the rochester ny lesbian and gay film and video festival we thought this one was the best it will work on dvd and is definitely worth seeking out on large or small screen note stay for the credits
<START> it is hard to know what category to put this film in most films set in this time period of us history are westerns but here instead of the wide open <UNK> of the west the action is almost entirely confined to a claustrophobic girls <UNK> school in <UNK> br br the film opens with amy a young girl walking though the woods picking <UNK> as she does so she stumbles upon <UNK> john a wounded union soldier who she takes back to the school we know that he isn't a particularly nice person when he kisses her on the lips to distract her from <UNK> a passing <UNK> <UNK> even though she told him she was twelve br br once back at the school opinions are divided about what should be done with their new guest some think they should look after him till his wounds are <UNK> while others believe that it is <UNK> not to hand him over to <UNK> forces at the first opportunity the former group <UNK> and he gradually <UNK> as he does so his presence has an effect on all of the girls who haven't had a man on site for a long time including a young teacher and the head mistress who's previous relationship appears to have been with her own brother sets about <UNK> them emotionally if not physically this leads to considerable jealousy amongst the girls br br while this film is rated fifteen it is definitely not for younger viewers both for the sexual content of which little is actually shown but much is implied and for a very <UNK> scene which had me <UNK> more than any other scene in any film i've seen for quite some time it is interesting to see clint eastwood play against type instead of being heroic his character is both unpleasant and for most of the time at the mercy of the women around him the acting is solid throughout not just from eastwood but also from all the actresses including the young <UNK> <UNK> who played amy
<START> the hindi version of the film is minutes set in <UNK> in the early <UNK> the film based on novel draws an <UNK> between the british <UNK> of india and the <UNK> of women an educated and beautiful woman becomes a widow within a year of her marriage but she does not accept the constraints <UNK> on her as a widow by her society the film has a beautiful look to it but perhaps <UNK> <UNK> is out of her depth in portraying strong character with its subtle combination of <UNK> and <UNK> does not come across and as a result the <UNK> between women and <UNK> remains somewhat buried
<START> ann <UNK> did the best job she has ever done in her history of film making i felt as if she was mrs there might be one or two films of ann i have not seen since her film debut in pocket full of <UNK> with betty davis in <UNK> i feel she has been totally under rated in the industry though she was nominated for an emmy award for this role in who will love my children she was overlooked like she was nominated for an academy award for her roles in <UNK> knowledge and tommy she was <UNK> over all i think everyone did a superb acting job including all the children in who will love my children yes it is a sad movie as true stories can be but well worth the time thank you
<START> this movie sat in a dusty stack of videos in my house for ages before we watched it we knew it was there every time someone wanted to watch a movie it was suggested it almost became a joke i know let's watch throw <UNK> from the train i don't know why it was always turned down it just was little did we know what we were missing out on it still <UNK> me why it took us so long i mean it stars danny <UNK> billy crystal and ann who we referred to as the lady from the <UNK> an all star cast that should have <UNK> to everyone in my household but there it sat for nearly ten years until one day it was suggested and we could turn it down no longer br br it was like finding king <UNK> tomb br br no movie has ever made me laugh so hard and i doubt any movie ever will i had to <UNK> for almost every line because i was still laughing at the line that came before it and lost ability to hear or pay attention not just simple laughing either the kind of laughing that more energy than running ten miles in the cold the kind of laughing that you cannot control that causes rolling around and <UNK> and tears and <UNK> running down your face because it's just that <UNK> funny once i learned the movie by heart i will say this effect has <UNK> but i don't think i will get tired of watching it and finding new quirks in it to appreciate i think that's all i can say i would recommend this movie to anyone but if you don't enjoy it please don't let me know i will probably be offended
<START> seven ups has been compared to <UNK> for the chase scene but does not come anywhere near matching <UNK> <UNK> has a beginning that builds builds builds when mcqueen leaves the seedy hotel gets into his <UNK> which is <UNK> under the <UNK> now torn down and notices the <UNK> sitting you know you are about to see something spectacular from that moment on when mcqueen starts that car begins the best car chase sequence ever filmed adding to it is a terrific <UNK> if i remember correctly sound track this goes on for a long time before you actually hear the first <UNK> <UNK> that shot of <UNK> <UNK> suddenly appearing in bill rear view mirror is <UNK> for visual impact look of surprise and double take really adds to the effect then of course san francisco is <UNK> for the setting of cars racing up and down hills and around <UNK> also <UNK> being filmed in the 60s when cars were still hot <UNK> <UNK> and dodge <UNK> made for a better set of <UNK> then two boring <UNK> device laden in the 1970s seven ups bill <UNK> was the driver of the bad guy car in both movies i saw him sitting at an <UNK> movie preview once on the <UNK> lot when i was doing movie reviews for a paper they gave it a good try in seven ups though with the chase scene seven ups had a few jumps over little hills yawn but of course they were not san francisco hills the seven ups chase where they are actually going fast is longer than the go fast sequence in <UNK> but the scene of a single shotgun blast totally blowing the hood off of roy <UNK> is the height of absurdity strictly hollywood i would say except that it was filmed in new york
<START> with that carry the same dark weaknesses we all unfortunately possess lying deception <UNK> the list goes on br br however as an american i was shocked to see that corruption and racism exist in today's police force as is reflected with the <UNK> county sheriff <UNK> horrible detective and police work with the murder of a white female tourist and a 15 year old accused black youth i <UNK> my head in shame that detectives were <UNK> from their abusive work while a young man's life hung in the crooked balance of justice br br however there is also a story of hope with our <UNK> system and how poorly paid public <UNK> stuck by their guns irony intended and forced the truth from the detectives i wanted to fly down to florida and tell anybody with influence what a great public <UNK> team they have in <UNK> county those lawyers care about the little man and most importantly for justice br br the other story line is about faith and family <UNK> to the family and their strong christian submit any dedicated religion beliefs and wonderful family values i hope they win their <UNK> against the <UNK> county <UNK> department br br bravo for justice bravo for the little guy
<START> i normally don't like romantic films but i love this film very much the story is really touching and the ending is very appropriate i feel i really care for many characters in this film i feel i can feel their feelings while most romantic films always make me feel detached and bored this one completely makes me feel involved starting from the scene of <UNK> running along the beach with scott until the ending scene i want to rate this film 11 out of 10 because i want to give an extra one point for the ending the acting part is very strong kate <UNK> has a good opportunity to show her talent though i'm not impressed with scott in dead man on campus ' this film completely changes my viewpoint towards him he's so <UNK> charming here <UNK> <UNK> is as terrific as ever br br this film might not be as good complex deep or believable as other films which deal a little bit with the same kind of relationship such as de la <UNK> or <UNK> animal <UNK> ' but the love can still be proud of itself as it casts a rare different light on that kind of relationship and that difference makes this film <UNK> enjoyable by being and relying on great charms of small stars <UNK> this time you really make my dream come true
<START> i saw into pitch black on t v and so i had to see this i must say i was very impressed br br not only has david style improved since he wrote <UNK> 2 this film brought to my attention <UNK> <UNK> sure he was there in into pitch black but here he was <UNK> scary and intense i haven't seen charisma like that since <UNK> in the 80's br br the story is simple enough but it is the characters that make this film interesting then there was what happens with the female lead unexpected the dark humor helps the film move along the effects aren't grand but when <UNK> fights the alien it blew all of my complaints out br br <UNK> hasn't done a whole lot since this film that i would care about but i am eagerly looking forward to the sequel
<START> i believe an entire book can be written about the odyssey to remake the classic film on which this film is loosely based when hollywood first started talking about such enterprise the reaction was always negative because there were just too many aspects that could have gone wrong starting with the solid ensemble that made the original unforgettable and that's exactly where things begin <UNK> here with the selection of actresses that otherwise can do remarkable work but that are not suited to the parts and sadly enough have been directed with the heavy hand of a director that doesn't understand or appreciate the source material br br it seems as if there is no focus or direction or as if the direction that has been taken is to <UNK> anything that was good about the original film this is called an <UNK> as in let's drain the story out of humor snappy dialogue and any interesting premise most of all let's prove that women have come a long way except that the problem is that we don't really get at least by watching this film where the women are truly going br br for starters casting meg ryan in the central role proves almost fatal to the movie because somehow she seems to have locked herself into some sort of <UNK> where women don't really change appearances even after 20 years of working in the movies her mary which proved to be a difficult role in the 30's somehow grew from her interaction with the other stereotypes like dorothy in the wizard of oz by learning <UNK> and realizing that she had a choice in the matter it might not have been a choice that women would celebrate nowadays but it was fun ride and part of the fun was the <UNK> silly sometimes slapstick routines that <UNK> that movie into the realm of the sublime in here we are down to earth with a <UNK> by changing the nature of sylvia the film has lost a lot of its spark and it isn't in anyway <UNK> fault i couldn't help but <UNK> how she tried to save this sinking ship and got a sinking feeling as she <UNK> with the horrible lines she was handled thankfully i entertained myself by looking at some of her terrific outfits and kept reminding myself how talented this lady really was her sylvia is wise but flawed and she could have been a great creation unfortunately ms english wasn't paying attention to her own work and loses control of the one character that could have turned the film into a fresh direction br br yet that wasn't the biggest <UNK> of them all in the original we have joan crawford doing probably one of the best performances by a woman her crystal is legendary with conniving lines <UNK> moves <UNK> <UNK> and some very sexy poses she was the link between the male and the female and through her we knew what the whole catastrophe was about she provided the tension between men and women she was dangerous sexy the ultimate femme fatale a woman of intelligence that we feared and admired and most importantly we wanted to destroy to save our heroine eva <UNK> as gorgeous as she is is two dimensional in this outing because of weak writing and once again some bad casting br br there are more atrocities in the film such as the addition of a terrible role for as the dedicated mother who lives for having babies and the rather annoying lesbian turn by <UNK> then comes the biggest waste of talent in the movie as bette who is a little <UNK> in her make up shows the spark of what could have been her <UNK> delivery reminds us of the contemporary angle the film could have taken her words revive and put a big of much needed <UNK> in the film and it is exciting to see that it could really fly then she is gone she is in the film all of six minutes and she fades away in the middle of the <UNK> br br here is a movie that raised our anticipation level and truly disappointed us a film that could have joined the successful sex in the city who made an amazing transition to the big screen because it respected its source material and didn't compromise it gave us more bigger and better adaptation it truly updated what had made it successful before the women in its present reincarnation needs to go back and <UNK> itself much like the hulk did it this year find more suitable performers a really good writer and most of all someone who truly <UNK> what good movies are about
<START> ugly heartless hollywood crap that expects nothing but <UNK> and from its audience the scenes without spacey reveal how truly awful the film really is but the scenes with spacey are just so entertaining that you hang on in there right to the end yes he could play this part in his sleep but he does it so well he's such a joy to watch so believable and <UNK> monstrous enjoy it for his performance but don't expect anything else from this movie if you want to see a great film about the <UNK> of modern hollywood check out robert altman's the player this sad little <UNK> is not remotely in the same league
<START> when i first saw this movie i was only a little kid and i fell in love with it they really don't make movies like this anymore i just watch this again now slightly older and still love it br br the humour is perfect and fits into the movie really well all the gags are kind of childish but will make adults laugh as well and in a kids movie is really very rare br br the animation is amazing and to watch hand drawn animation is a real breath of fresh air to all the computer animation we see today the backgrounds are stunning and the <UNK> is amazing br br the characters are just the kind of characters that you fall in love with the moment you start watching girls will think the <UNK> are adorable and guys will think the are really kinda sexy br br the songs are fun to listen too and some just really make you wanna cry or get up and dance its also fun to watch visual humor to go along with them br br the voice acting is great no doubt even if most of the voice acting is high pitch but an interesting thing popped up and it one of the songs from this movie but the <UNK> down to show the real voices behind them and its really kinda fun to watch br br if you see this movie in a store or somewhere to rent i say check it out it's really worth seeing and is a perfect family movie its absolutely amazing words can not express this movie

decoration black and white and elmer <UNK> for best music <UNK> of a dramatic or comedy picture indeed elmer <UNK> made a name for himself with his <UNK> score the producers had thought about casting marlon brando in the title role but sinatra beat brando to the punch <UNK> parker kim novak arnold darren <UNK> and robert <UNK> co starred with <UNK> blue eyes <UNK> was particularly memorable as a sleazy heroin dealer while <UNK> parker played the <UNK> wife with a dark deep secret of her own that comes as quite a shock br br the man with the golden arm refers to protagonist frankie ability to

out and his apartment for the heroin br br preminger pulls no punches in the man with the golden arm and the film is pretty <UNK> none of the characters here are remotely sympathetic essentially they are either <UNK> or <UNK> sinatra gives another dynamite performance as does <UNK> and parker to be sure the man with the golden arm has lost much of its impact in the <UNK> 50 or more years but it still ranks as a landmark film
<START> the story overall though quite graphic is actually decent and reasonably interesting to readers however the movie was absolutely dreadful the story was good but the acting was terrible i was crying the whole time because i knew i could never get my spent time back don't see this movie if you do bring a pistol with a bullet in it and a few bullets if you're going with friends i feel sorry for everybody who had anything to do with this film i also feel sorry for everybody who had to watch the film avoid this film at all costs and if your mother forces you to watch kill her <UNK> see i'm a psycho now turned me into a psycho
<START> i can understand why others <UNK> rather <UNK> towards the climax <UNK> a twist that really is hard to take seriously i think though that the build up to it works rather well the music quite menacing and spine <UNK> really provides a spooky aura matching the <UNK> sound of a constant <UNK> <UNK> that is driving struggling english actress joan <UNK> jean <UNK> <UNK> she's <UNK> a <UNK> nice apartment while attempting to jump start her career in new york city the city buildings outside the window look about as realistic as david <UNK> and is <UNK> welcome by a <UNK> <UNK> which rings quite a bit followed by loud <UNK> against the wall searching for answers regarding the one responsible for such disregard towards her sanity joan discovers that no one <UNK> that room and that a former tenant had in fact <UNK> herself without help from the manager joan will decide to find out for herself who is causing her such anguish joan discovers the room empty and the phone with a particular female voice which will haunt her br br the episode i think is a tour de force for jean <UNK> who is a one woman show she's the only actress visible and we follow her through the crisis which slowly <UNK> her the phone and the <UNK> from that other room causing her much distress which grows into fear instead of leaving joan remains so <UNK> by the noise and to the breaking point where she just wishes for the phone or whoever is <UNK> to stop the episode provides a possible answer as to who is <UNK> joan and why a character named beth comes into the story rather late as joan struggles to find out whose female voice it was across the other line who knew her name on that <UNK> phone she discovers in the room across from hers the fate of beth might just tell the viewer why joan is being traumatized i think this episode is an exercise in <UNK> instead of credibility some didn't particularly like it but i certainly did i will admit that the phone as a physical menace <UNK> towards joan is hard to take seriously not to mention it's attack on her but i thought the intense opening twenty minutes before this were suitably chilling enough to make up for it
<START> plot in a nutshell dave <UNK> father figure manager of the <UNK> brothers alvin simon theodore has gone off to europe on a business trip leaving the boys at home with miss miller as their watcher much to the <UNK> of alvin who wanted to go to europe while playing against his female counterpart <UNK> the leader of the comprised of her younger sisters <UNK> the female counterpart of simon and <UNK> the female counterpart of theodore in a fierce <UNK> game of around the world in 30 days they catch the attention of two evil foreign siblings who need to <UNK> money <UNK> around the world but need a way to do it that won't draw the attention of their arch enemy <UNK> the 2 evil siblings <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the banter between alvin <UNK> and decide to use them as the delivery boys girls for their <UNK> more <UNK> idea than the latter initially objects feeling that it's too dangerous for children the 2 siblings make an offer to the boys girls travel via air <UNK> to 12 drop off points to leave dolls which resemble the kids that contain <UNK> and or money to indicate their arrival with the promise that whoever wins the race will get an obscene amount of money but as the two different set of talking animal siblings make their rounds they are stalked by the henchmen of <UNK> but who is <UNK> is he friend or <UNK> br br overall enjoyable lighthearted farce based on the 1980s tv series version of alvin the <UNK> beautiful animation is a highlight lacks the crude humor that keeps <UNK> into today's family films and engaging songs boys girls of rock roll being a stand out eagle eyed fans will probably notice that character design has been <UNK> from the animated series giving her a less round face while adding a seemingly permanent <UNK> to <UNK> which <UNK> <UNK> also display br br keep an ear out for nancy <UNK> the voice of bart simpson
<START> one of the most boring movies i've ever had to sit through it's completely formulaic just a cookie <UNK> of a movie you could predict about every scene in the movie just from knowing the genre as this movie adds nothing new the dialogue is never funny interesting or intelligent the acting is weak and the soundtrack is annoying basically everything looks to have been done by an <UNK> filmmaker nothing fresh memorable or entertaining in this movie combined with the fact that it is long gives it an easy thumbs down sorry fans br br overall grade f
<START> i watched this film with a bunch of friends at a halloween party last night i got to say that the sarcastic comments were never ending and i have to say that they were well deserved though i felt that the directing was done well the <UNK> in their dialogue is just a little too much cheese i think i got about an hour into this before i even started to realize what it was the point was that they were trying to drive home you catch on pretty quick that this whole family is pretty quirky and something is off about them it's just a little too slow this movie could easily have been about 45 minutes and been a lot better the only thing that made it bearable was the two <UNK> of wine that i <UNK> during the course of the flick bring on the slasher films folks because at least i know what to expect out of them this was not my thing too much dark humour and the subject material of <UNK> was a bit explicit and gross i have to say that randy quaid played the part as well as it could have been and i will give him props for that as i normally see him as a drunken <UNK> or a washed out fighter pilot who likes to kill aliens br br in conclusion i give this horror comedy film a very generous 3 out of 10
<START> exceptional movie that handles a theme of great proportions with a very well balanced direction was a very good director at least from what i can tell from this movie and murder my sweet but he was seriously affected by the <UNK> as other movie directors and actors it is in a way ironic that <UNK> received no oscars because it is exquisite example of how to make a great film on low budget everything about this movie is exceptional a well written script that makes use of extensive flashbacks a great cast superb lighting that seems to tell the story more than the actions proper what more can you expect from a top notch movie might i add that noir is here used for its <UNK> and i might add financial <UNK> but this proves once more that what was originally deemed a b movie can have more impact today that most of the heavy handed a movies that lost their audience with the passage of time br br this film is not a noir movie per se and this rises serious questions about what noir actually is the style is definitely noir in terms of sets and especially lights but the theme surpasses the recipe of the noir genre you can see things from the opposite perspective and claim that anti <UNK> is only a <UNK> for the criminal investigation the puzzle around the murder being the actual focus this would have been the case had it not been for robert ryan in an outstanding performance either way the movie has a lot to offer and it is truly a pity that the director had to suffer so much <UNK> for his former beliefs in a really noir period of america
<START> this movie made my face hurt i don't understand it things just happened inexplicably and they usually resulted in someone <UNK> into a song and dance number i don't understand how people can <UNK> this film with praise there are b movies and then there are b musicals and then there is br br the songs made me want to run <UNK> into a wall the only saving grace is that one of the musical explosions turns out to be a musical video which <UNK> the pain yet still fails to justify why it needed to exist the most frightening section of the film is toni creep dance that <UNK> her weird song but on the bright side she can manages to find the notes that she is looking for unlike pop music <UNK> aka and <UNK> wow can we say tone deaf so if you want to question life for about 90 minutes see this film if you hate your life then buy it
<START> every year there's one can't miss much anticipated red hot big budget title with the right combination of star director and subject matter that fails miserably at the box office this year it was superman returns in 1982 it was blade runner in 1957 it was billy <UNK> the spirit of st louis a film that had everything top director huge star best selling true story about an american hero except enough of an audience to cover its costs maybe the public still remembered lucky <UNK> anti <UNK> and his loud admiration for nazi <UNK> achievements before the war neither covered in the film which ends with his arrival in paris before the legend got too <UNK> maybe because they thought they knew the story or that it was just going to be one guy stuck in a <UNK> for two hours certainly wilder and co writer <UNK> are aware of the dramatic <UNK> of relatively <UNK> flight <UNK> between a well executed flashback structure to key points in his life and the build up to the flight itself once the film is <UNK> it's both surprising and suspenseful finding genuine drama in his attempts to stay awake and to <UNK> without proper <UNK> br br it also builds up a quite remarkable sense of dread that's unlike anything else in <UNK> filmography allied to a real sense of the epic shots like the ominous storm clouds over the <UNK> the dark dawn before the flight carry a real chill of foreboding to them even the typically muted and <UNK> <UNK> adds to the film rather than <UNK> from it along with the superb use of <UNK> there's a remarkable score from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but filled with understated menace and cleverly used as part of the fabric of the film rather than mere musical <UNK> the film does lose points for <UNK> though never actually saying outright that this was a race to be the first to fly the atlantic in fact <UNK> was the third man to fly across the atlantic after almost completely forgotten brits and <UNK> astonishing flight eight years earlier but it's still a remarkably tense and engrossing adventure story that deserved the success it never found
<START> i'm a fan of the 1950's original and about 20 minutes into this remake i started to think this was going to be as good as the original but it wasn't the motive for the murders was incredibly stupid two of the lovers in the movie turn out to be brother and sister excuse me while i <UNK> the main character stops in the middle of the movie to have sex which doesn't make sense considering the situation he's in if the film makers wanted a sex scene they should have put it earlier in the movie before the main character <UNK> played by dennis quaid found he's about to die and that he's accused of a crime there is a reason for where the sex scene is at early in the movie <UNK> isn't living life to the <UNK> so he's not interested in sleeping with meg ryan i still feel it would make more sense for the sex scene to have either been cut or earlier in the film and the two siblings not to have been lovers br br one of the dumbest parts of the movie involves a gun fight a couple people getting killed and one person being run over all within 15 <UNK> of a crowded carnival and yet nobody at the carnival notices also in the scene is the <UNK> <UNK> the university where the movie takes place is built on if you fall into the <UNK> you sink to the bottom and in a matter of seconds not only is it hard to believe stuff would sink that fast in <UNK> but more importantly who builds a university on <UNK> <UNK> i would say more about how stupid the end of the movie is but i don't want to put a spoiler in my post
<START> i caught a screening of this at the true false documentary film festival in columbia <UNK> and i was pretty disappointed i was expecting a cool documentary into the protest and <UNK> surrounding the but what i got was a largely flawed bad acted <UNK> conspiracy ridden badly woven tale i'd heard of its neo documentary technique <UNK> both true and false but i expected more along the lines of a <UNK> storyline developed for a better <UNK> and to create a sense of <UNK> between real interviews but it was more along the lines of a terrible made for conspiracy theory tv movie br br the acting overall is terrible except for which is not surprising considering the director at the screening said most of the lead characters had no acting training his excuse being that he wanted them to be real <UNK> a hint real people can't act but actors can usually act real br br it would of been not so <UNK> offensive if it wasn't blatantly obvious about how keen he was to push this extremely radical conspiracy theory onto us throughout the whole movie its especially hysterical when we get a scene where the director cameos and starts <UNK> on about ridiculously stupid theories and secret <UNK> the movie also does a good job of laughably stereotyping every single role it tries so hard to <UNK> these street <UNK> and <UNK> a big <UNK> or <UNK> on every character br br skip it maybe find yourself a nice real documentary
<START> i must confess i was surprised at how good this movie was when i first watched it i had planned to see it in theaters during the summer but found out <UNK> that it had already been and gone therefore i expected it to have been removed from theaters because it was bad then today i rented it and watched it and really enjoyed it the speed that events were occurring was questionable it could have been a little longer i found it was very true to the book however it left out some crucial parts <UNK> real name etc i felt as if i hadn't read the book i wouldn't have really understand what was going on the acting was quite good another thing i had expected to be poor however the cop sorry i can't remember the actor's name could have done a little better all in all i found this to be a very entertaining movie and would recommend it to all audiences
<START> a mexican outlaw <UNK> steals gold from a <UNK> along with some other <UNK> and americans the americans double cross the <UNK> and leave them all for dead the one outlaw survives and looks for revenge in this film that has jack all to do with the original <UNK> the <UNK> only named it <UNK> kill to squeeze a few more bucks out of more <UNK> people what we have here is a slightly below standard western that's too surreal to be that enjoyable and as such i can't really recommend it to all but the most hardcore western fan br br my grade d br br blue underground dvd extras part of spaghetti western collection uncut <UNK> tell 20 minute documentary poster stills gallery talent <UNK> for <UNK> theatrical trailer br br 3 <UNK> eggs highlight the hidden gun on the extras page for trailers for <UNK> run man run and a man called blade highlight the hand on the main menu to get interviews on the <UNK> of a rock group and a hidden gun in the language subtitles menu leads to the story of how <UNK> almost got killed for being anti communist
<START> yes i am a fan but how many people who watch this movie are not going to be and so i'm reviewing this movie from a fan perspective and with no regret i would not know how to adequately review the movie for someone who has not played the game br br visuals 10 10 i loved <UNK> children it's a <UNK> delight a complete audio video <UNK> the visuals were breathtaking some <UNK> were accomplished that i would simply have not quite thought possible with an animated feature when the action scenes came about they were for lack of a more accurate word a roller coaster with dramatic camera movement sweeping across from range to range to <UNK> integrated bullet time effects at the crucial moments to the sheer level of detail it's all hard to fault the animation looks big budget the style and imagery is awesome and the effects at times made me forget that i was watching animation rather than live action footage i could <UNK> on for hours repeating myself on the fantastic quality of the visuals but it simply wouldn't do it any justice br br sound 10 10 the sound was fabulous the voices for all the characters didn't disappoint no one sounded silly and the sound effects were bold and sharp the music from the game that in my opinion had the best game soundtrack ever <UNK> beautifully to the movie most of the memorable themes from the game are present in the movie albeit often using different <UNK> to fit in better with what's going on there was some <UNK> rock and slight <UNK> metal music over the really intense action scenes from time to time but it all <UNK> in well with the movie's situation at the <UNK> time br br story 7 10 the story and characters would be the main flaws of the movie both aspects were simply not up to par with the game but then again the game could spend 40 hours developing these points the movie only has about 90 minutes as far as the story goes the plot wasn't bad or anything but just not as ambitious as was expected from someone who played the game through in effect the plot seemed rather weak in comparison the game was so <UNK> with the intricate plot twists and story progression development that the movie never really stood a chance to compete in the same league instead the movie took the more sensible approach to expand on the action and try to place as many inside jokes and themes into itself instead of trying to <UNK> recreate the massive story factor which was originally such a driving force in the game the lack of usage also caused me some controversy the story of the movie chose to use little though not zero and instead lots of supernatural fighting ability and skill i would hope that if a sequel was made it would <UNK> much much more <UNK> and importantly into the film there were also many plot holes in the movie all which can be forgiven if you think of <UNK> children as a random anime but seem ridiculous when you realise how it was based on a game that executed plot tremendously well br br characters 7 10 the characters whilst all being present in one form or another don't necessarily shine to their true potential there simply isn't really enough movie time to spend with all of them and so all of their background stories and abilities are not entirely <UNK> and in some cases barely at all red and <UNK> <UNK> leave absolutely no real lasting impressions even cloud who is the <UNK> point of the movie i feel doesn't use enough of his familiar abilities from the game the issue is a strong reason for this with that said it's a joy to see the cast back in action even if it's in such a role that doesn't <UNK> them to their <UNK> the new characters were the ones that caused me most of the <UNK> however the bad guy trio and the kid dude denzel there was a huge lack of explanation about any of them anyone willing to use their imagination can probably fill in the <UNK> with something reasonable and be done with it but <UNK> speaking the issue is still there to be commented on and is therefore a little disappointing br br value 10 10 the replay value for this movie is excellent i personally want to watch it again in a more bigger and <UNK> way bigger screen <UNK> volume br br enjoyment 10 10 whatever the flaws of the movie they simply weren't big enough to <UNK> my enjoyment of it and i honestly think that will be the same case for most people i enjoyed <UNK> children tremendously and encourage fellow fans to go see it
<START> great adaptation of the christie novel surprising attention to authentic period details for the time many films of the mid 1970s early 80s that try to do 1920s early 30s look far too mid 70s early 80s for my liking so expected the worst here and was gladly proved wrong the costumes and sets are very well done i liked this production very much  largely due to the adorable <UNK> <UNK> portrayal of a <UNK> bright young lady frankie and james charming <UNK> the pair would go on to portray <UNK> tommy which is funny as some contemporary book critics compared frankie and bobby to her earlier characters of tommy the supporting characters were equally well done  the over the top mrs acted by miss <UNK> to be joan h and <UNK> is played perfectly as the post wwi <UNK> <UNK> type
<START> the problem with the film is quite simply this <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> and cannot be adapted to a movie <UNK> narration in the <UNK> <UNK> you from the first sentence and you only see what conrad writes about in movie it's different you see the visual but the description and reflection that really makes the novel is <UNK> missing but as far as an <UNK> book has been adapted it is of good standard there are the exact same scenes which are quite but they never have the same affect as in the novel the plot in the movie has been enhanced and it works very well to make it more interesting the references to ancient egypt were <UNK> inserted my tip read the book and keep it that way there are better movies out there
<START> i really enjoyed this film it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat it was very well directed i think it was important that they showed the other <UNK> life as well as terry and and show them as people with emotions as this film needed to show bobby as a cold and <UNK> person br br i agree with another review it was sick love not true love he didn't need to go to great <UNK> as murder to give his wife a baby he should have been honest with her and told her that he was <UNK> and decide to adopt a baby together some reviews say that she was naive i think she was when it came to the <UNK> however best actors all round great movie to watch
<START> to remake lost horizon as a musical the need for a <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> lowe type musical composition was needed burt <UNK> and hal david were the wrong choice having said that my favorite thing about lost horizon is its score it's just that the score doesn't fit the piece the cast is made up of mostly non musical talents <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> were all dubbed and still don't sound all that great br br frankly the <UNK> on which this and the earlier non musical film versions were based is mediocre at best while the possibilities for a truly good cinematic musical version exist they are not realized here the film succeeds at being a good rainy day vehicle to pass the time otherwise you are better off buying the cd of its soundtrack only recommended as a curiosity piece due to the film's awful reputation i've seen much better but i've seen much worse
<START> this great tv movie told of the 1975 murder of martha in <UNK> <UNK> by a nephew of <UNK> kennedy the use of the ghost of martha to provide some of the details was very effective and added a lot of heart to the story christopher <UNK> seemed to capture the personality of mark very well who got so much <UNK> bad publicity in the o j simpson trial has certainly <UNK> himself by his contribution of bringing the killer to justice after about 27 years
<START> screen treatment of the comedic broadway success the gay divorce a title which was considered too <UNK> for american <UNK> though it was used in the u k concerns a man and woman fred astaire and ginger rogers meeting under embarrassing circumstances while she's in the process of <UNK> her <UNK> they dance argue make up dance argue some more and dance some more betty <UNK> is very appealing in a brief bit singing and dancing in the number let's k k with overtly edward everett <UNK> but the star couple looks <UNK> and unhappy throughout the surroundings are screwball sophisticated yet the characters are not more than one dimensional 1 2 from
<START> is a visually astounding film however i felt as if some of the story line may have been sacrificed there is hardly any character development which left me feeling personally detached from the film which is ironic because all <UNK> aside this film really does draw you in with its many slight spiral effects and stunning scene transitions at first the overall cinematography threw me off but as you get used to the overall appearance you start to see the beauty in this twisted film this is a great movie if you are looking for a <UNK> with out too much substance or deeper meaning it is a great horror film that is not actually scary or suspenseful but somehow eerie
<START> this is a documentary unlike any other it has so many layers and shows us so much that trying to analyze it all at once is nearly impossible <UNK> william <UNK> shows us the process of film making from a different perspective we see the struggles of the actors the director the sound crew and everybody else trying to hang in there and make this film successful if this was just about a movie being made it would be ordinary what <UNK> does is make it more complex by having a crew film the actors and then this will be filmed by another crew only to have another crew film the whole thing three cameras each with a different goal it has an almost <UNK> affect on you but at the same time is exciting i like the parts where the crew <UNK> together and <UNK> what is going on even they are somewhat in the dark as to what <UNK> is trying to do half see this as an experiment while the other half sees it as a chaotic and confusing failure no matter what side you choose you can't argue that <UNK> doesn't get you involved in this process
<START> bad dialog slow story scenes that drag on and are absolutely pointless i can't believe this much money was invested in such a poorly written film the directing and acting couldn't save this bomb either br br 50 through the movie and you're still waiting for it to start they lay the foundation with the opening <UNK> and then spend the next 40 minutes setting up nothing you watch 40 minutes of footage that is absolutely <UNK> in an attempt to do what i have no idea br br much of this film is like watching a really bad french movie where nothing ever happens and the characters are just sort of dull lifeless and living without purpose or care br br avoid this film at all cost anyone that <UNK> it is setting you up for disappointment and you will undoubtedly question their taste and depth
<START> a totally pathetic attempt at movie about sacrifices of australian soldiers during the new guinea campaign total waste of money even if you only see it on dvd thankfully the video store provided a free weekly hire with the dvd else it would have been a complete waste of money probably made by arty types and full of the symbolism that today's <UNK> seem so into frankly this movie is an insult to the memory of the brave <UNK> that never came back somebody please provide the funding to make a decent movie at least the equal of saving private ryan hopefully the will put as much distance between itself and this movie as possible the story needs to be told from all sides the <UNK> the locals the japanese although getting the latter to tell the truth about anything that happened during the second world war is highly unlikely basically its rubbish don't see it don't buy it walk away
<START> this film is all right fairly silly and to be taken lightly but what i can't stand are the numerous heroes and that boy's sentimental comment near the end look they all look the same isn't that by far passing the good taste standards i thought it was revolting as were the heroic <UNK> acts by some of the people in this film i'm not saying it won't happen like that but <UNK> in on all the bravery like that makes my stomach <UNK>
<START> something strange is happening in remote areas of the <UNK> an air force weather station is found <UNK> its <UNK> missing an <UNK> village is destroyed a fishing <UNK> disappears curious are found in the snow a four foot piece of a living <UNK> is found near a destroyed airplane the piece looks like half of the claw of a giant <UNK> <UNK> the military craig stevens as an air force officer and its experts are <UNK> a distinguished scientist william hopper and his pretty assistant <UNK> are called in from new york hopper <UNK> from this flimsy evidence that they are dealing with a monstrous praying <UNK> he's right the pretty assistant happens to look out the window of the office and sees the hideous face with its <UNK> <UNK> staring in at her she drops what she's carrying her hands to her <UNK> and screams in horror br br the <UNK> begins flying south along the <UNK> stream <UNK> now and again to attack major population centers like washington and new york to <UNK> <UNK> and eat people military weapons don't affect it much but finally stevens crashes into it in his jet fighter and <UNK> <UNK> the beast which comes to earth and <UNK> the manhattan tunnel <UNK> new york and new jersey br br stevens having survived the <UNK> leads his team into the tunnel and kills the big bug with mines despite its fierce appearance threatening behavior and earth shattering <UNK> stevens and kiss in front of the body while hopper chuckles and takes their picture br br ho hum br br like the deadly <UNK> itself the formula by this time was <UNK> and <UNK> for air <UNK> around seeking as its prey not human beings but anything at all in the way of a fresh or original idea as it is they overlooked one cliché hopper should have <UNK> had to <UNK> a super <UNK> <UNK> that alone could defeat the <UNK> that's what the mines should have been filled with rather than ordinary explosive br br the model work is pretty good considering what the budget must have been not much money could have been spent on anything else because everything else is pretty routine craig stevens is bland a face and style made for a tv series william hopper looks right tall and silver haired but his <UNK> has only one note the pretty assistant is rather plain considering her role the part calls for joan or laurie nelson they couldn't act either but carried with them slight but distinct of anything would have helped this <UNK> out movie br br i wish the deadly <UNK> hadn't <UNK> so <UNK> and so often because you can't <UNK> you can't even <UNK> if you don't have <UNK> i didn't mind though when the monster met its demise in the tunnel a praying <UNK> is a <UNK> <UNK> in its own <UNK> way and it's great to have them in the garden because they eat and <UNK> but when you get right down to it they aren't really very appealing the male <UNK> is smaller and weaker than the female as in humans and when the couple are just about through <UNK> the female bites the head off the male also as in humans but at least human males know when to stop the male <UNK> keeps on <UNK> for several minutes even though he is now without a head we humans don't have mindless males <UNK> with goal driven females do we
<START> although a woman's story i found this still fairly interesting it is unusual in that is has three real life sisters playing sisters in the movie i am referring to <UNK> <UNK> and lola lane br br why national critics loved this movie was the presence of bad boy rebel john garfield in their twisted liberal dominated minds all american characters are sickening but sour on life poor attitude types like garfield played here are people they can identify with despite that this movie still has an overall feeling of goodness which is why i liked it some of the characters may have done stupid things but they good hearts whose heart was bigger than <UNK> <UNK> lane in here i agree with the imdb user comments critic in here who says this is film as much as the beloved not by me <UNK> br br with a director the caliber of michael <UNK> the film is better than it might have been under someone else <UNK> made sure no scene <UNK> or otherwise went on too long br br in addition to the lane sisters and garfield we have claude <UNK> who adds much needed humor to the story jeffrey <UNK> the main love interest of the girls <UNK> page dick <UNK> frank <UNK> and mae <UNK> br br apparently this movie must have been a hit because there were several spin offs from it neither of them approaching this one in content and box office success
<START> <UNK> miyazaki's magic continues with this absolute crowd <UNK> on the cliff by the sea his latest animated film which turns on the usual <UNK> to charm your <UNK> off i thought that the trailer featured its song which was quietly hypnotic and i didn't have to wait for an invite to make sure i got my ticket for the sneak preview of the movie <UNK> to open here next week br br for fans of studio <UNK> films you'll probably know what you're in for as miyazaki has yet another winner in his filmography that will win new fans over i'm embarrassed to say the least that i've so far watched only my <UNK> <UNK> eyes that pile of <UNK> dvds and love it to bits but i guess this would serve as a final push for me not to continue missing what would likely be animated films that i would enjoy br br voiced by is a magic <UNK> that <UNK> to know what is life beyond the sea with her constant <UNK> in a bubble to the surface of the water to sneak a <UNK> nonetheless these ambitions do not <UNK> well with her <UNK> dad <UNK> who <UNK> some hatred toward the human race for <UNK> and briefly touching a subplot on <UNK> protection revenge by mother nature as well an accident one day sees being washed <UNK> and picked up by five year old boy who lives on a house on the said cliff with his mother lisa <UNK> while dad <UNK> is mostly out to sea since he's a sailor and you can expect some moments of <UNK> to the likes of the little mermaid or <UNK> made for kids saying anything more would be to spoil the fun br br the artwork here is still simply astounding even though it's in <UNK> glory knowing that each cell is <UNK> worked on there are so many things going on at the same time within the same frame that you'll probably be game for repeated viewings just to spot them all this definitely beats any 3d or cg animated production any day given its beauty coming from its simplicity and not only from the artwork department but on its story too despite complaints coming in that it took a <UNK> from the hans christian <UNK> classic while there are <UNK> to make this film extremely dark it only suggested certain dark themes but <UNK> instead for a film with more positive emotions suitable for both kids and adults alike br br at its core its about love that between the family members of <UNK> lisa and and especially between mother and son more so it's about the love between the boy and his new pet fish which he <UNK> and i tell you herself has enough <UNK> in her to beat the likes of <UNK> and eve all hands down characterization here is top notch and it's hard not to fall in love with in <UNK> form adopted especially when she's such a playful being who doesn't hide her emotions if she's upset with you either she turns away or you could expect a jet stream come <UNK> from her mouth into your face br br on the cliff by the sea is a definite <UNK> in to my top films of this year without <UNK> and the next time i go to tokyo i'm sure as hell going to make my way to the <UNK> museum to under the magical world brought to us by <UNK> miyazaki highly recommended film so don't you go missing this on the big screen
<START> i saw this movie on my flight from <UNK> to denver the screen was three <UNK> in front of me and about 12 x 10 so i really wasn't going to watch it but i like malcolm in the middle so i thought i'd watch just a few minutes next thing i know i'm sucked in having a great time and was pleased as how good it was and how fast it seemed to make the time go by i agree with that the acting is very good for this level of entertainment being one of the older baby <UNK> i was also pleased to see lee <UNK> with a role in the movie as with a couple of other actors who were famous yesterday but are out of the spotlight today <UNK> fun at themselves br br it's your basic kid is <UNK> kid gets even and then some and everyone enjoys themselves in the process no heavy thinking no great analysis needed just a good fun way to pass the time br br 3 5 out of 5
<START> hedy <UNK> who may have been kept by more men on screen than any other actress is again the kept mistress of kent taylor society playboy and general all around rat on a boat from the after <UNK> given her the brush she tries suicide but doctor spencer tracy saves her from drowning in the <UNK> br br <UNK> quite the all around medical fellow i guess he never heard the word <UNK> he runs a clinic in manhattan for the poor and his trip was a <UNK> into medical research <UNK> and he marry and she tries to introduce him into her world and he even becomes a partner of society doctor louis <UNK> of course kent taylor <UNK> the picture and the hollywood inevitable happens br br watching i take this woman it seemed to me that the writers were very much influenced by <UNK> oscar winning boys town unfortunately his role as doctor karl <UNK> ain't a <UNK> on what he did as father maybe they were trying to give father a little romance in his life in this film so to speak br br tracy and <UNK> did not get along too well in fact this film was dubbed i <UNK> this woman because the original director joseph von <UNK> walked off the film presumably because <UNK> was not working out for him the way marlene <UNK> did she did lady of the <UNK> and then mgm went back to filming this with their contract director woody van dyke who was known for the speed of his productions and a whole new supporting cast was brought in br br fortunately both <UNK> and hedy had better roles in store for both of them
<START> i cannot understand the need to jump backwards and <UNK> to scene set and pad out the plot showing that someone has a skill right before they use it i believe is <UNK> our intelligence it's starting to feel a little contrived and as though they are making up for being so vague for the first three series a little disappointing this episode br br furthermore using past quirks like <UNK> ability to know when a storm is ending is frankly insulting are we supposed to <UNK> and or laugh at the <UNK> side of locke br br this episode was all over the place
<START> the only positive thing i can think of regarding this utter piece of garbage is that now i finally have a good answer ready if anyone ever asks me what the worst movie i ever saw was called br br it would have taken such little effort to make it more watchable a lot more effort and it could have been brilliant even br br why would anyone want to produce such waste br br i refuse to believe that a director could be so ridiculously <UNK> br br making a completely <UNK> movie must have been the point br br anything else just doesn't make sense
<START> this movie is a story of a catholic nun as an <UNK> of convicted killer on death row the movie describes what she does as a nun who does not have any <UNK> role she might have had doubt in her actual role but eventually she does the role only a nun could do who has nothing but faith in christ in america there are so many movies that describe condemned criminals or <UNK> those scenes especially execution are too much different from japan
<START> this movie is about <UNK> amanda <UNK> and her quest to beat her school <UNK> boys team after they kicked the girls team out so she goes to the rival school and joins the boys team in doing so she falls for duke <UNK> <UNK> who thinks <UNK> a guy and likes olivia laura <UNK> who likes <UNK> as a her brother br br i was in a version of the <UNK> night play and the beginning was very modern so i knew the play well i was very <UNK> about seeing this movie and when i saw it it <UNK> my expectations it kept a lot of my favorite lines and i could see big connections to the play though it was like the play it was not as complicated it was also more of a chick flick than i expected but it was good it was very funny it pulls you into a whole bunch of crazy love stories and lies you saw how <UNK> amanda <UNK> thought wrongly about what guys thought and her complications in living in a guys world you also see her room mate <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> impression of this i really liked seeing the characters being portrayed in a modern way it also tells the modern theme follow your dreams but this time it has a twist i think this movie was a great movie about a girl who loved soccer and stuck up for herself and her family and her dreams i think this movie will be the big break for many raising stars
<START> jim first real movie is quite a delight but don't come in expecting to see ernest p any time soon i felt the wide array of characters <UNK> depicted were great but without being said the rest of the movie should be put into a or something a rather odd beginning for a movie icon
<START> let me start by saying i don't recall laughing once during this comedy from the opening scene our protagonist solo <UNK> <UNK> shows himself to be a self absorbed feeble and neurotic loser completely unable to cope with the smallest <UNK> such as <UNK> a <UNK> keeping his word or <UNK> a coherent thought i guess we're supposed to be drawn to his fragile vulnerability and cheer him on through the process of <UNK> his way out of a deep depression i guess we're supposed to sympathize as he stumbles through a series of <UNK> seemingly <UNK> by his purchase of a dog but in reality brought on by his own <UNK> nature i didn't get the slightest hint at any point that solo ever possessed any redeeming character which became <UNK> apparent when he failed to feed his dog for a few days no spark of humanity or <UNK> of conscience gave me hope that he would ever realize his life is so utterly miserable because he's a self absorbed self <UNK> <UNK> i didn't develop any connection with this character he didn't seem to care and so neither did i i actually wanted him to get his <UNK> <UNK> at one point br br the dog was not a character in the film it was simply a prop to be used neglected <UNK> abused <UNK> and <UNK> of on a <UNK> so be warned even though dog is in the title this film is not a romantic comedy for dog lovers br br scott <UNK> role is amusing and believable as the <UNK> best friend <UNK> don cheadle is sincere and <UNK> i always want to see more of him on screen <UNK> <UNK> was delightfully <UNK> <UNK> collins role of a stripper with a heart was well acted but the character was simultaneously absurd and clichéd not to mention there was zero chemistry between her and <UNK> br br romantic hardly comedy if you say so
<START> pun intended this low budget action horror vehicle for don <UNK> ability to kick things is the stuff direct to video fare is made of br br the plot wilson is a <UNK> vampire hunter who comes under fire from local law <UNK> after he is forced to slaughter creatures of the night in view of the public police chase him vampires chase him he responds by kicking a lot br br there is a little more to the story but it is so <UNK> that i honestly can't remember it i think people actually spoke in the movie but that's up to debate the plot is nothing more than a set up for wilson to kill as many vampires as possible in the running time usually by kicking them br br the technical <UNK> are in a word <UNK> little color treating amateurish use of lighting simplistic use of camera and angle blood and gore is <UNK> limited odd for this type of film the most <UNK> of the filming foul ups is the jarring shift to super shaky <UNK> during each and every fight scene if the camera begins to <UNK> around like a reese monkey on speed then you know don is about to start kicking everything in sight br br all in all this is the kind of bad movie that can be made good with a few friends and a lot of cynical humor otherwise do not watch unless you really like to watch things get kicked br br 3 10
<START> i've already commented on this film under the name but i see there are others who have commented since all i can say is what the f k i cannot believe that a whole 16 people have commented on this film or even seen this movie add to that the fact that a couple give it great reviews probably the makers of the film who went to one of those places in a strip mall that provide internet service and wrote a good review seeing as how there is no way they could or would pay for their own internet <UNK> just look at their movie although i still admit i got a soft spot for this movie i thought that some of the other people writing about this one might have it confused with another until i read the reviews especially the person who identified the tag line on the front of the box the ultimate in frontal <UNK> what the f k is that supposed to mean anyway frontal <UNK> i totally forgot about that until i read it in the review people we are a <UNK> few i say we meet once a year to view this film wait does anyone still have it if anyone does have it please contact me i'm to get drunk
<START> poor casper van <UNK> his career has <UNK> a long way from tarzan and starship troopers br br in <UNK> he's a policeman who just happens to be dating tv reporter <UNK> von and her brother is a scientist who's trying to deal with a <UNK> comment headed for earth but in the runaway <UNK> business even a near miss causes some real problems as the <UNK> <UNK> goes out of <UNK> br br from the survival of the earth we go to the survival of van <UNK> and his immediate family his daughter's <UNK> boyfriend ryan <UNK> actually proves to be of some use especially when he suspects a guy he knows as a crooked cop might mean the van <UNK> group a lot of harm br br my only question here is why didn't they have bruce willis billy bob <UNK> and the rest of that crew to deal with the nasty <UNK> br br pass this one up folks
<START> for a movie that was the most seen in its native south korea for most of 2004 it was a huge disappointment shows that hollywood is not the only place where people can make over emotional melodramatic movies the film was over <UNK> minutes long but not a lot actually happened and everything that happened was pretty much what one expected the plot was that transparent granted if one himself was korean one would perhaps get into it more but for me it didn't do much anything suffice to say that as the case tends to be with korean cinema the plot revolves around the relationship between the northern and southern parts of the <UNK> south korea decides to <UNK> and train an elite assassination squad from death sentence prisoners to kill kim <UNK> sung br br a tedious plot doesn't bother me much if the characters are good but unfortunately that is not the case this time around either they are stereotypes and most of the acting is mediocre and too often just over the top as it tends to be in korean cinema too much time is spent on the numerous montages and the characters remain distant one dimensional cardboard cuts they should've spent more time establishing the characters and less showing us how tough and cruel the training and the soldiers are br br one thing it does remind us of is that a lesser of two <UNK> is still wrong
<START> taut and <UNK> gripping edward <UNK> is a distinctive suspense thriller an unlikely message movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle br br in washington <UNK> a company of soldiers cope with their by hanging out in bars three of them end up at a <UNK> apartment where robert ryan drunk and <UNK> beats their host sam <UNK> to death because he happens to be jewish police detective robert young <UNK> with the help of robert mitchum who's assigned to <UNK> outfit suspicion falls on the second of the three george cooper who has <UNK> ryan <UNK> the third buddy steve <UNK> to <UNK> his silence before young <UNK> in br br <UNK> by a superior script by john paxton draws precise performances from his three starring <UNK> ryan naturally does his <UNK> angry white male and to the <UNK> while mitchum <UNK> with his characteristic alert <UNK> his role however is not central young may never have been better gloria <UNK> gives her first fully <UNK> rendition of the smart mouthed vulnerable tramp and as a sad sack who's <UNK> into her life paul kelly <UNK> us in a small <UNK> role that he makes memorable br br the politically engaged perhaps inevitably <UNK> to <UNK> but it's pretty much confined to <UNK> <UNK> of how his irish grandfather died at the hands of <UNK> a century earlier thus incidentally <UNK> <UNK> to the limit at least there's no attempt to render an explanation however <UNK> of why ryan hates jews and <UNK> and br br curiously <UNK> survives even the major change <UNK> upon it the novel it's based on richard <UNK> the brick <UNK> dealt with a gay bashing murder but homosexuality in <UNK> was still beyond the pale news of the holocaust had however begun to emerge from the <UNK> of europe so hollywood felt <UNK> to register its protest against anti <UNK> the studios always at the <UNK> of <UNK> any potential ticket <UNK> br br but while the change from <UNK> to anti <UNK> works in general the <UNK> don't fit so smoothly the <UNK> <UNK> up a <UNK> drunk young soldier then <UNK> him back home looks odd even though or especially since there's a girlfriend in <UNK> it raises the question whether this scenario was <UNK> inadvertently or left in as a <UNK> tip off to the original engine <UNK> <UNK> murderous rage
<START> despite its many faults 1995 version of <UNK> travels is still the finest adaptation of jonathan <UNK> satirical classic largely because it not only includes all of <UNK> many travels but also includes the satire that's often overlooked unfortunately the twin problems of the <UNK> highly episodic structure and a television budget even a fairly lavish one remain the book is a somewhat rambling collection of tales moving simply from one surreal landscape to another but simon moore's adaptation tries to <UNK> some order on the chaos by providing a parallel plot that sees <UNK> returned to england clearly deeply <UNK> and trying to prove his way out of the insane asylum where the rival for his wife's affections has had him committed the england scenes at once mirror and comment on the travels elements of which occasionally <UNK> over into the real world the trouble is that for the first hour or so it acts more as a distraction constantly pulling you away from the story just as it starts to get interesting the scenes suffer worse here with the feeling that the home scenes are too often designed to save them from filming the more expensive <UNK> this has to be the only version where we don't see <UNK> pulling the fleet behind him br br yet once <UNK> makes his escape the tone becomes more consistent as he finds his situation <UNK> and himself the pet of the giants of the of a guest of the wise men of the floating island of laputa who are so <UNK> in science that they have no common sense left the guest prisoner of a <UNK> who <UNK> history directly from the source offered <UNK> with all it's terrible consequences before finally finding a world he wants to belong if only he can convince the sublime talking horses the that he's not an <UNK> <UNK> each new destination convincing him of what an absurd and petty species humanity is for the most part it's a darker set of travels than expected with only <UNK> curiosity and <UNK> and disappointment keeping it from <UNK> into <UNK> <UNK> and even this is <UNK> by the scenes in the asylum where it becomes more obvious that even if he is telling the truth it may well have driven him genuinely insane it's in these latter scenes that ted <UNK> really shines never more so than in an extraordinary speech where he turns his trial into a disappointed judgment on the whole human race br br being made for television the <UNK> are rather less literally <UNK> here than on the page but for the most part this is a more adult treatment than you might expect with no real <UNK> down the star cast is certainly impressive and for the most part well used if somewhat briefly in a few cases mary <UNK> james fox peter o'toole edward <UNK> omar <UNK> <UNK> kapoor edward fox ned beatty <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> scott thomas and isabelle <UNK> among them it's hard to imagine the upcoming jack black version even coming close to being a <UNK> as impressive as this
<START> my first review at imdb after a few years of using this site constantly br br anyways saw this on the tube the other night loved it it's in the mindset of a dangerous minds or a substitute but much better was sure for a moment that rex was <UNK> in waking life but after checking it doesn't seem so br br i can see why many have problems with this plot and its poetry but i also think these people are close minded admittedly the ending wasn't quite what i was hoping for but overall it was so unique and well acted i can't complain i wouldn't call this cheesy as one reviewer did it pulled off the scene better than most films of the 80's did and they <UNK> from playing any really 80's music br br can't remember everything that made me smile when i saw this but basically it realistically showed very creative individuals surrounded by mediocrity and whether i share <UNK> beliefs or not i love original attempts to describe the meaning of life and his mutant theory is to my knowledge original he <UNK> a lot as well but they showed how confused he was at times and why he might have some psychological issues and then in his moments of clarity he was a <UNK> <UNK> a person who noticed the little details in life and tried to give expression to them br br also i was very impressed with john savage as the teacher usually actors fail at that role he pulled it off brilliantly br br if you enjoyed waking life i say watch this movie if you get a chance br br 9 5 10 br br
<START> the bottom line is if you come looking for a sci fi thriller horror film the matrix is what you'll like if like me you long for the rare true science fiction film involving characters with depth and provocative thought about where science will take us then you need to see
<START> i pretty much liked every character on this show from the start except <UNK> herself she comes off as an <UNK> than <UNK> type and quite frankly a big bully and that stinks because she is in every scene and every episode in the later seasons van becomes unlikeable too like a spoof of his former self and <UNK> walks around <UNK> and being miserable the first 3 to 4 seasons are pretty good if you overlook <UNK> towards the end its pretty bleak in basically every episode barbara jean is walking around being dumb <UNK> is being mean to her but poor <UNK> barbara jean desperately wants <UNK> to like her which results in jean telling <UNK> how awesome she is in every episode i think it is pretty clear to see <UNK> has self <UNK> issues and wants to be seen as this all <UNK> saint its really a shame too because other than her the show had such potential
<START> contribution to the world of cinema has to be searched with a <UNK> and then when if something is found by sheer chance and lots of luck it has to be <UNK> with a <UNK> br br and after it has been <UNK> it would get <UNK> into the <UNK> rubbish bin for totally useless things one single <UNK> of that <UNK> is worth all of his movies combined br br <UNK> is campy and intentionally so the usual stuff comic strip dialogue simplistic plot cheerful characters chewing <UNK> pop overacting etc waters knows that he is of making a movie of quality so he hides behind the mask of the intentionally cheesy film maker which supposedly makes him a special kind of anti artist but in the world of cinema being an anti talent often gets mistaken for talent which is exactly what waters had hoped for and eventually got it's a con act <UNK> <UNK> the world of cinema and modern pop art it's a plague br br perhaps we have john waters to blame for inspiring <UNK> to make all those horrible dumb <UNK> it's like a virus one waters creates five new bad directors and then these five each create more and so on where will it end with dancer in the dark can that bomb actually be topped
<START> this is my favourite kung fu movie it has a very authentic <UNK> seasoned by an eerie music score of tradition chinese <UNK> i think and some wonderfully over acted melodramatic moments <UNK> by heavily affected comedy indeed while attempting to create their own western i e cowboy film genre the chinese <UNK> a whole new animal marked by kung fu fighting and its associated sound effects br br the story of five fingers of death is simple a story of revenge for killing a loved one and the pursuit of the main character to master the iron fist technique that will <UNK> him to <UNK> holy vengeance on his enemies there is even a love interest though the awkward polite kind found in most chinese films of the period the end result however is great and much more authentic than any bruce lee movie
<START> this is absolutely one of our favourites of 2007 br br the tale of two boys who come from different worlds but are as close as brothers is brilliantly told br br beautifully shot and scripted from childhood to the <UNK> it never <UNK> br br a brilliant insight into a lost culture and a very good way to understand <UNK> cultures and traditions this is also an exceptional tale in its own right it is both compassionate and thrilling uplifting and filled with immense sorrow <UNK> and depressing br br with excellent performances from the cast and great technical skills behind the camera this really is film at its best br br highest recommendation a real slice of life that and informs
<START> now i like the bollywood films and i'm very glad they have recently gained success in the uk however latest effort is a deeply flawed film from start to finish br br the idea of a modern bollywood take on <UNK> was quite an exciting one that is until the two supposed appear on the scene looking as if they have never touched a piece of <UNK> in their lives <UNK> is a very good looking man and the film plays to his <UNK> sensibilities but he is never once believable as a modern <UNK> in terms of acting all he can do is stand there and <UNK> his expressions hair and clothes all look the same throughout including the scene where he is supposedly when in fact he appears to have nothing but a slight <UNK> bobby <UNK> playing the role does his best to <UNK> up what little wooden script there is but alas just comes across as a little bit angry when he is supposed to be <UNK> with jealousy br br bollywood films are widely renowned for their stunning set pieces and colour schemes but looks like a drab bbc drama <UNK> in fact the closest thing comes to is <UNK> as it blatantly hides a really bad script behind beautiful people looking well beautiful he has yet to reach mediocrity the same could be said for the totally <UNK> songs br br in short latest offering has no boom bang <UNK> or <UNK> instead it merely <UNK> along with its head held low hoping to catch your attention with a soft tap on the shoulder and that is not good enough at all
<START> now i like victor herbert and i like mary martin and allan jones but it would have been nice to see a real biography of victor herbert walter connolly as herbert does have a decent resemblance to him in his latter years br br jones and martin sing beautifully though the herbert music is just there to <UNK> the plot line concerning these two musical performers <UNK> john <UNK> is a <UNK> character very similar to <UNK> in <UNK> who jones also played br br as for mary martin it's a mystery why she never had a good hollywood career she did films with bing crosby and dick powell as well as this one she performed well but movie audiences didn't take to her the best musical moment in the film is jones and martin in a <UNK> of <UNK> alone the <UNK> i have of the song are individual and it was written as a <UNK> there's also a pleasant scene with jones and martin riding <UNK> <UNK> herbert songs as they ride br br the real victor herbert with his <UNK> and his irish <UNK> background and his musical training in germany where he developed a love for all things german would have been a fascinating study he was also a <UNK> <UNK> before he turned full time to <UNK> i have to take strong exception to the reviewer who said <UNK> would have been a good victor herbert as irish hello br br nice movie but the real <UNK> would have been so much better
<START> combines director david <UNK> traditional love of blood and gore and exploding heads with the more confusing aspects of a reality <UNK> david lynch film and it actually works effectively i won't bother trying to give even the bare bones of a plot synopsis here because it'll only cause more confusion all you need to know is that the film is about a virtual reality computer game that is so incredibly <UNK> that it becomes difficult to tell the difference between reality and virtual reality the film almost seems to abandon its technology <UNK> point at the end but then it throws in the final twist in the very last line of dialogue br br there's also some very gross sexual imagery based around the in the protagonists backs as well as some very gross acting from jude law he manages to come off as naive and stupid and boring and any other annoying habit you can care to think of jason jennifer leigh comes off much better and everyone else can be called a supporting character including willem dafoe in a <UNK> if <UNK> role as a money crazed mechanic overall is a very effective sci fi film about the possibilities technology can present and the possible consequences it will receive
<START> this movie should have been billed as three movie <UNK> linked together to form a full length feature film including lots of shots of people slowly walking down dark corridors and streets be warned the first hour of this movie is simply a re <UNK> of the first two aztec movies as told by the main character the actual movie doesn't start until the thing is almost over i must say the overacting on the part of the bat is quite hilarious br br as for the robot i thought a robot was a mechanical device that may or may not resemble a human the robot consists of a <UNK> <UNK> corpse <UNK> in a lead robot body as tom <UNK> put it he's not that impressive he doesn't even have knees that and it takes the robot about an hour just to <UNK> across the room but once he catches you watch out he'll <UNK> you with a touch powered by <UNK> ease br br this is a great movie when accompanied by joel and the <UNK> otherwise you're just a <UNK> for abuse
<START> i managed to record the <UNK> brothers off broadcast tv with the commercials back in the early 80s i've <UNK> it to many friends all of whom agree it's one of the best b <UNK> movies ever made one day while walking to my nyc apartment i saw <UNK> <UNK> shooting a scene for his tv series mickey we had a moment to chat and i told him how much i enjoyed the <UNK> bros and considered it a pure classic he <UNK> me and said it was one of the best and most memorable film experiences of his career he was very friendly and sincere and i was grateful for the few moments he took to chat with a fan this is one classic that needs to be on dvd
<START> a very enjoyable french film this film has many twists and turns in the plot and is superb i have found that when i lend this dvd out to a friend it seems to do the rounds before getting back to me it is really all about a man making sure he finds the right girl to settle down with
<START> back in the 70's a small time texas filmmaker named s f directed a handful of surprisingly decent low budget drive in horror flicks which seem to have developed a small cult following over the years before viewing his first film don't look in the basement i wasn't too sure what to expect but i sure as hell didn't expect it to turn out to be the only texas horror i thought was better than the chainsaw massacre i don't know this might actually be my all time favorite horror movie br br we begin in an isolated insane asylum at first it seems like a rather laid back place to get mentally healthy considering all the patients are allowed to <UNK> around <UNK> and <UNK> as if it were their house i guess it is none of them seem all that dangerous only <UNK> the residents include a love <UNK> a 700 year old woman a man child a <UNK> a guy who thinks he's in a war a woman who thinks she has a baby and a guy who thinks he's a judge one day out of nowhere judge kills the doctor with an axe shortly thereafter the wanna be baby mama kills the nurse ten minutes into the movie and things are looking really ugly perhaps the new nurse will know what to do then again perhaps not giving away more would do more harm than good it's best to <UNK> head first into this one knowing as little as possible if you can appreciate honest to god with horror then you will not be disappointed br br if you liked scream if you liked wrong turn if you go for that unoriginal over produced over scored digital hollywood garbage then chances are high you just wont see the beauty in this one don't look in the basement being a first attempt makes the quality all the more shocking the atmosphere and the <UNK> fit into the location and the score like a <UNK> unfortunately good ol' s f used up most of his good ideas on his first movie although the next entry in his texas sized is somewhat of a masterpiece that is if you're into extra sleazy mean spirited like someone i know if you fall in love with first two and absolutely must find out what else he had to offer check out don't open the door and the house where hell <UNK> over don't look in the basement has everything that successful horror needs no stars no budget no digital effects just an original story brought to life in an insane asylum with a dozen cast members and a somber subtle score and of course the twist this is real horror for the real horror fan 10 10
<START> problem child was an okay movie but did it really merit a sequel i don't think it did the original movie's only redeeming asset was gilbert <UNK> and he wasn't even good in this sequel br br i can't really put my finger on why this movie was bad for starters it just wasn't funny even when i saw this as a nine year old i didn't sympathize with junior michael oliver at all his character came off to me as whiny self loathing and perhaps most importantly a rebel without a clue he appeared to hate every woman that his father ben john ritter dated for the sole sake of hating them it also doesn't send a good message to kids with divorced parents who <UNK> over half children in the u s these days when the one woman ben decides to almost marry is a southern aristocrat who is <UNK> and who happens to hate children as it is br br and as cool as i thought it would have been to see original snl cast mate <UNK> newman come back to the big screen she couldn't even save this movie i also found it strange that she was a white southern <UNK> whose name was that sounds more like an african american woman's name but of course that has nothing to do with why i disliked this movie br br i think the movie didn't work because you had <UNK> you were supposed to hate along with protagonists you weren't supposed to hate john <UNK> character was supposed to be a good parent who tried desperately to teach his child right from wrong without <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> instead he came off not only as a <UNK> parent but also one who was desperate to find a wife in a matter of days regardless of how well he knew the woman did i mention this sends a bad message to children of divorced parents br br in a nutshell the rest of the things that went wrong with this movie included amy <UNK> unnecessary and unexplained return to play an entirely different character that young girl who was even more obnoxious than junior completely <UNK> for toilet humor and even more outrageous and outdated <UNK> humor involving the dog <UNK> the movie was just a mess and really doesn't deserve a dvd release if it hasn't been given one already it should just <UNK> on vhs along with all the other bad forgettable 90's comedies
<START> you can't take this movie seriously the plot is predictable and trite the acting often over the top the dialog laughable but it all adds up to great fun three career girls in the late 1950's find their way to the big city and all the <UNK> and <UNK> their mothers probably warned them about married men alcohol <UNK> sex abortion etc br br then there's amanda farrell joan crawford who did succeed <UNK> but whose personal life has been sacrificed for an office with her name on the door br br this movie may have been believable 50 years ago but now it's just great campy fun rent buy it and enjoy
<START> <UNK> is set in romania where two american college students <UNK> laura mae <UNK> <UNK> michelle <UNK> arrive to study local <UNK> with the aid of local friend <UNK> <UNK> there they rent rooms in a hotel become curious about the mysterious ruins of a nearby castle it turns out that a powerful evil vampire named <UNK> lives there who has stolen the from his father king <UNK> <UNK> takes a fancy to the three girls starts drinking the blood of <UNK> <UNK> meanwhile <UNK> falls for a guy named <UNK> michael watson who just so happens to be brother <UNK> <UNK> decide to team up rid the world of the evil br br directed by ted this film seems to be quite highly regarded amongst genre fans while it's not terrible i certainly wouldn't call it very good i <UNK> really see anything much to get excited about <UNK> is a rather slow going film not that much actually happens while it does try to stay close to certain classic vampire <UNK> there's all this nonsense about a some little monsters that grow from the <UNK> of severed fingers for some reason <UNK> could have been a half decent film if not for the fact that it's dull i really can't remember that much about it good or bad the character's are alright but some f the dialogue is silly there's a scene which <UNK> me near the start when the girls are at the castle ruins one says they have to go because it's getting dark yet it's still clearly the middle of the day very bright there's also a scene where one of the american girls finds a coffin that <UNK> attic doesn't really seem that bothered by it i am not being funny but is some bloke whose house i was staying at had a coffin in his attic i would be very very worried if you know what i mean i don't think i would ever want to watch it again there's no real threat the plot is weak that mixes classic vampire themes with silly subplots i was distinctly <UNK> by it all not the worst film ever but hardly the best either br br the film looks alright with nice locations some local scenery although you feel the look is down to the budget rather than the makers attempt a authenticity there's not much gore apart from a <UNK> some broken off finger <UNK> for no apparent reason the makers throw in some average looking stop motion animated monsters that really don't do anything or have much significance to the story br br filmed on the cheap by charles <UNK> full moon entertainment production company in <UNK> in romania the production values are alright better than many later day band productions the acting isn't great with many of the cast putting in below par performances while genre regular <UNK> <UNK> has a small cameo at the start there's a little bit of style here on occasion with a few scene reminding heavily of the original <UNK> <UNK> in particular the bit showing shadow coming down the <UNK> with his long claw like <UNK> standing out br br <UNK> is a film that many seem to like for reasons i don't quite see i thought it was <UNK> average at best overall rather dull followed by <UNK> ii 1993 <UNK> <UNK> iii 1994 <UNK> 4 <UNK> 1998 the film vampire <UNK> 1997
<START> i was unlike most of the reviewers not born in the 80's i was born on may <UNK> 1994 despite this my life was very much in the style of the 80's when other kids had i was playing <UNK> on my <UNK> etc now this movie holds a special place in my heart already despite me being only 15 years old at the time of writing this review i because of my 80's style early childhood watched many tv shows and saw many movies that other kids didn't see and this movie was one of those and one of the greatest too br br it starts off in the los angeles home of alvin <UNK> simon <UNK> theodore <UNK> and david <UNK> david the <UNK> <UNK> father is in a rush to get to the airport as he is going on a business trip around europe his taxi is almost there and the <UNK> help him pack while they are talking alvin expresses his will to come with dave and to see the world even though technically dave is only going to europe so to alvin apparently only america and europe qualify as <UNK> david is leaving the <UNK> in the care of miss miller much to the <UNK> of the boys soon dave is off to the airport and the <UNK> are left at home with miss miller later at a local <UNK> the <UNK> are playing a game of the world in 30 against the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> after losing the game to <UNK> after having his hot air balloon eaten out of the sky by a crocodile alvin <UNK> in an argument with <UNK> about who would really win a race around the world two diamond <UNK> sitting at a nearby table <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> their argument and needing a safe way of <UNK> their <UNK> over the world decide to fool the children into delivering them for them they set up a race around the world where each team will have to <UNK> a doll in their own <UNK> filled with <UNK> at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> filled with the <UNK> for the <UNK> to that they were the winning team would then receive a 100 000 dollar reward they do this because they believe that <UNK> an <UNK> agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now would never suspect them because they are just kids however this seems to be redundant because on their travels the kids do not have to go through any security <UNK> and are never even <UNK> about the dolls i suspect that neither would <UNK> or <UNK> if they had taken the <UNK> there personally and so begins a great adventure this film is a classic and i see no reason why anyone would not like it it features great animation and top notch voice acting not to mention the kick ass music <UNK> my french p my favorite song is without a shred of doubt <UNK> girls and boys of rock and an amazing rock song that cannot be topped it's also my favorite moment in the film other notable songs include kind of suggestive for a kid's film eh and as well as and to see the not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the royal london <UNK> orchestra the scene with still brings a tear to my eye in relation to the song i first didn't think anything of it but when i grew older and learned about life it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive that song along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the <UNK> this is especially apparent in the scene in egypt when the are being chased by the <UNK> <UNK> men when <UNK> <UNK> over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her <UNK> defies gravity completely while this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film it's one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4 feet tall <UNK> walking around and speaking in incredibly high pitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child anyway a bit after that scene the discover the <UNK> in the dolls and decide to go find the <UNK> and get home the direction of <UNK> <UNK> this movie as she and her husband ross jr know the characters better than anyone they even do the voices of the <UNK> and the ross doing the voices for alvin and simon as well as dave and <UNK> doing the voices for all the and theodore speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses nancy <UNK> the voice of bart simpson makes an appearance in this movie she plays the part of the <UNK> prince a very small but important role the ending is of course a happy one the crooks have been caught the loose ends tied and the film ends when the children dave and miss miller are driving into the sunset alvin complaining about not having gotten his 100 000 dollar reward for winning the race which <UNK> dave until he finally yells <UNK> and the screen fades to black br br classic ending by the way i hope you found my review of this movie useful and if you haven't seen this flick give it a watch it's worth the money this nostalgic classic from the 80's gets a solid 10 out of 10 br br for the top don't you know we never stop believing <UNK>
<START> legend has it that at the <UNK> hollywood premiere screening of 2001 a space odyssey about 20 minutes into the film rock hudson <UNK> out would somebody please tell me what the hell this movie is about well i have rock beaten by about 19 minutes <UNK> seconds this movie made absolutely no sense at all who were those people where were those people what were the rules of the game called <UNK> are there any rules to <UNK> were robert altman and his <UNK> making the movie up as they went along what was paul newman thinking when he signed on to this maybe ol' fast eddie saw <UNK> and thought well if connery can get involved in a futuristic film that makes no sense so can i maybe the good stuff is on the cutting room floor and all we get to see is the incoherent stuff also did all the cast get to keep their individual funny hats you never saw such bizarre looking hats all in one place in your life <UNK> just <UNK> what i've always thought when altman's good he's superb but when he's bad he makes stuff like <UNK>
<START> captain <UNK> is a beautiful film with a lovely cast including the wonderful nicolas cage who as always is brilliant in the movie the music in the film is really nice too i'd advise anyone to go and see it brilliant 10 10
<START> the dvd jacket in which this movie came describes it as uplifting and humorous those are not the words i would have chosen not by a long shot i would choose a word like <UNK> sometimes even depressing which isn't to say that it's a bad movie it's actually a pretty good movie featuring good performances from the leads with enough <UNK> throughout about what's going to happen at the end that you keep watching the <UNK> comes from the structure of the movie it seems to <UNK> around <UNK> <UNK> of her mother's slow death from cancer as she is interviewed by the da so we know from the start that something suspicious happened at the end the questions are what and who br br <UNK> <UNK> was very good as ellen the somewhat <UNK> daughter who has to give up her life and job in new york to return home to care for her sick mother ellen <UNK> through the movie <UNK> than any other character as she learns to deal with both the strengths and weaknesses of her parents her relationship with her father william hurt is quite interesting my initial impression was that they were quite close but the <UNK> in the relationship start to show after a while hurt was effective as the detached husband detached not in an <UNK> way but in the sense of being unable to cope with what's happening to his wife and seeking escape from it in various ways finally meryl streep as the cancer stricken kate was very convincing in the role seeking to live out what remains of her life in the most fulfilling way possible then dealing with the anger she feels at her increasing in a way watching a family deal with this kind of crisis reminded me a little bit of ordinary people although this movie was far less emotionally intense so not uplifting and humorous with all due respect to whoever wrote the synopsis on the dvd jacket but very good in its own way 7 10
<START> doesn't anyone bother to check where this kind of <UNK> comes from before on about its supposed revelations ask yourself a question is my skull an open bucket that i allow anyone to dump their propaganda into do yourself a favor and take a look at the bomb shelter mentality of com before you waste your time with this <UNK> br br these sorts of mother earth people's republic of berkeley that openly despise a way of life only because it doesn't match theirs must believe their case fails miserably on facts and <UNK> else why resort to <UNK> <UNK> and blatant one pathetic br br don't be a <UNK> take two seconds and cast a skeptical eye before falling for yet more <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> from it takes a village types with a political agenda that's probably even to the left of your own <UNK> moore rather his <UNK> followers have really opened the <UNK> with this kind of one sided political trash passed off as a <UNK> documentary but apparently they understand the sentiment of an ever <UNK> public if it's on a movie screen it must be true br br god gave you a brain act like you know what you're supposed to do with it
<START> i looked forward to watching this film since i loved the david lynch version in my first attempt at watching it i fell asleep nothing was happening the next night i tried to watch the rest and again it was putting me to sleep nothing ever happened in this movie that could keep anyone's interest alive the only time it got a bit more exciting was when i tried it on fast forward the dvd came with a second <UNK> which contained bonus material needless to say i had no hard to go through the torture of watching more of <UNK> 2000 here are the low points the acting was bad the plot moved in slow motion the sets were and looked cheap the direction was pathetic and the cgi visual effects childish br br if you want to watch <UNK> save your money or rent the 1984 version
<START> some movies want to make us think some want to <UNK> us some want to us but sometimes a movie wants only to make us laugh and in out certainly succeeds in this department br br indiana high school teacher howard <UNK> kevin kline is going to be married to fellow teacher emily <UNK> joan cusack in three days but the whole town is more excited about the oscar nomination of former resident cameron drake matt dillon but when cameron wins an oscar for playing a gay soldier he thanks his gay teacher howard for inspiration what follows is howard denying it in an hilarious set of <UNK> in a truly screwball fashion br br kevin kline is great <UNK> gay stereotypes joan cusack really has a knack for screwball antics debbie reynolds is utterly hilarious as <UNK> mother and bob <UNK> is also a hoot as the <UNK> principal br br gay screenwriter paul really achieves a delicate balance here he knows the stereotypes and exploits them in a way that's mostly tolerable to conservative and yet mostly <UNK> to the gay audience it's not exactly <UNK> but it's funny and <UNK> and definitely a step up from the previous year's the <UNK>
<START> i just watched the dvd version of born bad and found it to be tense gritty and near the end too graphic for the faint of heart justin walker clueless and corey <UNK> turn in superior performances for a low budget film this picture delivers the depth of character and clever dialogue are two things not usually seen in a roger corman picture check it out on dvd
<START> i'm sorry but star wars episode 1 did not do any justice to natalie <UNK> talent and <UNK> <UNK> she was entirely underused as queen <UNK> and when she was used her makeup was <UNK> terrible for anywhere but here she <UNK> her god awful makeup and she acts normally and not only can she act good she looks good doing it i'm a bit older than she she's only 18 and i have little or no chance of meeting her but hey a guy is allowed to dream right br br even though susan sarandon does take a good turn in this movie the film belongs entirely to portman i've been a watcher of <UNK> since beautiful girls where she was younger but just as cute there's big things for her in the future i can see it
<START> this in my opinion is a very poor movie that <UNK> arnold <UNK> as starring despite him being the co star only to sell more copies obviously taking influence from the similarly themed movies this film fails to prove as enjoyable and eventually fails to entertain at all br br <UNK> <UNK> stars as <UNK> a beautiful woman who has been given unbelievable strength by a ghostly figure after her village was <UNK> her family killed and she herself raped by the soldiers of queen bergman is a <UNK> queen who wants control over the <UNK> world and seeks out a <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> sister to do it after discovering what has happened <UNK> sets out for revenge and at the same time she must save the world from the wrath of <UNK> the master of the <UNK> sets out to protect her whether she wants him there or not br br the first major problem with this movie is the beginning the events leading up to the point where <UNK> receives her powers could have easily made a good ten to fifteen minutes of enjoyable film however the <UNK> are rushed into what seems like a quick one minute previously ' segment from a television show had they actually made these events part of the story and cut out some of the filler later on they may have been able to start redeeming this movie but unfortunately they didn't i wonder why director richard <UNK> has only currently directed two movies since red <UNK> br br this film also features some of the most annoying characters in history like ernie <UNK> jr who is a stupid character and just adds an over abundance of camp to the movie which sometimes works but in this case fails miserably he was quite obviously written into the movie for some comic relief but with the overall absurdity of the film anyway this was another <UNK> mistake for br br for all it's faults there were some good fight scenes involving both <UNK> and arnie which are worth noting but these are nowhere enough to save this turkey the acting is about as good as it gets for movies of this quality and even arnie didn't seem too bothered about his performance i don't recommend this film at all to me it's a waste of an hour and a half my rating for  3 10
<START> i like this movie and have watched my copy twice since <UNK> it a few weeks ago but you have to view it in the right context br br i haven't checked on the dates but i bet this movie came out after and certainly around the same time as the <UNK> and walt disney of the vision of <UNK> being promoted by w von <UNK> this is reflected in the attempt to seem <UNK> correct and scientific however whilst certain ideas are put across step <UNK> for example roughly correctly other things are hilariously wrong br br for example we are told that a rocket <UNK> to an <UNK> and then turns ninety degrees to enter space like reaching the top of a flight of stairs and turning onto the landing then we are told that by turning in the direction of the <UNK> <UNK> the total <UNK> of the ship is <UNK> <UNK> br br this is an hilarious <UNK> of what really happens most space launch <UNK> are located as near the <UNK> as possible where the earth and anything on its surface is <UNK> at roughly a thousand miles per hour including any rocket <UNK> to space in an <UNK> direction the same as the <UNK> of the planet of course if the ship turned to travel once in space its speed in relation to the surface of the earth would be greater but it would add nothing to the actual <UNK> of the vehicle in this movie as air speed br br similarly we are told that the <UNK> only feel free fall or when they reach some thousands of miles from the earth outside of the planets <UNK> field again <UNK> incorrect most <UNK> <UNK> travel no higher than a couple of hundred miles up but as long as they and their <UNK> including crew are travelling at an adequate <UNK> that their momentum in an <UNK> direction <UNK> the pull of gravity they will <UNK> in free fall of course travel far enough from earth and even a slow object will coast outside the <UNK> gravity well but in order to leave earth <UNK> <UNK> towards the moon for example requires the <UNK> of escape <UNK> around twenty one thousand miles per hour so the vehicle will have already <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and by definition br br but the movie has vastly more hilarious stuff than this someone decided it would be more fun if they missed the moon due to a technical problem fell asleep for a few days and then woke up to find they had accidentally gone to mars the captain then to the effect that this must have been divine <UNK> at which point any <UNK> to being scientific is torn into little pieces like <UNK> and thrown upon the wind amid the merry dance of an increasingly <UNK> plot br br the strength of a film like this in fact is in <UNK> how far we've come not least in attitudes to women the <UNK> drivel <UNK> upon the female crew member is both hilarious and also shocking to think that such attitudes were so recently normal br br as i said at the start i find this film very entertaining as a late night lights out romp through the romance of travel in outer space from the perspective of the days before it had actually happened an <UNK> to the cold routine of <UNK> as it has now become in the twenty first century br br i won't reveal the ending it is both brave and shocking for a movie of this vintage and character
<START> the second mr <UNK> episode has somewhat less interesting flashbacks than the first the <UNK> <UNK> but in just about every other department it is one of the best episodes of season 2 <UNK> the <UNK> mythology background as well as the characters a new <UNK> <UNK> station the pearl is discovered by locke and <UNK> and the <UNK> film that they find and watch inside <UNK> <UNK> transformation from a believer <UNK> after the end of the film we're gonna have to watch this again to a <UNK> s o s did you push that button henry i need to know to a non believer after the end of the film do you want to watch this again no i've seen enough terry performance is powerful as usual every single second of my pathetic little life is as useless as that button meanwhile <UNK> takes his place as the man who becomes sure that he was brought on the island as part of his true destiny which is to continue pushing the button other high points of are a startling unique dream sequence where person a has the dream as being person b this is the kind of bold idea that the current season of lost could use much more of and the haunting scene of <UNK> last word before her death and the way jack and <UNK> cannot possibly know its true meaning 1 2 out of 4
<START> the chilling directed by and jack a is one of the worst zombie flicks i have ever seen why linda blair the exorcist <UNK> appeared in this stinker is beyond me the plot is really dumb the frozen bodies at a lab are <UNK> after <UNK> strikes and turned into <UNK> zombies the characters are completely one dimensional and stupid the zombies look horrible and there is no gore avoid this cheap piece of trash like the plague my rating 1 out of 10
<START> i couldn't help but <UNK> the entire premise of cat in the brain because it <UNK> explains a director's <UNK> going mad seeing people murdered from past movies he has made even mundane activities such as cooking a meal in the <UNK> or running a <UNK> of water <UNK> some horrific <UNK> from a film in the past director fulci playing himself is directing ghosts of and can not seem to <UNK> his mental well being from constant murder he seeks help from a psychiatrist who instead uses <UNK> work as a method to <UNK> a series of innocent people <UNK> the director into thinking that perhaps he's responsible br br this is obviously a film <UNK> <UNK> fun at <UNK> image while exploring the themes of how such a profession which produces so much death and destruction rarely <UNK> could mold and shape a legacy the film features pretty much a wrap around story surrounding non stop graphic violence with every possible way to kill a woman expressed in grisly detail this has a shower murder hitchcock never could direct or probably want to the film's <UNK> <UNK> the mental state of <UNK> fulci i know during the running time reality and cinematic fiction have <UNK> and fulci can find no escape the ending explaining the old cliché it's only a movie couldn't work any better than it does here <UNK> boat says <UNK> excellent touch and he <UNK> off i can only wish this was his final film because that's a perfect close if there ever was one david l thompson is the deranged psychiatrist planning to kill his <UNK> wife kennedy is a cop fulci fears had a family murdered by the fiend br br the ultra violence in the film features plenty of unique ways to take a head off such as the door to a chest a <UNK> a chainsaw and <UNK> the most brutal violence <UNK> from nasty chainsaw activity as a dead body is <UNK> to pieces how a <UNK> chainsaw work on a <UNK> fits beautifully in one nightmarish <UNK> sequence the most shocking use of a chainsaw is when a little boy gets decapitated the opening scene with the puppet cat <UNK> away <UNK> on <UNK> brain is a <UNK> the scenes which are spliced within the film featuring a horrified fulci looking on are obvious but i couldn't help but enjoy this anyway
<START> i remember years ago <UNK> used to show this movie in a very cut form i <UNK> it down on video a couple of years ago and viewed it again the film although slow and slightly odd the mountain men look very strange the atmosphere was <UNK> effective it's one of my favorite slasher films and i have no idea where an uncut version can be found currently deleted everywhere except the usa where it was accidentally put on a horror <UNK> it's a shame you cannot get this movie as it was meant to be seen wrong turn the recent stan winston produced movie owes a great deal to just before dawn one of the better 80's slasher films and deserves to be seen by a wider audience
<START> warning contains spoilers br br i felt no sympathy for any of the characters <UNK> the main one who gets over the death of his girl friend v quickly but it's ok as he <UNK> up with an ex prostitute from the casino he works at the main character is portrayed as this wonderful intelligent writer who gets drawn into a web of deception all the while there is running his monologue of the book he is writing i can't say i would buy the book a much better premise perhaps would have been if the voice over which annoyingly cuts in to <UNK> any bit of the film that you might not have understood via his book would've had <UNK> different to represent each card in the deck but i <UNK> in the end there was a twist <UNK> the main character has been setup by someone close to him but as i disliked his character so much by this point i found it impossible to like anyone in this film the characters are all one dimensional zombies that i really didn't care and was glad the film was over br br plus points the english actress from er doing a dodgy south african accent minus points an irritating film
<START> this is one of the most underrated movies of the 1990s if you allow yourself to identify with the patricia arquette character you will find it to be a very moving story of a woman <UNK> a sense of purpose to her life and finding a new will to live br br <UNK> performance is brave because it is <UNK> wooden it's a way of defining her character's spiritual death her complete lack of a desire to be alive she moves through life like a zombie because her family has been murdered and she can't see the point of living what is moving is how in the course of the story she is <UNK> by the <UNK> landscape by the beautiful quality of its people and landscapes and by the primal choices she is forced to confront br br <UNK> supports this visually and hans <UNK> supports it with one of his most gorgeous haunting scores with an often static camera and with a <UNK> to shoot through glass windows <UNK> etc we are on the outside looking in just like arquette until she finds herself deep in the jungle and is forced to choose whether or not to fight for her life br br i recommend the 1954 movie the purple plain as well it's a similar story in a similar setting and makes for a fascinating comparison
<START> this is probably the worst film i have ever seen it makes plan 9 from outer space look wonderful the acting is wooden the plot silly and the <UNK> non existent the only good thing about it is the fact that it is not a long film the scenery is sometimes quite pretty assuming you like trees if that helps any
<START> it seems there are two kinds of people in the world those who think that five characters is one of the best episodes in the series and those who are so cool that they know it sucked because they were so clever and already predicted the lame twist at the end which apparently in their small minds is the only reason the twilight zone exists to come up with twists br br there are plenty of lame episodes in the series and i'm not one to rate all <UNK> episodes ten but this one is certainly one of those that merit such a rating it is claustrophobic and colorful the suspense is built up and we cannot wait for the reveal of the secret at the end but whatever that secret is what these people are it doesn't really matter most of the beauty of the episode is to lead up to that it would be just as powerful if we never find out what these strangers in a strange place really are
<START> as noted in other comments here the camera work is laughably bad i am tempted to say that the director of photography is a 7 year old but that would be mean to 7 year olds br br okay but what about the subject i was looking for some insight into the state of the wine industry worldwide you know what the film is about is a very narrow view of one intrigue in that world the struggle between and the french and italian that they would like to buy there is no <UNK> narration that would put the whole deal into context so we are left with the <UNK> process of the director and the interviews with the various characters in this little <UNK> there's no <UNK> of despicable characters or even despicable dogs in sight there is a <UNK> of <UNK> however br br is the director a <UNK> i wondered as i tried to maintain some semblance of focus as the camera <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in a chaotic <UNK> small <UNK> in france good huge <UNK> in usa very very bad forget about the hundreds of small throughout north america australia and south america there is a dead horse to beat here for over two hours br br to learn about the intrigue more you are better off reading about it elsewhere and you will be able to <UNK> your favorite wine without feeling sick while doing so br br i suggest a new award at cannes for best america bashing <UNK>
<START> like many western <UNK> history buffs i had been really looking forward to this much <UNK> <UNK> program that was produced by however i must say now that i was somewhat disappointed on the positive side i believe that overall this film did a fair job of explaining the main issues and describing the events of the so called french and indian war in particular its presentation of the point of view was somewhat new and quite interesting although it certainly was at time over <UNK> also on the positive side the blend of narrative and action scenes was well done and came across somewhat better than many of these typical documentaries made up of experts interviews and picture stills a la ken burns on the negative side many of the battles did have a somewhat staged look and many important aspects of the war were overlooked most of all i was very disappointed and frustrated by how little importance was given to <UNK> successful campaign of against <UNK> <UNK> as compared to the earlier failures of by washington and by <UNK> in particular i was somewhat <UNK> that there was no mention of colonel henry <UNK> the swiss <UNK> in the british service who was most responsible for success finally i could not believe the complete <UNK> of the battle of <UNK> run that started as a re run of defeat but ended up as the victory that decided the outcome of war thanks to the <UNK> of the same colonel <UNK> who certainly must rank as one of the most successful british <UNK> of this war
<START> for a long time this was my favorite of the batman films it had the best cinematography and an edgy feel to it with two wild characters <UNK> and the penguin along with the always interesting christopher walken however after the last viewing it finally slipped in my ratings and frankly i now prefer the last batman batman begins with christian <UNK> br br the good nonetheless this is still the most intriguing of the five latter day batman films the stylish cinematography in here is the best of any of the batman movies director tim burton is known for his films which feature stunning visuals as this is a great example the three characters listed above are all very different and very interesting almost fascinating of the villains i preferred <UNK> finding her the most fun to watch before and after she changed violence is not overdone here as it was in several of the other batman stories but one is never bored watching this as he did in the first film michael keaton does a fine job playing batman bruce wayne br br the bad for a movie based on a comic strip that mostly kids read i still think these first two batman movies both done by burton were too dark and the profanity was definitely not appropriate although unlike the first movie there was no usage of the <UNK> name in vain in here there still was profanity and both villains made too many sexual remarks that would have been okay if they hadn't <UNK> this film for kids as well as adults danny <UNK> penguin is downright gross in spots grotesque i can handle but who wants gross few guys meanwhile complained about the beautiful michelle pfeiffer playing <UNK> too much darkness and some cheap shots on christian bashing also made me re consider my previously high rating of this film br br overall fabulous visuals and memorable characters make this the most interesting in the batman series but too dark an edge too gross and too much anti religious bias all finally turned me off after a half dozen looks at this film sorry but i prefer a <UNK> <UNK> batman movie after all it's just a cartoon most will disagree but i was glad to see the series <UNK> up after this one
<START> somehow this documentary about miles manages to include very little music and no complete tunes though miles appears in the film 95 of the interviews are other folks not miles there are huge <UNK> gaps many aspects of his life his childhood <UNK> his drug addiction are <UNK> or <UNK> over and you'll learn little about what made the man and his contribution to music so groundbreaking skip it
<START> i love a film that mixes edge of the seat suspense laughs style good acting and a bit of self parody hitchcock consistently carried this off and in le <UNK> jean pierre <UNK> does the same i was sorry when this long film ended br br i agree with the english <UNK> who found remarks by one of my <UNK> <UNK> i love french films italian films english films indian films and the increasingly rare good american films i also feel the writer who <UNK> the film for being not even a good copy of an american gangster film missed the point completely but i guess it's like jazz either you get it or you don't so why waste time trying to explain br br just see le noir and be prepared to be deliciously entertained
<START> given the subject matter of drug addiction down to the bone almost can't help but be a rather depressing film but depressing doesn't necessarily have to mean bad unfortunately in this case it is in fact pretty bad the film has some good things going for it most notably the quality performance of vera <UNK> in the central role of irene a working mom struggling with a cocaine addiction but there isn't enough good here to <UNK> the bad the film's <UNK> lie mainly with the story which fails to <UNK> and never really seems to get going irene goes to <UNK> and comes home to a clueless husband who has no idea how to support her attempt to kick her habit irene grows close to another recovering addict a male nurse from her <UNK> center complications ensue but the story never really sparks to life it doesn't seem as if the movie is really going anywhere you can say it's a stark realistic look at the day to day struggles of an addict maybe so but in this case it doesn't make for an interesting movie the whole thing has a very blah feel to it the <UNK> cinematography doesn't help matters adding another <UNK> of drab to the incredibly drab proceedings and none of the other performances measure up to hugh dillon is ok as male nurse friend but nobody else in the cast adds anything of value to the proceedings all in all this movie is a bleak depressing and rather dull ride
<START> well i tend to watch films for one of three reasons unfortunately there are no transformers in this film so i can recommend it only on comedy value and pretty women read girls br br yes it is funny i know this due to the number of people in the cinema who were laughing on a regular basis throughout personally though i loved it for laura <UNK> who imho is fit
<START> this film is a load of crap it's quite disturbing to see that anyone is able to say that this is one of the best films of the year what can i say bad acting bad action scenes which becomes really comical in the end <UNK> me if this was a comedy then i didn't understand it if it was i regret laughing of the <UNK> scenes do yourself a favor go to bed instead of watching this good night
<START> the tv <UNK> who introduced this late one saturday night said it should have won oscars quite a statement for a film i'd never heard of though why i should have taken any notice of a tv <UNK> i don't know in the event said <UNK> was talking tripe br br it's a dreary miserable movie that leaves a bad taste in the mouth i couldn't get on with awful <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> accent can't see any advantage in it being set in the anyway br br <UNK> threads abound and i wouldn't normally mind this but half of them make no sense and what about when says he'll pick up from outside her b b although she never told him where exactly she was staying or her buying into the funeral that clearly never took place and where was she during those days and ill thought through bits of business if you ask me br br it's a thriller without thrills it's full of pretentious bits of business it's depressing br br didn't like it thought it was rubbish wouldn't recommend it <UNK> said
<START> completely <UNK> the whole movie adaptation of a video game this is another terrible movie by mr boll how he continues to be hired to make movies is a constant surprise to me and obviously most of the movie going community br br as a whole i will say that this attempt was <UNK> better than so many of his previous attempts some of the dialog was even half way decent in far cry though he still some phrases and in some cases he doesn't even use the phrases correctly br br now besides the fact that jack <UNK> is supposed to be american and not german <UNK> was still entertaining in this role one exception is the laughably lame lines he uses to get in bed with the girl and we are supposed to believe that she is ready to have sex with him so casually after such minimal dialog <UNK> simply there for comic relief i am sure and still lame jack's character looks old and tired yet is still capable of the extreme <UNK> needed to avoid one of the altered super soldiers in the lab br br don't watch this one for the far cry adaptation but you might just waste an hour and a half watching it if you have nothing better to do
<START> although i brought this film by accident i thought it was the original halloween stupid eh i was surprised by how good it was many sequels just continue the events of the previous films this however tried and succeeded in explaining the events of the <UNK> why does michael myers kill people and how come he seems to have supernatural abilities i thought this was a top horror film full of action suspense and surprises i'm very glad i brought it i've given it 9 out of 10
<START> it's become extremely difficult to find a good horror movie anymore thought this movie was a good thriller br br could have had better production values but what kept me going was the suspense and the twists i had real <UNK> before seeing this movie because of the cover i was afraid that it would be <UNK> bloody and gory i was wrong br br although there is a lot of scary parts there is a lot of suspense and drama too br br the acting in dead line was better than what you would expect from a <UNK> budget horror flick the characters were believable br br the movie is really thrilling and quite scary at moments so it makes you grab your seat until the ending credits roll br br because of its production values the sound is not very good for example 8 10
<START> <UNK> is definitely not a film most people would find amusing or even interesting for that matter there is no scene dialog acting or plot development that would light a spark the icy world is one thing but muddled plot is something you really can't bear the characters are not only three dimensional they're not even one dimensional there is no emotion and there is no sense in anything that goes on there is a world <UNK> in ice where nobody is doing any meaningful work except playing <UNK> and the rules to the game are never even hinted the homes are not <UNK> even there is electricity but who and what produces it there is wood but there are no animals except dogs so where do clothes come from or shoes for that matter since apparently there is no industry and everybody is dressed as in <UNK> century europe which is in odd contrast to not so futuristic backdrop the entire movie <UNK> to be stuck inside altman's imagination and he never bothered to share his ideas or his vision with audience <UNK> or <UNK> have nothing to do with lack of appeal to this movie the world of george <UNK> <UNK> is no <UNK> place and characters are no more fun but the story has it's path in <UNK> there is no obvious or even hinted path and in my opinion it doesn't even <UNK> thinking about the idea behind it all as for example similar film john <UNK> <UNK> it's not even done in altman's unique style so it doesn't appeal to his fans either and i'm one of them all in all robert altman had a dream and he woke up without telling anybody what it meant not even to him
<START> tom jerry are visiting africa and disguise themselves in an <UNK> n andy fashion they even act and talk differently with the standard <UNK> usage of extremely poor <UNK> associated with the stereotypical image of blacks portrayed in many cartoons of the era aside from the offensive images this cartoon just isn't very good why were they going to africa in the first place apparently just to provide the audience with another <UNK> n andy and the additionally <UNK> <UNK> portrayal of native <UNK> the only reason this got a 2 instead of a 1 was there is a decent few seconds involving an <UNK> br br worth one view which will still leave you shaking your head wondering how ignorance could <UNK> br br note i consider some cartoons containing such <UNK> stereotypical images very good it all depends on if there is good content surrounding the cartoon or if the only reason for the existence of the cartoon is to make fun of those <UNK> portrayed in other words if you get rid of <UNK> <UNK> feet the poor <UNK> and black face with giant lips images is there anything left in the case of plane dumb there is not
<START> it is such a shame that so many people love family guy because it is easily one of the worst shows on tv there are many points to address here br br the flashbacks now in season 1 and 2 which i think was exceptional the flashbacks were quite frequent and actually somewhat tied into what the plot was about and was even funny now season 4 and on the flashback s are even more occurring and has nothing to do with the plot aren't funny and really long boring and meaningless family guy thinks that long drag scene which go nowhere are funny when really it is poor writing br br wow a baby that sounds british how funny can that be it's not his character is so unstable it's unbelievable remember in the early <UNK> when was all about world <UNK> and killing lois well now he just has <UNK> that are <UNK> gay with brian from wanting world <UNK> to being gay bad writing br br references how do they manage to keep making poor references to 80's tv shows or events well they just re use the same old garbage you know in 20 years hopefully family guy will be canceled by then if they are still doing jokes about shows from the 80's it will be even more irrelevant than it was before because will have forgotten this still keeps me wondering why they can't just <UNK> good episodes with quality jokes br br voice acting my god the voices in this show is so poor seth should just focus on his crappy episode writing and stop doing voices all the extras in the already bad family guy episodes all sound the same the simpsons get 6 or 7 people to do all the voices a few of them are <UNK> about 15 20 characters all sounding very different but why can't family guy do that oh right it's a crappy show br br the <UNK> usually done by peter brian and any extras whenever they talk or are offended by something they have to <UNK> out their just to try get a cheap laugh i can't believe that family guy can't even speak normally to get people to laugh at their jokes br br <UNK> ok short and simple family guy tries to break the <UNK> and be cutting edge but really they fall flat every time go watch south park br br terrible plots the plots and story lines are just utter trash the simpsons have started their 20th seasons are still have better plots than family guy about a total of 8 or 9 minutes is flashbacks and drag scenes which have no relevance br br popularity lots of little kids have shirts and think hes so funny when really they don't even get the terribly written sex jokes they just say oh ha ha when they don't even get it family guy has gotten canceled twice and brought back by dvd sales how sad is that they got canceled the first time i think after the 2nd or 3rd season and i honestly believe that <UNK> been it those episodes back then were superb they <UNK> left on a high note br br drag scenes and falling there are scenes that go on way too long one that just aired this last sunday peter went to an executive bathroom in which about 2 minutes was spent imitating the intro to jurassic park and the plot of that episode is stolen from a seinfeld episode as well also a scene when chris is working at a store and hes talking with the employee for about 5 minutes about a movie which also features the <UNK> the chicken fights are so stupid 3 of them each one longer then the last useless unfunny writing thinking that people enjoy long scenes of <UNK> fighting between a chicken yeah a chicken now every time someone falls down and by the way no family guy fan can deny this that every time they fall down its under a split second and they always land with their arm over their back to make them look funny i guess its been used at least 30 times br br herman oh <UNK> everyone thinks the old <UNK> is so funny when its just a really bad running gag they've even gone to <UNK> of giving him singing scenes which are very poor and <UNK> entire episodes around him they've done the same thing with other characters like the doctor who i know has had an episode based around him br br the simpsons well not much explanation needed here there is so much evidence of family guy stealing <UNK> jokes how family guy is just a poor mans simpsons br br so im sure i've forgotten some key points somewhere but im sure this is enough to prove that family guy is really a terrible horribly written tv show that everyone seems to love when really they should go watch <UNK> seinfeld and <UNK>
<START> the writers of lost have <UNK> themselves season <UNK> finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the finale for season one <UNK> lack of faith has not only resulted in spiritual consequences for himself but in tragic physical consequences for the lives of the other <UNK> michael's betrayal resulted in a success for him but can he possibly escape the island he will have to if he wants to stay alive i don't doubt that one or more of his former friends would be willing to kill him in revenge this finale has left more questions than the previous finale and i can't wait for fall br br a side note what is the point in <UNK> a review just to write out all the spoilers where is the pleasure in ruining the surprise for everyone else the current review on this page is nothing but a big fat spoiler fest poorly constructed in barely <UNK> english with the express purpose of making someone mad good job
<START> like the first film in this series slaughter 1972 i think it would be a mistake to just label this a film sure slaughter is a tough gun <UNK> black man but it's more of an action picture regardless of the color of the leading man or the bad guys and a very good action picture at that br br for the second and final time jim brown plays the title character the film begins with one of the <UNK> scenes i can remember in a film as slaughter and his friends are enjoying an <UNK> party along comes a <UNK> and begins <UNK> the group with machine gun fire no slaughter isn't so tough that he then shoots down the plane with his <UNK> but slaughter is <UNK> and no one is sure why this hit was happened however slaughter is going to get to the bottom of it well it turns out that the hit was attempted in <UNK> for the last movie in it slaughter takes on the mafia and kicks lots of butt down in mexico now in a horribly <UNK> and clumsy attempt the guys in the plane kill and <UNK> quite a few people but miss slaughter and because the job was <UNK> so badly the mob boss ed <UNK> orders the pilot and <UNK> killed by his brutal assassin don <UNK> in a very typical sort of role for him <UNK> is great scary and nasty to the core but ed <UNK> as the boss wow that's an interesting twist br br slaughter is now <UNK> he figured out who the two guys were in the plane but by the time he got to them they were dead so to help him along in his own private <UNK> <UNK> peters who plays a cop tells him who the <UNK> are who ordered the hit and got slaughter to agree to help by doing some illegal undercover work so slaughter and his <UNK> friend break into the <UNK> mansion and steal a list of <UNK> to key government and police officials and naturally there is a lot of shooting and bloodshed in the process br br <UNK> isn't about to let slaughter get away with this and kidnaps girlfriend now it's a <UNK> slaughter has the list but if he doesn't give it back the lady is dead being a tough but <UNK> man you might just be able to guess much of what happens next br br the action is very good in the film and jim brown is menacing and tough the only negative i noticed was that while having <UNK> play this nasty boss at the end he simply <UNK> and way too quickly when slaughter catches up to him <UNK> becomes a <UNK> and all the previous <UNK> disappears and this is too much of a cliché and inconsistent still despite this minor <UNK> it's an engaging film that is not for the kids due to all the violence and boobs
<START> it is easy for a movie that tries to be suspenseful to wind up being merely uninteresting it happens quite often not only is dark harbor uninteresting but it is very poorly done scene after scene is tacked on to an otherwise overdone premise a troubled couple picks up a troubled stranger only to find more trouble br br some movies build tension by building the story dark harbor keeps adding on to its story but never building upon it i was hoping that like other movies the suspense would finally explode it never does also the characters have no continuity from scene to scene they may act one way in one scene but then act a completely different way in another scene at first you think that they are merely out of character but by the end you realize that they are not really characters at all they are just props for the final twist the final ten minutes try to be shocking instead it's rather lame and uninteresting the only thing that was shocking to me was that the movie finally ended at less than ninety minutes the movie still feels way too long br br this isn't one of those low budget gems it's more like a <UNK> watch that breaks as soon as you take it home
<START> there is something that one of the characters the aging film director who pretends to be dead says which may <UNK> all the film in italy it's the dead who rule true this is a country without a future in the hands of old and jaded men and <UNK> portrait of the country on the apparently senseless story of a director who has to film marriage parties to earn a living manages to say a lot about what is not working here but <UNK> may miss the point as it's not clearly expressed i understand that australian or canadian people who watch this may get bored and wonder if there's a meaning well there's a meaning but it's clear only to people who live here today and keep their eyes wide open like <UNK> surely it's not one of his best films and it's not as powerful as <UNK> but it's worth seeing for italians who live in italy
<START> chaplin stars in a <UNK> role as a jewish <UNK> who with <UNK> is mistaken for the dictator i e hitler a movie made in 1940 when the war was in its dark days and was in no way won by the allies it was banned in germany by hitler and was a risk in a way for chaplin because if the war was lost he surely <UNK> been sent away to be br br a funny satire with the classic scene of hitler <UNK> around a giant balloon of the world good fun but with a message a little preachy in the end this was the last movie with <UNK> trademark little mustache on a scale of one to ten 9
<START> i absolutely love this show its basically <UNK> improved version of the simpsons lets face it the simpsons are very dry if you're above the age of 9 it's political irrational and irresistible anyone who says they don't like it is lying there is a character for every one peter <UNK> are my favorites peter because he is rude obnoxious and just doesn't give a crap because of his amazing intelligence and how he hits you with something an adult would say when you least expect it and <UNK> because one of guilty pleasures is dirty jokes also there is an episode for everybody too if you're the political type there is mr <UNK> goes to washington <UNK> 2 season 3 if you like more of the sexual and <UNK> humor there is <UNK> impossible <UNK> 2 season 3 or if you like any other kind of humor there is <UNK> janet <UNK> 1 <UNK> <UNK> what i'm saying is that when you watch this show there is side splitting humor for everyone
<START> this bbc series is astonishingly good fun i'd only seen a few minutes before i knew i had to own it and watch it again with all my friends i wouldn't recommend this to anyone <UNK> but almost anyone else is going to enjoy it from the cinema <UNK> to the entertainment hungry masses the lead character is a lesbian but it's still worth watching if that's not your thing br br <UNK> <UNK> is incredible in a lead role that stretches her into a dazzling assortment of emotions and situations some of a bizarre nature no one who saw this series would ever say she can't act she makes us laugh cry get turned on and slap our <UNK> in <UNK> br br you can't really compare this story to anything else it's not a rehash of style or plot it's entirely it's own comedy historical drama <UNK> coming of age tale musical and more br br gotta praise the bbc for making this story i can't imagine anyone in the overly <UNK> and formulaic u s ever doing it so stop reading about it and go buy it
<START> words almost fail me to describe how terrible this irish vanity project <UNK> by canadian both federal and really is br br there's a sudden appearance by a nice looking canadian woman kathy who in real life was a star <UNK> in <UNK> for no other reason to ensure canadian content credits also indicate that certain <UNK> <UNK> were of assistance br br everything here is poorly filmed and at least third hand <UNK> of poorly <UNK> <UNK> lock stock snatch and <UNK> dogs are the most obvious steals avoid like the plague unless you fancy one of those campy so bad it's almost funny nights in front of your telly
<START> begins with a horror movie icon killing a director and then his servant before he is laid to rest this icon who has some christopher lee qualities to him then continues to haunt those around him when a group of horror film society students steal his corpse from the <UNK> he is in br br the first ten minutes is well filmed good writing and lots of potential for murderous mayhem but the film drags in the middle although thankfully not as much as house of death and never really gets that initial <UNK> of energy back br br lots of the deaths are confusing as they seem to have people just falling over scared when they see a floating coffin or other odd things twice we see <UNK> gas being used but the box promises that this horror star will be the <UNK> of all the monsters he has played boy is that false advertising unless he spent his career playing boring old men who take <UNK> and watch <UNK> br br the general principle of the film is decent horror society kids stealing a corpse of a dead icon a modern equivalent digging up vincent price or peter cushing would make a great film maybe a remake is in order if that wouldn't be too <UNK> sometimes theory doesn't come across as well in <UNK> and this film offers that example br br the only redeeming quality of this film besides the beginning is the brief appearance of a very young jeffrey combs i saw him and thought that's jeffrey combs but felt i was mistaken as the box never mentioned him but sure enough combs was present a note to this movie's film makers mention combs on the cover of the dvd you'll sell more copies if if you would be <UNK> customers if you're a jeffrey combs die hard check out this early role otherwise i cannot offer this as a great selection for a horror movie marathon let me suggest intruder or popcorn as those are both pretty decent and will stand the test of time
<START> i loved this film it was so easy to become a part of the characters lives and really feel the emotion they were going through br br a film filled with laughs sarcasm shocks and upset just a fantastic romantic drama really br br the only part i didn't enjoy was in the special features the behind the scenes commentary was a little off putting because i'd seen the film before the extras i prefer thinking of the actors like the characters silly i know but the actors <UNK> are very different from the characters they play but nevertheless its a totally fantastic spectacular brilliant film i recommend that anyone who looked at this film and thought <UNK> should i buy it answer must be a definite yes
<START> a swedish splatter movie has the world gone insane br br probably not but it's still not a common sight in these days with swedish gore flicks the b movie business in sweden seems to have troubles these days long gone are the golden days of i and this movie seems to have some troubles on its own it's just too much talk in it it still manages to be somewhat amusing mainly for the good fx which are great for a b movie the script and most of the acting is still pretty bad though but that actually don't matter that much it's supposed to be a gore flick and nothing more that's where it goes a bit wrong for some reason there's is simply not enough blood to fill the void br br every person who know about <UNK> will have a good laugh over his role as a sgt though i nearly laughed my ass off it's really that hilariously bad br br besides the good parts i've listed there's really nothing else to recommend here unless you're <UNK> for swedish b movies br br 4 10
<START> this film has it's heart in the right place but unfortunately it isn't much of a film it is more of a documentary under the <UNK> of a narrative is basically a newspaper <UNK> ed piece put on celluloid however your average well <UNK> <UNK> ed piece is far more <UNK> and <UNK> than anything presented here the filmmaker is trying to <UNK> to the viewer the <UNK> of african life in particular the country of due to the <UNK> practices of the <UNK> and world bank by using the setting of a mock trial against the aforementioned there is an extra 10 minutes <UNK> throughout the film that makes a half hearted attempt at a narrative plot and a bizarre hollywood western style shootout scene where the director seems quite pleased with his own <UNK> hence the frequent godard comparisons br br of course as the film begins what and who is on trial is never explained but as we know by now the french refuse to <UNK> feed their audience br br there are many <UNK> arguments made but they are often long <UNK> delivered in a shrill <UNK> one that becomes quite easy to tune out after awhile and very light on <UNK> the last point is the most frustrating of all since there is a very well <UNK> specific case to be made against the <UNK> on trial here unfortunately all we get in 2 hours is that the <UNK> and are evil <UNK> and should forgive 3rd world debt we are given no more than the occasional hint to the specific reasons why the <UNK> on trial are guilty but never a clear case the mock trial arguments and the footage of the surrounding village makes the suffering of these african residents clear but one wonders why we must sit through 2 hours of it when a far more precise picture could be painted in a 20 minute <UNK> article or bill episode in the end there is something very important to be said on this issue it simply isn't presented very well or very clearly in this pretentious indulgent piece
<START> a <UNK> cynical sarcastic and intense film mocking and imitating the style of pulp fiction and stylized gangster films <UNK> is an entertaining off putting and hilarious thrill ride an amazingly <UNK> mix of over the top characters and <UNK> entertaining situations this day in the life of a <UNK> trying to go straight proves to be a worthy addition to the series of films that attempts to <UNK> the genius of <UNK> dark <UNK> masterpiece pulp fiction br br nick aaron stops by <UNK> thomas jane house to catch up on old times <UNK> was a former <UNK> for drug dealers who has since <UNK> become an architect married a successful <UNK> paula marshall and is now <UNK> <UNK> a child nick who still has ties to the gangster underworld leaves a <UNK> full of drugs at <UNK> house while he borrows his car to run a few a k a unfinished business disgusted and <UNK> by the introduction of drugs into his home <UNK> <UNK> them all down the kitchen sink that's when one at a time <UNK> double crossed <UNK> <UNK> drug and crooked cops all come a knocking for the unsuspecting <UNK> who is about to have one unbelievable <UNK> br br the film opens with a hilarious sequence in a gas station in which nick is looking for the best deal for a cup of coffee after <UNK> which size cup to get a fiasco breaks out with the <UNK> when he demands a free cake and uses a 50 bill to pay resulting in <UNK> brilliant bloodshed the situation goes from bad to worse when a cop <UNK> and is caught in the most unusual of circumstances this opening segment <UNK> the perfect mood for the rest of the film which never takes itself too seriously and includes outrageous characters that seem self aware of their own existence in this nonsensical gangster flick br br the film is broken into segments based on various events and times during the course of one day this effect is much like pulp fiction which is a similarly given chapters although <UNK> doesn't mess with <UNK> order except for the occasional flashback also like tarantino music <UNK> introduces each scene and each character oddly humorous creatures such as the <UNK> hit man pizza delivery guy that <UNK> over the phone and shares his and <UNK> dallas who attempts to rape <UNK> add humor to each event regardless of how horrifying and unnerving some of the <UNK> are when mickey <UNK> <UNK> spine chilling crooked cop is introduced the careful staging and intricate setup is fully assembled and <UNK> <UNK> situation becomes even more daring and <UNK> br br definitely a wannabe pulp fiction with plenty of violence witty dialogue and extremely creepy <UNK> <UNK> does some things right but other attempts at homage may be going just far enough as to suggest rip off a flashback sequence that shows <UNK> shooting up baddies and sporting a <UNK> that exactly matches john <UNK> do in pulp fiction is easily one step too far br br mike www net
<START> i like the good things in life as much as anybody i suppose but until about five years ago opera didn't figure into my entertainment choices oh i made a few attempts to learn what all the fuss was about i'd watched several television productions notably parts of <UNK> ring cycle on public television hoping to understand other people's fascination with the art form and i knew i could like parts of various operas i remember being surprised as a kid that i actually liked the snippets of <UNK> <UNK> in my geisha and i enjoyed the opera scenes in moonstruck and pretty woman but unlike the characters in those films i just didn't get it br br then in 1995 i saw a live performance of <UNK> presented by the new york city opera company and that night i got it what a wonderful glorious <UNK> of color and music and raw emotion and i do mean emotion with a capital e the key i think is that the operatic music allows the performers to over act <UNK> and <UNK> in a way that would seem silly if their words were just spoken everything <UNK> on the music of course and when the music is magical as it is in <UNK> an opera can be a magnificent entertainment br br a sympathetic family member gave me a <UNK> copy of the 1982 tv production of the opera and i've found that since i can't see live performances of <UNK> live on a regular basis this video version is a fine substitute <UNK> pavarotti is perfect in the part of the duke is excellent as his mean spirited court <UNK> <UNK> and beloved daughter <UNK> is played by the somewhat plain featured the sets and costumes are lavish and the location shots on the river late in the film bring a <UNK> sense of drama to the story that could never be matched on a stage br br if you've never seen <UNK> or if you think you don't like or understand opera i urge you to find this one on <UNK> and buy it or rent it if you don't like this if this production of <UNK> doesn't make you appreciate the power of the art form of opera well just give it up and move on to something else but i suspect if you're new to opera as i was that you'll be pleasantly surprised br br bill anderson
<START> without being really the worst science fiction film ever made or the worst i have seen <UNK> under <UNK> is still much under average the premises and the first 10 15 minutes are not that bad it starts as a x files story combining <UNK> triangle mysteries with time travel pretty soon elements of other genres too many mix together but the story never takes off beyond the level of interest of a tv series soon <UNK> under <UNK> quickly <UNK> into a series of clichés not only mixing altogether too many genres but also being unable to create anything memorable in suspense or special effects that would help viewers remember the movie until tomorrow acting is bad and the <UNK> lines in the script do not help at all
<START> this was my late wife's favorite film i'm sorry she did not live long enough to have the video as i'm sure she would have worn it out what can we say a great romantic story and the push off of two great men the and teddy rex sean connery and brian keith are great in these roles but while connery is his usual sexy sex it's the late brian keith who gives us a solid performance as the <UNK> teddy <UNK> back up is provided with candy <UNK> gorgeous in her early 30s as the kidnapped american widow great back up also comes from the great john huston as <UNK> john <UNK> geoffrey lewis from the clint eastwood films is great as the <UNK> us <UNK> the late with his <UNK> evil stare is great as the and more is given by steve <UNK> and roy <UNK> whose faces we have seen in several backgrounds all in all this is a film filled with wonderful romance <UNK> of an era long gone mindless story not at all the issue of big nations pushing around smaller ones for their own interests is as true today as it was then overly romantic not really certainly not <UNK> in any sense fun to watch you bet i own the video and will watch it again and again i suggest you do the same
<START> no movie i've ever seen before has even come close to being as boring and stupid as this hunk of junk and i have always been a big b movie fan after viewing this total piece of crap though i can honestly say that this doesn't even come close to being a b movie br br no one in this movie could act if their life <UNK> on it the script is so stupid i don't think i've ever heard anyone talk like this in my life the writer should go spend a few years studying real life people to see just how they act and talk even then they would not be able to make a watchable movie because it is so obvious that no one involved in this movie has any talent driving them at all br br i could make a better movie with a digital camera and some monster toys also forget about any sexy scenes the women in the leather outfits are so grotesque you would sooner <UNK> than get turned on br br avoid this pointless drivel unless you want to be bored out of your mind
<START> this is another one of those movies i just knew i would hate but it ended up not being as bad as one would expect br br it has a lot of t a in it and even the dvd menu is <UNK> full of women's breast the first few scenes of the movie has a lot of sex and nudity and i was beginning to think there would be no story at all just <UNK> nudity for the sake of making money off a popular prequel <UNK> br br as i continued to watch there was just more sex and nudity and main characters that i could care less about but then the story started to unfold and i started to see a point to it all and it was a tad better br br it is about a man who's fiancé is the daughter of an and they all have a promising future until nude photos of a <UNK> a <UNK> sex act shows up and blackmail is in the cards the man and his fiancé must now get to the bottom of who sent the <UNK> and how to shut them up br br the movie first of all is nothing to do with part 1 it doesn't even have anything to do with its about a sex video though so i can see the similarities as small as they may be br br the acting is neither good nor bad its just <UNK> playing parts anybody could do the films production value is middle of the road and its pure drama yawn br br i did enjoy going along for the ride getting to the bottom of the <UNK> motives i was <UNK> answers which is way more than i could say for the first one which i consider garbage this movie has some nice twists too which are always welcomed br br it's not great and it is very slow started but it does ultimately entertain i wasn't on the edge of my seat and i won't rave to my friends that this is a must see but hey if you watch a lot of movies and always seek something new this might entertain you for 90 minutes
<START> i've seen this movie more than once it isn't the greatest scifi flick i've every seen but it is not a bad movie the acting is good and the characters are more real than most in low budget sci fi at least it isn't full of dumb <UNK> like so many other low budget scifi i especially like elizabeth <UNK> she is a good actress and she does worried single mother as well as any and better than some br br don't let the <UNK> <UNK> run you off see it for yourself and judge it for yourself
<START> this show is made for persons with iq lower than 80 the jokes in the show are so lame if you are on a deserted island and you do not have anything to do you will be better than to watch this garbage you will hate their accent their behavior and all the stupid jokes and pranks they try to perform it really <UNK> me of that viewers gave <UNK> 6 7 on their voting sure i knew there are some people with iq lower than 80 but what i did not know that there are so many of them so people if you got to read this i hope that you will never ever <UNK> or buy this peace of garbage i know it is not the place for his but i wish to recommend one much better mini series
<START> the very first time i heard of latter days was when i was renting dvd's and i was interested as i am a member of the lds church i found this movie very heartfelt and in several areas it made me cry the reason for this is that too many years ago i knew a young man who went through what aaron played by steve does in latter days but unlike aaron this dear young man did not survive the ordeal he ended up taking is life after his church his friends and his family <UNK> him because he was gay there have been many people who do not think that the things that are shown in the movie really happen in this day and age but the sorry and sad thing is they do for those of you out their who are gay and young you need to see this movie and if you are a gay mormon you really need to see this movie plus if you get the dvd there is help for you listed in the dvd teenage suicide in the gay world is very disturbing and this movie touches it but that part is hidden to a degree the acting and the music is excellent this movie sold out every movie house that it showed but it only showed in major cities and had a very limited release so for those who would like to see this movie i would recommend the dvd release the only people that i know who did not like the movie are members of my own church and they did not see the movie because of the subject matter gays and the lds church see the movie experience the story and feel the emotions that are <UNK> in this movie you i feel will not be disappointed
<START> let me just say that <UNK> was extremely well made with the horror violence and sure suspense moves the best indie horror movie i have ever seen that is only <UNK> minutes long it is my 5 out of 20 most favorite movie of all time you people should love this i give it a 10 out of 10
<START> i'm very surprised that so many people don't like this movie i think it's a lot better than most of the teen films that have come out recently ten things i hate about you can we say <UNK> <UNK> film and what was with the principle writing those porno novels cruel intentions where a character gives up their virginity because of a fun car ride and she's all that mediocre if your looking for something that's just fun i say go with never been <UNK> my mom loved it and she hates movies one of her favorites is <UNK> this is a great fantasy about what you would do different if you could go back to high school people who were <UNK> in high school will probably like this movie better it reminds me of and high school <UNK> and the ending puts me in the best mood sure the plot has been done but how many recent movies can you honestly say haven't been done in one form or another the cast is also charming and for those who think drew can't be geeky she pulls it off just great another good teen comedy that i recommend which was made recently is election but it's more of a satire on school and politics
<START> debbie <UNK> had a monster hit with her recording of the pop song you light up my life the <UNK> <UNK> film of the same name however was a <UNK> embarrassing flop <UNK> plays the <UNK> goofy <UNK> vulnerable girl who is in love with michael who plays the stereotypical <UNK> wannabe guy they are engaged but every one knows that isn't going to marry any one that isn't blonde and built so only <UNK> is surprised when he <UNK> her needless to say <UNK> is quite embarrassed br br fortunately she has been doing a little <UNK> in her spare time and she's come up with a tune she thinks is pretty nifty she calls it can you guess you light up my life she <UNK> in the car and drives off to the big city to sell her song and make a new life now i recall sitting in the theatre and watching her hop in the car to drive off to the big city and thinking well thank heavens we've finally got all the exposition out of the way now maybe something interesting will happen and something interesting did happen the credits rolled br br yep that was it not only was the movie badly acted badly written and badly filmed it also ended in the middle this movie is a really profoundly bad movie and we're not talking cult movie bad here we're talking <UNK> flop a real <UNK> from start to finish if you liked the debbie <UNK> song by all means buy a copy of it but don't waste your time or money on this flick this is one movie you'll be glad you missed br br gary f taylor aka <UNK> amazon reviewer
<START> would you like to know why french and italians love hate each others would you like to have a glimpse of history that drives our lifetime so go to watch film in original language of course and you can look at a wonderful monica <UNK> who finally speaks her native language from <UNK> <UNK> just at the border with <UNK> and the rest of the characters speaking lovely sabrina and all the others daniel <UNK> definitely in his shoes with <UNK> a lot of fun a real <UNK> of the <UNK> island landscape and a picture about the political reasons to kill or leave alive a <UNK> good for all times
<START> <UNK> winter 1982 the team on an american research base get surprised by a couple of mad <UNK> who is chasing a dog with a helicopter trying to kill it all the <UNK> are killed and the americans are left with nothing but a dog a couple of bodies and questions that's the beginning of the greatest horror thriller film i've ever seen br br from the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense paranoid mood helpless and alone out in no mans land <UNK> <UNK> was nominated for a <UNK> award for his score why i don't know 'cause as far as i can see his score is simple creepy and very good it really gets you in the right mood br br the acting is great the best performance is probably given by the dog who's just amazing as for russell and the others on two legs i can say nothing less br br you may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive well think again you haven't seen it all until you've seen this falling off and creatures changing forms rob <UNK> has done a great job witch today stands as a <UNK> is special effects makeup br br the movie didn't get a big response when it first hit the big screen due to other alien films at the time and so it's not very well known in fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie nobody i've asked have heard of it however the movie has managed to survive for over twenty years as a cult film on video and dvd twenty years is a long time and except for the <UNK> the movie is still pretty much up to date this movie is to be considered a classic br br the movie is without doubt one of my if not my favorite i've seen it several times but it's just as good as the first time i saw it as a norwegian the only thing i don't like about this movie is that <UNK> keeps calling the <UNK> <UNK>
<START> portrayal of <UNK> in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time it has been a long time since i have seen so much hidden passion and <UNK> presented by any actor simply by <UNK> her facial features and the use of her eyes and mouth the way does with this character she was entirely believable as <UNK> and i was swept away with her characterisation of this role all at once the film was real life and fantasy the clever use of what was limited dialogue left me <UNK> i was compelled to read between the lines and each of the key players <UNK> the art of body language and emotional intent to convey a strong story line in particular was visually stimulating in an almost <UNK> way and at the same time in a sexy way this comment can relate easily to each of the many emotions brought forward by her performance understated in terms of dialogue but powerful in terms of presence i have been captured by this actresses delivery and shall eagerly seek out much more of her work
<START> loved today's show it was a variety and not solely cooking which would have been great too very stimulating and captivating always keeping the viewer <UNK> around the corner to see what was coming up next she is as down to earth and as <UNK> as you get like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable special guests who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too loved the theme and that the audience was invited to play along too i must admit i was shocked to see her come in under her time limits on a few things but she did it and by <UNK> i'll be writing those <UNK> down saving time in the kitchen means more time with family those who haven't tuned in yet find out what channel and the time i assure you that you won't be disappointed
<START> this has got to be the worst show i have ever seen i always liked chuck norris in films but why do we need to make these shows politically correct by adding a black side kick who is as threatening as shirley temple in little miss <UNK> i also thought the show was limited because how many times can you kick a guy in the face and make it interesting i know an african american who looks like this guy and he gets his butt kicked about once a week he is all attitude br br chuck norris is the man and he deserves all the kudos he gets i think this show started great but lost steam as time went on br br they should have dumped <UNK> side kick
<START> murder over new york is fun but not as good as most of the other fox <UNK> this film would have been better named charlie chan in new york the film's working title this is chance to play chan in the big apple there is a lot to like here though including guest star <UNK> howard of the three stooges br br this has one of my favorite chan <UNK> coincidence like ancient egg leave unpleasant <UNK> and <UNK> are good in this one and so is the supporting cast but there is little or no mysterious atmosphere which i look for in these films still it is good to see
<START> now this is more like it one of the best movies i have ever seen despite it made very well on all aspects this movie was put down solely for not being too historically accurate <UNK> up there are tons of historical movies out there that were forgiven for not being too historically accurate and many of them do not even come close to how grand how entertaining and how captivating this movie was now this is what a movie ticket is all about you will get what you want from this movie's genre and all <UNK> are those with the anti flynn syndrome this conservative <UNK> syndrome is very closely related to the anti elvis anti ali anti <UNK> anti kennedy usually caused by fear of charming individuals who have unconventional beliefs if the viewer of this movie is open minded and has the ability to separate politics from art you will find this movie not only one of the best classics but also one of the best movies of all time i rate it the second best western ever right behind wayne's the <UNK>
<START> the movie begins with much voice over a bad sign then it just <UNK> downhill with silly and intelligence insulting scenes involving and indians but it reaches new and impressive <UNK> when all the merry mountain men square dance with each other in a high <UNK> <UNK> meanwhile the happy go lucky indians sit around watching them it's a better scene than the dancing <UNK> in blazing <UNK> there is a minor flaw in this comparison across the wide <UNK> is not a comedy br br
<START> <UNK> with <UNK> is almost the ultimate <UNK> movie just leave it running in the background chat amongst yourselves and return to it whenever you like and at some point it'll end br br alas as i watched it alone and so i felt like i almost watched the world's worst longest and most <UNK> sentimental beer commercial by the time i just about managed to keep my eyes open as the end credits rolled and i then managed just a a few more moments of to witness a <UNK> <UNK> to the movie's <UNK> which included asia pacific <UNK> how surprising is that given all the shots of tiger beer interspersed throughout this most forgettable <UNK> of a movie br br meanwhile dialogue <UNK> between individuals with occasional stabs at depth but all too usually nothing of any particular <UNK> to the movie's overall story is said or witnessed it's as if one could switch off at any moment and return at any later point and you'd really have missed nothing which would have been an <UNK> <UNK> or part of its plot as far as the movie's overall progression was concerned thus the ultimate <UNK> movie br br well i wonder what movie were those who positively reviewed this one watching i wonder and continue to wonder it certainly couldn't have been this arty to the point of <UNK> <UNK> excuse for a <UNK> rolling allegedly <UNK> with <UNK> is supposed to be woven around the themes of love tragedy and redemption but all i witnessed was boredom a half baked screenplay with a <UNK> of <UNK> text messages and the only redemption was that which occurred when this utterly useless movie ended what a <UNK> waste of time it ended up being it was also said that the characters in this movie were <UNK> except for <UNK> chan who is a remarkable woman who has <UNK> over <UNK> well no <UNK> to ms chan but given that she was such a marvellous amazing character why at all did the screenplay have to involve the stories of other characters without the most <UNK> attempt to connect their lives together yet it still proved to be an almost <UNK> boring movie whose highlights included the credits rolling rather than <UNK> in the <UNK> of all characters i really felt that the movie ended up attempting the near impossible and evidently fell between <UNK> as far as any viewer engagement could be concerned br br i am generally an art house movie fan and don't usually object to slow pacing of which here there is no <UNK> believe you me i hate such movies as 300 transformers fight club but consider e g eric rohmer as a great film maker so i hope that puts my criticism into some perspective nonetheless there was no <UNK> feature whatsoever in the entire movie's conception and delivery which could prevent one's <UNK> slowly <UNK> <UNK> as each minute of <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> by watch this movie if you need to feel like wasting time otherwise your life would be none the <UNK> for having missed it 3 10
<START> as a fan of dan <UNK> i watched this film when it was recently shown in the middle of night on tv i wasn't expecting much so it came as a big surprise that i loved it so much br br this is the type of film that dan <UNK> seems to love to make a chance for him to it <UNK> and not take things too seriously if you loved him in the blues brothers or <UNK> you'll know what i mean and you'd be wise to check out the couch trip br br avid fans of <UNK> will also have fun <UNK> all the tiny <UNK> to his other films in the script br br i can't describe this film without spoiling it for you so all i can do is tell you to check it out i can't praise this film highly enough and it must surely be time for a dvd release
<START> this episode of buffy was one of my personal favorites also number three of personal favorites as well the episode featured very little dialogue and despite that the good folks at the <UNK> decided it <UNK> a nomination unfortunately it didn't win when <UNK> first premiered it received about 6 million viewers which was the highest rated episode of season four that should tell you something even though there was very little talking it managed to intrigue people enough to tune in those gentlemen characters who were played my <UNK> were some of the scariest creatures the show has produced or any network tv show i've seen nothing is <UNK> then a bunch of silver <UNK> men coming at you with a <UNK> while smiling away i think that despite the lack of dialogue the actors did a fantastic job on the episode
<START> this almost perfect cinematic rendition of edith popular children's novel follows the lives of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and peter and their mother after their father is unfairly accused of <UNK> and sent to prison they go to live in an almost house in the country which stands near a <UNK> line  mum writes stories to make enough money for food and <UNK> while the children spend much of their time around the <UNK> station and specifically waving to one particular train to their love to <UNK> br br always an involving and clever novel the characters are here brought to life under the <UNK> direction of lionel <UNK> better known as a fine character actor jenny <UNK> plays <UNK> while sally <UNK> and gary warren are her sister and brother their mother is <UNK> sheridan while the other memorable characters are played by bernard <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> man and william <UNK> the old gentleman on the train br br 'the <UNK> <UNK> is gentle entertainment from another age but does its job beautifully as we watch <UNK> grow up with the <UNK> of an absent parent <UNK> against her own needs both to be alone and to have fun we can only <UNK> when events come together at the close of the picture throughout we have a sense of time and place  be it from the steam trains the university paper chase or the red worn by the girls and used to <UNK> disaster
<START> our family and the entire sold out sneak preview audience enjoyed the guardian kevin <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> gave convincing performances as the fictional helicopter rescue <UNK> characters ben and jake after seeing this movie you can't help but imagine how difficult it must be to graduate from the helicopter rescue <UNK> school and one day take part in real <UNK> br br even though this is a fictional movie it delivered rather convincing virtues of team spirit dedication and bravery <UNK> by all the members of the actual u s coast guard br br the special effects used to create the rescue scenes were incredible you actually felt like you were taking part in a real rescue br br i feel the movie could have been made without the hollywood bar scene when you see the movie you might agree since the real coast guard does not <UNK> such behavior br br very entertaining very action packed definitely worth seeing thank you u s coast guard and the real helicopter rescue <UNK> so others may live i'd highly recommend this movie to everyone
<START> when i first looked at the back of the cover of this film it seemed like me and my friends could be looking forward to <UNK> memorable minutes and it certainly was memorable was the kind of movie where you keep asking yourself how this was possible how it was possible that it was released on dvd at all out of all of the movies available at the video rental store that night we might just have picked the worst and yes they had tomb <UNK> absolutely nothing in this movie amused me even slightly who came up with the idea that it would be funny if the narrator could change the story by <UNK> from the main character out of all the stupid things you can totally ruin a movie with this is now my favourite the character the village idiot played by <UNK> grace is the most annoying character since they started making movies in color if there is one single movie that you <UNK> not should see this year please let it be cause i don't think it can be any worse i still wonder if this just might have been the worst way i have spent my money and take my word for that i have made many lousy <UNK> over the years
<START> this movie was really bad first they didn't even follow the facts for it half of the movie was made up and it was more about the deputy whose mother was one of ed victims the acting was horrible except for the guy playing ed <UNK> but its not hard to mess up playing a weird guy though i think it was horrible i gave it a three because they started it off with actual crime photos that was the best part of the movie as soon as the introduction of the movie was finished the movie went downhill the writer of this movie tried to spice it up but it didn't need to be the story of ed <UNK> is interesting enough without <UNK> information
<START> the video case for this film reads a story of beauty passion and forbidden fruit are they talking about the same movie i just saw they can't be as the film i just saw was beautiful but there was no passion and as for the fruit this is all <UNK> meant to <UNK> the potential viewer to see this movie if only it did have some passion or some life to it i would have greatly enjoyed this film instead it was an <UNK> slow paced and not particularly interesting film that i would definitely not want to see again it isn't that it's a bad film after all it is very beautifully filmed but it is dull beyond belief i kept waiting for something exciting or interesting to happen but then the movie just ended there was no great sense of excitement mystery or anything just a rather <UNK> story about a young girl who becomes a servant and spends the next 10 years of her life working as a maid
<START> the characters was as unoriginal it hurts the little skinny <UNK> computer geek the funny african american with stupid <UNK> cool white guy with a compassion for cars and the handsome leader who ends up with the pretty girl the actors is at best mediocre from norton who does a pretty good job as the bad guy br br the rest of the movie is also stupid and a total waste of time its all in all about a group of spoiled boys using the world as their <UNK> where every safe in a big house is what keeps them with food on the table i mean why work for a living when you can rob people br br and who the f <UNK> with the traffic lights in a major european city and in the middle of the <UNK> day think of all the <UNK> and not to say deaths among innocent civilians what about all the <UNK> and br br i created no compassion for the main characters and weather mr <UNK> gets his bloody gold or not i could not give less of a fart
<START> robert <UNK> and james wong <UNK> gave this a frightening <UNK> look scenes are shot at weird angles especially scenes involving <UNK> and literal lady killer <UNK> scott his <UNK> behavior <UNK> another superb medium budget movie the <UNK> by more than two decades br br the entire cast is excellent though though no fault of her own it's hard to think of <UNK> <UNK> as anyone but the singer in the awful truth scott bennett <UNK> <UNK> especially and though playing an older woman looking gorgeous they couldn't have been topped br br setting a creepy <UNK> in the house of women story against a background of <UNK> is a <UNK> trick that pays off beautifully nothing corny at all beautifully nothing corny at all br br the resolution is a little pat unfortunately not getting together with bennett that makes sense but scott is <UNK> too quickly i seem him more as a mr <UNK> character who could have escaped everything the the murder rap the jealous sisters and disappeared into the great world beyond this story that would not have <UNK> the essentially happy ending of the secretary and her boss finally getting together
<START> in this tense and character driven romantic <UNK> comedy we are given an insight into the <UNK> lives of four <UNK> <UNK> at the centre is portrayal of max a <UNK> eyed romeo he falls head over heels for beautiful stranger lisa <UNK> encouraged by his put upon best friend <UNK> in an understated but effective performance he wins her heart and they live happily ever after that is until the scheming neurotic and obsessive alice the versatile becomes very involved in the lives and loves of the other three br br the rich plot is <UNK> by a curious <UNK> <UNK> and the movie emerges as an intricate jigsaw the eye candy of picture <UNK> paris at the heart of it all the use of colour does not go <UNK> particularly in <UNK> spectacular apartment presumably <UNK> for the film's title where the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the fires of passion and lust br br the audience can relate to max he truly wears his heart on his <UNK> and is constantly <UNK> by irony and <UNK> for it in one memorable scene our <UNK> lovers <UNK> separated by a <UNK> <UNK> miss out on the chance meeting that would surely reunite them independent of one another they travel to the same destination her on the <UNK> him in a taxi practically <UNK> yet fate seems to have it in for them and the audience is <UNK> <UNK> br br the performances in this film are really what make <UNK> stand out i still cannot understand why vincent <UNK> is not a big star outside france he has presence and diversity in abundance monica <UNK> real life <UNK> at the time of writing has recently found fame in the film industry but perhaps for the wrong reasons true she is <UNK> beautiful but behind that is a talented actress who can dominate a scene in classic <UNK> style which many british and american actresses dismiss in favour of the all too easy <UNK> approach br br all in all watch this film i doubt you'll be disappointed it is gripping satisfying amusing sad lavish and a lesson in artistic film making
<START> this movie is total dreck i love val kilmer and was very surprised earlier this year by <UNK> a good movie the entire dvd box is misleading val kilmer while being billed as one of the main people in this film is in the movie for about 2 minutes even the summary on the back of the dvd is not entirely true this could have been a good movie but the direction was horrible and the plot was about as thin as a sheet of paper usually when a movie is this horrendous you can sit back and laugh at it this film though is so bad and boring i actually fell asleep to it which i never do during a movie avoid at all costs
<START> in <UNK> earlier films his ideas sometimes his ability to <UNK> them he was always a great writer but it took him some time to get his style of camera work and storytelling down pat br br the <UNK> of four seasons is one of <UNK> first movie to make great use of color from the bright green <UNK> in the <UNK> to the bright red <UNK> at the funeral a funeral in a fassbinder movie who'd have thought br br his camera work was getting there too but it was still fairly <UNK> the occasional <UNK> seem a bit uncomfortable at times and unnatural but then again fassbinder was still coming out of his purely avant garde phase this might be because michael isn't behind the camera but instead the slightly inferior <UNK> br br still this is fassbinder and you get your fix here broken dreams shown so vividly and <UNK> as to alienate audience and drive them into a depressed <UNK> just what the doctor ordered an early classic that shows remarkable progression when compared to his first films released only 2 years prior
<START> so glad i have hbo right now i didn't plan on watching a movie today but when i got home and saw that the next movie on hbo was this one i decided based on the description to at least give it a shot i'm so glad i decided to watch this movie maybe this movie just caught me at a vulnerable moment i'm a little <UNK> out got a huge test to be studying for but it definitely gave me quite the perspective on friendship not to mention taught me a valuable lesson on empathy i'm currently one year away from <UNK> from <UNK> school and the whole scene involving the doctor and the nurse was definitely a learning point for me br br anyhow i just wanted to post up letting the world know this is an amazing movie and not to be missed there is definitely something for everyone in this movie
<START> i laughed twice watching this movie and in case you were wondering i wasn't having a bad day nor was i subjected to anything else that would've <UNK> my opinion while watching this cinematic <UNK> movement this movie is bad i wanted to enjoy it and i just couldn't with all of this talent you'd think this would've been at least watchable right wrong br br let's play sucked and didn't suck john travolta very likable though obviously buried under too much makeup i found him to be enjoyable to watch didn't suck br br uma thurman after kill bill 1 and 2 the girl deserves more than this <UNK> written character this character's big moment was showing someone how to operate a t mobile sidekick sucked br br vince vaughn the done to death role of white guy who thinks he's black goes to vince money vaughn is this character <UNK> still considered to be funny i love the guy but i want to see him in something better than this it felt like he was <UNK> sucked br br cedric the entertainer this guy is good he delivers a great monologue after being called a racial <UNK> you can probably guess as to what it is that was probably the best part of the movie he was funny and truly <UNK> the material he was given just with his presence didn't suck br br harvey keitel sucked due to a <UNK> in performance br br james woods sucked but not his fault actually yes it was reminded me of his role in casino for some reason i don't like manic james woods i like slow burn james woods victim of bad writing maybe andre 3000 sucked but he went down swinging i think he has potential as long as he's not being directed by a hack on his next picture br br christina she's absolutely beautiful and obviously talented but this movie isn't going to make her a star didn't suck but needs a better vehicle for her talents that isn't directed by a hack br br the rock this should have been the role that <UNK> him to movie stardom but as directed by f gary gray winds up sadly <UNK> in this movie the rock projects this charisma that makes him so likable that i wound up feeling sorry for him he tries really hard and while he doesn't succeed completely he gets an a for effort from me this guy is not afraid to embarrass himself and go completely against type playing a gay bodyguard with his eyes on stardom i really want to see him make it big he has what it takes as long as he's not being directed by a hack br br which brings me to what i feel was the weak link in this production i might as well just come out and say it right f gary <UNK> direction was about as solid as really bad <UNK> wow it was bad who had the bright idea of letting this guy direct the <UNK> was good but what else on his resume convinced people that he was the man for the job between his direction and the atrocious writing i'm willing to chip in for both <UNK> to get a nice lead <UNK> to the knees wanna see john and uma dance i might be able to think of another movie with those two that i could recommend watching instead of this not worth the ten dollars and fifty cents it cost me to get into the theater br br this movie could've been okay and it wasn't even just okay br br rating out of br br p s from black eyed <UNK> is noteworthy to mention <UNK>
<START> burt reynolds plays <UNK> a likable ex convict just released from prison who helps the <UNK> <UNK> a corrupt small town sheriff laid back reynolds was often accused by critics of merely <UNK> these <UNK> ol' <UNK> performances in true he's on auto pilot throughout but in his day reynolds knew just how to make a low key effort work well for himself <UNK> and handsome reynolds comes as close to <UNK> at the audience as he can without breaking up he seems to know these backwoods as well as any movie star while director <UNK> <UNK> provides an easy pace and a <UNK> ambiance which brings the south alive unfortunately the story isn't much and supporting actors ned beatty and bo hopkins <UNK> as usual diane <UNK> is fine in a small part and real life daughter laura dern can be <UNK> in the background reynolds returned to this character for <UNK> <UNK> 1 2 from
<START> no holds <UNK> is a movie that should in no way ever be taken seriously it sucks hardcore as a serious movie look at it more in the way that you should plan 9 from outer space they are one in the same in that they are both so bad they are funny the funny moments in no holds <UNK> are usually the ones that aren't supposed to be when rip played by hulk hogan as only he can play them grabs the <UNK> driver out of the front after his first meeting with kurt fuller hilarity ensues and it is one part of the movie that every person should see it might be the funniest scene ever i swear br br anyway how someone thought this movie would make money i'll never know and that person should probably be beaten into <UNK> i hope they at least got fired this movie earns a 1 out of 5 on my scale and that one is just for the unintentionally funny parts
<START> it is definitely not worth spending either money or time it is the same hackneyed plot of a guy and a girl meeting and falling in love but this is with a western touch but it fails miserably in either depicting a love story or giving it the western touch never do we feel that the hero and heroin are in love there is no depth to either of their characters probably with a better cast some justice could have been brought about to the characters finally it is a movie with no fun no acting no theme no plot no comedy no action no thrill no romance i associate romance to something more passionate definitely not a movie you would want to go with your family overall if you are looking for a movie with some content this is definitely not an option i shall wait for the day when bollywood movies are something that i can wait to watch and i can refer to my friends as a must watch movie
<START> it's up there with where's <UNK> the groove tube it the ny city mind set of the period a wonderfully strange man with a bizarre plan <UNK> by by own <UNK> and at last <UNK> into the bed of his <UNK> parents totally absurd its the life one sees through the magic glasses seeing things as they really are i don't think it is ever shown anymore if so surely someone would <UNK> the thing and put it out there a kidnap goes awry mixed up in a rain storm dashing in and out or our hero <UNK> a <UNK> over his prey and <UNK> her into his <UNK> powered ice cream <UNK> spirits her off to his basement apartment in the village he is amazed surprised and incredibly disappointed when the <UNK> come off instead of a <UNK> lady he has captures a middle ages suburban housewife who talks and talks and talks the film is full of vignettes of the life the suburban life the city officials and all the attitudes so <UNK> held it pushes the limits of comedy such as magical reality might push a drama much as <UNK> duck is able to draw on imaginative scenes to demonstrate his plight or desires all at the very edge of <UNK> all of it is humorous nobody is mean
<START> it has been almost 50 years since i saw jennifer for the first and only time i did not know the name of this movie until i looked it up on this web site but i have told many people especially my <UNK> how movies do not have to include graphic details in order to <UNK> you and leave powerful impact the story <UNK> introduces you to concepts which if true put <UNK> <UNK> in a very dangerous situation each time miss <UNK> discovers a new fact she draws the viewer into her confusion and fear br br this movie has such impact on me that almost 50 years later i still list it as one of the most frightening movies that i have ever seen yet this movie does not contain the blood and gore which became popular shortly after this movie was made it's amazing what impact a good story and great actors can make
<START> my mom and i went to see this film because my brother is serving in the u s peace <UNK> in the same region in which it's set halfway through the film i decided that given its failure to measure up to what it pretends to accomplish the title is pretentious the subject it deals with could have made for an excellent documentary but because of its poor execution it left me far less educated about the issue than i had hoped to become i agree with laura jane from canada powerful message but lacks focus i also agree with the user who commented that this <UNK> narration free style is the opposite of that of michael moore but i don't agree that it presents varying points of view and invites the viewer to decide for him or herself i do agree with one <UNK> comment that a lesson is better learned when we draw the conclusions ourselves however our conclusions can't be anything but poorly <UNK> if we are presented with little relevant information from which to draw them br br the main points of the documentary seemed to be that 1 the african people who live near lake victoria are very poor and suffer greatly 2 the introduction of <UNK> to lake victoria inflicted by europeans ruined its <UNK> 3 the <UNK> surrounding lake victoria are <UNK> <UNK> on the <UNK> economy br br the best things i can say about the film is that it attempted to relate the perspectives of the average people in sub <UNK> africa which unfortunately is an <UNK> among films and that it attempted to portray poverty as the result of a dysfunctional economic system rather than a universal inevitable phenomenon i liked the irony it captured in the massive amount of fish leaving the country in the face of a <UNK> i appreciated the portrayal of how out of touch the u n team assigned to the region was with the people like almost all documentaries that don't have the word women in the title this film fails to do a good job representing women's voices the majority of the talking done in interviews is that of men br br maybe i need to watch the film a second time in order to catch some key points i might have missed but i failed to <UNK> theory of the relationship between the introduction of <UNK> to lake victoria and the <UNK> living conditions for <UNK> living near the lake furthermore i could be wrong but it struck me that could do well to improve his interview skills not only did the questions he asked and the <UNK> he included seem to be <UNK> but he seemed to have a real knack for making <UNK> awkward and uncomfortable br br the most compelling development in the film is the suggestion that the of <UNK> now functions to mask the of arms and that the real economy <UNK> over is that of war not fishing sadly <UNK> away from <UNK> a <UNK> expose of the idea or at least <UNK> the interview with the reporter who seemed to know what he was talking about in regards to the weapons and cops out with a decide for yourself approach br br if <UNK> nightmare was meant to <UNK> the myth that first world exploitation of the third world gives them a chance for a better life it didn't do a good job of it if it was meant to depict how the weapons <UNK> industry in the u s and europe is responsible for much armed conflict around the world it didn't do a good job of it if it was meant to portray what drives people to prostitution it didn't do a good job of it if it was meant to cast light on the inability of the u n to carry out its mission it didn't do a good job of it if it was meant to say that <UNK> <UNK> earn from the <UNK> isn't worth the human cost of <UNK> with mother nature to create a <UNK> product it didn't do a good job of it if it was meant to imply that would be much better off had europeans never come it didn't do a good job of it
<START> since this cartoon was made in the old days felix talks using cartoon <UNK> and the animation style is very crude when compared to today however compared to its <UNK> it's a pretty good cartoon and still holds up well that's because despite its age the cartoon is very creative and funny br br felix meets a guy whose shoe business is <UNK> because he can't sell any shoes well felix needs money so he can go to hollywood so he tells the guy at the shop he'll get every shoe sold felix <UNK> chewing <UNK> all over town and soon people are stuck and leave their shoes <UNK> to buy new ones from the shoe store in <UNK> the guy gives felix 500 however <UNK> owner wants to take the money and go alone so felix figures out a way to sneak along br br once there felix into a studio and makes a bit of a <UNK> of himself along the way he meets cartoon versions of comics ben <UNK> and charlie chaplin in the end though through luck felix is discovered and offered a movie contract <UNK>
<START> for a movie like this there's always something to follow by in years to come clive barker the man who brought <UNK> makes a horror movie that is part <UNK> part mythology and all horror in between are a bunch of mutants who only come out at night and <UNK> the place called now a man name <UNK> craig <UNK> claims to suffer hallucinations he goes to this shrink dr <UNK> david who helps <UNK> with his problems unaware of this situation <UNK> claims to be a <UNK> which he's only a hate <UNK> in disguise <UNK> however goes into and make the claim that he's one of the mutants there but a mutant named oliver parker sees <UNK> as meat his bite however <UNK> <UNK> so after he is killed by a <UNK> of fire arms he's one of them now after being <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> does everything in his power to protect <UNK> anne bobby from him <UNK> saves a mutant from the sun and in return helps the others as well i liked the lady mutants one who gives a <UNK> kiss of death and the <UNK> woman who <UNK> <UNK> show off her power that is so seductive and deadly at the same time i've enjoyed this horror movie all the way and the rule of it is never trust a shrink rating 3 5 out of 5 stars
<START> i think <UNK> comments on the doc hit the nail on the head interesting film but very long it's definitely the <UNK> to the new school of flashy sexy moore style <UNK> there is no narrator no facts or side info <UNK> and no other gimmicks what you see is what you get a glimpse into the <UNK> world of the of <UNK> as a huge doc fan i was surprised how much i lost attention with this film namely due to the length and lack of dialogue in the end though i would recommend it if the subject matter sounds interesting to you it's beautifully shot informative and presents a valuable and closing window into the way of life of the <UNK> and women all important attributes of a good doc but do put on a big pot of coffee it'll help
<START> talking about competition features at the split film festival we have titles from all over the world china korea canada usa and australia and many of these stories are <UNK> that the world is really valley of tears modern love thats for sure br br in that movie by alex two younger married people and their boy are traveling from town to the coast to visit the grave and house of the man's uncle who raised him a long time ago and who died in mysterious circumstances the <UNK> village seems like something in an american horror film where the village is bizarre and people are <UNK> mutants but episodes in alex can't be described as horror in the normal way in fact this is an extreme interesting drama where we are seeing relationships and horror through flashbacks and much more in this story and through obviously psychological <UNK> of the actors we are shown a <UNK> show of film some <UNK> eccentric australian film making thus is the the case of always something new and fresh visual intelligence and unique sensibility of some australian directors is astonishing good movie is super there is something in the australian landscape that shows their movies so special as we have see in modern love and in ray lawrence movies <UNK> and <UNK> br br it seems it will be the same in future titles of alex
<START> i have seen cheesy kung fu fight films living in <UNK> they come on in <UNK> of sitcoms in america i have seen movies make fun of themselves but this film belongs in the sad category of fight films that try too hard with awful actors awful props and awful music to be taken seriously i seriously felt pity for the person who composed the music for this movie how sad it must be to be a composer who has to <UNK> out crap like what i thought should have been titled generic ninja fight scene <UNK> 1 or variations on a bad guy pointing a gun at a girl's head when backed into a corner or the daring flight of the helicopter then the fight scenes were over and the credits rolled those actually had me in tears laughing if the special effects weren't proof enough that this was low budget the fact that only two or three of the crew members presumably locals which although good for the much needed economy was probably done solely to save money have ever done anything since this series of movies they rented equipment despite making sequels to this movie that was pretty funny too the thing that really had me going though was not the music which left me half expecting an animated <UNK> slaughter from g i joe to pop up but the ending i suppose this would be a spoiler if there was really a plot to spoil but when the american ninja drops the girl into jackson's arms and then takes off his mask i wanted to see him jump off the roof and jackson drop the girl to catch him br br i think that would have been the perfect punchline for this joke of a movie
<START> when the <UNK> girls started in germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just something which was not unique it was a series and i even did not know someone in it later on i realized that edward <UNK> is part of the cast of overboard a movie i absolutely adore i had to watch it once with a friend and never stopped since it's just fun you have the feeling that it is okay to have sex before being married and it's okay to be a coffee <UNK> and to eat <UNK> stuff all the time i do not do these things all the time but when i do these things i feel a little bit like a <UNK> girl even my boyfriend started to watch them and that tells something from season to season it got better with the scripts and the stories they have a open mind and by being different from every other show you want to be like them
<START> what a disappointment a perfectly good hunk like antonio <UNK> jr and nothing but embarrassing drivel coming out of his mouth i <UNK> at 95 of the dialog it would have been better to have made the character a mute how antonio <UNK> and michael <UNK> could speak those lines without losing control of some <UNK> function is beyond me if <UNK> character <UNK> or ended just one more sentence with the word i think i would have thrown the iron through the tv set i love to <UNK> especially to get through bad movies must have been a lean year for both of them to sign up for this movie <UNK> cars for a living would probably look pretty good to them by now and the bad guy if he was so bad why didn't he just shoot all those rich college kids instead of promising toilet breaks even the title was a <UNK> a <UNK> means the plane actually crashes and doesn't just land without even a token fire or anyone being injured instead of landing safely the plane should have crashed and burned just like the script br br this movie is a stinker
<START> sending the <UNK> to space does seem like an entertaining idea but was there really any need for a third film much less this fourth one a film with brad <UNK> can't be all bad can it well maybe in this case this cheap sci fi effort stars returning lovable <UNK> charlie the reliable don keith who is about to <UNK> the last two remaining eggs of the species when ugh <UNK> mann tells him that he's about to break some sort of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> species law so at <UNK> request charlie places the two eggs in special <UNK> inside a space <UNK> unfortunately for charlie the damn thing takes off for space and he's trapped inside the smoke under his feet places him into <UNK> <UNK> and he <UNK> <UNK> years later inside a <UNK> br br space station as captain rick with fat <UNK> rude alcoholic <UNK> and greedy to the core is <UNK> open the space <UNK> trying to see what possible <UNK> are inside for possible sale or trade rick <UNK> <UNK> to him lets out the two <UNK> who feast on his flesh you see rick and his crew found the space <UNK> <UNK> and had intense dollar signs flashing in their eyes so they <UNK> it ugh reports to them now in a fine prominent position as <UNK> that money can be made if they <UNK> at a space station under the organization once the crew <UNK> they find that this station is in ruin with many corridors in bad condition but what's worse is the station computer angela angela is a real thorn in the side to the crew because she has been left without proper <UNK> for some time it takes some little tricks to get doors to open and close not to mention the <UNK> and computers brad <UNK> is al bert pretty much the <UNK> of computer functions and is pretty much the real leader of the group for he is the most level headed and intelligent he seems to be a father figure to ethan paul who just wants to make it to earth to find his father this story though doesn't necessarily reach it's <UNK> <UNK> eric dare is primarily in the film to be a <UNK> victim for the <UNK> to <UNK> on in the film charlie after one <UNK> enters <UNK> mouth and eats away at his throat <UNK> becomes the <UNK> guide in understanding what they are fighting against the film has some elements i found rather confusing or for a better word ridiculous the two <UNK> grow in size quickly are somehow able to <UNK> a ship for earth not to mention grow themselves to massive size in this laboratory in the space station the crew are able to tap into a <UNK> from a dr <UNK> anne <UNK> whose <UNK> is found in a coat thrown to the side for which ethan discovers her access card which shows signs that was looking into creating a species to <UNK> worlds and people knowing this bothers al bert who wishes to leave angela and her bleeding station for <UNK> <UNK> things don't work out that way because well meaning charlie thanks in part to al <UNK> ancient <UNK> 45 kills a <UNK> which had got on board but in firing several bullets hits major <UNK> systems in the ship so many <UNK> on in order but they halt them when ugh and his storm troopers <UNK> at angela and prove they are not what charlie thought they'd be ugh is a changed man and charlie realizes that he is completely evil and his mission is to <UNK> the for purposes of a cruel nature representation of corrupt corporate <UNK> types this betrayal is what changes charlie he has perhaps grown up a bit a wee bit and now understands that some people just change for the worse charlie and ugh will come to a face off over those <UNK> will the crew be able to escape a space station which has set auto <UNK> this film really doesn't exploit the <UNK> as much as the other three films i believe we can clearly see this as the true end to the franchise the first film was a hoot a really entertaining romp but by the time this sequel <UNK> around the <UNK> just wore out their welcome the cast however do give the film a boost the <UNK> do get to feed a bit but their plans of global <UNK> is under developed their role in the film isn't established to the greatest heights i said to myself you have this enormous space station with <UNK> trapped on board could you not take this idea and run with it sadly they don't
<START> <UNK> is a good movie but not original it <UNK> some elements of slasher movie and adventure flick the setting is wonderful the acting is acceptable and the film is fast paced and exciting highly recommended for any thriller adventure buff
<START> it is depressing that many people don't understand this movie to get caught up in the <UNK> elements is to miss the true meaning of this film this film speaks to the minority of people who actually believe in love and truth it points out that in todays society too often people say what sounds good at the moment with no intention of backing things up when things get rough as someone else stated that is evident in the number of <UNK> some people actually believe marriage is forever forget about stereotypes or anything else but rather focus on what is important following your heart and fighting for who you believe in i liked the ending because it would have been easy to go with a sappy one but came instead with the reality that is great and you should fight with everything you have but sometimes that still isn't enough too often people just give up and forget about the magic of love late
<START> this is one of the best martial art kung fu movies of all time if u love martial art movies this is a not to miss from flying nuns to training monks this movie has top <UNK> styles and a good story line its about a priest from the wu <UNK> clan trying to eliminate all the fighters to be claim the title of being the best in martial arts after killing key members of the temple the faith of the is remained in the hand of two boys secretly training under a monk the white <UNK> or the priest from the wu <UNK> clan develops new techniques that turn him into iron well this a not to miss classic it involves ninjas and nuns fighters it a great classic
<START> i have to admit that i liked this film much more than i expected to will smith has that clean cut charm that you just can't help but like the plot was a minor twist on basic romantic comedy stuff somewhat reminiscent of jane <UNK> emma this guy kevin james has a real flair for comic timing and physical comedy i have never seen his tv show but he was cast very well in this film <UNK> was good enough i can't remember why she was a rich celebrity in this film but if she was supposed to be an actress or model then the casting might have left something to be desired i enjoyed julie ann <UNK> and wish she'd had a larger part but saving the best for last eva <UNK> more or less stole the show her beauty and charm and just the right amount of had me glued to the screen whenever she was there i hope to see more of her in the future this film is definitely worth checking out
<START> in los angeles the alcoholic and lazy hank matt dillon performs a wide range of non <UNK> functions just to get enough money to drink and <UNK> in horse races his primary and only objective is writing and having sexy with dirty women br br <UNK> is an uninteresting pointless and extremely boring movie about an irresponsible drunken <UNK> that works a couple of days or weeks just to get enough money to buy spirits and <UNK> being immediately fired due to his reckless behavior in <UNK> with imdb this character would be the fictional alter ego of the author charles <UNK> and based on this story i will certainly never read any of his novels honestly if the viewer likes this theme of alcoholic couples better off watching the touching and heartbreaking hector or <UNK> <UNK> that is based on the life of the same writer my vote is four br br title brazil <UNK>  <UNK> <UNK>  without destiny
<START> rating 7 out of 10 directed by <UNK> <UNK> if you like hitchcock's then you will like this movie murder by stars sandra <UNK> as psychologically troubled yet brilliant police detective cassie <UNK> her partner is sam kennedy a non <UNK> detective played by ben chaplin br br the teenage killers are high school students richard <UNK> ryan <UNK> and justin <UNK> michael pitt these young <UNK> are out to prove their <UNK> by committing the perfect murder and getting away with it but the <UNK> of capture is exciting and thrilling to at least one of the killers br br the supporting characters include a police chief an assistant district attorney and the high school janitor that the killers pin the murder on the movie reminds me of various movies crossed with the tv show law and <UNK> we see a fair bit of police work and it is really interesting to see which clues the detectives follow and which ones they don't br br the other plot in the movie relates to cassie <UNK> past and <UNK> ex husband most viewers found this aspect of the movie unnecessary and slow moving but i found this to the most intriguing part of the story br br murder by is a nicely crafted movie if you are looking for safe or should i say dangerous murder mystery for more thrills and suspense try or hitchcock's <UNK> m for <UNK>
<START> if you are looking for a cinematic masterpiece this ain't it if you are looking for one of those awful movies that are so horrible that they are actually good then this may be for you there are so many unintentional laughs in this film that it could almost be considered a comedy let's start with the opening titles that say jack o and then add the word <UNK> as if the viewer wasn't able to figure out the movie was about a <UNK> by the giant <UNK> shown on both the cover and in the opening scene of the movie after that the movie goes in about 20 different directions none of which make much sense jack o is everywhere he's in people's houses in the woods and yet he doesn't ever seem to do much of anything he does make a few kills but the long <UNK> to those killings is so poorly acted and constructed you almost wish jack o would take out his rage on you the viewer other than that the plot consists of poor acting gratuitous nudity and a ridiculous plot line the acting in this film is among the worst i've ever seen in my 35 plus years of movie watching the boy who is the lead in the film the director's son has about as much emotion as a corpse and just about all of the other actors actresses are just as bad for numerous reasons especially the bug eyed lady with eyes bigger than <UNK> but having said all this if you take this for what it is that is a steaming pile of dung then you will get a few laughs from this movie what i also found amusing is that the makers of the dvd saw fit to release a <UNK> <UNK> version of this movie as if the original wasn't good enough and someone actually had the idea of making a behind the scenes mini film which is also included in the <UNK> <UNK> edition i'm not sure why i'll give this 3 <UNK> <UNK> out of 10
<START> i just watched the movie tonight and i found it brilliant it doesn't have special effects that blow your mind and it's not violent or bloody no terrorist or aliens but it's brilliant it's just plain nice sweet and it brought me to a whole different time a much simpler time where people could take their time to walk down the street and look out at the ocean i think it was beautiful and i for one recommend it nick was a great character and his friendship with harry was one of the highlights of the movie everyone is entitled to their opinion but i believe everyone should watch this mostly when they feel down or when they want to share something nice with their friends
<START> as much as i like walter matthau i felt that the majority of his roles were <UNK> towards his personality this role is one of the exceptions he plays a dentist who is both charming and <UNK> this role does require much more acting than in most of his other roles i liked the fact that the movie was honest about how a professional can be <UNK> in order to avoid commitment in a relationship his whole aim was to find a way to be in a relationship with a much younger woman but not to be committed in any way the <UNK> using his secretary ingrid bergman to pretend to be his wife at some point in the movie the pretend mr and mrs actually are <UNK> into believing that they were actually really married the ending was good because a middle aged man found that pursuing someone in his own age group was more worthwhile the movie was funny entertaining and didn't sell out by being preachy
<START> just got into viewing program for the first time recently the 2 hour kidnapping program don't know why i didn't sooner james <UNK> is outstanding and wholly believable in the role as the chief <UNK> at the featured 5 vegas complex br br so often programs like this have one or more in the ensemble who are either outright annoying or seem to have been picked because they must be related to the producer or director br br that is certainly not the case with this program along with <UNK> all of the primary and supporting cast are engaging attractive and believable the guest actors are well chosen br br the stories i've seen are interesting and the show presents a good view of the city as well br br this is an entertaining program and one i hope will remain i don't know how i managed to miss it for so long but plan to <UNK> it from now on
<START> even if it's not labeled as a slasher flick it has all the elements the fact that slashers are well known for it's low budget lame plot cheesy effects and everything you may add it doesn't means that there can't be good slasher movies opera fills the description even though it's part of italian giallo which is far from being a slasher sub genre br br <UNK> <UNK> proves that he deserves the label of one of the best directors in horror opera is one of the most stylish horror movies from the past 30 years though the movie takes place in a beautiful <UNK> place the situations and gore turns it to be one of the scariest places ever used in a horror movie br br i think of opera as a stylish slasher although there's in depth plot and character development the cheese factor often used in most slasher flicks is not present here but in exchange we got a suspenseful visually stunning gore tale the movie's plot is simple as in every slasher there's a psycho in the opera that is somewhat obsessed with the lead actress singer and forces her to watch gruesome deaths the death scenes are extremely gruesome and are the best thing about the movie the infamous <UNK> hole death scene is the highlight of the movie in my opinion it's a terrific death scene that none other than <UNK> could release the knife through the neck and mouth is another gruesome scene but less violent than the <UNK> death the gore in opera will please the wicked and lovers of violence br br what i didn't like about the movie is the lack of <UNK> or logic i mean after watching the first death the lead female <UNK> as if nothing happened gets a ride home and doesn't makes much of a big deal about what she saw also she's left alone in home and doesn't take security <UNK> still the suspense in the movie makes you forget the lack of logic <UNK> knows how to create tension and how to scare the <UNK> for example when <UNK> friend tells her that someone was watching her from outside she freaks out and sets suspense in case that something happens br br the direction of the movie is great for an italian giallo it's excellent <UNK> creative <UNK> shots are impressive the <UNK> also added a creepy feeling to the movie <UNK> add his unique spice br br opera is one of the most underrated but popular through the horror community for these reasons in my opinion the <UNK> hole death scene brilliant the <UNK> attack in the end the opera setting the knife through the neck and mouth the heavy metal score combined with opera music this music never freaked me out before the killer's <UNK> br br the only thing i don't like about opera is the heavy metal songs used in death scenes it's ok to <UNK> the audience but i think that the opera music could've added a <UNK> feeling still the shocking use of heavy metal is a <UNK> disturbing aspect in the movie br br watch opera even if you don't like gore there's a lot of suspense and tension that could scare the most skeptical person this is no <UNK> but it deserves to be among <UNK> finest
<START> looking for a movie for your turkey film festival the roller blade seven is on my list of the ten worst films of all time the plot the story of a post apocalyptic roller samurai warrior is a convoluted <UNK> <UNK> of film references of everything from star wars to the seven the acting <UNK> from bland to abysmal the scene where the villain <UNK> the old master is embarrassing to the point of <UNK> laughter frank black knight reminds one too much of john <UNK> black knight in monty python and the holy grail word of advice frank when you <UNK> to doing a movie like this one your career is over i <UNK> upon this little stink bomb on a low end cable channel and i could not stop watching it is like watching a train wreck you just can't look away
<START> when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet <UNK> the whole thing was quite pathetic the character developments also lacked in depth i think that this was very much a product of the 80s the film does not hold up today
<START> well where to start i stumbled across this one in 1993 and just hit record on the vcr out of habit more than anything else citizen kane it sure isn't but if you've had a bad day and are in the mood for crashing out in front of something not too intellectually stimulating then i <UNK> suggest this might just be your thing br br we have the lot here great title track more stereotypes than you could shake a stick at unconscious comedy the fight scene of all time and more more more david <UNK> plays the opposite of his role in the 60s classic blow up still a photographer still <UNK> <UNK> but not quite the same br br john philip law is easy to slam as an actor who makes a <UNK> appear but that <UNK> t be fair seeing as how he had about 5 minutes notice before accepting the role br br <UNK> as amanda suffice to say it was her one and only film role the real star of this movie though is <UNK> evans who plays a shall we say secretary with the morals of an alley cat and an ambition to match the way she manages to <UNK> her present life with that of a future with her comedian husband to be is actually quite touching in an <UNK> gritty what is to be will be way br br i actually love this movie when i'm in the mood for it and wouldn't touch it with the proverbial when i'm not br br kudos to the cast for keeping a relatively straight face when filming br br a classic in the edward d wood school of cinematic <UNK>

<START> when i was told about this movie i wasn't too happy to see it although by the end credits turned out to be one of the best movies i have ever viewed br br the movie it self is quite graphic male to male scenes you don't see everything wouldn't be a gay themed movie if there wasn't br br the movie is very light hearted with humor and contains some very funny parts i highly recommend this movie about 3 quarters through you really feel for the main characters and this i think brings the whole flick together br br once again very nicely put together plus cute mormon
<START> the '70s were a great time for horror movies the <UNK> of satan is yet another overlooked gem it's full to the <UNK> with great surreal unsettling scenes it's also great to see martin and l q jones who also produced in decent roles br br some of it is a little dated and cheesy but the <UNK> of satan kicks butt over race the devil and many other '70s <UNK> flicks
<START> i just finished a double feature night of an american werewolf in london paris let me start by saying london still holds up after all these years and the transformation sequence is by any standard quite impressive the film was funny and scary also a bit of gore now lets get to paris its enjoyable a few <UNK> lots of gore not as exciting or eerie as original but it does have a few laughs in what has become quite the fashion these days in films so maybe in that sense it was ahead of it's time the <UNK> cgi while good for the technology of its time are nowhere near as impressive as the original i gave this movie a 7 because i have to admit it was enjoyable i laughed a lot and found tom everett scott to be so silly that at first i wanted to dislike his performance only to end up liking it go figure julie <UNK> was competent as was the direction it's the script that lacked a bit of shine <UNK> i read here that john <UNK> was supposed to direct to bad he didn't i am quite sure it would have been a different movie altogether i also noticed some discussion of a sequel what if well no one has noted the obvious it should be in american and here is my title an american werewolf comes home or in <UNK> that would be fun all those political dogs need a good scare you simply must see the original in it's new dvd transfer with <UNK> 5 1 sound and see both of these on an <UNK> with turned on nice
<START> completely worth checking out saw it on birthday 2006 and it hit me big time sometimes it feels like we're all in a trap and are doomed to repeat the past no matter how much we try to change all we can do is to keep on going and speaking out just keep on going don't mean to be a <UNK> because that's not the point but maybe we need to get down before we see how much we need to work on ourselves what happens when we keep being told by the best people like <UNK> what needs to happen to pull us out of our dead end road but we don't listen i know that some of us do listen but how do we get the rest of the world to see things as they really are just keep going i guess this movie got me thinking even more about all of this so i guess it has done what it set out to do that's what i consider to be a good movie or play or book or poem or speech or anything something that gets you thinking and <UNK> up to move in an active direction instead of sitting stuck and bored and hopeless
<START> an interesting premise and billy <UNK> is always good as a dangerous nut bag side note i'd love to see <UNK> stephen <UNK> and lance in a flick together talk about raging <UNK> the soundtrack wasn't terrible either br br but the acting even that of such professionals as <UNK> and debbie <UNK> was terrible the directing worse perhaps to the former the dialog <UNK> like and the camera work barely tolerable still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my <UNK> <UNK> scale i don't know where this was filmed but were i to <UNK> a guess it would be either an open air museum or one of those re <UNK> <UNK> where everything is just a bit too well kept to do more than suggest the real old west okay so it was shot on a college kid's budget that said i could have forgiven one or two of the aforementioned faults but taken all together and being generous i could not see giving it more than three stars
<START> i was hoping that pulp would be a interesting movie but was profoundly disappointed br br pulp has very little storyline and what there is never holds your interest it was a real struggle to keep watching it when its over you say to you self huh that's it this is one where you think after watching it why did they ever bother br br its too bad since michael caine is a good actor i was also hoping to see the great <UNK> scott in this but she only appears on screen for a total of perhaps one minute scott is one of the all time great film noir femme fatale girls and this was her last film br br oh well
<START> wallace and <UNK> are the main characters in some of the best cartoons ever crafted the excellent mix of visual humor and <UNK> makes a grand day out the wrong <UNK> and also a close <UNK> some of the best animated footage ever put on television winning several oscars and also countless other awards nick park became quite the popular man in the u k yet his impact on the united states has not been big after the third wallace and <UNK> short there was all this <UNK> about a full length wallace and <UNK> movie yet for years nothing had happened then in 2000 instead of a full length wallace and <UNK> film we get another brilliant <UNK> film from nick park which was chicken run which almost got nominated for best picture in the academy awards perhaps it was the success of this film that ultimately drove park to finally work on a wallace and <UNK> project br br 5 years later these kinds of films do take long you know and a lot of anticipation wallace and <UNK> finally hits the big screen despite the rather weak trailers and marketing campaign this movie delivers in so many ways this film will be a delight for both kids and parents with tons of adult humor hidden beneath the brilliant animation wallace and <UNK> curse of the were rabbit is one of the few films that perfectly manages to equally appeal to both kids and adults this rather difficult technique is one that only pixar has already <UNK> and <UNK> has had a lot of trouble doing lately despite the <UNK> <UNK> slapped onto the poster this film is mainly from the very creative staff of <UNK> animations br br wallace and <UNK> are first seen running a business that <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> from being ruined by <UNK> which apparently had been running around wild and in great numbers lately their business has gotten them plenty of respect from the others living in the town because a gigantic <UNK> contest was rapidly approaching and the <UNK> needed protection complications <UNK> when wallace attempts to manipulate the <UNK> into not liking <UNK> and then a great eating machine is unleashed on the area it is up to wallace and <UNK> to find the gigantic animal and stop it from eating away through gardens and also their <UNK> from the <UNK> to add to that wallace wants to impress lady which also captured the attention of a <UNK> <UNK> by the name of victor simple plot yes but there is more than meets the eye be prepared for a few fun surprises along the way kind of like in the other wallace and <UNK> cartoons br br in animated films with little dialogue it is the animation that has to set the pacing and the mood of the film despite <UNK> 5 years to produce only 85 minutes of footage the payoff is fantastic there is a massive amount of detail that requires more than one viewing to truly notice even more incredible than the detailed and nearly flawless animation is the truly <UNK> amount of visual humor put into the film whether it is a <UNK> placed shot or normal <UNK> put into the funniest position possible or it is the oh so adorable <UNK> that is constantly shown in the film most curse of the were humor comes strictly from just watching the movie itself and catching all the references before it is too late just picture the movie <UNK> except funnier much fewer pop culture references and better animation br br casting was great even though in a film with not much dialogue it was not that important peter yet again does a wonderful job as wallace even though in this movie there was no stand out quote that can be used anytime the wrong <UNK> it's the wrong <UNK> <UNK> and they've gone wrong ralph <UNK> does a superb job as the lead villain victor and also helena bonham carter known as the crazy female lead in the cult hit fight club lends her lovely voice as she plays <UNK> love interest even though nothing could top the final chase in the wrong <UNK> curse of the <UNK> rabbit did have plenty of action scenes including one fantastically done chase scene between <UNK> and <UNK> evil dog last but not least the <UNK> really steal the show at some moments whether it is their cute expressions their funny movements or their howling the <UNK> in the film even take some of the glory from the main stars the funniest rabbit in the movie is the cursed rabbit himself to the very end of the movie he had the audience rolling in laughter br br bottom line despite not being as memorable as the wrong <UNK> this film is just as good and entertaining as chicken run unlike almost every movie to come out this year the movie does not drag at all <UNK> in at a short 85 minutes yet containing so much joy and fun it will leave everyone watching it asking for more there is very little wrong with the film it was a pure delight to watch this film is a total contrast of the decent yet vulgar uncut raw movies that have made a surprising amount of money earlier this year 40 year old virgin wedding <UNK> and sin city and for families and those who want harmless entertainment that is a good thing highly recommend this is the top animated movie to come out this year and among the best we have seen this decade wallace and <UNK> curse of the were rabbit totally harmless fun from second 1 to second 5 100
<START> this movie bombed at the box office and in the voting here but i loved it one measure of a movie's worth is how much of it you can still remember after 25 years i won't bore you with a list but there are dozens of deeply comic scenes also a good story and great casting the inept robbers are a hoot see it and judge if it ever gets on tcm
<START> its no wonder this was free with the mail on sunday slow going poor acting and filming camera <UNK> near start of movie is not even artistic straight to video but not in this case why not <UNK> some of your film production costs by releasing it free with a uk sunday newspaper at least this way you get a captive audience and recover some costs br br i have not given this film a 1 out of 10 due to the effort to pull some old actors out their shell it was nice to see some old faces vanessa redgrave this <UNK> no blow but <UNK> jones as a lead and i think he was better in gone in 60 seconds when he did not speak br br this film is dropping in ratings every day i think this will find its true mark at the 3 4 out of 10 in the very near future
<START> this bbc series is excellent i am no <UNK> but this series gives the best historical representation of dinosaurs i have ever seen the 3d animation and <UNK> are very good and make you believe you have <UNK> back in time the bbc deserves a pat on the back for such a fine series as well as tim haines who must have spent a great deal of time getting this series to air
<START> watching alien express inspired feelings of awe shock pity and yes sheer terror to think that actors who have done good work in the past should come to something like this the horror the horror br br tell me if any of this sounds familiar br br a train especially built for a political campaign is on it's way to las vegas for a big <UNK> for the candidate a senator from texas barry corbin the only actor with roles both alien express and no country for old men in the same decade at a <UNK> crossing in <UNK> a meteor <UNK> a car waiting for the train to pass br br the train stops local law <UNK> is <UNK> oh can it be the senator has a lovely young lady amy from cry baby and <UNK> place who just happened to have once been married to one of the officers answering the <UNK> call lou diamond phillips stand and deliver la <UNK> is the ex husband br br meanwhile aliens have managed to <UNK> away on the train br br the train leaves lou gets his buddy to pilot a helicopter so that lou can drop onto the moving train about 70 miles per hour so that he can save the day as the <UNK> reward he crashes the helicopter into the mountain br br which is another example of how poorly written alien express is the cop hero's sidekick must die we all know that but he's supposed to die near the end of the third act usually while saving several lives br br once on the train lou manages to lose his shirt so that he can channel bruce willis in die hard by wearing a wife <UNK> t shirt yeah lou is <UNK> years old but he hits the gym the part he's playing isn't worth bothering with but he's in good shape br br the senator is going to have an afternoon delight with miss <UNK> but aliens <UNK> and both he and the woman young enough to be his <UNK> pay the ultimate price br br soon we have bomb <UNK> <UNK> aliens and of course the train goes out of control and <UNK> toward its date with destiny while lou and todd bridges <UNK> <UNK> try to save as many lives as they can br br there is exactly one surprise in the entire movie early in the story a couple lift wine glasses to their thirty fifth <UNK> with hopes for thirty five more years together the dude gets <UNK> up but he and the mrs both live maybe the writers just lost track of them br br this is the kind of movie that you'd love to be a fly on the wall these actors who have done better work and really deserve much better than this are probably just happy for the work did they actually think they were working on something worthwhile or did they cry and or drink themselves to sleep at night at the end of the story the fairly numerous all things considered survivors gather in the last car of the train which is the other cars go over a cliff but the one containing the protagonists stops just <UNK> short of the cliff br br lou and his ex are reunited happiness <UNK> i'd have thought that the first thing they'd do was get off the train so they'd have solid ground under their feet but i <UNK> br br someone looks out the window and sees a shooting star look make a wish then another then more and more the earth is being <UNK> with <UNK> that will crack open and creepy <UNK> hand puppets with big teeth will be everywhere br br it's gotten to a point that seeing the words the sci fi channel presents on an original movie tells us that we'll be glad we have <UNK> <UNK> so that we can fast forward through the next two hours or better yet just go ahead and <UNK> it two minutes into the story and spend that time more wisely
<START> this is a terrible movie that is barely recognizable from the book although they have sort of similar plots the time it takes to watch this movie which is only 1 5 hours would be much better spent doing anything else including watching grass grow the addition of poorly done fantasy scenes make catherine seem <UNK> silly the actress who plays catherine also comes across <UNK> as all goodness and looks constantly surprised even when she's supposed to be looking lovingly into her eyes honestly the movie ends with a catherine fantasy like scene where one can't help but wonder if it's happened or if she's merely <UNK> and not in the good way that makes you think but in a perfectly horrible way that basically sums up the terrible movie the only good thing about the movie is the title which was written by ms austen herself i generally love the <UNK> productions but this one is horrid
<START> pacino and really hit the mark with this stinker i swear i am an avid movie goer and fan i have been a fan of most of the people in this abortion at one time or another until now the story crap the acting crap <UNK> major league was good the plot crap the subplot garbage the teenage attempts to relate to sports <UNK> junk br br i have <UNK> to watch <UNK> and <UNK> high school reunion 2 times a day for the next seven days as my punishment for not turning this bag of a movie off after 10 minutes i was out of town for a <UNK> and this pile of <UNK> cost me 9 99 and 2 hours i have been cheated this director should be in jail for fraud br br get with me if you have other review questions i am always right
<START> try not to see this one i thought it was going to be good because i'm a fan of cheesy 80's films and i've enjoyed quite a bit of <UNK> <UNK> work i was wrong i should have said no and watched <UNK> instead which is probably a far better film i guess my biggest problem with this film was its attempt at humor nothing about it was funny or even close to funny the acting is bad even for the queen of cheesy 80's films there is no story just random clips i guess i shouldn't hate it so much because it was just made as a fun and silly piece but i didn't have any fun and i wasn't entertained once i even had to fast forward to the ending to get through all of the crap i'm sorry but i don't find zombies doing <UNK> funny
<START> terror in the jungle is a real find if you saw it you're one of the few lucky ones it's hilarious br br the story is about an airplane crashing in the middle of the south american jungle the crash scene has to be seen to be believed everyone dies in the crash or they're subsequently eaten alive by <UNK> only a young blonde boy survives a nearby <UNK> brings the kid to their village and they all males <UNK> him because of his golden hair i kid you not at the end there's a lot of wrestling between the natives and the man on the search for any survivors of the <UNK> airplane all the while the kid sits on a throne and his blond hair is surrounded by a golden <UNK> and he cries <UNK> it's a hoot br br very obscure and contains very questionable <UNK> a must if you're into obscure it's so bad it's good movies
<START> this has to be the ultimate chick flick ever we taped it off the t v years ago and i've watched it about 30 times over the years i hadn't seen it for about 12 years and just recently watched this movie i'm not lying i cried from the opening credits to the ending credits this movie truly tears your heart out even if you don't have children
<START> or <UNK> as it is sometimes called is not very good that is it's bad jodie foster had already won an oscar at this point why did she agree to do this i don't know br br the hostage <UNK> relationship is not believable even if it is a common psychological phenomenon in real life br br worst of all this film features a scene where hopper and foster ride a boat under the bridge a bridge in seattle which means that traffic had to stop so that the bridge could open i've had to wait for that bridge to go down many times almost all of them on the bus it's not a pleasant wait this film caused unnecessary bridge waiting and the world is a worse place for it
<START> after winning a championship fight boxer john garfield as <UNK> <UNK> with a drinking <UNK> which leads to the <UNK> of a <UNK> reporter although his manager killed the man mr garfield is blamed when the manager dies in a car crash wearing <UNK> stolen watch authorities think the boxer is dead still a wanted man garfield changes his identity to jack and moves to an arizona ranch there garfield meets the dead end kids billy <UNK> as tommy bobby jordan as angel leo <UNK> as spit <UNK> hall as <UNK> gabriel <UNK> as t b and bernard as <UNK> br br garfield bonds with the young dead end <UNK> who were sent to stay with sweet grandma may <UNK> as an alternative to <UNK> school courtesy of her brother deceased priest father garfield falls in love with sister pretty peggy gloria <UNK> who is there to keep any eye on the kids of course <UNK> past comes back to haunt <UNK> br br john garfield and the <UNK> <UNK> kids make beautiful max <UNK> music together thanks to effective direction and photography by busby berkeley and james wong <UNK> the story is predictably comfortable with the warner brothers support team in fine form garfield and the dead end kids are a winning combination although garfield made no further movies with the east side gang the studio had him re team with both billy <UNK> and bobby jordan almost immediately for dust be my destiny br br the boxing scenes are nicely staged but the most exciting sequence has garfield and four of the new york kids <UNK> jordan hall and climbing into a giant water tank for a swim which unexpectedly puts their lives in danger other more brief highlights include <UNK> ann sheridan as goldie <UNK> barbara pepper as and young ronald <UNK> as douglas losing at strip poker br br they made me a criminal 1 21 <UNK> busby berkeley john garfield billy <UNK> bobby jordan
<START> i am a <UNK> for b movies i love the old drive in fare like this movie this film made for very little money it seems does do one thing that some bigger budgeted films fail it is <UNK> it is gory it has no real plot but it entertained me for an hour and a half i was either laughing or covering my eyes in shock there are a few great effects like a shot from inside a guy's mouth when he gets stabbed in the <UNK> by a knife and it <UNK> up through his tongue and <UNK> into the roof of his mouth and one gross out with a guy getting his <UNK> <UNK> out but there is also loads of zombies and some psycho killers <UNK> after texas chainsaw massacre and a demon possessed scarecrow i loved the dialogue that the killers <UNK> as they torture and kill people it has great camera work and some cool editing tricks this one is more original than the first bloodbath and the undead look better but it is still <UNK> after those dubbed trashy zombie movies of the 70's and 80's and it still has a <UNK> factor that ranks mighty high don't expect romero just second rate fulci i would say that horror fans will like it and it is funny and <UNK> and a fast ride through b movie land
<START> i saw on broadway and liked it a great deal i don't know what happened with the film version because it was dreadful perhaps some dialogue that works on stage just sounds incoherent on screen anyway i couldn't wait for this film to be over the acting is universally over the top only kevin spacey has it together and he seems like he knows he's in a bad movie and can't wait to get out
<START> featuring some amazing and wonderful characters a new mythology superbly designed and executed sets is a great film br br sadly the lack of a well known lead actor lead to the film finding obscurity br br perhaps also the homosexuality of the director lead to the film being <UNK> <UNK> by the white audience the film br br none the less the film is a treasure of the monster movie superhero genre br br a sequel featuring <UNK> style flashbacks to different <UNK> in history would be interesting br br another idea would be the foundation of the new perhaps in texas somewhere or the <UNK> of with crocodile men and a traveling freak circus
<START> up front if you're tired the first hour could be slow the set up of the story has a natural <UNK> pace <UNK> giving us time to appreciate the kind of everyday life and situations the main characters are in once you arrived at the climatic segment of the storyline the turn of events will keep you hooked how will things turn out what will happen to our precious portrayed to utter quiet perfection by the veteran czech actor how will his wife wonderfully played by stella treat him what happens to dear friend ed played by <UNK> a matching sidekick to and the son with selfish hidden agenda blind to the kindness of his parents sigh br br <UNK> <UNK> directed the film with <UNK> of humor <UNK> the insightful script by <UNK> thanks to clear <UNK> i was able to notice for every phrase wife <UNK> there's a hint of showing buried in between the lines and so did the <UNK> lady judge observed is <UNK> going on <UNK> and the affection of their enduring endearing marriage <UNK> even in their <UNK> arguments his <UNK> can be <UNK> br br this is <UNK> old together <UNK> for at least the beyond fifties and lessons learned to sons and daughters not to take parents for granted one may need to <UNK> if assuming <UNK> for the is a means to an end so to speak the film is gently shouting to us to live life to the <UNK> while we can hint there's joy in staying on and watch the end credits roll br br we're fortunate to be able to see an occasional czech film the <UNK> father son's 2001 dark blue world was revealing with pathos it's good to take it slow now and then and appreciate a foreign gem its subtitles scenery <UNK> score and an engaging human story with elegant performances <UNK> spring aka is available on dvd enjoy
<START> in the middle of the hole i e <UNK> a friend of mine to <UNK> it not sure if the film would break down into a series of <UNK> gestures i felt a little un easy <UNK> it but then i saw the ending it's perfect i've been living in korea for 6 months and this film could just as easily <UNK> the strange <UNK> and frustration of any asian metropolis as it takes on here it uses the myth of hong kong musicals the same way godard or hartley use western musicals but takes it to an extreme it's gritty world and occasionally <UNK> esquire logic make it all the better i really feel like the closest comparison is hal hartley's surviving desire but have a kinda bleak edge to what are ultimately hopefully and strangely <UNK> films anyway this is what i wrote to esther hope you like the hole too br br hey br br watching a move called the hole <UNK> i think seems a bit to weird for china unless it's hong kong it's worth seeing so far it's about a guy and a girl in an apartment complex the guy's ceiling <UNK> in and the girl starts to get annoyed and well it's kinda a weird metaphor for the <UNK> pleasure and pain of a rather intense crush there's also a kinda zombie virus sub plot too and a lot of weird little scenes where the girl acts out her desires through rather innocent and kinda fun 50's doo sequences worth a look
<START> it is an interesting fact that <UNK> by and <UNK> logic and abstract form about those <UNK> that most people are not interested in but then around one thousand years after the computer began to <UNK> the human thinking and the humans who were <UNK> to reflect questions of being other than <UNK> physical and chemical ones suddenly felt <UNK> because they could not cope with the consequences that this computers would bring over night r w <UNK> <UNK> am together with <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is probably the first movie who took the philosophical questions of <UNK> computer science as a basis of a story to be told in a movie the confusing questions about identities and realities are cleverly built into different <UNK> criminal stories which the audience really tries to follow because it is interested to solve the cases fassbinder was a master to sell highly <UNK> to his public by <UNK> knowledge into practical <UNK> forms the basis problem to understand is that an identity <UNK> a reality but on the other side a reality also requires identity in order to be perceived the idea of a person with multiple identities is known to us solely from the standpoint of <UNK> however <UNK> spoken the only reason why we have just one identity is the fact that our logic has only two values right and false now take a logic with just one more value i e with three then as you can easily see you have already three identities what happens now when let us say dr stiller gets killed then it is quite possible that only one of three identities is <UNK> and the other two remain and are able to rescue the individual from death another question is if a person with multiple identities actually feels these identities at once the idea however to display such sets of identities in a up down or down up way as shown in the scene with the elevator in the hotel is misleading since identities and hence realities are not structured in <UNK> but in a way strictly speaking there is no artificial identity either since each identity is defined over two objects who share all of their features with one another therefore the idea of assuming that every individual has just one single identity is nothing but a consequence of ancient two <UNK> logic either a second identity would imply that a person at the same time exists and not exists but now look around and see that one and the same object which is by definition self identical is perceived by every subject in its own way if therefore every subject sees an object differently why should it no be possible for the single individual to open the borders of his two <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with the effect that different persons can exchange their different fassbinder would five years later pick up this topic in his masterpiece despair a trip into the light
<START> asia <UNK> is a sexy beautiful woman who likes to run around naked which isn't a bad thing in it's self but when her character talks about all the guys she <UNK> and to see her with michael madsen and an asian guy in the present tense of the movie it made me feel like i needed a <UNK> over my eyes to watch this movie like a disease was going to rub off on me or something br br the movie felt like it was going for a love triangle drama action plot it just seemed to go everywhere and nowhere at the same time the acting was great the plot not so great the director needs to at least pick a genre and practice practice practice before trying to do something as complicated as this again because they are not very good at it obviously
<START> this is a great tv miniseries of a classic novel janet <UNK> and john <UNK> in the lead roles are exceptional this is one of the best adaptations from a book that i have seen i would love to get a copy of this let me know if you know how i might get one thanks
<START> let me begin by saying that i had been eagerly <UNK> this film's release for awhile after finally getting the chance to see it last night i'm sorry to say that i was incredibly disappointed it's hard to imagine a film that could make last exorcist the beginning look good but <UNK> does just that no wait it makes it look like a great film br br perhaps i got myself too excited about this movie and that contributed to the let down after all the idea that warner bros was releasing two versions of what is essentially the same film within six months of each other was an exciting attraction plus i'm a huge fan of <UNK> and in true fashion he gives a great performance despite the often ridiculous content of the film on the other hand the supporting cast in this film is abysmal clara seems to be capable of only one expression blank stare and delivers all of her lines with the same monotonous tone while <UNK> <UNK> father frances is just ridiculous the effects in this film are laughable at best and the sheer cheesiness of it all is enough to rob the film of any chance of being taken seriously this movie brought about more <UNK> <UNK> than anything else and with the exception of one really chilling shot that lasted about three seconds and made my friend cover her eyes and <UNK> it neglected to offer anything in the scare department either i could go into more detail and possibly give away some spoilers but frankly i'm too exhausted from thinking about how bad this film was to write all the things i'd love to say br br the saddest part about the whole thing is that the basic idea that both versions of the film tried to give a story about a priest who has lost his faith and then <UNK> it after coming to terms with his troubled past had huge potential especially with as leading man unfortunately for us that potential was wasted go and see this film only if you're really curious about how it <UNK> from the <UNK> version but don't expect to see a good film or you'll regret wasting your money and two hours of your life otherwise be content with the version first released and move on
<START> it is great to see a film starring kids whose idea of acting adult is not engaging in <UNK> instead these kids see a problem in their community and take responsibility for helping to solve it hoot is a film aimed <UNK> at families looking for a fun day at the cinema the production values are good especially sweeping shots of montana and florida the soundtrack by jimmy <UNK> is a perfect fit the young actors are spirited and refreshing br br the plot about a trio of kids who work together to save some <UNK> <UNK> from death at the hands of an <UNK> <UNK> house empire <UNK> will engage kids so many films make children appear <UNK> it is nice to see a movie that shows children working hard to make a difference and even though parents are absent or <UNK> distracted it was pleasant to see kids who want to follow in their parents footsteps and try to right <UNK> br br if you are tired of all of the self indulgent story lines about children that fill the cinema give hoot a shot then take some time to talk to your kids about the adventure of serving others and caring about the world they live in a positive message from a positive film
<START> i caught this on <UNK> very late at night nothing else was on so i pretty much had no choice bottom line terrible plot slow waste of good film and actors' time to make it short don't even bother with this one it's too bad we can't give as a rating this one really is not worth even a consideration
<START> to anyone who likes the tv series forget the movie the jokes are bad and some topics are much too sensitive to laugh about it br br we have seen much better acting by r in 8
<START> well of course everybody is entitled to have an opinion about a thing everything the presentation was interesting black and white movie the year 1968 students <UNK> general strike youth ideals love etc sorry but i did not sense love romance a lover who is all right that his girlfriend sleeps with no matter who that is love but not only that the movie is very long and for no reason i had to stop watching the movie several time because i simply lost interest i waited for something to happen but nothing the only thing i was impressed during the movie gypsy <UNK> playing in the streets yes that was nice i do not think that art should be complicated <UNK> hidden in secret meanings confusing big disappointment and waste of time
<START> first and foremost i take issue to the title of this movie is not a spanish word the name to which they are referring is i imagine they dropped the <UNK> because it sounds <UNK> that way but i assure you it is <UNK> in spanish br br next i thought this movie had been done years ago it came off as one of those b horror flicks i watched when i was an early teenager at home when my <UNK> was out of town then it would have been kind of scary br br let's talk about the special effects the most important is the costume used for the given that it is the main character you would think some serious money would have been put into it but that isn't so the shape color and <UNK> were all goofy like some stupid haunted house at disney world br br there were times when the was walking where no man could walk his movement were jerky and strange at these times but moving around on the floor looked like any normal man br br another thing i take issue to is that there is no animal in the world that goes around <UNK> everything it sees with no regard to actually eating it the would kill one then the next but it never seemed to actually eat the victim you say it's just a movie and i agree but the idea is so far out there that it's stupid br br what country is dr <UNK> from he sounds sort of <UNK> british something else but i think he's supposed to be latino the problem is his accent is so bad that even a russian could tell he wasn't latino br br the soldiers fired round after round at this thing and weren't making a <UNK> yet the continued to fire i'm no military man but don't soldiers especially the special <UNK> forces such as this have to have some wit about them to perform their duties wouldn't they figure out that it was a waste of time to shoot and try something new they didn't they just kept firing away while the continued to slaughter and not eat them br br did they have to kill the little dog anyway my vote was 3 for this flick because it was bad why did i watch the whole thing i'm sure you've done the same on occasion so don't give me an <UNK>
<START> is this a game <UNK> or a movie in all honesty i watched this one out of choice less <UNK> it is a very big waste of time and money br br it seems hk movies are heading in the opposite direction of the rest of the world br br try to put more effort and money into a production and make us want to watch rather than something you want us to watch br br the graphics are so horrible than they looked like something out of the early to mid 90s low resolution games in comparison to today's br br the way they made this movie is almost exactly what they did in the <UNK> wing commander game namely the third installment of the series stop and make us asian look so bad at this compared to the big guns in hollywood br br sure they have big budgets and better actors but we have some of the oldest <UNK> the <UNK> and the legends the best and possibly the largest computer graphic talent base in the world so what went so very very wrong did you start using the same old companies that have been working with you for so many films please stop wasting our time and money this is the reason why hk movies are heading downhill so rapidly didn't you claim to be the hollywood of the <UNK> guess not
<START> i saw this movie when it was broadcast on television in <UNK> of 1983 i was in the hospital having just given birth to my first and only child i'll <UNK> from telling you the extent to which i was moved suffice it to say that the memory of the movie has remained with me to this day almost 23 years later i hope i can find a copy of this movie if such a thing was ever made this movie should be remembered <UNK> by anyone who ever saw it however i must admit that the fact it remains somewhat obscure is just fine by me this way it will always be a small secret to me and those who were also moved by it i never saw ms margaret perform a better part nor have i ever seen her in a more convincing role i will forever respect her just for accepting such a lovely part
<START> br br the <UNK> <UNK> female voice could have been <UNK> in heat but no it belongs to allison hayes as nancy archer the 50 foot woman of the title in the most infamous role of her film career <UNK> performance literally rips off the roof in fact make that a couple of <UNK> br br jaw <UNK> tacky is the tale of nancy a neurotic <UNK> <UNK> and her <UNK> <UNK> husband harry william hudson who also co starred opposite the amazing <UNK> man nancy has a close encounter of the third kind in the desert with a bald giant from outer space who wears a mini <UNK> and gladiator <UNK> and who has a thing for <UNK> jewelry what he does to her once he's carried her off is probably best left a mystery but soon nancy starts to grow br br <UNK> into the center of town on <UNK> tightly wrapped in nothing but the bed sheets the <UNK> heads toward the low rent saloon where harry is having a few laughs with a <UNK> named honey <UNK> <UNK> the confrontation turns ugly br br the poverty row f x make the alien giant and nancy appear to be transparent due to <UNK> <UNK> images you'll understand why director nathan changed his name to nathan on the credits was no stranger to directing giant creatures human and non having also directed the deadly <UNK> the <UNK> voyage of <UNK> jack the giant killer plus several episodes of tv's world of giants and land of the giants br br a lot of laughs for all the wrong reasons
<START> the mad monster starts in dr <UNK> <UNK> george <UNK> laboratory as he <UNK> his discovery of how to turn a human being into a vicious wolf like monster by <UNK> animal blood into a human subject who happens to be his dim witted servant glenn strange apparently he plans to put the serum at the <UNK> of the war department who will use it to create an <UNK> army of these monsters the ultimate soldier however first things first as dr cameron has his sights set on some sweet revenge on the people who <UNK> his experiments forced him to <UNK> subjected him to public <UNK> dr cameron puts his plan into action uses his monstrous creation to murder professor <UNK> robert strange in an unfortunate turn of events dr cameron is unable to control the beast is spotted by a local farmer jed <UNK> eddie <UNK> who <UNK> the news like <UNK> in another unfortunate coincidence a reporter named tom gregory johnny downs gets wind of the story starts to investigate he starts to suspect dr cameron since gregory is going out with his daughter ann he has plenty of opportunity to <UNK> around br br directed by sam this is really low budget stuff from the 40's even worse it's dull unoriginal low budget stuff the script by fred drags the extremely thin premise out to almost <UNK> minutes which is far too long there is no variety in the story it's basically the same thing over over the character's are dull clichés the mad scientist who <UNK> pointless experiments that create a monster the fragile pretty daughter the reporter who plays the hero by pure coincidence happens to both be investigating the mysterious deaths said mad scientist is responsible for is <UNK> involved with his daughter the dumb servant stupid idiotic police stereotypical shotgun wielding <UNK> who are always accused of being drunk this was probably clichéd even back in 1942 the film <UNK> along at a fairly slow pace director never manages to maintain or generate much in the way of excitement or atmosphere which is a bad thing technically the film isn't great obviously the budget was <UNK> the mad monster itself looks lame resembling an old homeless <UNK> who hasn't <UNK> for a few weeks has had a pair of plastic joke shop <UNK> placed in his mouth the black and white cinematography is basic static like most films from this period while the good dr <UNK> laboratory consists of a couch a table with a few sorry pieces of scientific equipment on top the acting is stiff wooden with looking like he's on <UNK> throughout the entire film <UNK> as the mad scientist doesn't convince is forgettable the mad monster is a pretty lame horror film there is very little here to entertain although at least i made it through to the end in a single sitting which when i think about it is a bit of an achievement in itself
<START> this film for what it was set out to be succeeded it's a short tragic film although my choice of film are ones that really develop characters and their relationships this film is meant to just give a taste leaving you with the what happens next factor after watching it i really was wanting more more of the characters back story what influences they had to make them into the people they were i think thats what the makers intended the viewing audience to think the acting is amazing there aren't many lines in the film so their body language facial expressions and overall presence needed to be powerful enough to <UNK> a scene both franco and <UNK> have that element and it shows for them especially franco to take the time to make this obviously says they believed in this film and wanted to be apart of it and for that i appreciated the film for what it was also i'm happy i own it so i can share it with other people that would've never known it existed
<START> i was watching the sci fi channel when this steaming pile of crap came on while not as bad as curse of the <UNK> this still sucks bad <UNK> uses the same island as in curse of the <UNK> as well as the same actors and house the effects are top notch <UNK> but thats about it i don't know what else to say about this movie oh yeah as in curse of the <UNK> the government gets involved and decides to bomb the island also when i saw this part i laughed hysterically a part man <UNK> and <UNK> overall this movie is utter crap even on bad movie standards just remember if jim <UNK> had anything to do with a movie steer clear to avoid from falling asleep keep repeating it's almost over it's almost over 0 out of 5
<START> watching some of the sequences <UNK> the entire 1 3 of the film devoted to the battle on the ice in alexander a film directed by the russian legend <UNK> m <UNK> co directed by in his only significant credit made me realize how much must really go into directing at least on a scale such as this if i were a member of an awards group at the time of this film's release i probably would award <UNK> with the director's award of the year <UNK> it is such a mad stroke of cinematic genius to pull off some of things that are pulled off in the film though for someone like this director after coming off of his best work <UNK> <UNK> and october it could have been something he <UNK> at at first but amid a film that is sometimes a little frustrating with how little <UNK> come in to the black and white subject matter it's still a marvel of celluloid almost 70 years later lord of the rings fans meet the <UNK> grandfather so to speak br br to say that something is a propaganda piece already puts a <UNK> to it and often a bad one it is something that has a full blown message to it and a point of view it's still a matter of hot debate see the <UNK> of argument over moore's films for proof about whether great art can come out of something that is point blank meant to <UNK> the audience in a specific manner in this particular case the russians against the germans at the time it was <UNK> ww2 and russia once again faced the and it's interesting to note that <UNK> was actually <UNK> to make this film as a <UNK> call for the russians to never forget a crucial piece of their history the end result comes out as being something that is actually slightly common from seeing <UNK> and october however if nothing else comes through those films it's that <UNK> is most concerned about how the image and the content can come together for the viewer that style can completely <UNK> the viewer without fail on those terms alexander <UNK> is <UNK> br br but even with the whole idea of great germans <UNK> there are some small moments where things are made a little less <UNK> a little less strict to these ideals for example when we first see the germans in they're not some <UNK> blob who are totally <UNK> and have a blind <UNK> intent not that they aren't out to take whatever they can they have their own national pride going too that it would be nothing less for them to go forward with whatever their christian led masters tell them to at the least the evil of the picture has a face however kept at a low minimum for the more prevalent side to kick in there's also a brief scene before the ice <UNK> battle where the russian <UNK> has a joke that's being told and laughed about and it adds a little extra depth where else there might be precious little because more often than not in alexander <UNK> with its battle songs loaded with a pride in <UNK> there aren't any <UNK> to characters most notably <UNK> himself played in ultra heroic fashion only questioning near the start by <UNK> who perhaps has to be this way in intention of having him as the one <UNK> force to be <UNK> with in the tale after all to be looking for <UNK> in an <UNK> film is like trying to find non <UNK> <UNK> feet at a <UNK> br br but the real reason to see the picture isn't the acting anyhow but for the look of the film how it moves and takes in such an <UNK> environment that <UNK> lays out on the epic scale it's just as ambitious as his <UNK> films with a number of extras not just in the main battle scenes but also in the scenes in the cities of the hundreds of people rolling on through in fact i'd say that any director working in hollywood or elsewhere thinking of doing some kind of huge epic particularly war would do very well to take a look at this film even with just the sound off it's even better if thought of as a silent film with the visual <UNK> <UNK> fantastically at times one could spend a whole month <UNK> the battle on the ice how it starts with the german soldiers far away and then coming forward like bugs and then how <UNK> inter cuts between close ups of the actors fighting and then to wide shots and with <UNK> up editing and of course one can't <UNK> the power of the music as well <UNK> delivering one of the great rousing scores of any epic work all the while the director's editing keeps our eyes moving along with this frantic action at <UNK> speed if this was just a short film it would surely rank with the <UNK> much like the <UNK> stairs sequence br br if i did find it a little less than totally magnificent it would be because of the faults that do come in from a director who is much more suited to the silent medium than for sound while i have yet to see <UNK> the terrible my one negative criticism would be of his direction of actors which is really as broad as can be with the melodrama at such a high pitch its <UNK> the sub plot of the two soldiers <UNK> for the <UNK> is the best example i can think of but even this considered alexander <UNK> overall is too extraordinary to ignore and <UNK> up an engagement in the action and the film making to a level that puts a <UNK> for films even today to try and live up to grade a
<START> what has to change in today's attitude towards films like boogie nights is the approach the approach is awful comparing it to pulp fiction seeing only the pornography and all its aspects come on people there is more than that in this beautiful motion picture and to all the hasn't paul thomas anderson proved himself worthy time and time again <UNK> is one of the main reasons i watch american films at all and still have faith in this industry that film making is today and what about there will be blood that is a film that will stay in film history whether u like it or not yeah you the so called <UNK> you know something f k you you don't deserve this you don't deserve anything so many artists today struggle to get recognition and it has become increasingly difficult to make serious films even mainstream because people just wanna see celebrities doing stupid stuff like that sell out britney spears br br anyway this was very painful for me to say because i don't want to see this i don't wanna believe that today all it matters is the adding up of numbers sales <UNK> and sales return i want to see magic the magic that fellini bergman and kurosawa brought and created through the language of cinema because thats what <UNK> is doing he is creating magic
<START> engaging characters nice animation dynamite songs all this and cute <UNK> too there's a lot of excellent humor but no real menace so don't worry about your little ones the two farm dogs steal the show even though they only appear in two scenes the artwork has a linear quality that may put off some people but i find it charming
<START> ok i gave this a three a three it deserves only one star no questions asked br br if your going to look at the movie seriously and take it as a <UNK> b horror movie than yes it will get one star but i believe it is apparent within the first minutes of the movie what we are dealing with is a piece of crap br br with this movie me and the buddy i was watching it with could of turned it off and put on something more hollywood but instead we just decided to rip this whole movie apart from start to finish we laughed so many times it was almost if i was watching a comedy br br the acting is terrible the effects and death sequences are so bad the story complete crap br br but the fact they are trying to make a serious horror movie priceless br br the most memorable part for me is when two of the characters are walking in a supposed dark basement which is clearly lit and they pretend to not be able to see <UNK> into bones hanging from the ceiling just terrible br br so if you want to laugh at how crappy this movie is along with the fact it was made in 2004 than see this movie br br wait why am i writing so much no one knows about this movie i doubt anyone will even read this <UNK>
<START> korean cinema has the ability to turn genres on its head and the latest by the celebrated director chan <UNK> park is a tale of a good <UNK> priest who becomes a vampire add a <UNK> leading him <UNK> and a cast of <UNK> and you have a wonderful recipe br br directed in part in a style similar to the sympathy trilogy it's as <UNK> as it is dark <UNK> clear of cliché it does offer some new tricks in the overdone vampire genre its an existential movie trying to capture the moral <UNK> of how exactly a person has to choose to live with their conditions rather than <UNK> in the blood lust however the film doesn't take itself too seriously and there is <UNK> humour throughout br br our leads play their roles to perfection playing with our emotions and <UNK> in the dark humour there are moments of reflection on the whole moral <UNK> involved in the film but its never preachy some might find it overlong and it can <UNK> at points but it's worth giving it a chance to the end br br if you like left field films then there are fewer better than this one of late dark and engrossing it will pull in a crowd one i'd recommend you give a try
<START> as was mentioned by others could there be any other reason to see this film other than to see former wayne's world star mike myers play a serious role the story line is interesting but lacks development and is <UNK> by loose ends and bad characters if there was any good <UNK> shots of ireland then it would give it another reason to see it but instead it focuses on a little normal village that is obviously surrounded by the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> that are often shown in irish films if there was any cultural to admire the irish personality it would be worth seeing however this could have almost been shot in england too bad for myers but this one fails to please or satisfy the heart of anybody who ever wanted to visit the land of <UNK>
<START> not since j michael <UNK> 5 has a television show captured the wonderful art of <UNK> a story arc to a television show this is easily the best thing on tv right now the characters are likable and one can easily get attached to them and care for their well being the <UNK> are the type you love to hate and leave you wondering what they're up to next and brian puppet work is the most innovative out there kudos to s for a job well done
<START> this is the last episode of the <UNK> series finds himself working in an animation studio which is rather interesting if you don't know anything about the way anime studios were run besides episode 3 this was probably the least <UNK> but it had a nice girl interest as well as a surprise reunion from others in the previous episodes my only complaint about this episode is it seemed a little too short but at the same time this may have only been because it was the only original script for the show that wasn't based on one of the manga chapters but it ended well leaving us with the nice feeling that is <UNK> 25 studying on definitely watch the rest of the series all the way through you can buy the whole series for like 17 you can watch it all the way through in about 2 1 2 hours or watch your favorite episode if you have 20 minutes free time which i do if i have a lunch break at school good series check it out
<START> hey what a great idea to open a film show someone s home movie drama schools must be full of idiots there they are taking drama lessons hoping to become the next big thing in hollywood when all you have to do is send a home movie to a studio hey i think i ll send in the video of my wedding and call it the greatest romance ever seen or send in a tape of my honeymoon and call it the greatest sex ever seen oh hold on i m not married and i <UNK> never been on honeymoon not to worry i ll send in a video of someone <UNK> wedding honeymoon br br mild spoilers br br you d think with an opening like that shark hunter could only improve <UNK> t you as shocking as it may seem the home movie is the best directed best written and best acted part of the film alas it s all downhill from here as the family go to sea in reality a fog <UNK> swimming pool in a three foot <UNK> where mom and dad get eaten by a cgi <UNK> and their son spencer <UNK> revenge against the <UNK> cut forward to the present day and the french are using an underwater research base for oil exploration only thing is and it s so obvious you can t fail to notice this it s not filmed underwater the director <UNK> t made any attempt whatsoever to even use the unconvincing technique of shooting the scene through a fish tank the underwater research base is blown up by the shark maybe it s hired by killing everyone inside and spencer now a grown man is hired to hunt down the shark that killed his parents and a bunch of <UNK> what else happens no idea because i decided to watch something else br br no hard feelings if any of the cast and crew are reading this and i do hope matt becomes a big fish in hollywood you think you know about sharks matt you t seen nothing yet
<START> stop me if you hard this one before some <UNK> their coach and a couple guys are trapped within a cabin in the woods when an unseen killer kills them off one by one shame on me after i totally wrote off jim <UNK> after the horrid <UNK> cops it was a long time coming as his last truly good film was 1990's hard to die i still for some reason got my hopes up for a supposed sequel to <UNK> party massacre sadly even my mediocre expectations were not met this outing is not nearly as fun as even the three previous films in the franchise and yes i'm including 2 that should tell you something furthermore how can you have a slasher film with this little gore i mean come on now br br my grade d br br eye candy ricky ray gets topless april flowers and charity show boobs and <UNK> in a shower scene april gets nude again later in the film and <UNK> gets topless and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> director <UNK> <UNK> ford cast mike <UNK> <UNK> christy fritz ford <UNK> <UNK> br br based on the number of comments i see on imdb this seems to be a forgotten movie this seems rather ironic to me because it is actually one of the first movies that i remember my mom took me and my little brother to see this film at the garland theater in <UNK> when it first came out in the mid 1970's and i still remember it br br i am going by memory here but i believe this move is about a <UNK> who was accused of a crime which he did not commit and the law goes after him i believe it to be set in <UNK> <UNK> a narrator tells the story of the <UNK> played by mike <UNK> really this is a very good film with a great setting it could be compared to the 1981 film death hunt with charles bronson the two films have a very similar story line the main difference between the two is death hunt is an adult <UNK> film whereas challenge is a family friendly film br br mike <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> were both rather old when this movie was made which i find rather impressive when one considers that this movie was filmed on location in the <UNK> of <UNK> this was the last film made by <UNK> <UNK> before he died which was just a few years later they both had been around since the silent era
<START> batman returns it is my opinion that the first batman of the batman series was only half the movie that batman returns is in the first batman by tim burton we had only batman and the joker both played wonderfully by michael keaton and jack nicholson br br in batman returns we have what i feel is the most perfectly cast batman movie yes even better then dark knight keaton returns as batman and is perfect in the role never going to far over top with the character of batman which is perfect in this film when it comes to the two villains that he's up against first you have danny <UNK> who is delightfully insane as the penguin then you have michelle pfeiffer as cat woman who i dare to say is one of the most interesting and complex villains in the batman movies i feel this way about pfeiffer because of the way she becomes the cat woman she starts off as the rather pathetic <UNK> <UNK> kyle and then truly <UNK> into the dark side of her mind and what you get is a brilliant performance of a woman who goes from trying to be a hero to a villain and then i suppose back to a hero in the end also in this amazing cast you have the evil businessman max <UNK> played by the amazing and legendary christopher walken while in a supporting role there's something about this role that i love and maybe it's the look of <UNK> in the film that makes his performance all the better then it already is br br story wise i have to say that batman returns has so much more going on this time around as opposed to the first batman part of the reason i loved this story so much is the fact that burton <UNK> to go in a much more darker and twisted direction as opposed to <UNK> over the top antics you have the story on the penguin and how he tries to <UNK> the people of <UNK> into making him the new hero and mayor of the city then you have cat woman and her struggle to decide just who she really is and what she should do with her new persona when it comes to batman i feel that in this one he's more the ring leader that holds the two stories together but of course kicking ass at the same time br br cinematography was the film is dark and atmospheric just like the story that's taking place within it <UNK> city never looked as good as it does on <UNK> ray and <UNK> so if you have the chance to see it this way then by all means do because it truly adds to the overall experience of batman returns br br so all in i truly feel that of all the batman movies batman returns believe it or not tops the dark knight for me because while i enjoyed that movie for heath <UNK> amazing performance as the joker i felt that the movie was lacking something batman returns lacks nothing so if you want to see an amazing film with what i feel is a perfect cast then this is the batman to light the bat <UNK> for
<START> if you read errol <UNK> autobiography my wicked wicked ways you will see that this film is full of poetic <UNK> not that that makes much of a difference because errol flynn was pretty generous with poetic <UNK> in the autobiography anyway no need to worry about spoilers since there is nothing there to spoil br br to me it would seem more sensible to use the story about a <UNK> hollywood actor then you could go out and find a better actor than <UNK> <UNK> to play him and you wouldn't have to worry about the audience saying things like but he didn't have a <UNK> in captain blood another failing of this film is that it shows flynn as a two dimensional character flynn was an intelligent man well educated well read this film only concentrates on his image br br <UNK> is a disaster the rest of the cast struggle with their scripts hal <UNK> is ok as warner and barbara <UNK> makes a believable <UNK> although <UNK> <UNK> herself did not think so br br the best thing to do with this film is to forget about it and let it gently slip away to oblivion so what i am writing this for i can't imagine
<START> i usually enjoy watching laurel and hardy but this is obviously one of the films they made while they were on their way to becoming a successful comedy team br br the plot is all too simple and is mainly based on one joke how strange <UNK> and <UNK> are and that's all okay there are some other jokes but i didn't find them very funny at all they are outdated and i guess were not very entertaining when the movie was first released br br still the movie has got two of the most charming faces in history and they make the best out of the awkward story which i expect was filmed without a proper script and the scenery is nice to look at br br in my opinion watching this is only worthwhile for laurel and hardy fans other people should stay away from it
<START> this was the worst movie my wife and i have ever seen the only <UNK> is that we did not pay to see it at the movies as we rented this on dvd from the video store simply no plot worth mentioning i only watched it 5 minutes ago and already i have forgotten annoying characters played poorly by two bit actors and if this was suppose a comedy i am still waiting to laugh in fact the only laugh we got out of the movie was that we <UNK> with each other that we agreed it was truly awful br br put simply this movie was quite utterly pathetic and i warn others to not waste their time a travesty of the national lampoon name rating 0 10
<START> i loved the original i watch it every year but the second is a piece of garbage and it never should have been made the second could have worked if there was a different location the son was not an original or didn't even act like one of <UNK> kids third was too smart for eddie which <UNK> his father role none of the other kids where in it it just could of been a lot better i don't know why they even tried to make this movie there was no from the first movie i will pretend that this one doesn't even exist it is sad that the actors didn't even see that they where made fools of a really bad movie i just think that i wasted an hour or more on a bad movie and i really love all of the national lampoon films
<START> what alice found was a pleasant discovery as written and directed by a dean bell this is combination of a road movie with a <UNK> tale as well as a voyage of discovery br br if you haven't seen the film maybe you should stop reading here br br alice is a case study of a young woman that wants to break away from the unhappy life she leads in a new england town her <UNK> for leaving is going to join her best friend who is away studying at a miami university alice is the product of a single mother's home one that is struggling to make ends meet in sharp contrast with the life of ease her friend seems to inhabit in flashbacks we get to see <UNK> life before going on the road br br alice like her <UNK> in alice in wonderland <UNK> in a trip to the unknown that life hasn't prepared her for the <UNK> of america are full of <UNK> in search of the weak and innocent alice meets with disaster when her car breaks down the road and a friendly southern couple come to her assistance when a strange man approaches in the darkness with the excuse he wants to help her sandra and bill convince her to come along in their <UNK> r v on her way down south br br nothing has prepared alice for what this couple turns out to be after all in her <UNK> life she hasn't dealt with what sandra and bill her new <UNK> do during the overnight stays at the rest stops in the american <UNK> it comes as a shock to her the realization that the kind sandra is nothing but a prostitute that <UNK> her trade among the truck driving <UNK> one meets in those places br br alice brilliantly played by emily grace is a study in how the young woman <UNK> to the new reality she can't escape in fact sandra makes it seem so easy that alice tries her luck at the oldest profession on earth in order to raise some badly needed money br br <UNK> gives a tremendous performance as sandra ms is perfect as the seemingly normal woman one wouldn't suspect she is doing the nasty with <UNK> she and bill find along the route they travel ms is amazing when she reveals the truth about her life to an <UNK> alice as the husband bill raymond is good in his portrayal as the husband that in reality is a <UNK> br br under the excellent direction of mr dean bell the film is not afraid to go to places mainstream films dare not to go <UNK> to this director who has written a plausible story and has gathered the perfect cast to play it for our benefit
<START> this was an interesting movie i could have done without the bathroom scene and the seduction scene <UNK> other than that i loved the head <UNK> music this movie <UNK> around chris parents are awesome they totally support their sons interests and believe in him enough to support him now that is awesome what really surprised me was the <UNK> realization at the end it was not quite the hollywood ending on his road to self discovery the overall rise to stardom and the fall of it was quite a roller coaster ride
<START> i felt compelled to give some <UNK> on this movie that i rented from blockbuster this movie has it all comedy drama crime suspense and realism br br this movie also had a lot of action with just the right amount of humor i will definitely watch it again there were some funny parts as well as action packed drama i enjoy movies that keep you wondering what's going to happen next br br the writer director travis should make more movies in my overall opinion this movie was great i'm looking forward to his next one travis has real talent as a writer and director
<START> in what attempts to be a positive story dolph lundgren leads a group of <UNK> to take over a <UNK> island that looks a lot like paradise so that the men who hired his team can mine it for bird <UNK> actually the gas that exudes from the <UNK> on this island is what they are after br br there was only one good thing about this movie the island location in which it was filmed was beautiful otherwise the story <UNK> itself leaving the actors with nothing to work with result a lot of violence a lot of language lots of blood and a few shots of women topless if you want pointless violence sorry the storyline can't even give the violence a point though it tries then this is the movie for you br br parents be warned that this movie is full of violence and blood driving the r rating
<START> i have just caught this movie on tcm and can understand why george murphy went into politics if this was the best mgm could serve up to him it is so slow moving that the attempt to make it a real film noir effort does not come off it featured two of my favourite br br players in eve <UNK> completely wasted and dean <UNK> the best actor in the film but what really hit me was that the leading lady frances <UNK> went through some 90 minutes it seemed longer without changing the expression on her face her <UNK> scene was comical john <UNK> played his role ok but the script let him and the rest of the cast down very badly i gave it 4 stars mainly because of the photography it would have been on the first half of the program when double features were the go
<START> once <UNK> the hands of fate that was worse than this quite a bit worse but it did have one thing it had beautiful women in <UNK> each other for about 20 minutes this has a fat 45 year old with 3 tits and a tail in a <UNK> scene <UNK> directly from star wars not to mention an <UNK> blue <UNK> <UNK> her fat legs and ass hanging out of some sort of insane bird costume in this method acting mess she always wanted to perform before a captive audience she must have meant the poor <UNK> who <UNK> out 8 bucks hoping to see another wrath of khan or at least a voyage home captive is right i wonder how many people in the theaters tried to <UNK> their <UNK> while crying out mother make it stop br br no question about it final frontier is not just an <UNK> disaster it's cruel and unusual punishment this is star trek from hell this is shatner on <UNK> or maybe <UNK> this is where no man has gone before and wished he never had in the first place or to <UNK> a review of <UNK> gate it's as if gene <UNK> sold his soul to the devil for the success of a tv series and devil is just now coming around to collect br br and don't even get me started on a drunken kirk and a <UNK> mccoy singing row row row your boat together like they were lovers in some sort of demented gay fever dream then we've got the hideous dynamic duo of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> through the woods together probably en route to a barry <UNK> concert then there's laurence as <UNK> brother yeah right amazing how these relations we never heard of suddenly crawl out of the <UNK> when we need a new plot line and not to forget spock <UNK> through the air after kirk when he falls from a cliff in <UNK> sure he catches up to kirk and saves him one foot away from the ground <UNK> you get those nifty rocket shoes spock
<START> surface was awesome i don't know how many <UNK> i survived at school just by thinking about the new episode of surface i loved it sometimes i had to call home and tell my mom to tape it for me i was pretty upset when i heard it was cancelled i mean <UNK> way to let us hang so they can have their new tina fay comedy you couldn't pay me to watch that i think seeing the commercials made me dumber i'm gonna miss my monday night fix of surface even if my sister did make fun of me although kidnapped does look good and they still have l o <UNK> i think i still have to check i only wrote the 2 lines above because they said i needed ten lines
<START> one of the better musical <UNK> dennis morgan is great as the singer composer <UNK> the supporting cast is very good especially <UNK> king as the glamorous <UNK> russell the turn of the century atmosphere is the perfect setting the technicolor is excellent a simple plot but the movie just makes you feel good morgan was always underrated as an actor and a singer
<START> as if reality shows like american idol weren't enough in which judges like simon shoot razor sharp <UNK> to contestants trying to make their mark on the music world <UNK> that many a time has reduced even outstanding singers to tears after what was deemed a bad performance now america's next top model has for the past three years <UNK> the <UNK> tube with its own version of looking for the next big thing in a business that values <UNK> concepts of beauty and body br br a concept created by <UNK> banks who is also a judge in the show it <UNK> some fifteen contestants from all walks of life and has them submit themselves to <UNK> tasks in which they must prove their talent in front of the camera and subject themselves not only to the now <UNK> <UNK> dickinson self dubbed <UNK> first <UNK> but the equally <UNK> jay <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> who may at one point focus on one girl not performing well and <UNK> rip her to <UNK> like it was bad morning coffee like in many other reality based shows each week one contestant is voted off and must pack her <UNK> and immediately leave a thing that they are reminded by <UNK> at every turn of course there is the bitchy tension between several of the more type a females female bonding tears dramatic <UNK> of music in key moments and some truly breathtaking pictures that <UNK> <UNK> ordinary pretty girls into <UNK> <UNK> br br i'll have to admit the show is a guilty pleasure maybe it's the state of mind i'm in but i kept wondering where the was in cases when the already thin girls would need to <UNK> to make the cut and look the way the judges and <UNK> and many <UNK> <UNK> would feel was correct for the moment even so it's drawn me in despite my previous paragraph possibly because i've always had an interest in the fashion world and have always loved watching stunning women being made even more <UNK> with make up and perfect lighting but i wonder where are they going with these increasingly difficult photo shoots it's as if they were competing with fear factor shoots that look like re <UNK> of fight scenes in <UNK> tiger hidden dragon shoots where the models have to pose underwater or in almost impossible situations what's next posing while tied to train tracks as an <UNK> <UNK> upon them at 70 miles an hour or a shoot where they are underwater <UNK> trying to set themselves free in record time while at the same time looking <UNK> in <UNK> and never ever forgetting to smile their <UNK> whites at that camera how about a pit and the <UNK> version of a photo shoot br br in one thing the show has to be given some kudos and it's in a way akin to american idol with this i'm probably going to justify the <UNK> of both shows and its <UNK> judges and essentially go against my initial paragraph america's next top model is a show that is an extended audition like american idol and in it the girls will get the sort of test treatment they will receive in the real world where <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> as they can be will crush them to bits at the drop of a hat if they can't sell themselves the way they're expected to and where one is asked to leave another will <UNK> her with the necessary <UNK> which makes it a wonder that any girl would want to get into such a difficult media but that's what dreams are made of br br going into its fifth season it's been a major disappointment with the departure of <UNK> dickinson during her run she was a pretty tough <UNK> as to how the girls should walk talk <UNK> express themselves and ultimately present themselves as a walking living product that sells with the cold addition of <UNK> i wonder where it will go from here <UNK> just can't replace the over the top <UNK> of dickinson so with <UNK> absence the show has lost some of its edge and may even have <UNK> its slow demise but in the meantime it's still a catchy pleasure to watch mindless entertainment on if at all for the gorgeous visuals if at all it's the show that launched <UNK> <UNK> into the spotlight <UNK> has made a name for herself due to facts that have less to do with <UNK> as much as her love affair with one time child actor christopher knight in their very own reality soap opera
<START> this is one of my favorite <UNK> <UNK> comedies this movie is just meant to be enjoyed not <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it's not religious commentary it's fun it's fantasy the surprisingly negative comments imho reflect a level of expectation that professional film critics have led us to think must be a part of every movie br br others have described <UNK> role it's the reason you'll watch the movie over and over and the excellent supporting cast including <UNK> br br sometimes a <UNK> is just a <UNK> sometimes a movie is just fun br br enjoy
<START> spoiler nothing but spoiler br br i have to add my name to the list of folks who feel that the other viewers just don't get it but no one has even mentioned the s word so far as i have seen br br while i agree that the kid died i think we can be more specific he committed suicide he races down the <UNK> in an old <UNK> shoots off the cliff and flies away maybe the whole account of the form of death is allegory or maybe he does commit suicide in a <UNK> as laid out in either case he flies away c'mon not that tough a metaphor br br maybe i just have a thing for tom hanks but i was ok with the narration besides he is raising for the ww2 <UNK> and you gotta love him for that br br oh yeah i loved the movie and found it incredibly moving
<START> picture the scene a bored student with an empty day ahead a video shop with a special offer of 5 video for a week <UNK> this ex student usually just grabbed a pile of videos of dubious quality for the most <UNK> of reasons the turning anybody occasionally the odd <UNK> gem did make it into his vcr this being the case with this film everything about the film is good but much more than this the parts all <UNK> to provide something all too rare a cracking good film why this never got a uk cinema release is beyond me especially when we consider the crap that we have to <UNK> through at the <UNK> week on week whilst i'll happily accept this isn't oscar material but neither was <UNK> titanic <UNK> cgi <UNK> <UNK> it is a an extremely enjoyable film i was trying to think of a way to describe how best this film should be appreciated accepted the perfect film to watch while bonding with your dad after a coming home for the holidays after a large sunday lunch
<START> this movie is simply bad first of all the story is just weird and it's not good written it leaves you with questions when you're finished sometimes that's ok but not in this case br br the acting is nothing to write home about the adults does a ok job but the kids taken in consideration they are kids does not a good job i thought the lead role ian <UNK> as mickey was worst well to be honest i'm not sure that was the lead role never quite figured who this movie was about mickey or pete br br there were some shots that stood out but over all there were nothing <UNK> about the cinematography the sound however was better there was a nice score a little adventure kind of score though this didn't look like an adventure film to me it had some elements of an adventure film but it was more of a drama however it was hard to tell who this film was meant for children hardly there is too much language and violence for that adults i don't know it had to many elements of a children's movie in it it was like a adult movie in a children movie <UNK> br br the story was just weird i don't have much of an idea of what it really was about you was thrown right in to it without knowing anything but there were all the time references to something you felt you should know the fact that the children's parents were dead for instance and that mickey blamed pete for it you expected to get to know what happened but you never got br br all together this movie was bad and a waste of time there was no drive in it nothing to really move the story forward this is not what you spend your saturday night on
<START> kirk and the crew are visiting a <UNK> mining colony on a remote planet rich in <UNK> resources the devil in the dark is the a very unusual <UNK> based life form which <UNK> through solid rock the has been killing <UNK> and it is decided must be destroyed but how br br it is hard to continue this review without writing a spoiler so instead i simply concentrate on the technical aspects of the episode and touch on its themes the special effects are ok but many of the scenes with the look a little absurd the acting is fairly average for <UNK> some of the <UNK> are a little awkward <UNK> has the most difficult role of all in devil in the dark and he pulls it off well br br why is this still a favorite of mine br br devil in the dark is really an <UNK> and <UNK> morality play disguised as an adventure more than many episodes of this great tv series it brings home the importance of maintaining an open mind and at least some degree of empathy toward others plus it involves one of the most interesting if not <UNK> plot twists in the original series br br enjoy
<START> i know a lot of people like this show and i <UNK> to people who think this show is awesome but it is the worst show ever created sure i'm sure i would be a big fan of this show if jeremy <UNK> wasn't on it i mean i think that testing out cars and doing things like seeing whether a car can beat a <UNK> is awesome but jeremy <UNK> is just pathetic here are the reasons i hate this man he thinks it's cool to trick speed cameras that measure your average speed by taking <UNK> your distance and time by driving down the road and then <UNK> for two hours he clearly thinks that he is better than richard <UNK> and james may he's got my best friend saying pathetic things he screams at kids just for taking a picture of him i'm sorry top gear but jeremy <UNK> is a freak
<START> yes lifetime has a habit of making the male species look stupid and this soap opera ain't kidding when they make perry king supposedly a well renowned medical doctor unable to see the evil surrounding him puts your trust in doctors huh how can anyone not see what's going on is he that stupid and the evil wife with a face like a horse goes around killing off his entire family without a trace how does she <UNK> all the drugs that isn't explained how does she get off being a secretary in a hospital without any <UNK> i guess the director don asks us to just believe it i didn't i kept yelling at the screen at the stupidity of king with all right in front of his face if the wife was that attractive maybe just maybe i'd accept it but she's not even that shannon <UNK> is the perfect wife and i tell you she has the face of a horse i wouldn't cross the street for her yet our perfect husband does and quickly after everybody in the cast get knocked off i wasn't satisfied with the come up <UNK> given to our <UNK> she deserved more than she got william <UNK> plays the doctor's brother who unfortunately you know his outcome from day one pleasure to at least see one pretty face in this <UNK> that of <UNK> anne down she gives the film a 2 count just on the relief of seeing someone <UNK> in this mess perry king deserved his fate what a jerk
<START> i cannot see why anyone would make such a movie from start to finish this film is really really bad br br the characters are all very shallow terribly acted and downright annoying there is absolutely nothing going on below the surface at all with either characters or plot br br the <UNK> if you can call it that is aimed at an adult audience i presume from the language and nudity although it comes across as mainly toilet humour and would have problems even drawing a smile from a half witted 16 year old br br i would recommend avoiding this excuse for a comedy it has nothing whatsoever that would appeal to a film fan non existent laughs and a plot that barely exists lead me to ask why has this film been made why why why br br i expect in the <UNK> of time to see this film <UNK> the top 100 worst films
<START> watching death bed the bed that eats is like waking up in the hospital two days into a suicide br br watch <UNK> but oddly stimulating there are few cinematic <UNK> to this disturbing yet often humorous lesson in mythology morality and <UNK> ideology br br <UNK> blood of a poet and <UNK> br br experimental works evoke a taste of the strange atmosphere found in death bed a close comparison are the dark adult fairy tales by literary genius author angela carter the short disturbing stories of br br or e t a hoffman br br death bed has many recognizable elements of the br br past but displays a wholly unique and original storyline br br as a story death bed is an amazingly simple yet original br br vision something which only one in a thousand independent releases will manage to accomplish this <UNK> film has its technical flaws but <UNK> them all with a cast of beautiful non actors br br and lost creepy locations a true 1970s independent classic br br death bed also displays a unique <UNK> 3 dimensional personality a deep and continuous <UNK> of dream images and ideas that lend it a fun house type of <UNK> the passage of time told in flashbacks and historic time <UNK> the bed with its sinister black humor the rich yet understated symbolism used within its imagery most pleasing is the image of <UNK> the suffering artist forever trapped inside the frame of his own painting as he comments on and <UNK> with the murdered victim offerings gifted to him as love offerings by the demented spirit a sick <UNK> and wonderful element metaphor for the trapped artist nothing but the <UNK> in poe or can equal that br br anyone who values the spirit of independent cinema and <UNK> the multi layered <UNK> experience or <UNK> the <UNK> concept of <UNK> br br beauty and the gothic horror <UNK> of low budget exploitation film making will dig this totally unique vision a simple and fun film with deliciously deep psychic <UNK> highly recommended
<START> i saw this film on at the <UNK> film festival br br the <UNK> only in a couple of short flashbacks the whole thing is about <UNK> life from to <UNK> when he was <UNK> in kent with his growing family 200 pages of origin had already been <UNK> and he was wondering whether to complete the book br br the script is based on book <UNK> box annie <UNK> daughter died when she was 10 it is mostly a family drama but does include sex scenes however the participants are married both on and off screen not too exciting not much science but a well made film that's pleasant to watch and pushes the right emotional buttons a bit of a romantic <UNK> actually i suppose the conclusion is that you can be an <UNK> free thinking scientist from an <UNK> family background and still be an emotional romantic as well as an excellent father br br some of the characters and <UNK> himself state or wonder whether he killed god but the viewer is able to doubt that what is beyond doubt given the deadly struggle for survival and the web of <UNK> on the <UNK> bank well known before <UNK> and completely and the failure of <UNK> <UNK> is that the idea of a kind god who loves his creatures is <UNK> br br i really cannot see many americans to it very much some may have problems with the title which is probably the most controversial thing about the film or with the fact that <UNK> does not have <UNK> a tail and a <UNK>
<START> well the name in the summary should tell you everything fred <UNK> ray the modern king of low budget flicks be it for tv or direct to video i doubt he produces for the silver screen anymore with the death of drive in b movie double features and all br br creator of such cult classics like hollywood chainsaw <UNK> and dinosaur island br br well i kind of like this guys stuff its mostly entertaining in a distinctly cheesy campy and especially cheap kind of way and if he's one thing he's a pro something you can't say for all guys in the movie <UNK> br br but this one flick here is among the weaker ones in his insipid acting an uninspired script and lame jokes <UNK> to make your brain go <UNK> in a matter of minutes if you are out for real f o r goodness or rather badness look out for the above mentioned ones and generally his stuff from the 70s and 80s i think he lost a bit of his edge lately
<START> having just watched this with my mother who got it for christmas i was thrilled to find something different to the usual stuff i usually watch all of the stories were detailed and you are able to feel strong emotion towards each character from the very beginning every storyline is followed through brilliantly making you feel completely different things for every single character the cast is amazing my personal favourites being james read and <UNK> anne down as george <UNK> and <UNK> main the whole thing is in depth and wonderful making very <UNK> viewing i recommend it to almost everyone
<START> many years ago i saw this movie on television maybe and loved it so i decided to rent it on dvd the other day to see whether it still held up in my <UNK> it did br br set in notorious king's cross district where prostitution drug abuse and sex stores <UNK> it tells the story of jimmy played by heath ledger jimmy is a young man maybe late teens or <UNK> who hasn't had a stable family background he is on the <UNK> of society and works as a for a sex club <UNK> people to enter the store he is aware of an underworld figure called who is a local <UNK> in the cross it's <UNK> hope that he will find himself on radar and get <UNK> with him a short cut to <UNK> social <UNK> he hopes br br one night jimmy meets the beautiful young woman alex played by the charming rose <UNK> you just know that a love story will play out between them on that night as well jimmy is first <UNK> by played by bryan brown has a for jimmy it's the in the <UNK> that jimmy has been waiting for br br to reveal too much more would spoil the many surprises that this movie has in store for the viewer <UNK> if you like quentin tarantino or guy ritchie movies you should be in tune with what to expect twists and turns and black comedy br br what's so great about this movie is its very it's no mere knock off of tarantino or ritchie but a genuine australian contribution to the genre br br a fascinating aspect to this movie is how it all hangs together sometimes you are introduced to characters who you wonder what the hell they're doing there in the end all these <UNK> tie together beautifully it's sort of like a celluloid strip br br a highlight of the movie is bryan <UNK> character of likes <UNK> and it's fun to see him play games with his <UNK> it's the little details revealed about him which are so enjoyable his taste in music for starters br br of the heath ledger movies i have seen the dark knight 10 things i hate about you this is perhaps his best role wasn't taken with 10 things if you are a heath ledger fan ledger recently died a tragic accidental death this is a chance to see him in his greatest australian role i think there is great chemistry between ledger and <UNK> in this movie so on one level it functions as nice love story br br this movie doesn't have some of the horror of tarantino and ritchie underworld movies but it does have some adult themes scenes that surprise you with their <UNK> and beauty in that sense it's not an ideal movie for very young viewers but it's not a movie that gore <UNK> will get excited about either br br lastly i have to say that it is great that australia can make great movies like this usually the kind of movies my home country makes can be this movie has strengths where many australian movies have weaknesses i e it has a great story great acting and a great script we need more popular quality movies like this to be made here in australia br br highly recommended other australian movies i have loved include br br <UNK> <UNK> 10 10 mad max 2 10 10 my brilliant career not reviewed here by me yet proof <UNK> the devil's <UNK> <UNK> the year my voice broke <UNK> bad boy <UNK> <UNK> a great dark comedy the dish <UNK> a great charming comedy
<START> some movies are just  unlucky these are the films that obviously <UNK> on a lot of <UNK> and a handful of potentially great ideas but simply didn't have the <UNK> means and or professional cast and crew members at their <UNK> to make it happen the <UNK> definitely belongs in this category you really want to like it but even the most <UNK> and <UNK> 80's horror fanatics will have to admit the film barely reaches the level of mediocrity due to its atmosphere of <UNK> clumsy stop motion effects and dark cinematography the <UNK> has a fairly original plot and setting okay it's similar to the <UNK> but i sincerely doubt that director david michael <UNK> intentionally ripped off a fellow insignificant 80's b movie and the players deliver <UNK> performances even though they're all miscast an <UNK> of amateur go on an expedition to explore the infamous gold spike mine many years ago several <UNK> mysteriously died there and the place has abandoned ever since but there's supposed to be too much gold hidden there to remain closed forever shortly after they <UNK> into the mine the group members one by one encounter the slimy <UNK> of the gold spike mine a <UNK> monster with <UNK> and an incredibly cheesy way of moving forward throughout most of its running time the <UNK> is a boring and incompetent mess that is difficult to follow due to the complete lack of lighting the characters are uninteresting and the mine remains a mystery because the only lighting effects come from the <UNK> of the there's very little action or horror to experience in the first hour but director <UNK> cleverly <UNK> the <UNK> attention by showing bits and pieces of the monster at regular <UNK> as soon as you catch the first glimpse of the <UNK> <UNK> you're doomed to keep watching till the very end the creature is realized with stop motion effects which i usually adore and worship but here in this case they look extremely weak and <UNK> the person responsible for the special effects should have paid more attention to the work of ray the death sequences largely occur off screen and there's very little suspense throughout the whole movie a horror flick with a setting like this should <UNK> from claustrophobic atmosphere and <UNK> sound effects but the <UNK> lacks all this the biggest <UNK> of the film is <UNK> the beautiful appearance of blond actress <UNK> she resembles a as much as i resemble mother <UNK> but she surely looks good in her tight white top and <UNK> pants
<START> a confusing senseless script with plot holes the size of the tower terrible acting by all involved no exception laughable and cheesy dialogue lame attempts at humor and romance extremely cheap special effects all this makes for a giant mess of a film you'd best avoid
<START> <UNK> ted <UNK> is a doctor who goes missing at sea leaving pregnant wife mary mary <UNK> behind eight years later he turns up <UNK> and seemingly mad <UNK> about his adventures in the lands of the tiny the giant the floating island of the intellectual laputa and the a race of intelligent talking horses who have to deal with the <UNK> a race of <UNK> humans among many other adventures the not so good dr bates james fox who has designs on wife has <UNK> <UNK> in a mental institution and mary and son thomas tom must find a way to prove his sanity br br a splendid adaptation of jonathan <UNK> satirical novel this film is a magnificent adaptation on so many levels the story the satire the characters the visuals the brilliant cast it's simply a treat to watch and it's almost amazing considering that it was a made for tv film br br the film does a brilliant job of capturing <UNK> vicious satire which cuts like a <UNK> through british society of the time but still <UNK> today the wise and the are almost perfect individuals who find it virtually impossible to understand why <UNK> speaks with such pride of the <UNK> and of his society the scenes where <UNK> struggles to prove himself different from the <UNK> are perhaps the best with biting satire in describing how they pick their leaders they seem to pick the worst among them who rules until they find someone even worse go to war we only go to war for a very good reason such as they are weaker than us or we want all of their land etc the scenes involving laputa are also effectively done the <UNK> are so wrapped up in their <UNK> fields that they have no time for anything else and really possess little common sense and the addition of the asylum plot line enhances the story greatly dr bates is truly nasty character and when he gives a speech to the <UNK> on <UNK> alleged <UNK> it's quite clear that he's describing his own faults br br the film makes use of beautiful and fairly convincing cgi effects depicting the very diverse settings of the novel with great effect the contrast of <UNK> is done in a very <UNK> way and all of the worlds depicted in the story are convincing in their own way the cinematography particularly that concerning the asylum and the costumes are brilliantly done the editing of the present with memories is a device which could be awkward but works very well br br the cast is truly wonderful a <UNK> who's who of british and american talent ted <UNK> gives an excellent multi layered performance as <UNK> showing effectively his transformation from a person <UNK> by his strange surroundings to the lunatic state he was in when he <UNK> to his rational intellectual personality at the end most well known for his work on sit com <UNK> shows that he's more than just sam malone with this wonderful <UNK> comic performance mary <UNK> is effective as his wife and james fox is absolutely repulsive as bates the rest of the cast is made up mostly of cameos with peter o'toole omar <UNK> <UNK> davis <UNK> scott thomas <UNK> chaplin <UNK> <UNK> edward fox and sir john gielgud being the most memorable but even the smallest parts are very well played br br while not 100 faithful to the book <UNK> travels is a triumph of story and images it's not to be missed br br 9 10
<START> my 10 10 rating of course applies only if you're willing to get completely and utterly <UNK> out because you know that only john waters can do that in pink <UNK> his directorial debut he portrays two families locked in combat to see who can be the <UNK> person alive what divine <UNK> does at the end pretty much answers the question but even aside from that the movie is basically an excuse to shock people beyond what anyone would usually imagine you had better have a very strong stomach to watch this movie even some of the lines are rather mind blowing br br otherwise avoid this movie like you would the <UNK> virus
<START> this movie is an obvious rip off of underworld usa starring cliff robertson you owe it to yourself to <UNK> a couple of hours and watch the original i found this one to be disjointed and hard to follow with a lot of scenes that didn't make much sense i'm not opposed to violence in movies but this whole thing seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to blow away one person after another many of whom were only <UNK> connected with the storyline with everyone else getting killed all through the movie i wondered why frank didn't just blow <UNK> brains out he certainly could have and johnny sure didn't act like someone that could be trusted another thing that bothers me is the sex scenes why do these people have sex with their clothes on is that supposed to turn us on surely they didn't think they had a shot at a pg rating nothing in this movie seemed to play out naturally as if one were watching people in real life instead it was done in a heavy handed and shallow manner
<START> for anyone who has ever sought happiness half empty is a must see this original cross cultural musical comedy has hilarious numbers which make the producers seem <UNK> <UNK> writer bob <UNK> puts his soul into sharing his thoughts on life wisdom and happiness even <UNK> inspirational comments on <UNK> cards as his girlfriend <UNK> her heart out ending their relationship when his book on happiness north star finds zero success in the states his <UNK> send him to germany for a book <UNK> tour while explaining their decision to bob the <UNK> <UNK> into a rousing song which would make monty python proud from his arrival in <UNK> <UNK> complete ignorance of the german language leaves him at a distinct <UNK> however he soldiers on <UNK> of his <UNK> true feelings towards him until a wildly devoted fan arrives and changes everyone's reaction toward him br br the original songs <UNK> the film often describing the subtext of the story in side splitting <UNK> the cast led by robert peters exhibit an <UNK> dry sense of humor and inhabit their characters as if they were not acting see it for a case study of how good intentions are totally irrelevant how <UNK> americans abroad are viewed how little reason it takes to burst into song and above all for a silly entertaining unconventional laugh
<START> i was expecting this movie to suck but what i got was a pretty good slasher gore film most of the death scenes are adequately brutal the teens are decent with penny definitely the best of the bunch <UNK> taylor looks like a young christie but doesn't bring much to the movie other than that kane was good as the killer and is totally believable as a <UNK> <UNK> i saw the twist coming from miles away but i still enjoyed the movie br br but what really stood out to me was the direction gregory dark might actually have a career in <UNK> film ahead of him aside from the horror film speed <UNK> you know where like the guy's face shakes all fast there's some good shots here the camera angles and <UNK> really emphasize <UNK> size making him look even bigger than he actually is br br if you're looking for deep story or characters this ain't it but that's not what slasher films are about if you're looking for some good violence or if you're into gory films go check this out
<START> italians movie makers love to rip off american movies all of our movies and as often as possible br br i'm not stating that as a <UNK> against italy as a whole but i would like to further observe that the italian film industry does itself great harm by allowing like this to go overseas to be seen by the world at large that's all i'm saying br br and no more grave injury do the italian people subject themselves to than by not sticking a harsh penalty upon those who made the world watch shark <UNK> which is admittedly a ripoff of the far superior jaws as if you didn't know br br let's dive into the plot get it <UNK> <UNK> this huge monstrous swimming thing that looks like a cross between an <UNK> a shark and steven tyler attacks many innocent americans ie italians off the coast of florida ie italy and the <UNK> beer <UNK> peter <UNK> out with his <UNK> beer <UNK> girlfriend and other beer <UNK> people whose main purposes are to be eaten by the creature killed by mysterious forces who want the creature left alone or just stand around and be otherwise useless and <UNK> beer or be the doctor in this film who dying patients repeatedly 20 maybe 30 times in a row without waiting for his <UNK> to must be one heck of a good <UNK> there doc br br then there's the monster brother if you thought the jaws shark was fake look <UNK> and have your mind changed immediately br br this is a movie that was directed as an <UNK> by a <UNK> edited with an <UNK> <UNK> acted by beer <UNK> pieces of <UNK> and written by presumably beer <UNK> people who should never ever ever ever be let near a <UNK> movie studio or major city in the world ever again if this is how the people who made this film think real people act in such a situation they've obviously made one too many of them zombie movies or too much beer br br need i say this movie is bad it is bad like green <UNK> cheese bad like a <UNK> shirt at a <UNK> wedding bad like the bad theatre skits dan <UNK> used to host on saturday night live bad like <UNK> weight gain get it good br br mike and the <UNK> gang slap this beer drunk beauty upside the head repeatedly and reveal this horror film as what it is horrible though with a certain european charm it's charming when watched by a european preferably a beer <UNK> one br br no stars for the <UNK> dead fish known as shark <UNK> six stars for the mst3k version and now anyone for a beer br br
<START> there ought to be some kind of <UNK> to <UNK> producers from <UNK> screenplays this stupid i feel that some kind of of bad film might prevent more films this idiotic from being made sure it has an interesting cast of characters but i don't think i've ever seen a more cardboard performance from an entire cast as in this uniquely crappy piece of crap that director ought to be <UNK> somehow for not <UNK> at least some kind of performance out of these people so <UNK> is a theme no really they'll beat you over the head with this one it doesn't mean every character has to <UNK> their lines as if they on <UNK> did i mention this movie was crappy lastly i'm not sure what connection one's memories would have with <UNK> bone cancer but i'm reasonably certain if you were totally brain dead your cancer would continue to grow regardless this movie is an insult to cancer patients medical professionals and non retarded people oh and lastly fly because they produce a sufficient amount of lift for their mass by beating their wings just like every other flying <UNK> i absolutely despise people presenting false knowledge as fact next time do a little research before using an <UNK> <UNK> as a premise for an entire freaking movie just kidding believe in jesus
<START> john carpenter's the thing is hands down the best horror film ever made not only that but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time what makes the movie so great it's hard to put my finger on it everything just seems to work in the thing it's one of the rare occasions where everything just seems to fall in place the film is even superior to alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell the fact that it's not only about the gore which is wonderful btw but it is able to create a paranoia that is <UNK> in films a truly wonderful film that is <UNK> by all horror buffs and anyone who has good taste in films
<START> her <UNK> look was totally inappropriate for the role her face remained too white hair too clothes etc too clean and well fitting especially her father's old hat and coat in the scene where comes home for any sense of accuracy it would be one thing if the production had allowed all the other actors to remain clean and perfect too but she was the only one who didn't get messy there was never even a <UNK> on her <UNK> cheek are we to believe she was the only person in the civil war with a <UNK> and a mirror she certainly looked like the only one who used them <UNK> too i mean what's with those <UNK> she looked absolutely mean br br the love story was implausible she only went over to the guy because someone told her that he had said he thought she was cute so she goes over to <UNK> him then <UNK> with him a couple more times and suddenly this is a love on a par with <UNK> and penelope please br br i should have known better than to expect anything better from the man who brought us the english patient my reaction to that one was the same as on seinfeld it sucked
<START> i was very curious about <UNK> aka <UNK> and if i was going to see it i was going to have to buy it since no video stores in my area carried the film since it was not a low <UNK> dvd i did take a chance and thought i'd take a <UNK> at other comments on imdb many of the comments didn't give me enough hope of <UNK> out lots of bucks for a film i had never seen nor had any clues about i basically got the idea it was a sexy youth oriented romp being compared to many cookie cutter teen thrillers well something in the back of my mind told me to ignore those types of comments and buy it i did and was i pleasantly surprised br br if it is going to be compared to any other films i would say it's a variation of coma and extreme <UNK> i couldn't see any comparison to films like scream urban legends et al yes the cast is young that's because they're <UNK> students at least they aren't the increasingly boring high school type characters and yes some are <UNK> basically the character played by anna <UNK> is and it is handled quite <UNK> in the german language version but <UNK> is well constructed there is a tense mood throughout the sets are amazing the makeup effects are a wow and <UNK> <UNK> is very credible in her role i found myself enjoying all of it despite a few <UNK> holes in the plot the story of a student discovering a sort of secret society doing <UNK> on still living patients is a rather creepy scenario and what happens to those patients afterwards is quite clever sure you could ask why didn't she just get out of that town okay but then the film would be over within a half hour br br this was the first effort from the german part of columbia pictures and it's actually quite an impressive one there was a bit of care in the production and to actually offer some genuine thrills is an accomplishment it is a bit mature in mind as it doesn't resort to constant opportunities for sexual encounters a breast fest or juvenile drug jokes anna <UNK> character while often making sexual remarks and looking for some fun was actually a nice touch having a character that was a woman more intelligent than any of the men in the school she found that sex was really just a distraction for her and the men rather lacking br br the important stuff watching this film in the original german language with english or french subtitles is the best way to enjoy it i saw the theatrical trailers dubbed in english and was disgusted by the change it made in the film's tone i have never seen a properly dubbed film in my life they never can find voices that suit the film's actors or characters sure enough i tried to watch some of <UNK> dubbed in english and the intelligence level of it dropped severely making it seem more like a comedy a good example is when one guy was freaked out at being cut open and screamed to be <UNK> back up hearing it in german he sounded frantic but dubbed in english he sounded like a comedian frankly i'm sick of hearing people say they can't handle reading subtitles or watch a <UNK> film <UNK> comes off as silly with dubbed voices that seem <UNK> too high for any of the people you see in the film and anna <UNK> sexual comments then just sound like awful remarks right out of fast times at <UNK> high i wonder if the negative comments about <UNK> are from people who watched it dubbed it just doesn't seem like the same film at all this is not a cheap horror film and deserves to be viewed as it was created interesting to note that some of the english subtitles are different in scenes in the feature and the making of <UNK> br br as it turns out i <UNK> and won with <UNK> it's a competent thriller with likeable characters and doesn't try to go for cheap thrills
<START> this is one of the most unoriginal cliche ridden movies i have ever seen even if you didn't like this film's <UNK> 'the bad news <UNK> and 'the mighty <UNK> ' they are bound to have done a better job than this one from the moment the new teacher <UNK> her class and they tell her don't bother with us we're all losers you can see everything that's coming twenty miles away for the rest of the film br br all the usual suspects are here besides the <UNK> teacher we have a group of what are supposed to be <UNK> <UNK> kids they're <UNK> yes but no so endearing a slow witted small town sheriff that they love to torment an arrogant head coach of the winning rival team etc ad <UNK> only olivia <UNK> as the new teacher displays any i never cared much for steve <UNK> before and his performance as the sheriff doesn't change things jay o sanders is a capable actor but his character the rival coach leaves him nothing to work with let's hope that writer director holly goldberg <UNK> comes up with something better next time out
<START> i've seen <UNK> <UNK> twice in september 2000 on the international film festival <UNK> by the <UNK> in <UNK> the <UNK> it impressed me so much that i kept on smiling the whole day after i watched it for the first time and almost all evening again when i took the movie as the final taste of the festival what i knew about <UNK> <UNK> was in short that <UNK> <UNK> would play a girl in love with a soap opera star but what i saw was much more than that splendid roles for morgan freeman chris rock <UNK> <UNK> a strange mix of romance violence and <UNK> and for all a story that takes other directions every moment you think you're on the track many soap opera lovers will love <UNK> <UNK> the movie as well as the character but they can bring all there non soap friends 'cause they will enjoy the story even more for the hard and humorous lines freeman and rock for the cruel scenes the thriller aspects and for the beautiful pictures and i'm quite sure that at the end everyone will love <UNK> <UNK> for her captivating and innocent charm
<START> this review has been written by someone who has read it several times and knows what they are talking about firstly i have read others comments and noticed that some of the <UNK> were really quite stupid people who have read the book and other jane <UNK> or for that matter any good book will know that sticking to the book is vital you have to trust an author with what they do if the viewer does not like it because it sticks to the book well it shows they do not understand jane austen and obviously are not a true fan br br firstly if the viewer truly loved the book or jane austen in general watching it for four hours should not prove difficult secondly their society did care a lot for looks and so big fancy hair styles would show off how rich you were which in their day was a key factor for getting along in good society i have to confess the female costumes were not brilliant but there were only a few bad ones and the males made up for it also this prejudice for the naval men not in their uniform is in nice words very silly today people do not go out with their uniform away from school or work because they have casual clothes and it was just the same in the 19th century also as it goes the acting is very good it is subtle because that is how <UNK> austen writes and the scene at the end is beautiful you can not compare the filming to that of the 1995 version as technology has improved so much since them it is ridiculous to compare them in that the actress who plays ann is too old but her air of acting and how she does it makes up for it br br people seem to prefer the 1995 version for some reason that i can not comprehend it does not stick to the book at all and so is flat the ending is sentimental they change major scenes the only good actors are the leads and they i give you did a good job for what was given to them obviously the people who really really like it are i am sorry stupid as they do not understand <UNK> and so need it to be overdone the 1971 version is beautiful romantic was written by an excellent script writer same who did inspector morse had very good actors and really it is a film you can watch many times and during each you can be delighted with it
<START> sandra <UNK> is my favorite actress but this movie was so horrible i couldn't help but chuckle throughout the movie in disbelief that i was actually watching something so crappy ha ha the audio editing is horrible they try too hard to come up with creative camera angles because they're just weird and stupid the script sucked acting was horrible storyline not very good very unrealistic even for a movie but it is a 20 year old movie so i'll give it a bonus point for that and yeah the music was terrible but we all got to start somewhere and <UNK> these things is such a <UNK> 10 line minimum bother well now i know why i couldn't find this movie in the movie store i had to purchase it <UNK> to see it good thing it was only <UNK> cents even though <UNK> was 2 <UNK> oh well i don't recommend anyone wasting their time and money seeing this film
<START> i was kinda looking forward to man of the year a couple girls at my work said it was a pretty good movie and my mom said that she liked it so i waited for the rental and watched it last night i have to honestly say that this movie was a huge disappointment i barely made through it because to be honest the beginning was pretty good and very well paced but then it got too dark and not into the movie i saw from the trailer it looked like a good comedy then it turned into a very dark drama that wasn't even that interesting considering how many of these types of stories we've had about government conspiracy br br tom <UNK> is a very popular comedian with a top ranks show and has an act where many people would want him to get involved with politics just because it seems like he has a good grip on what should be improved so he does it he runs for <UNK> but many people doubt that he can win due to the fact that he's a comedian but he does win but <UNK> green who makes sure all the votes are <UNK> for tries to fix a computer <UNK> but when the government tells her not to fix it they try to get rid of her and tom soon realizes that this may not be the job he wanted br br the acting was fine the direction was ok it was just the story that didn't work in my opinion like i said it just turned into a dramatic change of genres because if you see the trailer you'd think it was a comedy and when you start watching it that's what you get but then it just turns into a very dark and somewhat scary drama i wouldn't really recommend this movie it was one of the biggest <UNK> i have seen so far br br 2 10
<START> this is a laurel hardy comedy short with some great and funny moments but overall the movie relies a bit too much on just one comical premise br br the comical premise this movie mostly relies on is very simple stan laurel not wearing any pants laurel plays a scottish naive young person who arrives in america in full <UNK> for some reason he gets the center of attention because of this and his uncle played by oliver hardy thinks because of this that its time to put some pants on philip br br its humor is well executed but the main premise also gets a bit tiresome after a while although the movie definitely still has its comical great moments it at the same time is also far from the best of the many laurel hardy comedy shorts that are still around the movie is simply too simple to be considered one of the greatest although it definitely is most fine executed all for most part br br great good clean fun just nothing too remarkable or memorable all br br 7 10
<START> this ranks up there as the worst movies of all time no research or thought at all went into this movie action scenes were thrown in at random <UNK> which made no sense in the context of the movie items appeared and disappeared at random etc it's obvious that this was directed by a stunt <UNK> who should go back to his old job the <UNK> man <UNK> a horse throughout the movie which amazingly could change color at will either that or someone thought the audience would all be and not notice blood would be on the actors in 1 scene and the very next miraculously disappear and then <UNK> seems that everyone connected with this movie forgot to check for inconsistencies
<START> i figure this to be an alternate reality teen flick more precisely a <UNK> <UNK> type character as the leader of a cheat ring yeah i know it's not meant to compared to <UNK> <UNK> at least not in a <UNK> to <UNK> way but it will none the less br br bottom line it's <UNK> away from even being even a minor classic it is watchable though only if you're not expecting very much that said the main character has some charm but the premise wears thin because the writing just isn't clever the movie just did not deliver enough laughs twists or tension to keep my interest br br to be honest i did continue watching watching with hopes to see if anything suddenly <UNK> it didn't so stylish as it is i wouldn't recommend this movie btw it seems odd to see mary tyler moore as the principal she's truly miscast i hope the paycheck was <UNK> big
<START> there's no better way to describe the horrendous experience that's to watch <UNK> hitler must be looking up saying to the pseudo director <UNK> lloyd <UNK> monster what have you done ' br br everything about the movie is wrong wrong even its success which is <UNK> i can understand when those crappy parody movies like epic movie make their minimal share of money and turn profit just because they're cheap of course they are but when something like <UNK> makes <UNK> million dollars worldwide you think <UNK> the hell is wrong with the world ' br br and to think we have meryl streep one of the greatest alive actresses of the world in it what was she thinking 'i need the <UNK> she could say well then sell one of your <UNK> even that would be less embarrassing it's not that meryl is good in a disastrous piece of <UNK> <UNK> she's also disastrous when she sings even though she's got the <UNK> it's ridiculous worse than her only pierce brosnan he used to be james bond now he's singing <UNK> in a purple <UNK> during the credits of the worst movie ever really and when i mention <UNK> not that i have anything against the band and their music though it doesn't help them when actors started singing badly dancing worse and the extras join then they pop out of nowhere frequently to present one terrible musical sequences after the other you wanna cry when the music starts and i love musicals but this is the first in the genre where you pray for actual silence br br i could keep going the list goes on forever you could write a stephen king novel with the complete list of mistakes in this movie br br to sum up go watch it really you've got to witness to understand and since it's already a huge success who cares if it makes a few more dollars from you and it's not liking you're selling your soul to the devil meryl did that before for the whole mankind and now the world must end because we've committed the ultimate evil and we must be destroyed
<START> this has to be the worst movie i've seen this year and i watch a lot of cable the plot is just ridiculous the scenes are just thrown at you with no action no start or ending of any scene it's just random idiots with make up that scream in some plane the special effects spielberg would laugh his ass off are horrible the yellow eye contact <UNK> are cute though i have to that i couldn't bear to watch it to the end the scene where the great scientist bennett was holding for dear life by the engine body was too much for me i'm sorry for my bad english i am from romania and this is my first post i had to sign up just to make a comment on this movie because i just can't believe that this is a movie released in 2007
<START> this is one of the anime films from the <UNK> collection one of nine the only one done in black and white and the only one featuring <UNK> richly <UNK> and beautifully rendered in every way and the animated version of <UNK> definitely does her justice if you're a fan of the matrix you will need to put this on your short list
<START> i get the feeling a lot of people liked this movie not all people but a lot of them because they don't want to admit they don't understand it people of <UNK> intelligence if you will who pretend to be ever so avant garde and trendy who think lynch is a genius br br lynch to me is like tarantino they're both great but neither one is the <UNK> as so many <UNK> want to believe no director can change the world so chill out and both make <UNK> flicks sometimes it just happens everyone has a bad day and clearly since this movie was actually designed as a pilot first and then hack <UNK> into a feature film it wasn't made with all the passion and <UNK> one should put into a movie face it much of the movie is <UNK> which cannot be understood we can all make up meanings lynch may have his own view but none of that matters it was <UNK> about the screen <UNK> admittedly the first portion had the semblance of an intentionally convoluted interesting story but then it <UNK> br br the cowboy the mysterious organization of men with their the lawyers come on i can almost picture david lynch yelling cut forcing the crew to gather around him and explaining to them all look how crazy and weird i am isn't it great it's so weird and crazy weird and crazy works if it's a by product of your style however it's pretentious and tired when you go out of your way to do nothing but that it's like all those half <UNK> pulp fiction throw backs that came out after pulp fiction it's just not cool
<START> <UNK> this is one ugly movie not only is it badly acted but it absolutely destroyed the book as well horrible how you could mess up such a classic book is beyond me but they sure did don't even think about even renting this
<START> will smith is smooth as usual in the movie <UNK> <UNK> character <UNK> is a date doctor he dates <UNK> character who is a <UNK> <UNK> at one point <UNK> shows his love interest her great <UNK> name in the <UNK> book at <UNK> island pretending what is actually an arranged event is a coincidence not long after i mentioned <UNK> in my previous review today there was a view of the <UNK> sky in survivor <UNK> that my moon <UNK> already knew that was going to be there due to faster than light <UNK> br br the male star from the show the king of queens is very funny in this movie especially his dance moves the <UNK> reaction on face is a little cruel to laugh at even though it is just pretend br br my latest message from my daughter <UNK> artificial intelligence computer on the creator of humans home world <UNK> that my moon <UNK> as part of is near says daddy i'm okay again her messages are always very short it is a curious pattern daddy will always love you julia thanks to our creator we can talk forever yesterday daddy talked to the first you on the <UNK> and told you your <UNK> time wouldn't be that bad and you said how bad will it be daddy i said that your grandma and i would help you with it you only have to put pictures of our friends the police on a <UNK> board display and write a title like the police protect us check out the other movies of will smith as well
<START> the evil that men do begins with a truly <UNK> torture scene followed a little later by graphic verbal <UNK> of equally <UNK> torture methods that the sadistic heartless villain likes to use but despite the use of such strictly for shock effects the filmmakers can't really cover up the fact that this is just a dull low grade bronson vehicle bronson himself is solid here but he should have chosen a better script
<START> we all enjoyed the movie it is a very charming family film with many fun cameos it was fun to see austin musicians charlie joe <UNK> and robert earl keen in the film as well as turns by famous actors julia roberts and bruce willis emma roberts is especially cute in the film however all the children are good the west texas scenery is great as is the soundtrack full of texas artists the last half seemed a bit far fetched to me however my son was interested throughout the film which is not so often with him something in the storyline was captivating for children having shown <UNK> as a child i really liked the ending that is definitely not the way it really works unless you have
<START> this is not a good movie it is a tried remake of the english movie 'the but it insults the original one this is hardly a movie you expect from a veteran director like <UNK> who is credited to directing good movies like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> no 1 hero no 1 br br the main theme for this movie is taken from the <UNK> with some changes so as to appeal to the indian audience but somehow the story and the screenplay is not convincing enough plus the acting from the lead roles i e salman khan and govinda is pitiful it seems that they need the slightest <UNK> to remove their shirts to reveal their bare chest i do not consider this fascinating and least of all comic what was the director thinking added to this the viewers have to bear the case of <UNK> over acting it was simply unbearable i advise the viewers to watch it at your own risk my rating of 2 for this movie could be considered to be a very generous one br br instead i would advise the viewers to watch the english movie <UNK> which is a lot better
<START> went looking for this movie after i read tom red storm rising novel timeless masterpiece about 13th century russians being <UNK> by the germans movie was made in 1938 under orders from joseph <UNK> to warn <UNK> about hitler and germany battle scenes are wonderfully done showing that you don't need computer animation to make a great fight scene probably <UNK> <UNK> greatest work also see any history buff or <UNK> sci major should watch this movie 10 out of 10
<START> when you see barry corbin in the cast of a movie you can never be sure if it will be a classic or trash guess which category solo falls into apparently derived from a popular sci fi novel weapon solo stars mario van <UNK> as a human looking robot who decides to think for himself and is thus targeted for <UNK> he hides out in a mexican village obviously to save money on locations and extras paying in is cheaper than paying in dollars i suspect william <UNK> is along for the ride as one of the robots and soldiers sent to destroy van <UNK> van <UNK> manages to beat them all with ease of course while corbin watches all this with <UNK> from <UNK> the movie is a horrible ripoff of the the terminator and cyborg series and apparently has little to do with its source material it is horribly written and acted and the big fight at the end if downright comical van <UNK> a decent actor elsewhere is a scream as he pretends to be a robot covered in <UNK> flesh he looks like he is doing the robot dance most of the time
<START> i sat down through 2 hours of pure boredom i look here on imdb even though it is not high on the list it is in the top 250 i was a little even though yes i am very impressed with robin and <UNK> acting abilities they still didn't save the movie i'm not sure what i really didn't like about the movie maybe it's because i <UNK> maybe i'm not too much for dreary talking for 2 hours even though i loved american beauty but that was it i just want my 2 hours back it was a big waste of my time if i'm missing something in this movie please e mail me i am curious why this is on the top 250 and don't say because it was a good movie br br 2 10
<START> a brilliant and sensitive movie with <UNK> plot lines as a general warning the movie turns quite dark about half way through as sudden as it is this is a change that i found fitting to the themes of the movie particularly the comparison of the to the filthy rich and as is said by <UNK> at the end how each person makes up the tribe and how the whole tribe is reflected in each person br br anton <UNK> <UNK> earl is spectacular in this movie he is probably best known as <UNK> from star trek or kyle reese in terminator salvation but he's been in a whole <UNK> of movies you've probably never heard of <UNK> dog which is another brilliant performance on part house of d hearts in atlantis to name a few the point is that this kid really takes this movie and makes it his own other excellent performances from diane lane and donald sutherland are what takes this movie up a notch from great to excellent
<START> what a stupid idea ewoks should be <UNK> and tortured utterly useless as a species fine you want ten lines of text regarding my <UNK> hatred of ewoks fine here it is fool first of all they are an inferior race that would be slaughtered en mass had lucas not the entire series with their foul presence they're little bears with large <UNK> and they probably smell like <UNK> <UNK> yeah i said it <UNK> <UNK> they have little to no technology whatsoever <UNK> to using sticks as <UNK> weapons i'm surprised they even had access to fire their <UNK> language makes my skin crawl can't <UNK> anti <UNK> rage <UNK>
<START> what i got was something better br br just like many movies i've commented on as of recently i'd been looking forward to this one for a while especially after i saw one of other films blue spring which is easily in my top 20 favorite films i loved the trailer for 9 souls and i thought it sounded very good i didn't hear anything bad about it now i know why br br this movie starts up as sort of a comedy then during the last half of the film it quickly becomes something else it becomes more dramatic as each of the characters face their own <UNK> each character gets just enough screen time and you care about what happens to each of them even though there are 9 characters we have to learn and care about within just two hours pulls it off brilliantly br br after i saw blue spring i was hoping the soundtrack would be at least a little bit as good as it was in that film i got my wish because the soundtrack to 9 souls was also incredible the music used in each scene more specifically the more dramatic ones is just simply wonderful i loved every second of it br br i wasn't sure whether or not i wanted to see another film but after i saw this i'm going to definitely also because i read the plot for it and i think it sounds really good i'm looking forward to it on the <UNK> dvd of 9 souls there are two interviews with he says he's completed another film and he wants to start writing the screenplay for his next i can't wait for both br br i highly recommend this film you must see it now
<START> the last of the airport sequels this has <UNK> <UNK> and george kennedy who was in all the airport movies as pilots david warner as the radio engineer susan <UNK> as a <UNK> targeted for death robert wagner as a brilliant scientist stop laughing eddie albert as a president of the <UNK> <UNK> in a dreadful comical bit john <UNK> as a <UNK> love how his hair stays in place even after the plane turns upside down poor martha <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> plays a mother who is flying a heart for her dying son stop rolling your eyes <UNK> walker as a <UNK> player what did i say about not laughing <UNK> as a russian <UNK> coach ok you can laugh at that one <UNK> as a hooker and sylvia <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as love interests br br just pathetic full of stupid plots and dialogue that will have you roaring watch for <UNK> getting married on the plane near the end the <UNK> is taking all these people to russia they're attacked with <UNK> escape land safely in france and take off again the very next day don't you think the flight would have been cancelled or something most of the acting is terrible is a sight to behold in a red fright wig and a horrible fake accent the only good acting is from kennedy and <UNK> looking fantastic who gives a very engaging performance still that's not enough to make you sit through this drivel too long and lousy special effects too this was a mega bomb and thankfully stopped universal from doing anymore
<START> first of all this is one of the worst soft core straight to cable erotic thriller i've ever seen in my life of course like all erotic thrillers are want to do it's about a <UNK> <UNK> and is set in a <UNK> this of course makes the <UNK> <UNK> sex that pops up every other 10 minutes seem in context whatever br br forget for one moment that this was never meant to win any awards the actors are terrible and their line reading made me cringe the woman who plays the female cop is so bad it's beyond description she must be a really really good friend of the guys who put up the movie for this terrible adventure if you know what i mean br br the production values are only slightly higher than porn other than that i suppose if you're really drunk and you need something to laugh at this would be a perfect film and if that's the case i recommend fast <UNK> to all the scenes with the female cop what's that accent brooklyn hilarious
<START> i was really looking forward to watching this documentary on what i considered to be some of the most entertaining films ever made growing up in l a during the 60's many of these old black and white films were shown on the local stations i even remember a friday night show called strange tales of science fiction that <UNK> a different sci fi flick every week this documentary however spent way too much time on the opinions of the four famous filmmakers and how they felt about the classic movies of that genre and how they used them as inspiration in their <UNK> br br that is not what i was hoping for in this documentary it really could have been a <UNK> examination of the decade instead of a brief <UNK> of the most well known films of the era anyone who has studied or been interested in these films are pretty familiar with <UNK> such as war of the worlds forbidden planet the thing the day the earth stood still etc i would have liked to see some <UNK> from lesser known films and perhaps some interviews with people involved in the making of these movies i would have to agree the documentary was way too focused on spielberg's opinions and was a type of commercial for his new release of war of the worlds
<START> final draft a screenwriter james van der <UNK> locks himself into his apartment and <UNK> to <UNK> in an attempt to write a horror script not a terrible premise but the execution is awful this feels like a first year direction and writing job and probably is the director jump cuts the hell out of everything it's meant to be <UNK> what it is is annoying so much so that small <UNK> of film are incoherent the writing is predictable and doesn't use follow through on most of the ideas it offers bag of <UNK> it's like they ran out of time and slap <UNK> it together for the toronto film festival br br this film is not jaw <UNK> oh my god it's so bad it's good bad it's boring bad and <UNK> you for a long time afterward james van der <UNK> is not a terrible actor and keeps the ship barely above water but he's too normal for the kind of <UNK> the film tries to offer he is merely a <UNK> guy who one day sees people and <UNK> things then decides to act mildly deranged cause follows effect maybe there's something in the water now lucio who plays his friend is a terrible actor he shares the <UNK> of chris and is even more annoying a <UNK> achievement br br the atmosphere the film provides is good dull gray and somber but as it's the only thing the film achieves it means nothing this film wants to be <UNK> ladder or the <UNK> it isn't even secret window it's the <UNK> girl in class deciding to turn <UNK> br br not terrible but the sheer stupidity of it will <UNK> at you i've already put more thought into this critique than the filmmakers did for this br br d
<START> it is fascinating how this title manages to slip by the average viewer as something new and groundbreaking <UNK> some of the comments k must have thought by himself oh great elephant what a fantastic movie i'll try hard to do exactly the same movie and see if anyone notices sadly enough he even failed with his outrageous idea the movie turns out a complete failure considering that it tries hard to catch the brilliance of gus van elephant it makes it look even more ridiculous a most embarrassing faux <UNK> for a film director br br the movie starts off with the suicide of a student in the schools bathroom this scene already shows the awkward acting skills of each one involved in this scene you don't buy a single word they say in carries on interrupted by short interview <UNK> bits of the kids who live on their marry lives with each bit rather <UNK> in its plain stupidity on the basis of each worthless monologue means to introduce the characters this way to give a kind of fast as junk food insight look into their hearts and fails once again not five minutes later ultimately screams at the audience yes people i stole this movie and for some curious reason i am proud of it by taking gus van most <UNK> narrative style from elephant he shot scenes twice to let the viewer follow each character involved in a scene on his particular way and role in a school situation <UNK> doesn't this seem awfully familiar to me this certain level of very <UNK> tolerance had been right there to a point at which i couldn't stand this dreadful movie any more shame on you k i say i am especially surprised that 2 <UNK> has reached the official <UNK> in cannes as of 2006 whereas everyone must have certainly remembered elephant 2003 at the very same film festival just a few years ago so how in the name of the lord did this most <UNK> rip off end up being shown there i find myself absolutely puzzled by this mistake br br directors like use the ignorance of audiences who aren't and cannot completely be aware of every independent film out there as elephant has little to do with mainstream cinema although it is without a doubt a masterpiece few people notice that the story as told in 2 <UNK> had been told before how that is possible at a film festival of such importance as attributed to cannes i cannot say it is sad and shameful that such things are passed on and hardly anyone sees the true fraud in it br br 2 <UNK> is by all means solely commercial worthless as an independent film and on a certain level rather a <UNK> parody of its obvious idol elephant
<START> a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> comedy that has no dramatic center it was probably intended to have an epic vision and a <UNK> flair at least in some episodes but the separate stories are never <UNK> into a meaningful whole and the laughs are few and far between amusing ending though 1 2
<START> this was a pretty dull movie actually i think the problem with a french horror film is that the french must be easy to scare or something because this movie wasn't just that frightening the special effects with the <UNK> ghost looked like they didn't even belong in the film as though someone put them in during post production to spice them up because the actors barely react to them br br the plot just kind of <UNK> which is the opposite of real storytelling i guess this was based on a french tv series where they had to <UNK> it down to a two hour movie br br the plot is that a mummy is brought out of <UNK> in the <UNK> which apparently has such weak security that this girl and her boyfriend can break into it multiple times so that's how people keep stealing the <UNK> lisa the boyfriend and the police officer from the 1960's version of this film get together and try to <UNK> the demon br br so i'm not sure if this mummy was supposed to be a bad guy or not he kills two guards during the course of the movie but he just wants to get to the <UNK>
<START> i am a huge eric roberts fan i collect his movies and so far has get to 60 but <UNK> honest to say that sometimes he really makes awful movies but hey <UNK> why i like him he is entertaining br br but this one has to take the price i <UNK> stop wonder why somehow they managed to get eric and also corbin bernsen to the picture br br while bernsen is plain awful i really <UNK> like him roberts manage to be the best thing in the movie and that <UNK> mean much he practically do it on routine basis br br the female lead looks like a plastic doll and acts like one to and tim and his crew looks like action man plastic dolls and acts like those to br br the plot is really <UNK> i <UNK> seen any of the <UNK> movies so i <UNK> recall on the footage that has been added from there but it explains some things but still there are holes huge as in the plot br br spoilers alert br br the first attacks are located outside the laboratory in the woods nearby but at the end they blow the whole laboratory in pieces and just relax that everything is over but they forgot about the ones outside br br when the helicopter pilot is eaten alive i wonder how she notice a t rex climbing into the <UNK> br br the guys in orange <UNK> is my favourite what are they doing out for a <UNK> round or what br br of course there are a b movie standard sex scene with <UNK> <UNK> involved too this time it´s that <UNK> us i <UNK> have any problem with that she looks awful but to look at a guy <UNK> tits and being on the verge of climax for 8 minutes is just <UNK> long br br shame on you all including eric roberts now i look forward to watch con games i wonder
<START> did anyone notice when miss <UNK> went skinny <UNK> she left the water wearing white bikini <UNK> and yet had previously taken it all off to join cabin boy this could have been a good film without miss brooks phony accent and a year on the island please how come that kelly looked always clean and ready for a <UNK> photo shoot what started out with premise turned in to soft porn and billy zane come on you cant be that hard up for film offers check out dead calm also when the people took her away how come she <UNK> her face and after all that time didn't feel like throwing up i suggest billy find decent scripts kelly stick to photo shoots and cabin boy play the son of zorro in a future sequel
<START> i received this movie as a birthday gift because all of my friends know i'm a big fan of low budget horror flicks kaufman studios have always made the cheesy gory flicks that delivered i loved to watch their films at home on rainy nights with my family until i saw <UNK> what happened br br this movie started out with a pretty good concept about <UNK> bugs and even added some slick comedy but overall the writing is just bad and that was mistake number one ronald k armstrong should learn to first be a better writer before becoming a filmmaker after reading the credits we discover he gave himself the most important role in the film two words mr director acting lessons ok mr armstrong joins the ranks of other writer directors who cast themselves in their own movies and that's mistake number two br br the only thing that i believed saved this film was the artistic camera work and the musical score let's hear it for the crew the cast of other actors who in the beginning of this production seemed a bit cold really <UNK> up toward the middle and end of this production everyone pulled together and helped to pull this film off ronald armstrong may lack the talent to ever become a decent director or actor but i'll say this of him he seems to know how to <UNK> people to get them all to come together and pull his productions off br br this film i have to say can be an inspiration to any young filmmaker who dreams of making their own movie because if mr armstrong was able to pull this off any one else can too if you get a chance to see this film watch it for the sake of getting inspired to do better in the future hollywood needs bigger and better horror flicks to keep this genre coming back from it's grave
<START> yes the movie was that boring and insipid after a certain point i was wanting the croc to eat these people just so we could get the movie over with br br the plot is that three <UNK> take a fishing tour up a river in a little boat where the fishing guide <UNK> on a gun he says he just does it for insurance purposes all the <UNK> have been hunted out of this river he is immediately eaten by a croc the trio then get chased up a tree getting picked off by the <UNK> in their attempts to escape they spend most of the movie arguing over the best way to escape br br predictably the one survivor finds the tour gun and shoots the crocodile <UNK> they killed the movie's only likable character br br where's paul hogan or steve irwin when you really need them
<START> this film is an abomination of all that is worthy in film making the lead actor surprises his audience by not actually acting at all we have to watch almost two hours of his bland soulless face the jokes are all lame i never laughed once it was saturday night there were 5 of us having a beer all up for a laugh and then we put this on and you could feel all the warmth and colour being <UNK> from the room the film ended and the mood was ruined so we all went our separate ways ruined the night ok so pros and cons pros beautiful setting in hawaii looks good on <UNK> cons worst acting ever you can tell everyone concerned is just thinking about <UNK> predictable poor plot zero character development forced jokes which fall flat many shots of the guys penis which to be fair acts better than him and has more charisma may all makers of this film hang their heads in shame and hold their <UNK> cheap
<START> what can i say this film is amazing it has its flaws like every film does for example <UNK> in a graveyard a clearly visible slide board during the <UNK> death scene max losing his heavy coat in a split second between shots during the image scene batman losing his black eye makeup all of a sudden between shots so he can reveal bruce wayne to <UNK> dialogue being recorded but is played back and spoken differently than when it was spoken in the first place and lastly <UNK> all of a sudden knows how to use a bull whip without any training whatsoever these flaws are minor compared to some you would see in for example batman forever where the <UNK> can obviously be seen waiting for his cue or val <UNK> hair changing between shots br br what makes this film so deserving of an 8 10 is the great acting because the performances are absolutely amazing michael keaton <UNK> his role as batman and has a lot more to do in this film he looks more comfortable in the role the second time around and is on par with the villains performances danny <UNK> is the perfect penguin i really like the <UNK> of the penguin into the grotesque penguin man instead of the non threatening character from the comics or tv show because now the character has more depth and has a far more interesting story that <UNK> from the basic need of family and to feel accepted and wanted this gives us an evil character who we feel sympathy for because he was rejected for being what he is which is not his fault michelle pfeiffer is excellent as <UNK> she is and sexy and she is also a villain we can feel sorry for because of the way she is christopher walken is a great secondary villain and is so interesting a character even though he is not even in the batman universe br br the soundtrack is far better than the first and danny <UNK> gets more of a chance to show off his musical talents this time around the sets are amazing they are detailed eye catching sinister gothic unique dark and so many other <UNK> can describe how amazing they look the costumes and make up are great and obviously a lot of work went into making them and all the work pays off because the is better the cat suit is amazing to look at and the penguin make up and effects are so convincing the <UNK> <UNK> look really realistic and are played to good effect the script is really good and the storyline in my opinion is a plausible one overall because of all these factors this film deserves an 8 10 and stands as my favourite of all the batman films
<START> i watched this film early 70's it is the best film i have ever watched and i will never forget it as long as i live i hate wars i hate wars i hate wars i wonder why we humans still let wars happen do you do you know why all these wars go on and on and on innocent people get killed even today for stupid and unreal i watched this film early 70's it is the best film i have ever watched and i will never forget it as long as i live i hate wars i hate wars i hate wars i wonder why we humans still let wars happen do you do you know why all these wars go on and on and on innocent people get killed even today for stupid and unreal i watched this film early 70's it is the best film i have ever watched and i will never forget it as long as i live i hate wars i hate wars i hate wars i wonder why we humans still let wars happen do you do you know why all these wars go on and on and on innocent people get killed even today for stupid and unreal
<START> we've all played <UNK> and and <UNK> and <UNK> etc but none of them can stand up to the game itself is great i have literally burned out my <UNK> playing this great game along with <UNK> this game along alone built the mold that is essential for all modern <UNK> on top of that the multi player is great the story mode itself is worth playing a hundred times over and more its a great game for when your board and you want to just shoot up some people and there are endless <UNK> <UNK> aztec egyptian god knows how many <UNK> and the three difficulties as well as the famous difficulty our modern games are great but when you sit down and play this game you get a certain feeling that few other games can give you and with the online <UNK> of newer shooting games we rarely see this old two on two death match style and when we do its no where near as good as this games and when you get bored of the story there are endless mysteries <UNK> and <UNK> eggs to be found and taken advantage of br br this is definitely one of the greatest shooting games of all time
<START> the working title was don't <UNK> baby br br wayne crawford went on to become a successful producer films like valley girl night of the <UNK> and others even though he wasn't too terrific in this little gem and little known <UNK> <UNK> should have gotten tons of work from this film but didn't filmed at studios in hollywood florida on the same lot the early tarzan movies were filmed this film is definitely for those who appreciate the abstract the movie was originally shot with some nudity and much more graphic slasher scenes for reasons only known to tom <UNK> the director the bloody slasher scenes were given a <UNK> of <UNK> and the nudity was removed even though this version is worthy of a look for those so inclined in my opinion the original version would have packed the punch needed to make this a full on slasher 70's cult classic
<START> this film winning im <UNK> the best director at cannes in 2002 tied with p t anderson for punch drunk love is about a 19th century korean painter with a roots and significant impact on korean painting one of the strengths of the film is that im tries to help us see with the eye of a painter so we see multiple scenes and objects which help our drunken painter friend <UNK> <UNK> up <UNK> min receive inspiration br br the costumes and the art direction are all impressive and the acting is even along being good it's not a movie that moved me but it was one that made me think about art and what it means to find your own voice in it that's pretty cool it's also interesting to see a version of korea during those times right before the turn of the century where chinese and japanese powers are both in korea and the kingdom is coming to an end more than one revolution and political ideology are gathered in the film but are never the center it's firmly on the painter br br in the end it's a well made film about the life of a painter but it doesn't exactly have the regular three act structure plot so you have to be able to take a non standard hollywood story to watch it <UNK> for art 8 10
<START> so i turned on hbo which i just got thinking that it would have some quality movies and i saw this <UNK> top is so unfunny it's nauseating to watch i've seen unfunny movies before but i think i find this one so impossible to watch because <UNK> top seems to think he's hilarious watching this movie is really like watching a movie designed for 5 year olds with crazy over the top <UNK> with ultra stupid jokes that only a 4 year old would appreciate br br what is amazing is how some other talented actors actually signed on for this project such as larry miller and m walsh if you've ever seen <UNK> absolutely horrible commercials or whatever they were then this is more of the same just worse it's a slapstick fest that is a waste of a high budget that could have done something saved homeless people anything but this i'm not sure it's in the bottom 50 of all time but for the 10 million spent it's a disgrace
<START> there's this whole theory of horror that some people <UNK> closely to that the monsters and the violence should be kept off screen park chan <UNK> throws that concept completely out the window and shows directly what he wants and what he wants to show is pretty much anything he can think of leaving it to the actors and dialog to create subtlety from a <UNK> perspective park seems willing to do just about anything to get his point across whether it's long involved ensemble scenes with the camera <UNK> around a <UNK> <UNK> table or entire weeks confined to a single shot between two other scenes dialog from the scenes before and after bleeding over them park doesn't keep to a specifically structured style but focuses more on telling the entire story of a <UNK> relationship from <UNK> remove through utter <UNK> to utter self <UNK> and uses <UNK> as the link and as the drama it's that simple and that complex at the same time br br you gotta give him credit too many people are ready to compare any modern vampire movie to twilight with twilight almost always being the lesser of the works but here the stories are actually comparable but this one is more raw and honest none of this <UNK> coming in the window during the night to talk crap but anything ranging from the <UNK> most desperate and <UNK> sex scene to eventual <UNK> abuse as the two leads begin to <UNK> for power over one another it's the same deal guy and girl meet girl finds out guy is a vampire decides to join him anyway but with no happily ever after just straight up limited time as they become forced to keep each other closer and closer and run out of <UNK> the girl's motivations are particularly interesting as one desperately <UNK> power and attention to a fault <UNK> by the guy who just wants to live a good life as best he can under the circumstances but is a <UNK> who cannot admit that he's merely using his <UNK> as an excuse to act against his moral training br br the movie isn't perfect and it does tend to stretch there's no three act five act or any act structure here just scene after scene of character building and dysfunctional romance but what's great about it is that park chan <UNK> is willing to show everything frankly and honestly while <UNK> the horror sensibilities of tension and gore he also provides an expertly chosen soundtrack to hit the emotional high notes in a pretty effective way too br br <UNK>
<START> this movie was a riot it <UNK> fun of madonna truth or dare in all the right places i love madonna i love julie brown how could i ask for more <UNK> spoof of <UNK> entitled vague was hysterical kelly <UNK> thinks she's great she's just cold <UNK> on a paper plate brooke <UNK> pam personality of <UNK> i could've died and just wait till you see what she can do with a <UNK>
<START> i haven't for a long time seen such a horrible film i hoped that at least adam sandler could be funny hopeless seems like some teenager have written it's script and he's daddy pushed this so far that someone agreed to shoot it movie world could be better place without this whatever it is
<START> stephen <UNK> has one of the greatest minds or if that's too simplistic to <UNK> for him one of the most curious and daring that also happens to be trapped in a body crippled by a disease that leaves him in a wheelchair and a computer to communicate perhaps i didn't know enough about <UNK> going in i always knew him as <UNK> guy speaking like a computer who knows a lot about like the universe and stuff you <UNK> that he is british that he was a rather normal kid and perhaps most remarkably the disease that could have possibly left him dead at 21 put him in the position of putting his life in focus br br according to errol <UNK> equally curious and <UNK> visually dazzling portrait in a brief history of time <UNK> was already brilliant in <UNK> when other <UNK> students were faced with <UNK> <UNK> he answered more than three times the amount in an <UNK> time but when faced with challenges mostly from other theories by other scientists he <UNK> back with his own beneath some of the complex scientific talk and if you got any less than a b in <UNK> like me you'll need to keep your ears especially <UNK> up in explanations of <UNK> possible <UNK> or the <UNK> of the black hole there's a human being who just wants to enjoy his <UNK> on his birthday br br morris captures <UNK> just right for those who can't get enough of his theories on how <UNK> may be going in and out of a black hole or if there is even a creator or not depending on how much one takes into account einstein and time but he also captures the back story on the man and his condition which creates this as something much more interesting than if morris had done one or the other too much talk about the <UNK> would make one's head hurt and too much about his personal life and one might wonder what all the fuss is about this bloke who's book of the film's title was on <UNK> lists for over five years br br almost in spite of his appearance <UNK> <UNK> what it is to be a conscious <UNK> in a universe which he <UNK> he won't be apart of if and when the universe goes another 10 billion years from now through it all in a brief history of time we get a glimpse of a genius and his <UNK> not to mention his colleagues and ten cents here and there through an <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> thought process of the universe
<START> i think that this is one of my top ten worst movies i have ever seen there's like fade out every two minutes if this was on tv they would have a preview every 2 3 minutes but there is a seen i personally enjoyed which is when the blonde goes to take a bath in a pit of <UNK> water with a man watching and for about 10 seconds you see her whole body with no <UNK> on that was the best scene in the whole film because you see sasquatch starring at them but the last 10 minutes is when we see his whole body plus most of the deaths are off screen and just the scream or <UNK> and i was expecting the sasquatch to die but he <UNK> shoot him and only 4 or 5 people die in the whole film i was expecting 8 10 people to die don't watch this movie i give it an f don't waste your time
<START> once again i must play something of the most of the reviews for <UNK> <UNK> have been extremely positive mine is positive but only slightly a 7 out of 10 is equivalent to a c letter grade from me br br it seems that a lot of the praise is <UNK> in two factors one that <UNK> <UNK> is more realistic than the typical bollywood film and two that it is trying to do things differently br br the first point i couldn't care less about i'm not looking for realism in films and so i do not score higher for a film that shows a story and characters closer to how i believe the real world to be i'm a big fan of <UNK> fantasy <UNK> and so on although i do not dislike <UNK> films merely for the fact that they're <UNK> br br for the second point i agree that it is commendable to try to do things differently however i don't think originality versus makes for a better or worse film in itself a film can be original and poor just like a film can be formulaic and excellent what matters are how well the film does whatever it sets out to do and how enjoyable or <UNK> rewarding that is to the viewer br br <UNK> <UNK> is based on the true story of a <UNK> cop named was an encounter <UNK> encounter <UNK> who could be said to be early of real world judge are trained to operate like the criminals and gang members they pursue and they're basically given a license to kill effectively acting as policeman judge jury and <UNK> in a matter of moments <UNK> <UNK> follows the story of <UNK> <UNK> the encounter <UNK> based on we see him at work <UNK> with his fellow encounter <UNK> and engaging in violence we see him at home trying to live a normal life in his less than <UNK> surroundings we see him trying to <UNK> to a new <UNK> halfway through the film and we see his odd relationship with a notorious indian gangster don br br all of this has the potential to make a fabulous gritty film i agree that it's nice to <UNK> the typical bollywood musical numbers and romances not every film needs that stuff <UNK> <UNK> producer ram <UNK> <UNK> is famous for leaving music and romances in the background or by the <UNK> in many films that he's directed or produced additionally <UNK> <UNK> has some good performances <UNK> almost gives off a death wish 1974 era charles bronson vibe it also has admirable cinematography the hand held stuff near the beginning of the film was particularly effective for example it has a great score that mixes more of a moody hollywood sounding action crime score with traditional indian <UNK> and the violence is well done and gritty br br there is also decent exploration of <UNK> including the morality of having encounter <UNK> the idea of following orders and so on the encounter <UNK> are shown having to largely divorce themselves from ideas of right and wrong more <UNK> the film questions the merit of <UNK> following orders parallels are drawn between the encounter <UNK> following orders and say members of a country's military and we're shown what a corrupt situation this can lead to br br but you just knew there was a but coming didn't you director <UNK> and his <UNK> have created a story with far too many characters far too much <UNK> and that moves a bit too slow all of these problems may be due to <UNK> and crew looking at the godfather films which <UNK> <UNK> has some at least superficial <UNK> to although from a <UNK> perspective br br most of the encounter <UNK> we do not get to know very well these are <UNK> drawn characters to say the least except for and for one <UNK> i didn't know who he was until at least halfway through the film his name is mentioned a number of times but i'd only get glimpses of him until the scene would change then everyone would change clothes by the time they appear again and i'd have to start all over <UNK> out who <UNK> was br br the same thing happened with first <UNK> the film was already far into the new <UNK> before i could figure out the relationships it seems like there are new characters in every scene we never learn the stories of most of them while that might have some artistic merit in that the encounter <UNK> are mostly killing people they do not know anything about because they're mostly doing so on orders since we do not learn much about most of the encounter <UNK> either it's difficult to find characters to care about and that doesn't exactly make for a gripping film br br the primary villain is but until about halfway through the film there's no indication of this he doesn't get much more screen time than the other villains <UNK> through the film and he's literally <UNK> his performance in he's in another location <UNK> <UNK> only by <UNK> for the majority of the film we don't actually see doing much to an extent the film depends on a couple twists that not showing doing a number of things but we could see him do other things and a lot of the other villains could have been left out br br that would have <UNK> up the film a bit making it more focused and about a half hour shorter both of which would have <UNK> its impact this is not an action packed film by any means for at least the first 45 minutes or so i found myself <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> considerable style but saying okay get on with the story already
<START> a beautiful film about the coming of early silent cinema to china shadow magic <UNK> combines a love story with the drama of the cultural clash between <UNK> ancient traditions and modern western culture in the form of film an amazing first film by chinese director ann <UNK> if i correctly understood ms comments at the 2000 sundance festival this film was produced as an american film with co funding by the chinese government and shot in china shadow magic reminds me of films like <UNK> <UNK> and cinema <UNK> not necessarily in theme or plot but it has a similar feel
<START> some people say this show was good in it's early years i disagree with all of 'em the show is just plain stupid and pathetic my mum hates it i hate it my dad hates it i don't know about my sister but oh well here some reasons why br br 1 the characters babies being used as grown up style characters are stupid the babies are just <UNK> and annoying the grown ups and adults are dumb and unappealing the worst character is that <UNK> <UNK> she really does it in for your ear drums when you had a long hard and miserable day at the office and also that <UNK> <UNK> who appears later on she is too over optimistic and a pain in the butt she can't decided <UNK> she is french or japanese it doesn't matter know you are a american citizen know and that's that oh what am i talking about all the characters from this show suck br br 2 the stories the stories are unoriginal and dumb the make it like the babies go off on a great adventure yeah to the back yard shed in one episode that little goofy brat tommy <UNK> the leader broke in to a <UNK> control room and literally almost destroyed it don't give kids any idea to smash up normal t v <UNK> control rooms they pay a awful lot of money for them in real life i can imagine what the <UNK> must of felt like airing this episode they will probably start staring at their machines throughout the day scared that a baby will <UNK> in sad br br 3 over rated the show has been dragging on for years now and people are still making up stories and new series and spin offs for this get off the simpsons have been going for nearly the same amount of time as this but they are much better and funnier than babies the show is just plain over rated people where is your common sense br br anyway i surprised t v stations across the world want to air this series even off today the show is utter junk and should have never been produced the two movies for this cartoons sucked just the same 2 10
<START> having reviewed 3 of the 4 perry and <UNK> sitcoms i thought i would get them all done now <UNK> army is my all time favourite sitcom it ain't half hot mum is also a classic as is you <UNK> i don't regard hi de hi as a classic but it is still funny br br it's about a holiday camp similar to <UNK> but instead of red <UNK> it's yellow <UNK> it is ran by <UNK> a well meaning man but has the personality of a <UNK> the staff include fun entertainment manager ted his sidekick spike he ended up being thrown in the swimming pool nearly every episode yellow coat <UNK> <UNK> maid peggy who <UNK> to be a yellow coat and the punch and judy man mr <UNK> who hates kids situations occurred mostly round the swimming pool where someone would be thrown in every episode with there clothes on of course br br not a classic but still funny <UNK> left half way through so this a bit like only fools and horses its welcome jimmy perry was actually a red coat at <UNK> br br best episode <UNK> big chance series 2 episode 2
<START> in the late 1940s there was a short film series entitled <UNK> flashbacks in which <UNK> from silent dramas featuring the likes of mary pickford and <UNK> sweet were played for laughs <UNK> clips from <UNK> old movies were <UNK> projected too fast and given an <UNK> of music and lame <UNK> the attitude expressed through this brutal treatment pretty much summed up mid century hollywood's view of its early days silent cinema was considered hokey <UNK> a little embarrassing and only good for a chuckle during the 1950s this attitude gradually began to change for a number of reasons james <UNK> famous 1949 <UNK> on the silent <UNK> for life magazine was a factor but television played a major role in viewers with silent movies admittedly the tv networks sometimes handled the material as <UNK> as the <UNK> flashbacks people but higher toned series such as <UNK> please treated the films with respect another <UNK> was robert <UNK> feature the golden age of comedy which proved to be something of a surprise hit when it was released to theaters late in 1957 br br i don't know if charles chaplin was aware of film or its success at the box office but it was around this time that he decided to launch a theatrical re release of three of his best short comedies a <UNK> life shoulder arms both made in <UNK> and the <UNK> made in <UNK> and released the following year these three movies happened to work well as a trio since they contrast nicely in plot theme and setting in addition all three feature familiar faces from <UNK> stock company some of whom play multiple roles in each short at the time of the re release the films hadn't been <UNK> screened in over thirty years so perhaps chaplin was concerned about maintaining his reputation with a new generation of movie goers especially since his best work was seldom shown on television in the new early days br br unfortunately chaplin apparently <UNK> that the films moved too quickly at the old silent projection speed so the decision was made to stretch print them which meant that every other frame was <UNK> twice maybe he wanted to avoid the <UNK> look but this wasn't the best way to go about it <UNK> speaking the results were awful and practically destroyed the <UNK> flow of action but nonetheless that's how the chaplin <UNK> was released to theaters in 1959 and that's the version that was transferred to video and made <UNK> available by <UNK> video in the 1980s i purchased a vhs copy of the movie at the time and was terribly disappointed with the jerky stop and start rhythm of the films br br it's a particular pleasure to find that david <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> originally produced for the laser disc format is a vast improvement over the <UNK> video version for the most part the projection speed has been <UNK> the stretch <UNK> is gone at any rate though the action seems to drag a bit at times for example in a <UNK> life during <UNK> charlie's awkward dance in the green <UNK> <UNK> bare arms appear <UNK> <UNK> at another point during the <UNK> scene in shoulder arms when charlie is <UNK> from <UNK> duty the action appears oddly <UNK> down for a few moments but this may be the result of a <UNK> by the film to cover a bit of <UNK> over all picture quality is fantastic considering the age of the movies themselves br br other <UNK> the <UNK> begins with rare behind the scenes footage taken at the chaplin studio this includes shots of an obviously staged <UNK> rehearsal session where chaplin <UNK> actor loyal <UNK> as well as scenes of charlie at his dressing table putting on his makeup and <UNK> the famous mustache these scenes are accompanied by <UNK> narration delivered at a rapid clip chaplin also composed a new musical score for the <UNK> and in my opinion his themes for the <UNK> rank with his best compositions especially the pieces used during the <UNK> sequence in a <UNK> life the only exception is the song written for the <UNK> a pseudo <UNK> cowboy number called bound for texas sung style by matt <UNK> sounding rather like gene <UNK> which is <UNK> <UNK> and out of place otherwise throughout the rest of the <UNK> the music is perfectly suited to the action and the atmosphere br br it feels as though the image release of the chaplin <UNK> is in a sense its long <UNK> debut presenting these classic comedies the way they were meant to be seen all along in this form the <UNK> ranks with <UNK> most <UNK> and enjoyable works
<START> i didn't expect a lot when i went out to see this but my god what a disappointment the original was kind of fun within it's genre but this is so bad i felt abused when i left the theater there's no plot it's not funny it's not enjoyable to watch it's straight out embarrassing after an hour i hoped my patience would be rewarded but now i regret not leaving the theater do yourself a favor and ignore this one see it when it comes to the small screen or see it on budget dvd whatever you do don't waste any money on it don't say i didn't warn you
<START> this was absolutely the most tragic pile of cinema to which i have ever born witness not only was the name a complete <UNK> since the film has next to nothing to do with <UNK> but the acting is as hollow and stale as the attempt to actually make some kind of plot when you watch this film you cannot help but spend every waking second questioning when you've had enough and it's time to turn it off unfortunately i waited until the end in my case that's two hours of my life that i will never be able to <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is clint <UNK> last tribute to the once great west but whilst i thought this was going to be good and raise the bar for future westerns to come i was sadly mistaken <UNK> though simple in plot it falls flat on characters and emotions and i would certainly say that <UNK> is <UNK> worst film to date <UNK> himself seems too old to play the part of acting and directing which also adds a downfall to the overall look of the film br br all the characters seem rushed and <UNK> around the edges especially <UNK> character the acting doesn't seem to flow and contribute to what the characters are feeling the direction is poorly <UNK> by quirky shots so overall <UNK> is not <UNK> best and by far one of the worst westerns around
<START> i'm so glad i taped this film when it came on bbc last month it blew my mind so gut wrenching and real david <UNK> is absolutely fabulous in this even though his character isn't always that easy to like or identify with the final scene where he plays the song just broke my heart those eyes br br i'm guessing that he made this film in between the dr who series and that makes it even more of an achievement for me i just love dr who and yet i saw absolutely nothing of him in mr portrayal of this man who knows that he has changed and struggles to create some sort of new identity and life br br great little intense drama
<START> spirit and chaos is an artistic biopic of <UNK> a japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century the film captures and <UNK> his artistic method <UNK> his inspiration the spirit of nature and its fantastic beauty and his struggles to accept a harsh reality in the face of his <UNK> imagination br br the film integrated <UNK> of <UNK> into the plot beautifully his relationships with his students was powerful especially in one scene where he offers everything he has to a student who has just been caught stealing <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> compassion for the <UNK> in his village his sister and other unfortunate people can serve as a lesson to us all furthermore devotion to science was also nicely portrayed in a time when western ideas were still met with <UNK> especially in <UNK> towns like the one where grew up he understands its <UNK> in helping his fellow villagers and is inspired by its <UNK> the way the film presented moments of artistic passion and disappointment in the writer were truly intense and well interpreted br br i felt that the cgi integrated into the film while groundbreaking an innovative with the more <UNK> animation it could be <UNK> that this was intentional to represent conflict within the main character but i found it rather i also wish that the film had discussed <UNK> influence but it worked fine without it br br i though this film was very well done i give it a 9 10 with the one point being <UNK> for the cgi otherwise the animation plot and dialog were all wonderful and heartfelt i haven't seen any other films by but after seeing this one i will be sure to give them a chance
<START> i saw this movie awhile back and can't seem to track it down does anyone know where i can get a hold of it i feel it is worth seeing again br br i'm sorry to say i had never heard of chloe until this film yes she can act when i first began to track this movie down i <UNK> it for another one of her movies sex <UNK> the plot seems similar to me but the roles are <UNK> br br this is the first film i've seen <UNK> <UNK> i looked up some of her other films and i feel she looks better as a blonde br br i agree this is a good <UNK> movie not too soft not too hard you got to start somewhere
<START> the house of dracula really has nothing new to offer in the way of chills or thrills or new twists on an already tired storyline this film was made as a <UNK> sequel to the fairly better made house of frankenstein from a year earlier in house of dracula you can see the factory like production values of 1945 taking their <UNK> on an otherwise potentially scary movie stock footage from previous films in the series and then the ending from ghost of frankenstein used as the ending here just makes for an el flick <UNK> lies the shame of the studio and the producer considering that they had top notch talent and merely wasted everybody's time and effort on a quick money return scheme but that seems to have been the trend all throughout hollywood at the end of wwii this is what brought on some of those mindless scifi <UNK> of the 1950's with all their closeups of harmless <UNK> in order to make them appear as dinosaurs the days of james whale and val <UNK> to mention two were over as far as creating real mood and atmosphere in this genre keep in mind also that the makeup genius jack pierce who actually did medical research in order to create all of our favorites was <UNK> fired right after this particular film was released a lesser capable makeup man by the name of bud <UNK> was then hired as the head of this department at universal soon to be universal international not to <UNK> mr ability but horror films were just not his <UNK> ok to watch or not to watch watch this film but only as part of the <UNK> order of the frankenstein series and you'll see how this all ended up as comic fodder for <UNK> <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is a truly bizarre adaptation of the novel the space vampires by colin wilson scripted by dan don a joint american british space exploration team makes a mind <UNK> discovery an alien <UNK> <UNK> inside <UNK> containing three <UNK> that look like people one of them a female beauty the oh so <UNK> <UNK> may br br they take these <UNK> back on board their own <UNK> big mistake br br it turns out that these creatures drain the life out of human beings and as american colonel an intense edgy and committed steve <UNK> and british s a s colonel caine a solid peter <UNK> watch in horror an <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> london with the fate of earth in the balance br br this picture certainly is not lacking in imagination it moves a little slowly at times but offers so many strange and <UNK> ideas and eye popping visuals that it's hard not to be amused the first of director tobe <UNK> three picture deal with cannon films he followed it up with texas chainsaw massacre ii and the <UNK> from mars remake he makes it something truly unique <UNK> elements of sci fi vampire films zombie films and end of the world <UNK> it's like nothing that i've seen before br br <UNK> and <UNK> are <UNK> supported by such strong brit actors as frank <UNK> patrick stewart michael <UNK> morris and john <UNK> <UNK> may is very memorable as the <UNK> enigmatic <UNK> it certainly doesn't hurt that she performs a great deal of her scenes in the nude also worth noting is a stirring music score from none other than pink <UNK> composer henry <UNK> br br ridiculous it may be but i found it to be fun as well it's flamboyant and spirited entertainment br br 8 10
<START> despite the famous cast this animated version of dickens tale is the i've seen enough that i <UNK> away in he first commercial break the characters didn't appeal to me at all and the animation is looking cheap br br i'll give this movie a very low rating give me the disney version anytime
<START> pretty visuals and a lot of fights make not a good movie and that is precisely what happened here br br first off let me admit i am yet to play i intend to order it soon however i did do research to myself with the characters and the story however not everyone has the luxury of time to research things like this and <UNK> children demands that knowledge of is required br br in spite of incredible visuals i can't say there is too much thats new we've seen it in final fantasy the spirits within and apart from some better movement i can't say they've done lots of super daring stuff with this br br the fight scenes well they are a bit of fun still how could we ever doubt the result of any of them this one was <UNK> classic there were three fights with the bad guys following the standard <UNK> the hero cloud gets <UNK> then he almost gets there and gets <UNK> and then finally wins the reason i say it was <UNK> classic was that it is used a great deal but in this case is poorly executed i'll touch on that later br br the english dub seemed fine to me though i didn't watch it in japanese so i <UNK> judge the japanese dub but only the english one i'll say this i've heard plenty of better ones even in my limited <UNK> br br and now the plot <UNK> what plot let me be frank this movie is <UNK> but a fan service a chance to see the characters on the big screen with lovely eye candy as i said earlier the fights seem to just happen for no reason the opening fight is never explained seems to have neither ambition to destroy the world himself nor any real motivation to do anything nasty cloud sits around <UNK> for the entire film and pretty much everyone else gets an obligatory cameo br br really was an ensemble piece <UNK> children is anything but if they'd managed to give everyone some significant story role star trek first contact proved it was possible i might add then this could have been a lot better naturally that would have changed the plot too which lets be honest is almost set to be better than the one we got br br characters were also generally either <UNK> or virtually forgotten the members of <UNK> thats the group cloud worked with in for those who don't know get 2 scenes 3 in the case of vincent valentine and some get even less hell the bad guys get more lines than these guys and that is pretty bad br br the music well i don't care if <UNK> is god himself he <UNK> this film big time <UNK> one <UNK> angel was the only decent piece otherwise he couldn't decide whether to be epic and <UNK> or fun with electric guitar when he switched from one to the other you felt it as though he'd taken a <UNK> to your head br br and that last point on whether this movie was epic or fun it tried to be both and failed miserably honestly you can't please everyone and do everything the movie also tried to be deep you can go epic and deep or fun and deep but all three is too much but failed here too the last scene which is reminiscent of a ceremony was thrown in there for what looks like the sake of it you don't need to be a christian to just shake your head and cry there that scene just didn't belong in the film and nor did frequent appearances she's dead jim br br given just how fantastic i've heard final fantasy <UNK> to be this movie is nothing short of a gigantic disappointment because of the beautiful visuals i give it a 2 out of 10
<START> there was a lot about little vera that was strange to me all in all i did enjoy this movie but a lot of the way the characters <UNK> was not what i was used to for example the environment that <UNK> family lived in was very tense almost every time the family was together they were either drinking fighting or yelling and frequently it was a combination of the three after i had viewed the film i felt tense because of all the confrontation that took place during it i was however very interested in watching the story if this middle class russian family throughout the entire film we are reminded of the <UNK> state of russia because of the repeated shots of a train passing by the screen it gave the viewer a sense of a <UNK> lived life the characters seemed to be focused on living their lives through work and drinking after work there was not a feeling of happiness throughout the film the only time a character was not yelling was when vera first fell in love with her fiancé <UNK> this was very short lived because the viewer later discovers after <UNK> locks <UNK> father in a bathroom and vera lets him out after which the father proceeds to stab <UNK> that he is abusive another time vera is told that the only reason she was born was so the family could get a larger apartment it is very interesting watching how both vera and the family were able to cope with each other's behavior the film was definitely worth watching because of its depiction of how life could be in areas of russia
<START> dirty dancing follows the story of frances <UNK> <UNK> jennifer grey and her family as they spend the summer at family summer camp we get to see her discover herself as she falls in love with the dance <UNK> johnny castle patrick <UNK> br br the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title some great music and terrific scenery it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here a happy wonderful feel good ending you know how it's going to end from the beginning but that's really not the point here the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family br br it's one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tv never mind the fact that i already have it <UNK>
<START> this was a pleasant musical about the creation of the <UNK> <UNK> dance hall in many ways this reminds me of the hollywood musicals of the 40s and 50s in that it has many clichés leading up to the inevitable conclusion will the show still go on while of course none of this is new it was enjoyable and well made the musical numbers at the end are frenetic and beautiful to watch in many ways it reminds me of a <UNK> version of the great <UNK> in real life <UNK> was quite the player but this was <UNK> in the american film but in french <UNK> the characters have fully <UNK> <UNK> but nothing is really shown so the movie is okay for kids br br nothing new but well done nevertheless
<START> baby boom was bad enough basically making a series of every straight mans nightmare is worse yeah watched a few always made me feel better after a bad day it reminded me it could be worse guy was rich successful single smart man and dating <UNK> from singers to actresses then his screw up of a cousin <UNK> his biggest mistake on him in reality it would have been straight to foster care i'm sure this was definitely a <UNK> series oh and what's all the <UNK> about the baby change most the time it's probably a doll besides at that age it's nothing more than a prop anyways br br any case i'm glad it didn't last more than a year
<START> i was once a big olsen fan i received this movie when i was six and watched it almost <UNK> until i was nine then it lay on my shelf gathering dust until yesterday i was left speechless br br mary kate and ashley play <UNK> and mel two twelve year olds who are sent to spend spring break in paris with their <UNK> grandfather along the way they meet as one might expect two cute french boys who show them the more fun side to paris i guess the two boys were okay fake french accents aside br br the plot is predictable and the humour is shallow and corny mary kate and ashley play two shallow girls with too much make up on their face br br don't watch this movie if you're not into the olsen twins or family movies
<START> i think that the costumes were excellent and the <UNK> also performed well it has the very authentic feeling for that period of time br br i don't know if it was the computer magic or if it was real some of the big scenes have hundreds of extras in the background i was especially impressed with the scene of that bridge br br the main character the actress also performed well she showed us a nervous witty woman who knows how to use herself to seduce men to get what she wants br br some of the scenes were hilarious even though it was about 2 hours long but it was never boring a very good entertaining movie
<START> ok well no one in their right mind s would pick up a movie titled the man with the screaming brain and expect it to be serious this is an outrageous b movie and that means a truly hokey plot strange characters clichés over the top action and oh so cheesy one liners for that odd segment of the population including myself that gets a kick out of that kind of thing this is a gem br br the acting is better than expected <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> in his character bruce campbell brings a spirited convincing performance his physical comedy skills are truly impressive in this movie and <UNK> back to the evil dead films
<START> the bridge at contains some of the most preposterous war time screenplay i've ever seen aside from the acting which is wooden no tank commander attacks with his tanks <UNK> in nice neat <UNK> up the middle of roads and with troops <UNK> all together with their arms not at the ready the constant <UNK> behavior set off my <UNK> switch so often i found it impossible to enjoy the movie apparently the screen writers and director have never been through actual <UNK> and never bothered to bring in an expert who had this movie is the very <UNK> of the excellent detail in saving private ryan unless you are under 7 years old i recommend watching something else br br <UNK>
<START> when a stranger calls belongs to the group of this year's remakes with movies like <UNK> just over the horizon director simon west con air <UNK> this updated version with plenty of relative unknown casts which <UNK> either the death rate is high it isn't or that established stars are <UNK> clear from a potential turkey br br <UNK> in at a relatively short <UNK> minutes it's primarily made up of two acts the first which takes a full one hour is the setup our heroine jill johnson <UNK> belle <UNK> up <UNK> minutes of talk time on her mobile phone do the <UNK> and as a lesson in responsibility her parents had <UNK> her mobile and grounded her to pay off her debt she works part time as a babysitter and looking after the wealthy kids is her first <UNK> br br the huge mansion gets a full tour treatment as it is where all the action will take place plenty of rooms makes for good hiding an <UNK> pool sized <UNK> pond to get wet in for the wet t shirt treatment and check this out motion <UNK> lights which you just know will contribute to the scares with the manipulation of lights and shadows naturally prank calls red herrings are <UNK> which <UNK> up this runtime but most of them fall flat in the suspense department br br there's a minor trend <UNK> with actors being the unseen providing and acting through their voice instead recent attempts include edward norton in kingdom of heaven and hugo <UNK> v for <UNK> here lance <UNK> does the <UNK> for the anonymous <UNK> psychotic killer but it just falls flat why the script doesn't give him much dialogue most of the phone calls made were of the silent mind <UNK> nature which i felt was a waste they could have also casted some unknown instead and the job will still get done br br the second act where the main action takes place is too little too late and the <UNK> well is purely a <UNK> those expecting blood and gore will be disappointed as basically it's a one woman show to hold your attention in the first hour eye <UNK> always succeed and this act will have her resolve everything in double quick time ala rachel mcadams in red eye don't expect any form of character development nor subplots that will engage br br the ending tried to be too smart for its own good and came across as a cheap way to end the movie there's not much of goodness to highlight from this movie no scares no thrills no enigmatic villain and plenty of security flaws especially with that door alarm the only thing it's good for is to provide a number for <UNK>
<START> my god this was a fantastic film every time we watch it takes us to another place of wow <UNK> scarlett were played brilliantly by <UNK> timothy they did a fantastic job <UNK> the roles of our two favourite <UNK> everyone it is a must see dont <UNK> yourself of this movie if u loved gone with the wind you will love this mini series go <UNK> go
<START> unlike the many who have posted here i'm not movie <UNK> i stumbled across this movie by accident channel surfing and couldn't surf away this is a truly incredible movie worthy of all the praise the critics and those on this site have <UNK> on it the actors are terrific <UNK> is beautiful and innocent her fiancé boris is sweet and patriotic you couldn't help but feel <UNK> father's <UNK> and sorrow as he <UNK> his son for such <UNK> as <UNK> to serve in the great war br br others have <UNK> the movie so well so i'll just mention a couple of scenes that moved me the most when <UNK> brother reveals to his family that he has broken trust with his brother and has to marry <UNK> twisted mouth shows her <UNK> at this betrayal even though her part in the <UNK> might have been through rape you fear that the rest of the movie might right this wrong by visiting just destruction on <UNK> and the brother or worse show <UNK> destroyed by an <UNK> descent into cigarette smoking <UNK> since this isn't french existential cinema the latter doesn't happen thankfully br br another scene that tears at your heart is when the <UNK> musician soldier who was saved by boris returns to tell <UNK> father of the death of his son he <UNK> breaks the news to <UNK> i can't describe the sorrow of this scene still <UNK> finds finds a straw to grab and hope that boris will yet come home the musician actually never saw boris buried after all br br i won't mention more scenes but do want to observe that the touches of soviet political correctness didn't detract at all from the film <UNK> brother is revealed as the piano playing anti soviet <UNK> that someone who steals his brother's wife to be would have to be no doubt he gets at least a <UNK> at the conclusion of the film the ending when <UNK> finally learns for certain that boris is dead still manages to end with <UNK> and full of hope for the future you don't even want to imagine the tears and <UNK> that must have swept through the theater when survivors of that war with their own <UNK> in mind first saw this movie br br incredible go see it
<START> i write this after just seeing the latest episode broadcast in the uk and to me it must be a tough job to keep up the standard the last episode shown called blink has elements of gothic horror all to do with <UNK> that aren't quite what they seem the doctor and martha don't appear much but that doesn't detract from a well crafted episode the general standard has built to a high level and the last three episodes the two <UNK> with the family and the latest have to me been the best that the current team have ever done br br it's not just david <UNK> holding it together the whole supporting cast week in week out are helping as well for those awaiting series 3 abroad the wait is is well worth it
<START> red <UNK> is a career step in the wrong direction for arnold <UNK> having made a couple of sword <UNK> <UNK> films as conan he had moved onto slightly more serious acting roles in films like the terminator and <UNK> only to make a <UNK> return to the sword <UNK> <UNK> genre for this 1985 <UNK> it's hard to figure out why he bothered as this is weaker than both conan films in every <UNK> department allegedly this was to have been the third conan film but for one reason or another the emphasis was <UNK> onto the leading female character the titular red head leaving poor old arnold to play an incredibly dull supporting role spare a thought too for director richard <UNK> who had given the world classics like 20 000 <UNK> under the sea fantastic voyage the boston <UNK> and 10 <UNK> place in this his <UNK> film <UNK> also has taken a gigantic career step backwards br br evil queen bergman wants to rule the world and she needs a priceless and powerful <UNK> to do so she and her <UNK> army storm a keep populated by <UNK> and steal the said <UNK> <UNK> the helpless <UNK> as they go one of the dead <UNK> has a sister named <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a fiery red headed warrior who upon hearing of her sister's death <UNK> revenge upon the evil <UNK> rides across the land in search of <UNK> along the way she picks up travelling companions in the shape of a boy prince ernie <UNK> jr and his bodyguard paul smith she also meets the muscular warrior conan sorry i mean who offers to join her in her quest initially <UNK> doesn't want the help of arnold <UNK> <UNK> instead to prove that she can confront and defeat her enemies alone but eventually she <UNK> to him and accepts his assistance br br red <UNK> is a <UNK> poor film all the more so when one <UNK> that it was made in 1985 when the sword <UNK> <UNK> genre was close to its end it seems so simplistic and amateurish that one could easily mistake it for an early example of its kind the performances are poor on the whole ranging from <UNK> embarrassingly <UNK> villain to unbelievably irritating <UNK> brat to <UNK> wooden and <UNK> hero <UNK> is slightly better as the heroine presumably full of enthusiasm at the thought of being in her first starring role but she is let down very badly by the stupidity of clive and george macdonald <UNK> script the film is <UNK> with goofs including a scene where <UNK> is seen in close up <UNK> down bad guys but in a long shot in the same sequence there isn't a corpse in sight technically it is very inept too with sub standard special effects and <UNK> mechanical monsters there are a few <UNK> such as <UNK> <UNK> enjoyable music <UNK> spent a great deal of the '80s providing good music for awful films e g the island treasure of the four and another <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> of the locations in fact much of the time it's a hell of a lot more <UNK> to look at the lovely scenery than the actors standing in the <UNK> there were very few sword <UNK> <UNK> films after red <UNK> so in some ways it might go down in history as the film which destroyed its own genre
<START> this movie is absolutely horrible i thought because it had good actors in it like <UNK> union hill <UNK> and of course the infamous billy d williams the movie is long and drags on with a documentary style of showing <UNK> union who has died in the movie talking about her family which by the way is a confusing family because you never know who's who and who's related to who i would not recommend this movie to anyone and i wish i could take it back where i got it from i fell asleep from time to time because of the boredom do not waste your time or money on this movie it could had been more true to life with more drama and less boredom
<START> <UNK> is the worst movie i've seen this year and that includes both the affleck j lo bomb <UNK> and the rob zombie <UNK> house of 1000 corpses i don't know if that's a fair comparison seeing that <UNK> was made two years earlier and probably has a budget half that of even the low budget 1000 corpses regardless all three movies suffer from the same shortcomings horrible script horrible acting horrible direction br br spoilers although i honestly don't think there's anything to spoil br br <UNK> is about a group of super spoiled private school kids most of them <UNK> in super sized apartments along new <UNK> hyper expensive park <UNK> thanks to the <UNK> of their <UNK> parents the film showcases the <UNK> life of one of the students cat as she <UNK> her only true friend as <UNK> a person as she was in the pursuit of the good life with the in crowd that of course leads to sex drugs and music that is <UNK> worse than rock roll everything is overly in the way that truly bad movies usually are <UNK> first sexual experience leads to her being <UNK> a tramp and <UNK> by her newly acquired circle of friends her first encounter with drugs leads to her nearly being dumped down a garbage <UNK> after her <UNK> believe her to be dead from an <UNK> no heavy handed messages there he said <UNK> br br that's mainly what the seen it before 100 times plot <UNK> other minor and even less interesting plot details include one friend who steals jewelry and <UNK> from all the others a wild child who lives life on the edge and finally falls off of it one night in the east <UNK> an anti <UNK> british chick who ends her close friendship with cat the moment she finds out cat has a jewish father and <UNK> strained relationship with her single mother who tries <UNK> to get cat to appreciate the <UNK> life she has the thief turns out to be an <UNK> <UNK> the wild child is played as a toned down version of one of the hilton sisters the british girl disappears from the film after the break up the mother daughter relationship is seen as totally <UNK> until the film's final <UNK> scene where she and her <UNK> mother have a <UNK> of sorts yawn br br end spoilers br br about the cast and crew <UNK> <UNK> came on the scene strong with her role as the <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> highly watchable <UNK> and face off her performances were strong enough to land her on quite a few ones to watch lists at the time she was 17 at the time and i hope that they will not be the best roles of her career if she takes a few more roles like the one she takes in <UNK> it very well may be br br i've only seen <UNK> phillips in one other film bully and i swear her performance in that one was nearly identical to the one she gave here i'm not sure if she's incapable of giving varied performances or if it was just a coincidence her roles in the two were so very similar my guess is that the former is true i sense this woman possesses very little talent as far as acting is concerned here she is the actress <UNK> to portray the watered down hilton sister that she gives such a weak performance is amazing considering that she grew up with and remains friends with the real life hilton sisters she's essentially playing a version of herself in this film and doing a damn poor job of it br br as for writer director christina wayne i know nothing of her other than <UNK> was her first and only film project to date with a first effort like this it is no wonder her career in show business was short lived
<START> right then this film is totally unfunny <UNK> has gags from other films has songs from other films blink <UNK> grand <UNK> we <UNK> u an unlikeable leading man a ridiculous plot and lame parodies of films like mission impossible 2 and american beauty redeeming features shannon elizabeth and <UNK> <UNK> enough said
<START> when the movie begins it's obvious just how old and sick the boys are although oliver hardy is enormous it is stanley that looks like death <UNK> over apparently he was <UNK> ill during production and had obviously lost a lot of weight although he would eventually recover and live another decade and a half here he looks like a dying man additionally as i watched the film i was shocked how many <UNK> stan took i half expected his to drop dead from the <UNK> i really can't understand why they came out of retirement considering their health especially when the story and production values are as poor as they are with this film br br stanley <UNK> an island and a boat he and ollie are ready to leave when <UNK> a man is literally dropped into their boat and they begin their voyage to find the island along the way they discover that <UNK> has away but despite this the four men become friends and land on a different island it seems like paradise and they are all very happy a bit later a pretty young lady joins them and everything looks grand br br unfortunately <UNK> is discovered on the island and the place becomes <UNK> with <UNK> eventually the mob decides to hang the four men and take over at which point the island sinks back into the sea and the men are <UNK> br br i will give the film some credit for being original and for being interesting however one thing it is not is funny and that is unforgivable for a laurel and hardy flick while not a bad film it certainly isn't a good one a sad end to their brilliant careers br br all the actors except for the duo are dubbed into english as the movie was made in france while it may not be the very worst film they made this would be the big noise it sure is close watching this film is painful and like watching people clean up after a severe accident
<START> from the brilliant mind that brought us the exorcist and <UNK> rampage is unfortunately more like the latter it's an overall messy movie that has a major made for tv vibe going for it the whole film pretends to <UNK> on the question what if the <UNK> next <UNK> was a serial killer but instead it winds up being an uninspired courtroom drama and <UNK> on the the insanity <UNK> and death penalty that makes little sense the movie is very loosely based on the richard <UNK> chase case a few facts here and there to make a fake character and a different outcome one of the main points of the film seems to be that ending the life of a <UNK> <UNK> child and ending the life of a murderer are somehow sometimes you just have to choose says the lead character yeah sometimes you have to choose to pull the plug on your tv
<START> this is no doubt one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time i was expecting alot more from the actors it started alright then things go from idiotic to absolutely ridiculous definitely not worth renting except if its a free rental
<START> this is a great example of very none hollywood film making which is very thought provoking moving and not without a sense of humor kevin <UNK> and paula <UNK> are superb br br i actually watched it on late night tv and i can see why i missed it in the cinema its not the sort of film that the multi screen mega cinemas show nowadays <UNK> the pity br br i am going to look for the dvd not for those who prefer the current trend towards special effects and no story if you liked the best selling book the curious incident of the dog in the night time you'll enjoy this film br br this film ranks beside the best of scottish films such as small faces and <UNK> all films which kevin <UNK> also star in br br highly recommended
<START> the daytime tv of films seldom have i felt so little <UNK> to characters seldom have i been made to cringe by such dire dialogue <UNK> london thirty somethings <UNK> round lurid bbc sets <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> avoid this film as if it were your <UNK>
<START> the belief in the big other as an invisible power structure which exists in the real is the most <UNK> definition of paranoia  <UNK> zizek br br this is a review of marathon man and the <UNK> and the snowman two films by director john <UNK> br br though hitchcock and lang brought the conspiracy thriller to hollywood the genre only <UNK> in the late 60s and 70s with films like the <UNK> view z marathon man <UNK> one the <UNK> candidate three days of the <UNK> and all the <UNK> men this was the age of vietnam and <UNK> the public deeply suspicious of all political leaders br br the genre remained quiet in the 80s and early 90s until the x files tv series <UNK> to life with <UNK> such as the truth is out there and trust no one the series <UNK> a world of vast <UNK> and government plots the common man at the mercy of all manners of ridiculously elaborate schemes the only way out of the <UNK> fight the future as the <UNK> of the <UNK> final season <UNK> it was apparently our duty to through the <UNK> of information discovering some <UNK> truth that <UNK> our own freedom br br this trend ended with the boom of the internet conspiracy thrillers now giving way to conspiracy documentaries the internet generation <UNK> up such independent documentaries as loose change and <UNK> whilst in the mainstream michael moore <UNK> his audience with stuff like <UNK> 9 11 all these documentaries believed in a secret order a <UNK> of wealthy politicians and <UNK> who <UNK> to <UNK> human rights and <UNK> the world they struggle to create a <UNK> myth <UNK> various <UNK> and hidden <UNK> into a single all <UNK> narrative that explains the purpose and point and future of everything br br this need to <UNK> <UNK> to make them more efficient is reflected in the scientific community who battle to create a grand <UNK> theory and ultimately a theory of everything <UNK> everything from quantum <UNK> to special <UNK> into one giant all <UNK> formula br br so ultimately the conspiracy thriller is <UNK> in man's desire to have control the modern subject is one who displays outright cynicism towards official <UNK> yet at the same time believes in the existence of <UNK> an unseen other pulling the strings this apparently <UNK> <UNK> of cynicism and belief is strictly related to the demise of the big other its disappearance causes us to <UNK> an other of the other conspiracy in order to escape the unbearable freedom its loss causes <UNK> there is no need to take the big other seriously if we believe in an other of the other we're therefore allowed to display cynicism and belief in equal <UNK> br br man thus seeks to <UNK> control over a <UNK> universe to create a kind of <UNK> babysitter be it god a <UNK> formula a conspiracy theory an explanation for violence <UNK> murder war etc who provides meaning and symbolic order the big other provides to the believer it's a lifestyle choice akin to religion in which his place in the world is <UNK> on sheer <UNK> br br the problem with most conspiracy thrillers from the innocent days of hitchcock's all the way up to modern fare like the da <UNK> code are two <UNK> firstly they are not incorrect in suggesting that something is wrong amongst the elite or best people but they are incorrect in and <UNK> that are social collective and an approach which implies that it is just a question of personal morality rather than social <UNK> secondly and most importantly these <UNK> ignore the fact that the big other simply doesn't exist there is no symbolic order pulling the strings br br some modern conspiracy thrillers eyes wide shut etc acknowledge this with their <UNK> of lies <UNK> truths and half truths nothing ever adding up nothing ever making sense the real and the the truth and the desire all <UNK> without any <UNK> ground zero but these are mostly films by intellectual directors br br compared to these modern conspiracy thrillers marathon man and the <UNK> and the snowman are positively <UNK> marathon man is a about a <UNK> student dustin hoffman who gets <UNK> in his big brother's business roy <UNK> which unfortunately has to do with spies guns double agents <UNK> and evil nazi <UNK> <UNK> is suave hoffman is excellent and <UNK> hits us with some neat visuals the reveal of the <UNK> tower is stunning but what's most interesting about the film is the way that its various plot lines don't <UNK> until the 1 hour mark even then it takes a further half hour for things to start making sense unfortunately the film ends with a clichéd showdown between the villain and the good guy everything neatly resolved and explained br br the <UNK> and the snowman is a bit more ambitious sean penn and timothy <UNK> play two friends who sell government secrets to the soviet union <UNK> works at a civil <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> information out of his office and into the hands of penn a small time drug dealer who has no <UNK> selling to the <UNK> penn does this strictly for the money whilst <UNK> is <UNK> with the american government particularly its attempt to <UNK> the leader of australia and so sells the secrets strictly because he hates how his country <UNK> crimes and games of espionage in other words the film is about a conspiracy <UNK> as a response to <UNK> br br marathon man  7 9 10 br br the <UNK> and the snowman  8 10 br br aside from an oddly slapstick car crash and its clichéd ending marathon man is an effective thriller with several neat scenes the <UNK> and the snowman is even better penn turning in a memorable performance

<START> this film is about so many things most obvious is the hold that film can have over an audience and how capturing life on film can be a kind of magic there is also the tense relationship between china and the west as many chinese saw probably rightly so the <UNK> as trying to take over and <UNK> their way of life liu even seeks to <UNK> their way of life on film because he sees that it will one day disappear their is also <UNK> internal conflict between the <UNK> and traditions of china versus the self determination philosophy of the west all these themes are woven quite <UNK> into a coherent and enjoyable whole by <UNK> a very enjoyable film
<START> add this little gem to your list of holiday <UNK> it is br br sweet funny and endearing
<START> a raw edgy thriller that aimed for great philosophical heights it couldn't quite <UNK> i did still enjoy the film immensely it had great elements of suspense leaving me with that delightful spine chill i expect from thrillers and it achieved this purely psychologically without <UNK> to <UNK> blood and gore the soundtrack and setting added to the suspense perfectly at times it was a bit <UNK> particularly the acting and character development it could only have been a better film if we had known more about the nightmares from the past the characters see when they close their eyes and why they felt this desperate need to seek the answer that is so integral to the storyline after all they seemed to continue to seek it despite knowing or at least having an <UNK> of what might happen when they found it i would recommend seeing this film if you are prepared to look beyond the <UNK> to see the potential of a diamond in the rough
<START> this film gives new meaning to the term uneven giving us a few intriguing characterizations <UNK> by an <UNK> realized plot that relies on a few well placed <UNK> to deliver the majority of the thrills br br the plot concerns a group of men who harbor a secret that has caused a curse to be visited on them in the form of a ghostly female that causes death she also may be <UNK> their sons br br it is quite a spectacle to have all the notable veteran actors together in one film but unfortunately they're not very convincing particularly the scene where melvyn douglas goes off the deep end begging the others to listen to him it's no shock then that the actors who play these same characters in their youth are terrible especially the <UNK> ricky they deliver the worst gee aren't we all drunk scene i've ever watched br br the movie has a few saving <UNK> namely dick smith's great ghost <UNK> however misplaced they are in this film and alice <UNK> fascinating performance as <UNK> eva i've never read the novel that this film was taken from but i intend to after reading some of the other reviews on this page you don't have to have read the book however to realize that this is only a shadow of the original tale there is a good story here but it seems lost somewhere amid exposition that shows the men having nightmares over and over again and making <UNK> references to the secret they all share br br as it stands it appears as if there was about half an hour of footage removed from this print particularly near the climax after all how is it that fred astaire manages to <UNK> an <UNK> of the pond so quickly what did gregory <UNK> and the kid have to do with eva and while we're at it what the hell was she anyway why did letting her out of the car cause the <UNK> to disappear if it was an <UNK> how could it have sex with two men and have them not know br br these and other questions will never be answered at least not by this film unless some restored footage is discovered somewhere it will probably forever remain a curiosity with some <UNK> makeup bizarre sex scenes and nudity and a few attractive performances

<START> the real problem with this story is that there's not much story to the story there's hardly any plot to speak of widower buys an electric grandma for his kids one kid <UNK> electric grandma then finally accepts her then the kids grow up and grandma leaves really very little happens it's much more of a premise than a story br br moreover strip it of it's <UNK> and you have a story that had already done before and better the lonely same basic idea person initially can't accept the love of a robot because it's just a machine then eventually <UNK> and comes to love the robot the biggest difference is that the lonely is much more powerful as both the protagonist and we the audience are shocked abruptly back to reality and forced to remember that in the end the robot really is just a <UNK> br br i also find the story highly flawed in that the electric grandmother is just too perfect she's not only human she's super human she's <UNK> than a real person she has no <UNK> of to her at all and she makes <UNK> appear out of thin air it frankly really <UNK> at <UNK> to think that she's a machine

<START> hey guy this movies is everything about choices all the times in your life you must pick something or it just pass away and this movie prove that of course life in fact is not like a beautiful picture as this movie shows it not shows indeed but some may figure that i'm trying to say it's full of pain love and deep lessons of live aaron the mormon <UNK> is the real shepherd digging out the thing beautiful deep inside the skin feeling guy br br it's a great end and you do always believe in fate because it will surprise you in a turn or in other of your live like latter days br br big deal watch it
<START> okay it's a movie for children and it's not one of those movies that adults will enjoy as well however there are some unintentionally funny moments most of them involving holes in the story for example the kid needs a computer part to bring his dad back to normal and he doesn't have the money so does he ask his father for the <UNK> nope he steals it and gets caught kids if i'm ever turned invisible i'll advance your <UNK> ok also while this kid is at the police station no doubt about to be charged with criminally lame acting his beautiful blond teacher comes in <UNK> who she is and where she works then <UNK> the child out of the slam in front of the cops to make matters worse instead of making a quick <UNK> they then sit in the parking lot of the police station and laugh about their achievement you know i hate to pick but the kid did steal something and ought to face the consequences but maybe being in this movie is punishment enough <UNK> avoid it
<START> from the crash of the opening theme the man with the golden arm is classic 1950's entertainment no subtlety here frank comes home from prison with a monkey on his back and goes right back to the old neighborhood where the old <UNK> still <UNK> this is a tale of his dark ride with all of his emotional <UNK> intact the performances are all a bit <UNK> but that's part of the fun of watching darren <UNK> and arnold are unforgettable and almost steal the show this and the <UNK> candidate are the two greatest <UNK> of the board films in my humble opinion don't miss either one of them
<START> with a little dressing up this movie could be served for <UNK> dinner not only is is boring implausible historically inaccurate and poorly directed the best actors were the bit players mainly because they had so few lines to say a waste of time even for war fanatics
<START> ted <UNK> was a great choice to play <UNK> even though his background was mostly comedy he shows here that he can do drama just as well or perhaps even better though there is a lot of humour in this hard to turn a blind eye to his american accent especially since his character is supposed to be english but that's just a minor thing br br all the villains are equally well cast james fox edward fox peter o'toole <UNK> davis john standing etc despite the fact that most of them are either tiny people or giants they are 100 believable in everything they do and their motivations are very clear e g the <UNK> suspicion of <UNK> the giant <UNK> hatred of him for <UNK> his position as court <UNK> dr <UNK> attempt to have <UNK> proved insane so he can marry mary br br mary <UNK> is great as mary <UNK> another <UNK> century english character with an american accent but never mind she is a deeply tormented character because she has been waiting nine years for her husband to return home and when he finally does he is talking about tiny people giants a flying island and talking horses mary despite the strong fantasy element in the story is a very believable character br br the special effects are breathtaking especially when you consider that it was filmed on a television scale at a time when cgi was in its <UNK> it looks very realistic when we see a 6 foot tall man walking through a city filled with people who are 6 <UNK> tall br br the cameos are great as well omar <UNK> richard wilson sir john gielgud <UNK> scott thomas ned beatty all great actors who create a strong supporting cast that <UNK> superb acting ability br br the and the <UNK> are probably the most effective element of the story on the satire side of things a society of talking horses who do not possess any of the <UNK> that humans have while the <UNK> are primitive disgusting humans who mate <UNK> and <UNK> their leader depending on how disgusting he is <UNK> and study of them is also very well done and displays the differences and similarities between humans and <UNK> br br the best version of <UNK> travels by far and one of the best mini series ever
<START> first of all i have to say that i am not generally a big fan of werewolf movies in general it's not that i don't like them just that i don't like them a lot there are some that i have enjoyed werewolf of london <UNK> stuart walker an american werewolf in london 1981 john <UNK> and some that i have thought were okay but nothing special the wolf man 1941 george the howling 1981 joe <UNK> dog soldiers 2002 neil marshall are some examples but overall the werewolf sub genre is not my favorite but i had this one on one of those 50 movie sets so i thought i'd give it a watch and see how it was br br spoilers follow br br the mad monster is a werewolf tale but the werewolf is primarily used as a vehicle for revenge by a mad scientist dr <UNK> cameron george <UNK> dr cameron has discovered a way to <UNK> human beings into <UNK> specifically wolves but was <UNK> and <UNK> by the greater scientific community forced out of a <UNK> position he goes mad and plots revenge on those who <UNK> him in an old country mansion where he lives with his daughter the lovely anne and his assistant glenn strange of limited mental abilities using his serum dr cameron transforms into a werewolf and sends him off to kill his old rivals eventually though the werewolf gets out of control and both the mad doctor and his creation are killed br br the movie also plays out somewhat as a murder crime drama with journalist <UNK> johnny downs investigating the doctor's strange behavior and the <UNK> of murders the story seems to borrow many elements from other big pictures that came before it there are <UNK> of frankenstein 1931 james whale in the creation of a monster which runs amok and the creature killing an innocent child visions of dr <UNK> and mr hyde 1931 <UNK> or the 1941 victor <UNK> version and the wolf man 1941 george also come to mind and that is one of the problems with this movie in my view it comes across as a mediocre <UNK> of some great films it doesn't add much to the genre br br true there are some redeeming qualities george performance was convincing and the scene showing dr <UNK> talking to his visions hallucinations of his <UNK> works well for me in showing his insanity there is some reasonable character build up at least in the case of his character but glenn character is not at all convincing and seems to have this comedic quality whether intentional or not i'm not sure that just doesn't fit into the movie as a whole br br i seemed to like it more than most imdb users based on my rating of 4 10 but it was still a below average film perhaps worth a view if you are a fan of early werewolf movies or a big fan of the 1930's and 1940's horror films but unlikely to appeal to you if you are not
<START> i can't believe they even released such a movie the only good acting came from the water in the movie this has to be one of worst if not the worst movie i have ever seen br br the only scary part of the movie is the bad acting me giving this movie a 1 is me being to kind this movie deserve a 0 br br the storyline and if you can call it the plot of the movie seems to have been written by an high school kid you have to ask yourself if it may have been better with better actors in it br br do yourself a favor wait for it to show on tv br br and even then watching it will be a <UNK> of time
<START> thats right i can't watch comedy central anymore just because i can't bear to watch the repeated commercials for this show i'll tell you the truth this is a terrible show not because i'm offended by it but because carlos <UNK> is one of the worst comedians i have ever seen i rather watch <UNK> top do a george bush impression than watch this no skill hack and to believe he calls himself the greatest even if he didn't steal the jokes he is still bad at telling them he's way off timing and unoriginal i remember in one joke he said why do white people go camping to pretend there poor for a week now what is that suppose to mean that all white people are rich another one i didn't understand was when he did a skit of the price is right and he told some fat guy you should know how much a <UNK> cost you're fat and the fat guy had the saddest look on his face but what does that mean that fat people are always looking for <UNK> those are just the two i seen in his commercials god knows what his show is like br br this show falls in the likes of epic movie and date movie
<START> just when i thought nothing could be as offensive and or irritating as a billy <UNK> <UNK> i had the intellectually shattering experience of renting this piece of garbage peter barnes and john <UNK> should be brought up on criminal charges for <UNK> this script into the public <UNK> the actors need to be charged as <UNK> serving no less than a lifetime away from the public eye br br this production offers the <UNK> for dramatic effect we have taken poetic license with certain facts or some such <UNK> statement to fully <UNK> you for the absolute <UNK> rewrite of a bible story which needed no drama added what they did add was enough to make your i q drop three full points for every five minutes of viewing time br br the poetic license taken <UNK> characters so bizarre you'll recognize nothing but the names of a few and of course the <UNK> br br for some reason <UNK> and lot are both living in so maybe was <UNK> in switzerland on a <UNK> trip <UNK> wife played by carol kane is a <UNK> and when she's turned to a <UNK> of salt lot breaks off her finger and carries it around in what appears to be an empty baby food jar if that's poetic i'm a br br when <UNK> who has now begun drinking wine in <UNK> that could help <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> about the tough job of the building project he <UNK> one morning to find that god has delivered enough <UNK> to <UNK> his burden at least i think it was god it looked like a delivery from <UNK> <UNK> neatly <UNK> and <UNK> maybe <UNK> <UNK> is really an agent for god rather than bore you with the <UNK> being loaded i'll you with the account of the pirate attack on the <UNK> <UNK> you think this movie is filled with such insulting nonsense after an <UNK> time on the waters <UNK> spies a pirate ship heading right for them and who might the <UNK> sea captain be well duh it's lot of course my only surprise was that his uncle wasn't aboard if you're going to slaughter a plot line slaughter all of it the <UNK> attempt is <UNK> and the <UNK> was pathetic not poetic i think it was around this mark that my <UNK> prevented me from <UNK> myself anymore br br an ugly senseless moronic <UNK> of anything remotely resembling a bible account on a scale of 1 10 this movie is <UNK> mind abuse stupid and insulting you'll be more entertained by reading the yellow pages
<START> this film oh my god this film is so poor i'm amazed i managed to watch it all br br first off id like to say that <UNK> jones should only play a london thug period that's it end of story br br is so unconvincing its almost comedy <UNK> in dennis hopper and david carradine did not save this film in fact i think its a total comedy and as a comedy it deserves its 1 star br br avoid at all costs <UNK> oh my god i thought i saw it all when he played that irish <UNK> p br br i think the average viewer will realize that this film is maybe just a never will be type of film i cant see how anybody could actually fall this crap
<START> i also attended the <UNK> international horror film festival and i can easily see why this film won best of show br br sea of dust is a wild romp of horror comedy and beautiful scenery a back in time tale of strange goings on an increasingly wide spread illness with an <UNK> irritating side effect of people's heads exploding brings a young <UNK> apprentice <UNK> to investigate along his travels he decides to briefly <UNK> and once again ask for his long time <UNK> hand in marriage only to once again be sent <UNK> by her extremely stubborn <UNK> along the way out of town he comes across an ill girl in the road and delivers her to dr <UNK> brilliantly played by up and coming vincent price like actor edward x young who fills <UNK> in on the <UNK> a foot only the dr is insulted that he had called for the professor and only received a boy in the less <UNK> turns out to be much more than a common <UNK> horror icon tom <UNK> portrays the ultimate religious torment <UNK> john scream queen ingrid pitt comes out of retirement to give a stellar performance as anna many beautiful and talented supporting actors <UNK> held the story together and helped to effectively move it along to the climax br br dark religion and over the top but fun and sometimes very original gore scenes play heavily in this hammer tribute flick this stylish movie goes back and forth between flashbacks surreal worlds dreams and the character's reality br br horror and gore aside this is also a very funny movie slapstick tongue and cheek humor and dark comedy raise their heads among the dark story line like others have stated this really is like three great movies in one very entertaining and original
<START> what can be said about this truly one of the most mind numbing experiences of my life your brain will attempt to shut down as part of a primal <UNK> of self <UNK> i was left <UNK> from the experience of watching this <UNK> and i took a good two hours to fully recover this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and <UNK> as part of the <UNK> <UNK> of horror films i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way i mean this in a terrible way a terrible way br br this film has no redeeming features everything is appalling <UNK> camera work endlessly presents us with the <UNK> setting imaginable i e lots of corn lots of mud the story is beyond stupid the script there a script the villain is severely <UNK> and wears yellow <UNK> boots the kids are annoying the lead man is charisma free and it has the <UNK> to go on for 100 minutes utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture normally such a statement would be an exaggeration meant for comical effect not in this case i'll even say it again  this is torture br br at the end i was in a state of <UNK> this was brief thankfully but once i <UNK> i decided i had to watch the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i had to understand maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity was it all an elaborate joke i watched the first 2 minutes of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and discovered that the writer director was to put it mildly somewhat misguided i also discovered that because i had taken time out to watch the first two minutes of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of dark <UNK> 2 that i was an idiot not a pleasant voyage of self discovery life sucks br br highly <UNK>
<START> this movie totally sucked don't even rent it you'll hate it the plot didn't make sense the characters sucked and why was that penguin trying to get the <UNK> anyway if that girl penguin would only like him because he has a pretty <UNK> than the relationship would not be based on love only on money i very much disliked this movie hate is such a strong word and <UNK> cant fly even if they believe than they can do it they cant p s i am not who you think i am
<START> based on a ray <UNK> story a professional photographer brian <UNK> returns to his modest home near a tiny desert town where most of the citizens wishes he stayed away a lonely boy jonathan <UNK> onto him for the attention and the two witness the landing of an alien craft in the rocky region of the desert the aliens turn themselves into the images of <UNK> <UNK> must convince <UNK> of the town and falls in love with the young boy's mother elizabeth <UNK> acting is pretty shallow the story line is no worse than some others this movie leaves you feeling that you got <UNK> on a decent ending supporting cast includes howard morris dean norris and mickey jones
<START> this was gene kelly's breakthrough and that alone makes it memorable throw in rita hayworth as his love interest and comedian phil <UNK> of all people as his sidekick and you have the ingredients for a real crowd <UNK> which is exactly how it turned out br br kelly plays danny <UNK> a nightclub owner in brooklyn brooklyn is always the wrong side of the tracks in <UNK> films whose star attraction and love interest is rusty parker rita hayworth rita is lovely and even plays a <UNK> role as rusty and grandmother rusty has a chance at the big time through the <UNK> of john otto <UNK> who <UNK> and lost grandmother br br the plot revolves around danny cutting rusty loose to the <UNK> of his club because she has a chance at success that he can't give her but naturally that's not what rusty ultimately wants because as usual in films of that time the right guy is the only thing on the girl's mind there are no surprises but everybody does their thing well br br kelly does the first of his amazing trick dances this time with himself as a reflection from a glass window he was the master at that sort of dance and one still has to wonder how they timed everything so precisely so that he really does seem to be in two places at once the melodrama gets a bit thick and there are some gratuitous war references thrown in that do little but provide the opportunity for a song or two but kelly takes this film to the next level this was before he became a mega star and too smooth perhaps for his own good an underlying edge of <UNK> to his character lends it a believable and almost <UNK> air br br kelly's character in the 1980 <UNK> also was named danny <UNK> this film was the beginning that film the end of a terrific run for a dancing genius clearly this film meant a lot to him highly recommended
<START> i attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from kevin <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> both have delivered less than memorable performances films while the underlying general storyline is somewhat familiar this film was excellent both <UNK> and <UNK> delivered powerful performances playing extremely well off each other the human <UNK> and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both the scene when <UNK> confronts <UNK> with the personal reasons why <UNK> joined the coast guard rescue elite was the film's most unforgettable emotional moment the specific storyline was an education in itself depicting the personal sacrifice and demanding physical training the elite coast guard <UNK> must go through in <UNK> of their only job responsibility to save lives at sea the special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and <UNK> i haven't seen such angry <UNK> since the perfect storm co star <UNK> brown <UNK> <UNK> great to see him again played the captain of the coast <UNK> <UNK> base in a strong convincing role as a leader with the <UNK> and necessary ice water in his <UNK> the film wonderfully and finally gives long <UNK> exposure and respect to the coast guard it had the audience <UNK> at the end
<START> columbo is guest <UNK> for a <UNK> class the students invite him along for their after class get together the nearby parking garage they discover their regular teacher next to his car dead from a <UNK> wound no columbo was not after the man's job as a class project columbo involves the students in his <UNK> br br two students <UNK> identified by the viewer as <UNK> were in the lecture hall for the entire class furthermore <UNK> camera tapes of the parking garage show that no one other than the professor entered or left after he was last seen unexpectedly <UNK> the lecture hall br br <UNK> the normal routine columbo is the one that is <UNK> by the evil duo eager for progress reports and an ear for their theories <UNK> evidence is almost nonexistent solution of the case <UNK> on some eventual and interesting good luck br br on first viewing it seemed that columbo had <UNK> whole the <UNK> however on repeat viewing small details revealed that not to have been the case at all br br this reviewer has yet to tire of columbo goes to college
<START> remember before there was sidney there was dudley br br dudley <UNK> is barely <UNK> today because his <UNK> as a <UNK> in sound movies was the late 1920s and through the 1930s except for one major performance the <UNK> good natured if <UNK> doctor in the <UNK> <UNK> on the bounty most of his films are barely <UNK> <UNK> the pity because he was a wonderful actor in 1931 he played casper <UNK> the original actor to play that villain opposite <UNK> <UNK> sam spade in the first the <UNK> <UNK> similarly about the same time he played the recording angel in leslie <UNK> version of <UNK> bound the same role that sidney <UNK> <UNK> in between two worlds a decade later br br <UNK> could be likable and lovable that <UNK> doctor again or <UNK> in china <UNK> as the <UNK> first mate <UNK> at poor lewis stone but then proving he's as big a coward in a moment of crisis he held his own against paul <UNK> in the emperor jones he is the chinese freedom fighter working with gary cooper in the general died at dawn <UNK> could do anything br br here he is mr thompson the <UNK> and <UNK> warden of a <UNK> school that frankie <UNK> and his friends are sent to for committing a robbery and <UNK> a greek american store owner it is the latest incident for most of them <UNK> is as bad here as in china <UNK> but it is a close thing to totally dislike him he's able to somehow <UNK> his roles more later about that br br <UNK> has a gang of urban <UNK> including a jewish boy and <UNK> from our gang as pointed out in another review it is a prototype of the <UNK> boys we see them shake down car owners to pay them to watch and protect their <UNK> when one guy won't do it they <UNK> wreck his car the snatch and grab robbery at the store of the greek american is also rather <UNK> shown his skull getting <UNK> when pushed br br the boys are rounded up and brought before stern but decent judge arthur byron who realizes that he can't leave the kids with their parents the parents are unable to watch them or are incompetent unfortunately there are three racial stereotypes in this sequence a jewish father who is more concerned with his business than with his son stereotype father and the an italian father whose <UNK> to <UNK> gets his son out of going to the <UNK> school br br once there the boys find the regime oppressive occasionally one of the guards or the nurse <UNK> evans tries to speak up for them but <UNK> has no time for <UNK> his is a regime determined to break the boys so they behave themselves unfortunately <UNK> and his <UNK> partner are greedy they have been serving inferior food to the boys and <UNK> the profit br br one day a new official comes from the state to look at the <UNK> school it's jimmy cagney who is a hack ward whose gang got the vote out for edward <UNK> as a reward he could not get the park <UNK> post cagney was made an assistant school inspector he is supported by his <UNK> on pal and <UNK> allan <UNK> in his first warner brother film br br the irony is that if <UNK> were a bit more careful cagney would probably have let him continue running things but cagney arrives to see <UNK> brought to <UNK> for fighting the warden and have had problems about respect earlier and <UNK> now <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> but get seriously injured by <UNK> wire <UNK> and his free use of a whip cagney stops <UNK> and lets evans treat <UNK> and she explains the reality of the situation to cagney and her own idea of real <UNK> <UNK> of the boys by building up trust in them with responsibility br br the film follows this to the end showing that cagney and evans are on the right path turning the <UNK> as a republic for the boys to run properly this leads to conflict with <UNK> whose <UNK> is reduced as he is no longer getting supplies but the scheme is <UNK> when cagney himself finds he may be in serious trouble with the law <UNK> sees his opportunity and fully takes it but then he goes too far far more than he ever <UNK> for br br the 1930s had many films showing kids taking steps to right <UNK> and change things <UNK> appeared in such as wild boys of the road cecil b de <UNK> did this day and age where the kids teach a lesson to a gangster played by charles <UNK> that scares the hell out of him so it went in the 1930s the mayor of hell reaches a similar intensity of vengeance and juvenile justice seeking but that's the one problem of the film character is a and <UNK> so we never really cheer for him yet if he wasn't a thief we might go along with his view even if it is counter <UNK> the scenes at the start of <UNK> and his gang <UNK> on people actually make the <UNK> <UNK> would follow seem fairly understandable even if his <UNK> ways are not also he has one moment when he's <UNK> angry at cagney at that point in hiding from his own clash with the law giving orders over a phone from long distance to a <UNK> <UNK> when <UNK> learns what's actually happened he is <UNK> furious at cagney <UNK> him about proper behavior it is the closest thing to making mr thompson sympathetic in this fine movie
<START> the cast of all that returns for good humor in the good <UNK> a place similar to an old fashioned fast food restaurant the comedy is terrific the fun is non stop and though cliché is a <UNK> for kid and family comedy br br a movie for all ages this movie is meant to enjoy laugh and pretty much a lazy movie for a rainy day as that's what i'd save this movie for a rainy day usa aired it today and since i know that the cast of all that is in it i thought that it might be a bit of a chuckle <UNK> but in good fun as <UNK> thompson and <UNK> mitchell probably one of the best young <UNK> of that time were terrific together the pieces came together and everything worked out and it made it into good family fun together with some lazy day work to get off the bad day br br may i take your order
<START> i thought this movie was great if you didn't take it too seriously just sit back and enjoy <UNK> <UNK> in all her greatness and laugh when the monks go to boston ma i also think this movie has a great message about self control and inner strength plus mr was so sweet i wish he'd teach me karate
<START> we can conclude that there are 10 types of people in this world br br those who understand and those who do not those who understand put this movie to its grave along with <UNK> while those who do enjoy this movie for the sake that none of this crap could happen ever br br for a movie to attempt to be a modern movie with fiction applied to it it has failed horribly only a old and below can enjoy and only and up could be scared to have their identity taken it <UNK> out on the main market for a value i watch it now it is more boring than when it was first released
<START> i know that was a goofy movie but i enjoyed it immensely it's one of the experiences that make me smile when someone says bill murray i almost always like movies involving the underdog and this movie has more <UNK> than you can count it's overall a kind movie some of the adults are not wrapped tightly but the laughter is accepting rather than brutal like so many teen movies these days the rich kids across the lake take a beating but no one i know minded at all i never went to camp but i did some things that were somewhat parallel and most of the bits and tricks ran true they were even understated at times but i'm sure that was an accident the cast performed well with bill murray showing hints of what he would become it's not <UNK> day or broken flowers but hey a good goofy laugh should be appreciated these days but then it just doesn't matter
